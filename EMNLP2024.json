    "abstract": "We study the integration of Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) from clinical study into a joint predictive model. Compared to the totally black-box models, a competitive model with explainable structure is much more desirable. To tackle this challenge, this paper introduces a novel Gaussian Matrix Graphical Encoder(GMGE) based on matrix normal graphical model to encode unstructured medical text and simultaneously learn the underlying conditional dependency graph of concepts. We further present DiMES, a Diagnostic Model with Explainable Structure, which integrates the concept graph generated by GMGE with structured data such as patient's physical examination measures. Utilizing Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), DiMES encodes patient features based on the concept graph for downstream tasks, providing clinicians with accurate predictive information to assist in diagnostic decisions and treatment plan design. The effectiveness of the proposed DiMES is validated through its application on four downstream diagnostic predictive tasks(ACL, PCL, MMI and PS)",

    "title": "Rethinking Pragmatics in Large Language Models: Towards Open-Ended Evaluation and Preference Tuning",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "This study addresses the challenges of assessing and enhancing social-pragmatic inference in large language models (LLMs). We first highlight the inadequacy of current accuracy-based multiple choice question answering (MCQA) formats in assessing social-pragmatic reasoning, and propose the direct evaluation of models' free-form responses as measure, which - as our results show - correlates better with human judgement. Further, we explore the enhancement of pragmatic abilities in LLMs, proposing the use of preference optimization (PO) over supervised finetuning (SFT) since there's no ``gold'' answer in responding to a social situation. Our results indicate that preferential tuning significantly outperforms and proves more robust than SFT across pragmatic phenomena, and offers a near-free launch to enhance models' pragmatic ability without compromising generic abilities. Lastly, we delve into LLMs' internal space and demonstrate that the substantial boost of the model's pragmatic reasoning capabilities is linked to deeper layer representation, mirroring human's high-level thinking. Our experiments span multiple pragmatic and social reasoning data sources, covering diverse phenomena, as well as a image referential game requiring multimodal theory of mind (ToM). With our refined paradigms for evaluating and enhancing pragmatic inference, this paper offers key insights for developing more socially aware language models",

    "abstract": "In low-resource settings, the problem is often not only the amount of data available, but also the quality, and in ways that are entirely foreign to high-resourced languages. For instance, many extreme low-resource languages have only recently acquired writing systems. This may result in multiple writing systems competing for dominance or, within a single writing system, non-standardized spelling. Translating to and from low-resource languages is a challenge for machine translation (MT) systems due to a lack of suitable parallel data. In this case study, we focus on the impact of manual data cleaning on the performance of learning machine translation models. We focus on Bambara, the vehicular language of Mali, and introduce the largest curated dataset for multilingual translation. We finetune six commonly used transformer-based language models, i.e., AfriMBART, AfriMT5, AfriM2M100, Mistral, Open-Llama-7B, and Meta-Llama3-8B on three existing Bambara-French language pair datasets and our curated dataset. We show that our new aligned and curated multilingual dataset enhances the translation quality of all studied models using the BLEU, CHRF++, and AfriCOMET evaluation metrics",

    "abstract": "Procedural texts, such as recipes and instruction manuals, are crucial for understanding processes involving multiple entities over time. Entity state tracking, which monitors the states of specific entities at each time step, is a key task in this domain. However, existing benchmarks heavily rely on manually annotated datasets, limiting scalability. We propose a novel task of step image generation in recipes, using step images as visual supervision for tracking entity states in procedural text without relying on manually annotated data. By generating step images, we can visualize the entity states in each step. For this task, we collect high-quality multimodal recipe datasets, theSpruceEats. Addressing the limitation of existing two-stage methods in achieving deep interaction between text and image, this paper introduces an explicit state modeling approach based on multimodal generative models. Experiments on theSpruceEats dataset demonstrate that our method enhance entity state tracking and image generation quality compared to existing methods, improving the CLIP similarity metric by 10.2% compared to existing methods",

Secondly, by introducing refinement layers, we allow interactions between arc representations, facilitating interactions between arcs.

Our experiments demonstrate that, while longer contexts can accommodate more examples, simply increasing the number of demonstrations does not guarantee improved performance. Smart ICL selection remains crucial, even with thousands of demonstrations. To further enhance ICL in this setting, we introduce Refract ICL, a novel ICL selection algorithm specifically designed to focus LLM attention on challenging examples by strategically repeating them within the context and incorporating zero-shot predictions as error signals. Our results show that Refract ICL significantly improves the performance of extremely long-context models such as Gemini 1.5 Pro, particularly on tasks with a smaller number of output classes",

    "abstract": "Recently, Mixture of Experts (MoE) Transformers have garnered increasing attention due to their advantages in model capacity and computational efficiency. However, studies have indicated that MoE Transformers underperform vanilla Transformers in many downstream tasks, significantly diminishing the practical value of MoE models. To explain this issue, we propose that the pre-training performance and transfer capability of a model are joint determinants of its downstream task performance. MoE models, in comparison to vanilla models, have poorer transfer capability, leading to their subpar performance in downstream tasks. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of transfer capability distillation, positing that although vanilla models have weaker performance, they are effective teachers of transfer capability. The MoE models guided by vanilla models can achieve both strong pre-training performance and transfer capability, ultimately enhancing their performance in downstream tasks. We design a specific distillation method and conduct experiments on the BERT architecture. Experimental results show a significant improvement in downstream performance of MoE models, and many further evidences also strongly support the concept of transfer capability distillation.

Therefore, in this study, we propose a method to construct tasks to comprehensively evaluate the robustness against format changes of MCQs by decomposing the answering process into several steps. Using this dataset, we evaluate six LLMs, such as Llama3-70B and Mixtral-8x7B. Consequently, the lack of robustness to differences in the format of MCQs becomes evident.

Drawing inspiration from adversarial training in deep learning and LLM agent learning processes, we introduce the In-Context Adversarial Game (ICAG) for defending against jailbreaks without the need for fine-tuning. ICAG leverages agent learning to conduct an adversarial game, aiming to dynamically extend knowledge to defend against jailbreaks. Unlike traditional methods that rely on static datasets, ICAG employs an iterative process to enhance both the defense and attack agents. This continuous improvement process strengthens defenses against newly generated jailbreak prompts. Our empirical studies affirm ICAG's efficacy, where LLMs safeguarded by ICAG exhibit significantly reduced jailbreak success rates across various attack scenarios. Moreover, ICAG demonstrates remarkable transferability to other LLMs, indicating its potential as a versatile defense mechanism",

Our study reveals three primary findings: (i) Despite these factors significantly influencing overall model performance, some abilities are more responsive to scaling, while others show high resistance. (ii) The sensitivity of different abilities to these factors can be explained by their Complexity and Transference, which indicate the relative importance of each factor in learning specific abilities.

We discover that the difference in scores assigned to response pairs by the reward model effectively indicates the quality of data, and data of varying qualities show significant distinctions in reward model training.

Although current LLMs are achieving increasingly better performance on various benchmarks, their performance in practical applications does not always match their benchmark results. Leakage of benchmarks can prevent the accurate assessment of LLMs' true performance. However, constructing new benchmarks is costly, labor-intensive and still carries the risk of leakage. Therefore, in this paper, we ask the question Can we reuse these leaked benchmarks for LLM evaluation? We propose Inference-Time Decontamination (ITD) to address this issue by detecting and rewriting leaked samples without altering their difficulties. ITD can mitigate performance inflation caused by memorizing leaked benchmarks. Our proof-of-concept experiments demonstrate that ITD reduces inflated accuracy by 22.9\\% on GSM8K and 19.0\\% on MMLU. On MMLU, using Inference-time Decontamination can lead to a decrease in the results of Phi3 and Mistral by 6.7\\% and 3.6\\% respectively.

This paper introduces a novel benchmark, BeyondX, designed to address these limitations by incorporating problems with multiple unknowns. Recognizing the challenges in proposing multi-unknown problems from scratch, we developed BeyondX using an innovative automated pipeline that progressively increases complexity by expanding the number of unknowns in simpler problems. Empirical study on BeyondX reveals that the performance of existing LLMs, even those fine-tuned specifically on math tasks, significantly decreases as the number of unknowns increases - with a performance drop of up to 70% observed in GPT-4. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Formulate-and-Solve strategy, a generalized prompting approach that effectively handles problems with an arbitrary number of unknowns.

However, DPO requires paired preference data which is harder and more expensive to obtain compared to binary preference data. We propose a retrieval-based method named Retrieval-DPO to align LLMs under binary preference data situation. The core idea of our method is that learning how to align can be achieved with non-paired preference data of similar questions rather than strictly paired preference data considering the learning process of human. For instance, to teach the LLM to learn how to treat multiple perspectives, other comprehensive golden answers of similar question may have similar positive effects as the golden answer of the same question. Following this idea, we retrieve an example with opposite label from the retrieval database for a binary preference data in the training set. After the retrieval process, we get a pair of preference data but with possibly different questions and then adopt the DOVE \\cite{bansal2024comparing} optimization objective for the alignment. We compare Retrieval-DPO with other preference optimization algorithms which do not need paired preference data such as Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) and Unified Language Model Alignment (ULMA). We find that our method significantly outperforms KTO and ULMA on helpful-base subset of HH dataset (over 13\\%) and slightly outperforms KTO on harmless-base subset of HH dataset and controlled sentiment generation task.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) fine-tunes a pretrained large language model (LLM) using preference datasets, enabling the LLM to generate outputs that align with human preferences. Given the sensitive nature of these preference datasets held by various clients, there is a need to implement RLHF within a federated learning (FL) framework, where clients are reluctant to share their data due to privacy concerns. To address this, we introduce a feasible framework in which clients collaboratively train a binary selector with their preference datasets using our proposed FedBis. With a well-trained selector, we can further enhance the LLM that generates human-preferred completions. Meanwhile, we propose a novel algorithm, FedBiscuit, that trains multiple selectors by organizing clients into balanced and disjoint clusters based on their preferences. Compared to the FedBis, FedBisuit demonstrates superior performance in simulating human preferences for pairwise completions. Our extensive experiments on federated human preference datasets -- marking the first benchmark to address heterogeneous data partitioning among clients -- demonstrate that FedBisuit outperforms FedBis and even surpasses traditional centralized training",

Solving these puzzles necessitates inferring aspects of a language's grammatical structure from a small number of examples. Such puzzles provide a natural testbed for language models, as they require compositional generalization and few-shot inductive reasoning. Consisting solely of new puzzles written specifically for this work, ModeLing has no risk of appearing in the training data of existing AI systems: this ameliorates the risk of data leakage, a potential confounder for many prior evaluations of reasoning. Evaluating several large open source language models and GPT on our benchmark, we observe non-negligible accuracy, demonstrating few-shot emergent reasoning ability which cannot merely be attributed to shallow memorization. However, imperfect model performance suggests that ModeLing can be used to measure further progress in linguistic reasoning",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently showcased remarkable generalizability in various domains. Despite their extensive knowledge, LLMs still face challenges in efficiently utilizing encoded knowledge to develop accurate and logical reasoning. To mitigate this problem, we introduced the Hint-before-Solving framework (HinSo), which guides the model in generating hints (e.g., specific knowledge or key ideas) for solving the problem before the step-by-step solution. Our studies involving 5 LLMs across 7 datasets of mathematical and commonsense reasoning results indicated that introducing hints before problem-solving can significantly enhance the performance of CoT. To investigate whether LLMs can learn the HinSo pattern and improve their generalization ability, we constructed two large-scale and high-quality training datasets, HST-S and HST-L, containing 7.5k and 75k samples, respectively. The experimental results of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) showed that, under the same settings, the performance of model trained on the HinSo-formatted data improved significantly compared to CoT-formatted data, with a performance increase of 5.1% and 5.6% on the GSM8K, respectively.

Despite the intelligence shown by the general large language models, their specificity in code generation can still be improved due to the syntactic gap and mismatched vocabulary existing among natural language and different programming languages.

To take the extracted structural knowledge into the foundation models, we propose 1) a hard meta-graph prompt template to transform the challenging graphical representation into informative knowledge for tuning-free models and 2) a soft prompting technique that injects the domain knowledge of programming languages into the model parameters via finetuning the models with the help of a pretrained GNN expert model.

Secondly, it includes negative text and images created through fine-grained editing and generation based on existing data, thereby testing the model's ability to correctly reject scenarios where the target object is not visible in the image—an essential aspect often overlooked in existing datasets and approaches. Utilizing this high-quality dataset, we conducted comprehensive evaluations of both state-of-the-art specialist models and MLLMs. Our findings indicate that there remains a significant gap in achieving satisfactory grounding performance.

    "abstract": "Lexical Constrained Generation (LCG) is a fundamental task in text generation. Recent advancement of large pretrained language models (LLMs) has enabled prompt-based controlling for LCG. Despite growing interest in assessing LLMs' capabilities in various aspects, there remains a lack of thorough investigation. To address this gap, we systematically analyze the performance of LLMs on satisfying lexical constraints with prompt-based controlling, as well as their efficacy in downstream applications (such as recipe generation, table-to-text, profile writing, etc). Through extensive experimentation, we identified several key observations that elucidate the limitations of LLMs in LCG, including (1) position bias, where LLMs tend to satisfy constraints that appear in specific positions within the input; (2) insensitive decoding parameters, which minimally impact the performance of LLMs; and (3) the inherent complexity of certain constraints (i.e. compound word). We conclude that there is a complexity bottleneck: LLMs still face significant challenges in consistently satisfying lexical constraints. Additionally, we introduce the Divide and Conquer Generation strategy, effective for both white-box and black-box LLMs, significantly enhancing their performance in LCG tasks. This strategy boosts LLMs' success rate by 93% in the most challenging LCG task, which is 40% more than the baseline. Our analysis aims to provide valuable insights into the performance of LLMs in LCG, and our proposed strategy offers a pathway to more sophisticated and customized text generation applications",

In India, where \"transgender\" was legally recognised as a category only in 2014, and same–sex marriages are yet to be legalised, it becomes crucial to analyse whether and how news media reported the lived realities of vulnerable LGBTQ+ communities during the pandemic. This study analysed articles from online editions of two English–language newspaper websites, which differed vastly in their circulation figures—The Times of India and The Indian Express. The results of our study suggest that these newspaper websites covered articles surrounding various aspects of the lives of LGBTQ+ individuals with a greater focus on transgender communities. However, they lacked quality and depth. Focusing on the period spanning March 2020 to August 2021, we analysed articles from The Times of India and The Indian Express using distil–RoBERTa–base and ChatGPT–3.5 for sentiment analysis and BERTopic for topic modelling. We also compared our results to the period before the pandemic (January 2019–December 2019) to understand the shift in topics and sentiments across the two newspaper websites. Our topic modelling results indicate that The Times of India and The Indian Express primarily wrote soft news on LGBTQ+ communities. Similarly, our sentiment analysis results indicate a difference in prevailing sentiment as depicted by the two models. Furthermore, our manual analysis of the articles indicates that the language used in certain articles by The Times of India was transphobic and obsolete. Our study captures the visibility and representation of the LGBTQ+ communities in online Indian news media outlets, the language they use, and the narratives they follow",

Quantization techniques have emerged as a promising avenue for addressing these challenges while preserving accuracy and making energy efficient. We propose CPTQuant, a comprehensive strategy that introduces correlation-based (CMPQ), pruning-based (PMPQ), and Taylor decomposition-based (TDMPQ) mixed precision techniques. CMPQ adapts the precision level based on canonical correlation analysis of different layers. PMPQ optimizes precision layer-wise based on their sensitivity to sparsity. TDMPQ modifies precision using Taylor decomposition to assess each layer's sensitivity to input perturbation. These strategies allocate higher precision to more sensitive layers while diminishing precision to robust layers. CPTQuant assesses the performance across BERT, OPT-125M, OPT-350M, OPT-1.3B, and OPT-2.7B. We demonstrate up to 4x compression and a 2x-fold increase in efficiency with minimal accuracy drop compared to Hugging Face FP16. PMPQ stands out for achieving a considerably higher model compression. Sensitivity analyses across various LLMs show that the initial and final 30% of layers exhibit higher sensitivities than the remaining layers.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Collecting high-quality preference datasets for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is resource-intensive and challenging. As a result, researchers often train reward models on extensive offline datasets which aggregate diverse generation sources and scoring/alignment policies. We hypothesize that this aggregation has an averaging effect on reward model scores, which limits signal and impairs the alignment process. Inspired by the field of inverse RL, we define the ``inverse alignment problem'' in language model training, where our objective is to optimize the critic's reward for a fixed actor and a fixed offline preference dataset. We hypothesize that solving the inverse alignment problem will improve reward model quality by providing clearer feedback on the policy's current behavior. To that end, we investigate whether repeatedly fine-tuning a reward model on subsets of the offline preference dataset aligned with a periodically frozen policy during RLHF improves upon vanilla RLHF. Our empirical results demonstrate that this approach facilitates superior alignment and faster convergence compared to using an unaligned or out-of-distribution reward model relative to the LLM policy",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "The evaluation paradigm of LLM-as-judge gains popularity due to its significant reduction in human labor and time costs. This approach utilizes one or more large language models (LLMs) to assess the quality of outputs from other LLMs. However, existing methods rely on generic scoring rubrics that fail to consider the specificities of each question and its problem-solving process, compromising precision and stability in assessments. Inspired by human examination scoring processes, we propose a new evaluation paradigm based on self-adaptive rubrics. Specifically, we create detailed scoring rubrics for each question, capturing the primary and secondary criteria in a structured format of scoring and deduction points that mimic a human evaluator's analytical process. Building on this paradigm, we further develop a novel benchmark called INSDA, which covers a range of domains including long-tail knowledge, mathematics, coding, and logical reasoning. INSDA consists of 1,000 meticulously crafted questions, each with its own self-adaptive rubric. To further streamline the evaluation, we train a specialized evaluator language model (evaluator LM) to supplant human graders. Using the same training data, our evaluator LM achieves a higher concordance rate with human grading results than other paradigms, including GPT-4, highlighting the superiority and efficiency of our approach",

    "abstract": "Causal graph recovery is traditionally done using statistical estimation-based methods or based on individual's knowledge about variables of interests. They often suffer from data collection biases and limitations of individuals' knowledge. The advance of large language models (LLMs) provides opportunities to address these problems. We propose a novel method that leverages LLMs to deduce causal relationships in general causal graph recovery tasks. This method leverages knowledge compressed in LLMs and knowledge LLMs extracted from scientific publication database as well as experiment data about factors of interest to achieve this goal. Our method gives a prompting strategy to extract associational relationships among those factors and a mechanism to perform causality verification for these associations. Comparing to other LLM-based methods that directly instruct LLMs to do the highly complex causal reasoning, our method shows clear advantage on causal graph quality on benchmark datasets. More importantly, as causality among some factors may change as new research results emerge, our method show sensitivity to new evidence in the literature and can provide useful information for updating causal graphs accordingly",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "With the rapid development of large language models (LLM), the evaluation of LLM becomes increasingly important. Measuring text gener- ation tasks such as summarization and article creation is very difficult. Especially in spe- cific application domains (e.g., to-business or to-customer service), in-house evaluation cri- teria have to meet not only general standards (correctness, helpfulness and creativity, etc.) but also specific needs of customers and busi- ness security requirements at the same time, making the evaluation more difficult. So far, the evaluation of LLM in business scenarios has mainly relied on manual, which is expensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a model-based evaluation method: TALEC, which allows users to flexibly set their own evaluation criteria, and uses in-context learning (ICL) to teach judge model these in-house cri- teria. In addition, we try combining zero-shot and few-shot to make the judge model focus on more information. We also propose a prompt paradigm and an engineering approach to ad- just and iterate the shots ,helping judge model to better understand the complex criteria. We then compare fine-tuning with ICL, finding that fine-tuning can be replaced by ICL. TALEC demonstrates a strong capability to accurately reflect human preferences and achieves a cor- relation of over 80% with human judgments, outperforming even the inter-human correlation in some tasks",

    "abstract": "Active learning (AL) techniques optimally utilize a labeling budget by iteratively selecting instances that are most valuable for learning. However, they lack \"prerequisite checks\", i.e., there are no prescribed criteria to pick an AL algorithm best suited for a dataset. A practitioner must pick a technique they \\emph{trust} would beat random sampling, based on prior reported results, and hope that it is resilient to the many variables in their environment: dataset, labeling budget and prediction pipelines. The important questions then are: how often on average, do we expect any AL technique to reliably beat the computationally cheap and easy-to-implement strategy of random sampling? Does it at least make sense to use AL in an ``Always ON'' mode in a prediction pipeline, so that while it might not always help, it never under-performs random sampling? How much of a role does the prediction pipeline play in AL's success? We examine these questions in detail for the task of text classification using pre-trained representations, which are ubiquitous today. Our primary contribution here is a rigorous evaluation of AL techniques, old and new, across setups that vary wrt datasets, text representations and classifiers. This unlocks multiple insights around warm-up times, i.e., number of labels before gains from AL are seen, viability of an ``Always ON'' mode and the relative significance of different factors. Additionally, we release a framework for rigorous benchmarking of AL techniques for text classification",

Grounded in the analysis of real-world data from a linguistic perspective, we decompose public-speaking style into key sub-styles to pose challenges and quantify the style modeling capability of LLMs. For such intricate text style transfer, we further propose a fine-grained evaluation framework to analyze the characteristics and identify the problems of stylized texts. Comprehensive experiments suggest that current LLMs struggle to generate public speaking texts that align with human preferences, primarily due to excessive stylization and loss of semantic information.

    "abstract": "While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities across various fields, hallucination remains a significant challenge. Recent studies have explored hallucinations through the lens of internal representations, proposing mechanisms to decipher LLMs' adherence to facts. However, these approaches often fail to generalize to out-of-distribution data, leading to concerns about whether internal representation patterns reflect fundamental factual awareness, or only overfit spurious correlations on the specific datasets. In this work, we investigate whether a universal truthfulness hyperplane that distinguishes the model's factually correct and incorrect outputs exists within the model. To this end, we scale up the number of training datasets and conduct an extensive evaluation -- we train the truthfulness hyperplane on a diverse collection of over 40 datasets and examine its cross-task, cross-domain, and in-domain generalization. Our results indicate that increasing the diversity of the training datasets significantly enhances the performance in all scenarios, while the volume of data samples plays a less critical role. This finding supports the optimistic hypothesis that a universal truthfulness hyperplane may indeed exist within the model, offering promising directions for future research",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) frequently generate inaccurate responses -- this can be particularly dangerous in sensitive areas like medicine and healthcare. Current methods for detecting hallucinations involve sampling answers multiple times, making them computationally intensive. In this study, we introduce HalluCheck, a novel hallucination detection module that identifies factual elements or atomic facts within a text. HalluCheck operates on the premise that responses to questions probing factual answers should be consistent both within a single LLM and across different LLMs. To improve system robustness, we incorporate a token-probability-based double-check mechanism. For hallucinated facts, inconsistencies or a lack of model confidence during generation will be evident. We evaluate our detection module on fact-based datasets such as NQ\\_Open, HotpotQA, and WebQ, by building upon open-source LLMs such as LLaMa-2 (7B)-Instruct and Mistral-7B-Instruct. Finally, we compare the generated output with the correct answers to determine sentence-level AUC-ROC scores for hallucination detection. Our results demonstrate that HalluCheck can (i) detect hallucinated facts and (ii) achieve significantly higher AUC-ROC scores compared to existing baselines that operate under similar conditions, specifically those that do not utilize external databases for hallucination detection",

The prevailing search algorithms tend to focus solely on performance enhancement, ignoring the cost-effectiveness trade-off. To address these challenges, we first utilize the 3E Criteria to systematically evaluate the cost-benefit balance of current search strategies. We found current methods typically sacrifice vast efficiency for marginal improvement of effectiveness. In order to empower LLMs effective decision-making capability with balanced efficiency, we present a plug-and-play framework with Speculative Reward Model (SRM), which leverages external reward assigner to speculate the preferential actions, not just rely on self-evaluation inside LLMs. Through speculative verification approach for pruning and efficient navigation toward more promising steps, SRM boosts decision-making ability of LLM cost-effectively. We evaluate SRM on several complex decision-making tasks including mathematical reasoning, planning and numerical reasoning for specific fields. Our results demonstrate the superiority of SRM for inference efficiency, which significantly lowers cost to a fraction of the original search framework's by 1/10 on average, without sacrificing effectiveness",

Over the past two years, Indonesia has seen a ten-fold increase in the online hate speech ratio, underscoring the urgent need for effective detection mechanisms. However, progress is hindered by the limited availability of labeled data for Indonesian texts. The condition is even worse for marginalized minorities, such as Shia, LGBTQ, and other ethnic minorities because hate speech is underreported and less understood by detection tools. Furthermore, the lack of accommodation for subjectivity in current datasets compounds this issue. To address this, we introduce IndoToxic2024, a comprehensive Indonesian hate speech and toxicity classification dataset. Comprising 43,692 entries annotated by 19 diverse individuals, the dataset focuses on texts targeting vulnerable groups in Indonesia, specifically during the hottest political event in the country: the presidential election. We establish baselines for seven binary classification tasks, achieving a macro-F1 score of 0.78 with a BERT model (IndoBERTweet) fine-tuned for hate speech classification.

We introduce a new metrics RIG (raw information gain) in order to do so. Any LLM (large language model) could be considered a \"black box\" of compressed information. It is hard to measure what amount of information is stored inside the model regarding any domain. The contrast between the size of a trained model of around 43GB compared to 15 trillion tokens of training data is staggering The other issue is to figure out where do the limits come from: is it an architectural constraint or is the limitation coming from the data used in training. So far the most common way to identify if the model is properly trained and contains necessary information is to put it through a list of benchmarks and the decision is based on either it's ranking or some educated guess of a score threshold. Keeping in mind that the most of those benchmarks become part of training data for upcoming models we face a vicious cycle of never ending benchmark creation. Taken into account constant size growth of both language models and datasets we face an challenge of losing a track of what is efficient and what is not to train models as well as simple scale of the datasets makes them almost impossible to supervise at all, what is an immense obstacle when we need to update any language model according to different environments those are implemented at and we need to bring ethical issues, actuality of the human knowledge and controversial statements altogether",

In the legal field, LLMs often provide generalized responses, lacking the necessary specificity for expert legal advice.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a popular approach to addressing these issues. However, existing methods often focus solely on semantic-level similarity, neglecting the logical structure relationships between different legal questions.

Secondly, the DSSM model that integrates logical structure and semantic information is used to retrieve the most relevant candidate questions from the database. Finally, in-context learning is used to generate the final answer. Experiments on a real-world legal QA dataset, using both automated evaluation metrics and human evaluation, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

From the pool of 22k questions, we utilize 4k to create the benchmark that offers balanced coverage of subjects and incorporates a diverse range of case analysis techniques. Furthermore, we evaluate a range of existing large language models(LLMs), spanning from open-sourced to proprietary models. Our experiments and analysis demonstrate that CPsyExam serves as an effective benchmark for enhancing the understanding of psychology within LLMs and enables the comparison of LLMs across various granularities",

    "abstract": "Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) for agent tasks is critical in developing language agents. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a promising technique for this adaptation with the alleviation of compounding errors, offering a means to directly optimize Reinforcement Learning (RL) objectives. However, applying DPO to multi-turn tasks presents challenges due to the inability to cancel the partition function. Overcoming this obstacle involves making the partition function independent of the current state and addressing length disparities between preferred and dis-preferred trajectories. In this light, we replace the policy constraint with the state-action occupancy measure constraint in the RL objective and add length normalization to the Bradley-Terry model, yielding a novel loss function named DMPO for multi-turn agent tasks with theoretical explanations. Extensive experiments on three multi-turn agent task datasets confirm the effectiveness and superiority of the DMPO loss",

To address this gap, we introduce CONSTRUCTURE, a novel concept-level benchmark to assess MLLMs' hierarchical concept understanding and reasoning abilities.

Our findings indicate that even state-of-the-art multimodal models struggle with concept structure reasoning (e.g., GPT-4o averages a score of 62.1\\%).

To address these limitations, we investigate whether LLMs can generate meta-feedback that pinpoints errors in the feedback rather than the response.While the ability of LLMs to generate self-feedback has been well-researched, their potential to provide constructive meta-feedback remains under-explored. We design a novel self-correction prompting framework, Feedback-on-Feedback (FoF), which leverages meta-feedback to improve the feedback before refining the response. Our framework first samples multiple feedbacks for the initial response, and prompts the LLM to generate a meta-feedback that analyze the inconsistency between these feedbacks. Based on the meta-feedback, the LLM generates a refined feedback that subsequently guides the revision of the response.

    "abstract": "Long-context modeling capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered widespread attention, leading to the emergence of LLMs with ultra-context windows. Meanwhile, benchmarks for evaluating long-context language models are gradually catching up. However, existing benchmarks employ irrelevant noise texts to artificially extend the length of test cases, diverging from the real-world scenarios of long-context applications. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel long-context benchmark, Loong, aligning with realistic scenarios through extended multi-document question answering (QA). Unlike typical document QA, in Loong's test cases, each document is relevant to the final answer, ignoring any document will lead to the failure of the answer. Furthermore, Loong introduces four types of tasks with a range of context lengths: Spotlight Locating, Comparison, Clustering, and Chain of Reasoning, to facilitate a more realistic and comprehensive evaluation of long-context understanding. Extensive experiments indicate that existing long-context language models still exhibit considerable potential for enhancement. Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) achieves poor performance, demonstrating that Loong can reliably assess the model's long-context modeling capabilities",

    "abstract": "LLMs as general-purpose agents have gained widespread application in practical domains due to robust autonomous decision-making capabilities and extensive world knowledge. However, recent studies have highlighted that the dynamicity inherent in real-world environments poses significant challenges to the decision-making abilities of LLM agents, making the investigation of LLM decision-making boundaries in dynamic environments an urgent and formidable task. Current evaluation benchmarks primarily focus on assessing LLM decision-making performance in static and interactive environments, which significantly differ from the dynamicity present in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, existing evaluation frameworks lack fine-grained assessments of LLMs' capabilities, providing limited insights during the evaluation process and hindering a comprehensive understanding of the models' capabilities. To address these limitations, we propose FD-Bench, a framework for evaluating the decision-making abilities of LLM agents in dynamic scenarios. FD-Bench employs a fire evacuation scenario as a representative dynamic setting, offering a generalized evaluation framework and a step-wise evaluation strategy to comprehensively analyze and capture variations in decision-making abilities. This framework provides a comprehensive understanding of the decision-making capabilities and limitations of LLM agents in dynamic environments, laying the foundation for their potential deployment in more realistic physical scenarios",

Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5 have shown greater capability in translating figurative language compared to state-of-the-art neural machine translation (NMT) systems. However, the impact of different prompting methods and combining NMTs and LLMs on idiom translation remains unexplored. This paper introduces two parallel datasets for Persian\\rightarrow English and English\\rightarrow Persian translation to address these challenges. The Persian idiom examples are sampled from our PersianIdioms resource, which is compiled from an online dictionary and contains 2200 idioms with their meanings and popularity scores. Using these datasets, we evaluate GPT models, Google Translate, and their combination, focusing on idiom translation accuracy, fluency, and contextual relevance. Additionally, we assess existing automatic evaluation metrics and GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 for evaluating idiomatic translations. Our results indicate that while Google Translate shows superior fluency, GPT-3.5 excels in accurately translating idioms. We also show that models are better at translating English idioms than Persian ones, and different configurations of models perform differently depending on the direction of translation.

Nevertheless, LLMs typically require orders of magnitude more data than children, and language outcomes cannot be directly compared. Here, we introduce \\textit{machine-CDI}, a metric based on the learner's output to enable a direct comparison of machines and infants on their expressive vocabulary as a function of input quantity. This metric adapts the Communicative Development Inventories \\citep{fenson2007macarthur,frank2017wordbank}, a normalized inventory of words to quantify child language development, to the evaluation set of language models. We illustrate machine-CDI by comparing the expressive vocabulary in infants and character language models (LSTMs and Transformers) trained on English audiobooks. The results show that language models approximately match the children's learning curves, although Transformers are delayed compared to LSTMs. A further analysis show that the models are more impacted by word frequency than children, with a large delay in acquiring low frequency words for models. This delay is found to be linked to the more general phenomenon of long tail truncation observed in language models, which makes them unable to learn words based on few shot observations. These results shed new light on the principles of language acquisition, and highlights important divergences in how humans and modern algorithms learn to process natural language",

    "abstract": "In-context learning has become a standard learning paradigm for language models. However, current prompt engineering methods, which function within the token space, may restrict their effectiveness. We propose to explore the potential of activation space through Iterative Context Vectors (ICVs), a technique aimed at improving task performance without backpropagation. ICVs are employed by first extracting and iteratively refining activations within a language model, then applying them during inference with minimal computational and memory overhead. We evaluate ICVs across a range of tasks using various models and observe significant improvements. Our findings suggest that activation steering can serve as a promising direction for in-context learning, thereby opening new avenues for future research",

    "abstract": "With the rise in social media (SM) platforms that offer easy access, community formation, and online debate, the issue of hate speech has risen rapidly. The hate detection, and countering it becomes a growing challenge to society, researchers, companies, and policymakers. Hate speech is in the form of text or multimodal such as memes, GIFs, audio, or video. The scientific study of hate speech from a computer science view has gained attention in recent years. Mostly it is considered a supervised task where the annotated corpora and shared resources play a big role. To combat it, SM, employing modern AI tools is getting attention. This survey comprehensively examines the work done to combat hate in the English language so far. This structures the state-of-the-art methodologies employed for unimodal identification, studies conducted in multimodal hate identification, the role of Explainable AI, prevention of hate speech through style transfer, and counter-narrative generation for the English language. The efficacy and limitations are also discussed. Compared with the earlier surveys this paper concisely gives a well-organized presentation of the methods to combat hate",

    "abstract": "Preference optimization is a crucial aspect of generative models, ensuring that the generated content aligns with users' preferences. While previous research has focused on optimizing for average preferences, text-to-image tasks require a personalized approach due to the diversity of individual preferences. In this study, we propose a two-stage framework for personalized preference optimization in text-to-image generation. The first stage, personalized image aesthetic assessment (PIAA), learns user preferences from a small amount of user image rating data. The second stage, prompt optimization, optimizes the text-to-image model's prompt to generate images that receive high scores from the learned preference model. We employ Large Language Models (LLMs) for the prompt optimization process. Through extensive experimentation with various configurations in the PIAA and prompt optimization stages, we demonstrate that our approach can generate novel images that align with individual user preferences, even with limited user data. Our research lays the foundation for future work on personalized content generation",

    "abstract": "With the rapid growth of Large Language models, more and more jobs are being automated by using LLMs. Therefore, it is very important to assess the fairness of LLMs. Studies reveal the reflection of societal norms and biases in LLMs, which creates a risk of propagating societal stereotypes in downstream tasks. Numerous works have been done in various NLP applications regarding bias exhibition via LLMs and more so on gender bias. However there is a gap on the study of bias in emotional attributes, although human emotion and gender are closely related in societal discourse for almost all societies. The gap is even larger for a low resource language like Bangla. Historically women were more associated with emotional responses like empathy, fear or guilt, whereas men were more associated with anger, bravado, authority etc. This resonates with the societal system in areas where Bangla is prevalent. We offer the first thorough investigation of gendered emotion attribution in Bangla for both closed and open source LLMs in this work. Our aim is to elucidate the intricate societal relationship between gender and emotion specifically within the context of Bangla. All of our resources including code and data will be publicly available to support future research on Bangla NLP",

For example, models trained on the reasoning-focused dataset GQA struggle to effectively handle samples from the knowledge-emphasizing dataset OKVQA. Meanwhile, in real-world scenarios, it is user-unfriendly to restrict the domain of questions. Therefore, this paper proposes a necessary task: One-to-Many Visual Question Answering, of which the ultimate goal is to enable a single model to answer as many different domains of questions as possible by the effective integration of available VQA resources. To this end, we first investigate into ten common VQA datasets, and break the task of VQA down into the integration of three key abilities. Then, considering assorted questions rely on different VQA abilities, this paper proposes a novel dynamic Mixture of LoRAs (MoL) strategy. MoL mixes three individually trained LoRA adapters (corresponding to each VQA ability) dynamically for different samples demanding various VQA abilities. The proposed MoL strategy is verified to be highly effective by experiments, establishing SOTAs on four datasets. In addition, MoL generalizes well to three extra zero-shot datasets.

Weight sharing is one promising solution that encourages weight reuse, effectively reducing memory usage with less performance drop. However, current weight sharing techniques primarily focus on small-scale models like BERT and employ coarse-grained sharing rules, e.g., layer-wise. This becomes limiting given the prevalence of LLMs and sharing an entire layer or block obviously diminishes the flexibility of weight sharing. In this paper, we present a perspective on head-wise shareable attention for large language models. We further propose two memory-efficient methods that share parameters across attention heads, with a specific focus on LLMs. % to reduce the memory usage for large PLMs. Both of them use the same dynamic strategy to select the shared weight matrices. The first method directly reuses the pre-trained weights without retraining, denoted as $\\textbf{DirectShare}$.

    "abstract": "Due to the prohibitively expensive full fine-tuning costs of large language models (LLMs), various popular parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods have been developed. These methods majorly rely on fine-tuning few add-on modules, popularly referred to as {\\it adapters}, that corresponds to only \\textit{small fraction of LLM parameters}. In specific, low rank adaptation (LoRA), has demonstrated impressive parameter efficiency while yielding performance close to the full fine-tuning. However, classical LoRA may still fine-tune more parameters as compared to the inherent rank of the pre-trained weights \\cite{aghajanyan2020intrinsic}, leaving room for further parameter reduction. To mitigate this, only recently, few researches had proposed various freezing strategy of LoRA projection matrices, however, at the cost of additional FLOPs. To improve fine-tuning efficiency, in this work, we present ShareLoRA, that leverages a novel approach to use the redundancy in pre-trained model weights and share LoRA modules to significantly reduce the trainable parameter counts. In specific, \\autolora{} automatically finds the redundancy of the pre-trained weights and determines which LoRA adapters can share parameters. For this, \\autolora{} uses the similarity between representations to assess the information redundancy and a greedy algorithm to maximize the sharing of LoRA modules. We performed extensive evaluations with LLaMA family LLMs across various tasks.

Existing linear attention based models usually exploit decay factor based positional encoding (PE), where attention scores decay exponentially with increasing relative distance.

Our analysis reveals that direct training decay factor is unstable. To address this problem, we propose a novel PE for linear attention named Disentangle to Decay (D2D). D2D disentangles decay factor into two parts to achieve further optimization and stable training. Moreover, D2D can be transformed into recurrent form for efficient inference. Experiments demonstrate that D2D achieves stable training of decay factor, and enhances performance of linear attention in both normal context length and length extrapolation scenarios",

SafeAligner leverages the disparity in security levels between the responses from these models to differentiate between harmful and beneficial tokens, effectively guiding the safety alignment by altering the output token distribution of the target model.

    "abstract": "While chain-of-thoughts (CoT) prompting has revolutionized how LLMs perform reasoning tasks, its current methods and variations (e.g, Self-consistency, ReACT, Reflexion, Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT), Cumulative Reasoning (CR) etc.,) suffer from limitations like limited context grounding, hallucination/inconsistent output generation, and iterative sluggishness. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel mono/dual-step prompting framework built upon two unique strategies \\textbf{Chain of Evidences (CoE)} and \\textbf{Evidence to Generate (E2G)}. Instead of unverified reasoning claims, our innovative approaches leverage the power of \"evidence for decision making\" by first focusing exclusively on the thought sequences explicitly mentioned in the context which then serve as extracted evidence, guiding the LLM's output generation process with greater precision and efficiency. This simple yet potent approach unlocks the full potential of chain-of-thoughts prompting, facilitating faster, more reliable, and contextually aware reasoning in LLMs. Our framework consistently achieves remarkable results across various knowledge-intensive reasoning and generation tasks, surpassing baseline approaches with state-of-the-art LLMs. For instance, (i) on the LogiQA benchmark using GPT-4, CoE achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 53.8\\%, surpassing CoT by 18\\%, ToT by 11\\%, and CR by 9\\%; (ii) CoE with PaLM-2 outperforms the variable-shot performance of Gemini Ultra by 0.9 F1 points, achieving an F1 score of 83.3 on DROP",

However, the setting of this task overlooks a significant portion of commonsense knowledge based on free-text in the real world, characterized by broad knowledge scope, long content and non instantiation. The editing objects of previous methods (e.g., MEMIT) were single token or entity, which were not suitable for commonsense knowledge in free-text form. To address the aforementioned challenges, we conducted experiments from two perspectives: knowledge localization and knowledge editing. Firstly, we introduced Knowledge Localization for Free-Text(KLFT) method, revealing the challenges associated with the distribution of commonsense knowledge in MLP and Attention layers, as well as in decentralized distribution. Next, we propose a Dynamics-aware Editing Method(DEM), which utilizes a Dynamics-aware Module to locate the parameter positions corresponding to commonsense knowledge, and uses Knowledge Editing Module to update knowledge. The DEM method fully explores the potential of the MLP and Attention layers, and successfully edits commonsense knowledge based on free-text. The experimental results indicate that the DEM can achieve excellent editing performance",

    "abstract": "With the popularity of the Internet, online social media has increasingly become a platform for people to share their attitudes towards life, such as optimism and pessimism about the future. While the Internet embraces various views, it also quietly deepens the formation of impressions on different views and attitudes. A large part of these texts will form the corpus of the pre-trained model, and the model may learn the tendency of life attitudes in the corpus. Our work develops new methods to (1) measure life attitude biases in LMs trained on such corpora and (2) measure the judgement impact of downstream models trained on different life attitude corpus. We focus on mental health disorder detection, aiming to empirically quantify the effects of life attitude (optimism, pessimism) leaning in pretraining data on the influence of risk-related tasks. Our findings reveal that pretrained LMs do have life attitude leanings that reinforce the polarization present in pretraining corpora, propagating life attitude biases into mental health disorder detection.We discussed strategies that might mitigate or leverage models of different life attitude leaning",

Despite this, these LLM agents introduce unexpected safety risks when operating in interactive environments. Instead of centering on the harmlessness of LLM-generated content in most prior studies, this work addresses the imperative need for benchmarking the behavioral safety of LLM agents within diverse environments. We introduce R-Judge, a benchmark crafted to evaluate the proficiency of LLMs in judging and identifying safety risks given agent interaction records. R-Judge comprises 569 records of multi-turn agent interaction, encompassing 27 key risk scenarios among 5 application categories and 10 risk types. It is of high-quality curation with annotated safety labels and risk descriptions. Evaluation of 11 LLMs on R-Judge shows considerable room for enhancing the risk awareness of LLMs: The best-performing model, GPT-4o, achieves 74.42% while no other models significantly exceed the random. Moreover, we reveal that risk awareness in open agent scenarios is a multi-dimensional capability involving knowledge and reasoning, thus challenging for LLMs. With further experiments, we find that fine-tuning on safety judgment significantly improve model performance while straightforward prompting mechanisms fail.

    "abstract": "Clinical notes are essential for physicians to accurately assess patient conditions, particularly in oncology where records are extensive. Efficient and effective information extraction from these notes is crucial for effective treatment. This is not a trivial task due to the lengthy and specialized content in the notes. Current methods that capture token-level or sentence-level relations, which are context-dependent, are sometimes insufficient for knowledge-intensive tasks such as information extraction from EHR that require external knowledge. To address this, we introduce a knowledge-enhanced hierarchical multimodal cross-attention approach. This method employs a cross-attention mechanism to integrate textual knowledge with patient network knowledge, aiming to synthesize information across multiple data levels, including word, sentence, note, and patient levels. This approach can efficiently highlight key sentences in clinical notes. We validate our method using extensive experiments on a large real-world dataset.

Despite the promising progress, their proficiency in compositional reasoning over attributes and relations (eg, distinguishing between \"the car is underneath the person\" and \"the person is underneath the car\") remains notably inadequate. We investigate the cause for this deficient behavior is the composition attribution issue, where the attribution scores (eg, attention scores or GradCAM scores) for relations (eg, underneath) or attributes (eg, red) in text are substantially lower than those for object terms. In this work, we show such issue is mitigated via a novel framework called CAE (Composition Attribution Enhancement). This generic framework incorporates various interpretable attribution methods to encourages the model to pay greater attention on composition words denoting relationships and attributes within the text. Detailed analysis shows that our approach enables the models to adjust and rectify the attribution on the texts. Extensive experiments across seven benchmarks reveal that our framework significantly enhances the ability to discern intricate details and construct more sophisticated interpretations of combined visual and linguistic elements",

    "abstract": "Safety backdoor attacks in large language models (LLMs) enable harmful behaviors to be stealthily triggered while evading detection during normal interactions. The high dimensionality of the trigger search space and the diverse range of potential malicious behaviors in LLMs make this a critical open problem. This paper presents BEEAR, a novel mitigation method based on a key insight: backdoor triggers induce a uniform drift in the model's embedding space, irrespective of the trigger's form or targeted behavior. Leveraging this observation, we introduce a bi-level optimization approach. The inner level identifies universal perturbations to the decoder's embeddings that steer the model towards defender-defined unwanted behaviors; the outer level fine-tunes the model to reinforce safe behaviors against these perturbations. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, reducing the success rate of safety backdoor attacks from over 95\\% to $<$1\\% for general harmful behaviors and from 47\\% to 0\\% for Sleeper Agents, without compromising the model's helpfulness. Notably, our method relies only on defender-defined sets of safe and unwanted behaviors without any assumptions about the trigger location or attack mechanism.

Leveraging their proficiency in processing visual and textual information, LVLM demonstrates promising capabilities in recognizing complex information and exhibiting strong reasoning skills.

However, current text-to-SQL LLMs are computationally expensive and challenging to deploy in real-world applications, highlighting the importance of compressing them. To achieve this goal, knowledge distillation (KD) is a common approach, which aims to distill the larger teacher model into a smaller student model. While numerous KD methods for autoregressive LLMs have emerged recently, it is still under-explored whether they work well in complex text-to-SQL scenarios. To this end, we conduct a series of analyses and reveal that these KD methods generally fall short in balancing performance and efficiency. In response to this problem, we propose to improve the KD with imperfect data, namely KID, which effectively boosts the performance without introducing much training budget. The core of KID is to efficiently mitigate the training-inference mismatch by simulating the cascading effect of inference in the imperfect training data. Extensive experiments on 5 text-to-SQL benchmarks show that, KID can not only achieve consistent and significant performance gains (up to +5.83% average score) across all model types and sizes, but also effectively improve the training efficiency",

Indeed, existing work has shown that LLMs can be used to great effect for many tasks, such as information retrieval (IR), and passage ranking. However, current state-of-the-art results heavily lean on the capabilities of the LLM being used. Currently, proprietary, and very large LLMs such as GPT-4 are the highest performing passage re-rankers. Hence, users without the resources to leverage top of the line LLMs, or ones that are closed source, are at a disadvantage. In this paper, we investigate the use of a pre-filtering step before passage re-ranking in IR. Our experiments show that by using a small number of human generated relevance scores, coupled with LLM relevance scoring, it is effectively possible to filter out irrelevant passages before re-ranking. Our experiments also show that this pre-filtering then allows the LLM to perform significantly better at the re-ranking task. Indeed, our results show that smaller models such as Mixtral can become competitive with much larger proprietary models (e.g., ChatGPT and GPT-4)",

    "abstract": "Despite its popularity in sentence-level relation extraction, distantly supervised data is rarely utilized by existing work in document-level relation extraction due to its noisy nature and low information density. Among its current applications, distantly supervised data is mostly used as a whole for pertaining, which is of low time efficiency. To fill in the gap of efficient and robust utilization of distantly supervised training data, we propose Efficient Multi-Supervision for document-level relation extraction, in which we first select a subset of informative documents from the massive dataset by combining distant supervision with expert supervision, then train the model with Multi-Supervision Ranking Loss that integrates the knowledge from multiple sources of supervision to alleviate the effects of noise. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in improving the model performance with higher time efficiency than existing baselines",

    "abstract": "Emotions are expressed differently and in different context and domain. On Twitter, for instance, an author might simply use the hashtag \\#anger to express this affective state, while in a news headline, such an emotion needs to be written in a polite manner. To enable conditional text generation models to create appropriate texts, users need a parameter that allows them to choose the appropriate way to express an emotion. To achieve this, we introduce MOPO, a Multi-Objective Prompt Optimization methodology. MOPO optimizes prompts according to multiple objectives and outputs a set of prompts for different preference weightings of the objectives. Users can then choose the most appropriate prompt for their context. We evaluate MOPO using three objectives, determined by various domain-specific emotion classifiers. Our findings indicate that MOPO improves performance by up to 15 pp across all objectives with only a minimal loss (1--2 pp) for any single objective compared to single-objective optimization. These minor performance losses are offset by a broader generalization across multiple objectives -- which is not possible with single-objective optimization. Additionally, MOPO reduces computational resources by simultaneously optimizing for multiple objectives, eliminating separate optimizations for each objective",

This approach eliminates the need for hand-crafted prompt engineering or explicit model fine-tuning. Prompt tuning is significantly more parameter-efficient than model fine-tuning, as it involves optimizing partial inputs of language models to produce desired outputs. In this work, we aim to further reduce the amount of trainable parameters required for a language model to perform well on specific tasks. We propose Low-rank Prompt Tuning (LoPT), a low-rank model for prompts that achieves efficient prompt optimization. The proposed method demonstrates similar outcomes to full parameter prompt tuning while reducing the number of trainable parameters by a factor of 5.

In this paper, we propose a parameter-efficient dynamic prefix method and formalize INER as a unified seq2seq generation task. By employing the dynamic prefix as a task instructor to guide the generative model, our approach can preserve task-invariant knowledge while adapting to new entities with minimal parameter updates, making it particularly effective in low-resource scenarios.

Identifying text segments requiring fact-checking is known as claim detection (CD) and claim check-worthiness detection (CW), the latter incorporating complex domain-specific criteria of worthiness and often framed as a ranking task. Zero- and few-shot LLM prompting is an attractive option for both tasks, as it bypasses the need for labeled datasets and allows verbalized claim and worthiness criteria to be directly used for prompting. We evaluate the LLMs' predictive accuracy and accuracy on five CD/CW datasets from diverse domains, each utilizing a different worthiness criterion. We examine two key aspects: (1) how to best distill factuality and worthiness criteria into a prompt, and (2) how much context to provide for each claim. To this end, we experiment with different levels of prompt verbosity and varying amounts of contextual information given to the model. We additionally evaluate the top-performing models with ranking metrics, resembling prioritization done by fact-checkers. Our results show that optimal prompt verbosity varies, meta-data alone adds more performance boost than co-text, and confidence scores can be directly used to produce reliable check-worthiness rankings",

However, in real-world applications, there are often similar prompt components for repeated queries, which causes significant computational burdens during inference. Existing prompt compression and direct fine-tuning methods aim to tackle these challenges, yet they frequently struggle to strike an optimal balance between cost-efficiency and performance effectiveness, especially in complex tasks such as NL2Code. In this paper, we propose a novel method namely PromptIntern to internalize the prompt knowledge into model parameters via progressive fine-tuning.

    "abstract": "Despite the widespread adoption of decoder-only autoregressive language models, explainability evaluation research has predominantly focused on encoder-only models, specifically masked language models (MLMs). Evaluating the faithfulness of an explanation method—how accurately the method explains the inner workings and decision-making of the model—is very challenging because it is very hard to separate the model from its explanation. Most faithfulness evaluation techniques corrupt or remove some input tokens considered important according to a particular attribution (feature importance) method and observe the change in the model's output. While these faithfulness evaluation techniques are suitable for MLMs, as they involve corrupted or masked inputs during pretraining, they create out-of-distribution inputs for CLMs due to the fundamental difference in their training objective of next token prediction. In this study, we propose a technique that leverages counterfactual generation to evaluate the faithfulness of attribution methods for autoregressive language modeling scenarios. Our technique creates natural, fluent, and in-distribution counterfactuals, something that we show is important for a faithfulness evaluation method. We apply our method to several attribution methods and evaluate their faithfulness in predicting the important tokens of a few large language models",

To steer LLMs towards human preference, alignment technologies have been introduced and gained increasing attention. Nevertheless, existing methods heavily rely on high-quality positive-negative training pairs, suffering from noisy positive responses that are barely distinguishable from negative ones. Given recent LLMs' proficiency in generating helpful responses, this work pivots towards a new research question: **can we achieve alignment using solely human-annotated negative samples, preserving helpfulness while reducing harmfulness?** For this purpose, we propose Distributional Dispreference Optimization (D$^2$O), which maximizes the discrepancy between dispreferred responses and the generated non-negative ones. In this way, D$^2$O effectively eschews harmful information without incorporating noisy positive samples, while avoiding collapse using self-generated responses as anchors. We demonstrate that D$^2$O can be regarded as learning a distributional preference model reflecting human dispreference against negative responses, which is theoretically an upper bound of the instance-level DPO. Extensive experiments manifest that our method achieves comparable generation quality and surpasses the latest strong baselines in producing less harmful and more informative responses with better training stability and faster convergence",

    "title": "Enhancing Zero-shot Emotion Perception in Conversation through the Internal-to-External Chain-of-Thought",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "An excellent emotional dialogue model needs to rapidly adapt to new scenarios and perform emotion analysis to meet rapidly changing demands. Therefore, enhancing the model's zero-shot emotion-related capabilities in the dialogue domain has become a new challenge. However, current research shows that large language models (LLMs) perform poorly in zero-shot emotion-related tasks and the Emotion Recognition in Conversations (ERC) task alone doesn't comprehensively reflect the model's emotion understanding capabilities. In this paper, we propose an Emotion Perception in Conversation (EPC) task, which includes both ERC and Emotion Inference in Conversations (EIC), to evaluate the model's emotion perception capabilities in dialogue comprehensively. We propose an Internal-to-External Chain-of-Thought (IoECoT) method for the EPC task. This is a plug-and-play method that first extracts personality information of the dialogue participants from the dialogue history as internal factors influencing emotions, and then uses the sentiment polarity of the historical utterances as external factors. Finally, emotions are perceived by combining internal and external factors. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments, and the results show that IoECoT significantly outperforms other baselines across multiple models and datasets, demonstrating that IoECoT effectively enhances the emotion perception capabilities of LLMs in zero-shot scenarios",

    "title": "Playing with News Context for Algorithmic Trading",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "The application of reinforcement learning for algorithmic trading in the spot market using numerical data is a well-studied problem. However, news data consists of hard-to-quantify information which the investors use to base their trading decisions. Thus factoring in news data for algorithmic trading can improve the trading performance of the RL agent. This paper proposes an RL-based framework that performs algorithmic trading in the futures market by combining news data and price data. We propose two approaches for representing the context of the news data: sentiment-aware approach and context-aware approach. We investigate the effect of these approaches on the trading performance of the RL agent. We further compare the performance of on-policy and off-policy RL algorithms. The models are evaluated by trading in the NIFTY 50 index. The evaluation of the models show that using context-aware approach for representation of news data significantly improves the return (\\%) and also reduces the maximum drawdown of the trading model during a trading session",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across various tasks, but their performance is highly sensitive to the prompts utilized. This variability poses challenges for accurate assessment and user satisfaction. Current research frequently overlooks instance-level prompt variations and their implications on subjective evaluations. To address these shortcomings, we introduce \\textbf{ProSA}, a framework designed to evaluate and comprehend prompt sensitivity in LLMs. ProSA incorporates a novel sensitivity metric, \\texttt{PromptSensiScore}, and leverages decoding confidence to elucidate underlying mechanisms. Our extensive study, spanning multiple tasks, uncovers that prompt sensitivity fluctuates across datasets and models, with larger models exhibiting enhanced robustness. We observe that few-shot examples can alleviate this sensitivity issue, and subjective evaluations are also susceptible to prompt sensitivities, particularly in complex, reasoning-oriented tasks. Furthermore, our findings indicate that higher model confidence correlates with increased prompt robustness. We believe this work will serve as a helpful tool in studying prompt sensitivity of LLMs",

    "abstract": "A common method to solve complex problems in software engineering, is to divide the problem into multiple sub-problems. Inspired by this, we propose a Modular Architecture for Software-engineering AI (MASAI) agents, where different LLM-powered sub-agents are instantiated with well-defined objectives and strategies tuned to achieve those objectives. Our modular architecture offers several advantages: (1) employing and tuning different problem-solving strategies across sub-agents, (2) enabling sub-agents to gather information from different sources scattered throughout a repository, and (3) avoiding unnecessarily long trajectories which inflate costs and add extraneous context. MASAI enabled us to achieve the highest performance (28.33% resolution rate) on the popular and highly challenging SWE-bench Lite dataset consisting of 300 GitHub issues from 11 Python repositories. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of MASAI relative to other agentic methods and analyze the effects of our design decisions and their contribution to the success of MASAI",

However, this framework has an evident drawback as a domain-agnostic detector cannot ensure the identification of only those entity spans that are specific to the target domain. To address this issue, we propose Double-Checker, which leverages collaboration between Large Language Models (LLMs) and small models. Specifically, we employ LLMs to verify candidate spans predicted by the small model and eliminate any spans that fall outside the scope of the target domain.

Previous works have focused on generic AI-generated text detection or have presented an approach for estimating the fraction of peer-reviews that can be AI-generated. Our focus here is to solve a real-world problem by assisting the editor or chair in determining whether a review is written by ChatGPT or not. To address this, we introduce the Term Frequency (TF) model, which posits that AI often repeats tokens, and the Review Regeneration (RR) model which is based on the idea that ChatGPT generates similar outputs upon re-prompting. We stress test these detectors against token attack and paraphrasing. Finally we propose an effective defensive strategy to reduce the effect of paraphrasing on our models. Our findings suggest both our proposed methods perform better than other AI text detectors. Our RR model is more robust, although our TF model performs better than the RR model without any attacks.

This bias, stemming from using a question set with a low concept coverage rate to represent a subject, can potentially lead to skewed results. To address this, we present ConceptPsy, a Chinese conceptual benchmark specifically designed for evaluating LLMs' complex reasoning and knowledge in psychology. ConceptPsy encompasses 12 core subjects and 1,383 concepts from official exams. To avoid copyright issues, we prompt \\texttt{GPT-4} to generate questions for each of the concepts, which are then validated by psychology professionals to ensure high quality. Besides the overall scores, we annotate each question with a chapter label to provide fine-grained results. We evaluate a range of LLMs on ConceptPsy and the results show significant performance differences across psychology concepts, even among models from the same series.

Experiments on well-known LLMs (i.e., Llama2 series and OPT) show that AdaInfer can achieve an average of 17.8% pruning ratio, even up to 43% on sentiment tasks while maintaining comparable performance with minimal loss (<1%).

We tackle this problem by proposing \\texttt{ObfuscaTune}, a novel, efficient and fully utility-preserving approach that combines a simple yet effective obfuscation technique with an efficient usage of confidential computing (only $~5\\%$ of the model parameters are placed on TEE). We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of \\texttt{ObfuscaTune} by validating it on GPT-2 models with different sizes on four NLP benchmark datasets. Finally, we compare to a naive version of our approach to highlight the necessity of using random matrices with low condition numbers in our approach to reduce errors induced by the obfuscation",

We investigate several subspace decomposition and feature selection strategies and achieve significant improvements over state of the art methods in cross-domain and cross-generator transfer.

    "abstract": "Thanks to the strong representation capability of pre-trained language models, dependency parsing in rich-resource language has achieved remarkable improvements. However, the parsing accuracy drops sharply when the model is transferred to low-resource language due to distribution shifts. To alleviate this issue, we propose a representation alignment and adversarial model to filter out useful knowledge from rich-resource language and ignore useless ones. Our proposed model consists of two components, i.e., an alignment network in the input layer for selecting useful language-specific representation features and an adversarial network in the encoder layer for augmenting the language-invariant contextualized features. Experiments on the benchmark datasets show that our proposed model outperforms RoBARTa-enhanced strong baseline models by 1.37 LAS and 1.34 UAS. Detailed analysis shows that both alignment and adversarial networks are equally important in alleviating the distribution shifts problem and can benefit from each other. In addition, the comparative experiments demonstrate that both the alignment and adversarial networks can substantially facilitate extracting and utilizing relevant target language features, thereby increasing the adaptation capability of our proposed model",

It can simultaneously supervise the internal preference model at the token level and optimize the mapping layer of the reward model at the sequence level. Theoretical justifications and experiment results on five datasets show the validity and effectiveness of our proposed hybrid framework for training a high-quality reward model.

    "abstract": "Large Language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable abilities in understanding complex texts, offering a promising path towards human-like translation performance. However, this study reveals the misalignment between the translation-specific understanding and the general understanding inside LLMs. This understanding misalignment leads to LLMs mistakenly or literally translating some complicated concepts that they accurately comprehend in the general scenarios (e.g., QA). To align the translation-specific understanding to the general one, we propose a novel translation process, DUAT (Difficult words Understanding Aligned Translation), explicitly incorporating the general understanding on the complicated content incurring inconsistent understandings to guide the translation. Specifically, DUAT performs cross-lingual interpretation for the difficult-to-translate words and enhances the translation with the generated interpretations. Furthermore, we reframe the external tools to improve DUAT in detecting difficult words and generating helpful interpretations. We conduct experiments on the self-constructed benchmark Challenge-WMT, consisting of samples that are prone to mistranslation. Human evaluation results on high-resource and low-resource language pairs indicate that DUAT significantly facilitates the understanding alignment, which improves the translation quality (up to +3.85 COMET) and reduces translation literalness by -25% ∼ -51%",

Prior studies involve addressing the calculation errors and step-missing errors, but neglect the semantic misunderstanding errors, which is the major factor limiting the LLMs' performance. To this end, we propose a simple-yet-effective method, namely Deeply Understanding the Problems (DUP), to improve the LLMs' math problem-solving ability by addressing semantic misunderstanding errors. The core of our method is to encourage the LLMs to deeply understand the problems and extract the key problem-solving information used for better reasoning. Extensive experiments on 10 diverse reasoning benchmarks show that our DUP method consistently outperforms the other counterparts by a large margin.

In this paper, we answer the question: Do LLMs know multilingual facts and can they use this knowledge for effective fact-checking? To this end, we create a benchmark by filtering multilingual claims from the X-fact dataset and evaluating the multilingual fact-checking capabilities of five LLMs across five diverse languages: Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Turkish, and Tamil on our benchmark. We employ three different prompting techniques: Zero-Shot, English Chain-of-Thought, and Cross-Lingual Prompting, using both greedy and self-consistency decoding. We extensively analyze our results and find that GPT-4o achieves the highest accuracy, but zero-shot prompting with self-consistency was the most effective overall. We also show that techniques like Chain-of-Thought and Cross-Lingual Prompting, which are designed to improve reasoning abilities, do not necessarily improve the fact-checking abilities of LLMs. Interestingly, we find a strong negative correlation between model accuracy and the amount of internet content for a given language. This suggests that LLMs are better at fact-checking from knowledge in low-resource languages. We hope that this study will encourage more work on multilingual fact-checking using LLMs",

However, prior studies have shown that dense models could contain harmful parameters that affect the model performance. This prompted us to consider whether SimCSE might also have similar harmful parameters. To tackle the problem, parameter sparsification is applied, where alignment and uniformity scores are used to measure the contribution of each parameter to the overall quality of sentence embeddings. Drawing from a preliminary study, we hypothesize that parameters with minimal contributions are detrimental, and sparsifying them would result in an improved model performance. Accordingly, a sparsified SimCSE (SparseCSE) is proposed. To systematically explore the ubiquity of detrimental parameters and the removal of them, extensive experiments are conducted on the standard semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks and transfer learning tasks. The results show that the proposed SparseCSE significantly outperform SimCSE. Furthermore, through an in-depth analysis, we establish the validity and stability of our sparsification method, showcasing that the embedding space generated by SparseCSE exhibits an improved alignment compared to that produced by SimCSE.

However, they fail to fully separate the task ability from the source language or the language ability from the chosen task. In this paper, we acknowledge the mutual reliance between task ability and language ability and direct our attention toward the gap between the target language and the source language on tasks. As the gap removes the impact of tasks, we assume that it remains consistent across tasks. Based on this assumption, we propose a new cross-lingual transfer method called $\\texttt{AdaMergeX}$ that utilizes adaptive adapter merging. By introducing a reference task, we can determine that the divergence of adapters fine-tuned on the reference task in both languages follows the same distribution as the divergence of adapters fine-tuned on the target task in both languages. Hence, we can obtain target adapters by combining the other three adapters. Furthermore, we propose a structure-adaptive adapter merging method.

This study addresses the limitations of manual data annotation by leveraging synthetic data generation (SDG) techniques using large language models (LLMs). We evaluate four SDG methods—plain prompting, sampling, precise attributes, and adjective attributes—to generate synthetic job ads and assess their impact on classification model performance. Our analysis focuses on the balance between dataset size, data diversity and label-fit, and we explore the use of Natural Language Inference (NLI) filtering to enhance data quality. Results show that models trained on synthetic data can effectively classify real-world job ads, achieving competitive performance. However, we observed significant volatility in outcomes, which we could not fully explain. By making our code and data publicly available, we provide the research community with opportunities to further investigate SDG techniques. By publishing our best models, we offer researchers tools capable of achieving up to 96% F1 on a real-world dataset for classifying German OJAs by employment type",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models have recently revolutionized the NLP field, while they still fall short in some specific down-stream tasks. In the work, we focus on utilizing LLMs to perform machine translation, where we observe that two patterns of errors frequently occur and drastically affect the translation quality: language mismatch and repetition. The work sets out to explore the potential for mitigating these two issues by leveraging model editing methods, e.g., by locating FFN neurons or something that are responsible for the errors and deactivating them in the inference time. We find that directly applying such methods either limited effect on the targeted errors or has significant negative side-effect on the general translation quality, indicating that the located components may also be crucial for ensuring machine translation with LLMs on the rails. To this end, we propose to refine the located components by fetching the intersection of the locating results under different language settings, filtering out the aforementioned information that is irrelevant to targeted errors. The experiment results empirically demonstrate that our methods can effectively reduce the language mismatch and repetition ratios and meanwhile enhance or keep the general translation quality in most cases",

While these models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various applications, they are prone to generating content infused with hallucinations, compromising the trustworthiness of their output. This phenomenon raises concerns of LLM applications, particularly when the dissemination of misleading information can have detrimental impacts. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method called \\textsc{HalluAttack} which generates high quality counterfactual instruction data in order to reduce the hallucinations. We observe that these counterfactual instruction data can unlock the self-reflection ability of LLMs, and the LLMs will use knowledge learnt from pretraining phase more accurately. We conducted experiments across multiple open-source LLMs to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed approach\\footnote{The data we used for fine-tuning is publicly available in \\url{https://github.com/oldstree/halluattack}}. Results consistently demonstrate that, through counterfactual attack and subsequent fine-tuning, we are able to significantly improve the model performance on hallucination benchmarks (e.g. TruthfulQA and HalluQA). Moreover, we also find that the LLMs fine-tuned with counterfactual instruction data can also achieve gains on public general benchmarks like C-Eval, MMLU and GSM8K, which also demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on hallucination mitigation",

To address this, we introduce the LM-KG Fidelity metric to assess KG representation reliability and propose the LM-KG Distribution-aware Alignment (LKDA) algorithm to improve explanation faithfulness.

    "abstract": "Parameter Efficient Tuning (PET) techniques such as Low-rank Adaptation~(LoRA) are effective methods to adapt Large Language Models to downstream tasks. We propose Sparse mixture of low Rank Adaption~(SiRA), which uses Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) by enforcing conditional computation with top k LoRA weights. SiRA is optimized through a combination of training techniques, including an auxiliary loss encouraging load balancing, a capacity limit which restricts the maximum number of tokens each expert can process, and novel expert dropout on top of the gating network. Through extensive experiments, we show that SiRA performs better than LoRA and other mixture of expert approaches across different single-task and multiple-task settings. Results show SiRA has more orthogonal low rank spaces and consumes less computing resources compared to other MoE variants",

    "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented generation supports language models to strengthen their factual groundings by providing external context. However, language models often face challenges in locating and integrating extensive information, diminishing their effectiveness in solving complex questions. Query-focused compression tackles this issue by filtering out information irrelevant to the query, but current methods still struggle in realistic scenarios where crucial information may not be located with a single-step approach. To overcome this limitation, we introduce COMPACT, a novel framework that employs an active strategy to condense extensive documents without losing key information. COMPACT flexibly operates as a cost-efficient plug-in module with any off-the-shelf retriever or reader model, achieving extremely high compression rates (44x). Our experiments demonstrate that COMPACT brings significant improvements in both compression rate and QA performance on multi-hop question-answering datasets",

    "abstract": "Trading range breakout is a key method in the technical analysis of financial trading, widely employed by traders in financial markets such as stocks, futures, and foreign exchange. However, distinguishing between true and false breakout and providing the correct rationale cause significant challenges to investors. Traditional quantitative methods require large amounts of data and cannot directly present the reasoning process to users, making them less than perfect in this field. Recently, large language models have achieved success in various downstream applications, but their effectiveness in the domain of financial breakout detection has been subpar. The reason is that the unique data and specific knowledge are required in breakout detection. To address these issues, we created the first financial breakout dataset and introduce FinanceGPT-B, the premier large language model for financial breakout detection. Furthermore, we have developed a novel framework for large language models, namely multi-stage structure, effectively reducing mistakes in downstream applications. Experimental results indicate that compared to GPT-3.5, FinanceGPT-B improves the average accuracy of answers and rational by 49.97\\%, with the multi-stage structure contributing 9.72\\% to the improvement.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Due to the continuous emergence of new data, version updates have become an indispensable requirement for Large Language Models (LLMs). The training paradigms for version updates of LLMs include pre-training from scratch (PTFS) and continual pre-training (CPT). Preliminary experiments demonstrate that PTFS exhibits better pre-training performance, while the training cost of CPT is lower. Moreover, their performance and training cost gaps gradually widen with the version updates processing. To investigate the underlying reasons for this phenomenon, we analyze the effect of learning rate adjustments during the two stages of CPT: preparing an initialization checkpoint and conducting pre-training based on this checkpoint. We find that a large learning rate in the first stage and a complete learning rate decaying process in the second stage are crucial for version updates of LLMs. Hence, we propose a learning rate path switching training paradigm. Our paradigm comprises one main path, where we pre-train a LLM with the maximal learning rate, and multiple branching paths, each of which corresponds to an update of the LLM with newly-added training data. Compared with PTFS, when training four versions of LLMs, our paradigm can reduce the total training cost to 58% while maintaining comparable pre-training performance. In addition, we also validate the generalization of our paradigm, further proving its practicability",

However, these methods still fall short in verifiability and require certain time costs for fact checking. This paper proposes a fine-grained ATG method called ReClaim (Refer & Claim), which alternates the generation of references and answers step by step.

In this paper, we focus on entity type ambiguity and analyze current state-of-the-art LLMs for their proficiency and consistency in applying their factual knowledge when prompted for entities under ambiguity. To do so, we propose an evaluation protocol that disentangles knowing from applying knowledge and test state-of-the-art LLMs on 49 entities. Our experiments reveal that LLMs perform poorly with ambiguous prompts, achieving only 80% accuracy. Our results further demonstrate systematic discrepancies in LLM behavior and their failure to consistently apply information, indicating that the models can exhibit knowledge without being able to utilize it, significant biases for preferred readings, as well as self-inconsistencies.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Despite advances in the multilingual capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) across diverse Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, English remains the dominant language for LLM research and development. This has led to the widespread practice of pre-translation, i.e., translating the task prompt into English before inference. Selective pre-translation, a more surgical approach, focuses on translating specific prompt components. However, its current use lacks a systematic research foundation. Consequently, the optimal pre-translation strategy for various multilingual settings and tasks remains unclear. In this work, we aim to uncover the optimal setup for pre-translation by systematically assessing its modes of use. Specifically, we view the prompt as a modular entity, composed of four functional parts: instruction, context, examples (zero-shot / few-shot), and output, either of which could be translated or not. We evaluate pre-translation strategies across 35 languages covering both low and high-resource languages, and assessing various capabilities including Question Answering (QA), Natural Language Inference (NLI), Named Entity Recognition (NER), and Abstractive Summarization. Our experiments uncover the impact of factors as translation quality, similarity to English, and the size of pre-trained data, on the model performance with pre-translation. Finally, we suggest practical guidelines for choosing the optimal strategy in various multilingual scenarios",

    "abstract": "Large language models demonstrate reasonable multilingual abilities, despite predominantly English-centric pretraining. However, the spontaneous multilingual alignment in these models is shown to be weak, leading to unsatisfactory cross-lingual transfer and knowledge sharing. Previous works attempt to address this issue by explicitly injecting multilingual alignment information during or after pretraining. Thus for the early stage in pretraining, the alignment is weak for sharing information or knowledge across languages. In this paper, we propose PreAlign, a framework that establishes multilingual alignment prior to language model pretraining. PreAlign injects multilingual alignment by initializing the model to generate similar representations of aligned words and preserves this alignment using a code-switching strategy during pretraining. Extensive experiments in a synthetic English to English-Clone setting demonstrate that \\method significantly outperforms standard multilingual joint training in language modeling, zero-shot cross-lingual transfer, and cross-lingual knowledge application.

This gap is caused by a lack of explicit task-language distribution characterization exposed to the model. Addressing this by capturing these distributions explicitly through task guidelines enhances model performance. We then present LongGuide, the first efficient algorithm that generates two types of guidelines as additional instructions for LLMs: (i) Metric Guideline (MG) that instructs models to optimize for selected metrics; and (ii) Output Constraint Guideline (OCG) that constrains generation at both the token and sentence levels. LongGuide automatically selects the most useful combination of guidelines, improving strong open- and closed-source LLMs by 5.39% and 6.58% under zero- and few-shot settings across seven tasks.

Concretely, given an input question, we first prompt the LLM to generate knowledge triplets, forming a graph representation of the question. Unlike conventional knowledge triplets, our approach allows variables as head or tail entities, effectively representing a question as knowledge triplets. Second, for each triplet, the LLM generates a corresponding sub-question and answer along with using knowledge retrieval. If the prediction confidence exceeds a threshold, the sub-question and prediction are incorporated into the prompt for subsequent processing. This approach encourages that sub-questions are grounded in the extracted knowledge triplets, reducing redundancy and irrelevance. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous CoT prompting methods and their variants on multi-hop question-answering benchmark datasets",

Traditional evaluations fail to assess a model's factual correctness. To rectify this absence, we present MoleculeQA, a novel question answering (QA) dataset which possesses 62K QA pairs over 23K molecules. Each QA pair, composed of a manual question, a positive option and three negative options, has consistent semantics with a molecular description from authoritative corpus. MoleculeQA is not only the first benchmark to evaluate molecular factual correctness but also the largest molecular QA dataset.

    "abstract": "Recent methods have demonstrated that Large Language Models (LLMs) can solve reasoning tasks better when they are encouraged to solve subtasks of the main task first. In this paper we devise a similar strategy that breaks down reasoning tasks into a problem decomposition phase and a problem solving phase and show that the strategy is able to outperform a single stage solution. Further, we hypothesize that the decomposition should be easier to distill into a smaller model compared to the problem solving because the latter requires large amounts of domain knowledge while the former only requires learning general problem solving strategies. We propose methods to distill these two capabilities and evaluate their impact on reasoning outcomes and inference cost. We find that we can distill the problem decomposition phase and at the same time achieve good generalization across tasks, datasets, and models. However, it is harder to distill the problem solving capability without losing performance and the resulting distilled model struggles with generalization. These results indicate that by using smaller, distilled problem decomposition models in combination with problem solving LLMs we can achieve reasoning with cost-efficient inference and local adaptation",

    "abstract": "Adapting pre-trained language models (PLMs) for cross-task generalization is a crucial research area within the field of NLP. While fine-tuning and in-context learning are effective approaches for adapting LMs to emerging tasks, they can be costly and inefficient. Recently, some researchers have focused on achieving efficient task adaptation via hypernetwork, which is a meta network that generates task-specific weights based on task-oriented information without any optimization. However, the training of hypernetworks often lacks stability since the optimization signal is not straightforward, and the task information is not adequately representative. Moreover, previous works train hypenetworks with the general corpus, which is struggling with few-shot adaptation. To address these issues, we introduce HyperLoRA, a hypernetwork for LoRA parameters generation involving hypernetwork pre-training on instruction-following data and generalization fine-tuning on sparse task data. Furthermore, we utilize a constrained training loss and a gradient-based demonstration selection strategy to enhance the training stability and performance. Experimental results and analysis across four benchmark datasets (P3, S-NI, BBH, and SuperGLUE) demonstrate the proposed approach has flexible generalization ability and superior performance",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "LLMs have become a go-to solution not just for text generation, but also for natural language understanding (NLU) tasks. Acquiring extensive knowledge through language modeling on web-scale corpora, they excel on English NLU, yet struggle to extend their NLU capabilities to underrepresented languages. In contrast, machine translation models (MT) produce excellent multilingual representations, resulting in strong translation performance even for low-resource languages. MT encoders, however, lack the knowledge necessary for comprehensive NLU that LLMs obtain through language modeling training on immense corpora. In this work, we get the best both worlds by integrating MT encoders directly into LLM backbones via sample-efficient self-distillation. The resulting MT-LLMs preserve the inherent multilingual representational alignment from the MT encoder, allowing lower-resource languages to tap into the rich knowledge embedded in English-centric LLMs. Merging the MT encoder and LLM in a single model, we mitigate the propagation of translation errors and inference overhead of MT decoding inherent to discrete translation-based cross-lingual transfer (e.g., translate-test). Evaluation spanning three prominent NLU tasks and 127 predominantly low-resource languages renders MT-LLMs highly effective in cross-lingual transfer. MT-LLMs substantially and consistently outperform translation-test based on the same MT model, showing that we truly unlock multilingual language understanding for LLMs",

    "abstract": "During pre-training, the Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models encode factual knowledge into their parameters. These parameterized facts enable realistic image generation, but they may become obsolete over time, thereby misrepresenting the current state of the world. Knowledge editing techniques aim to update model knowledge in a targeted way. However, facing the dual challenges posed by inadequate editing datasets and unreliable evaluation criterion, the development of T2I knowledge editing encounter difficulties in effectively generalizing injected knowledge. In this work, we design a T2I knowledge editing framework by comprehensively spanning on three phases: First, we curate a dataset \\textbf{CAKE}, comprising paraphrase and multi-object test, to enable more fine-grained assessment on knowledge generalization. Second, we propose a novel criterion, \\textbf{adaptive CLIP threshold}, to effectively filter out false successful images under the current criterion and achieve reliable editing evaluation. Finally, we introduce \\textbf{MPE}, a simple but effective approach for T2I knowledge editing. Instead of tuning parameters, MPE precisely recognizes and edits the outdated part of the conditioning text-prompt to accommodate the up-to-date knowledge. A straightforward implementation of MPE (Based on in-context learning) exhibits better overall performance than previous model editors. We hope these efforts can further promote faithful evaluation of T2I knowledge editing methods.\\footnote{Our code will be made publicly available",

With the recent advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their remarkable reasoning abilities, there is a growing trend to leverage them for KGQA. However, existing methodologies have only focused on answering factual questions, e.g., \"In which city was Silvio Berlusconi's first wife born?\", leaving questions involving commonsense reasoning that real-world users may pose more often, e.g., \"Do I need separate visas to see the Venus of Willendorf and attend the Olympics this summer?\" unaddressed. In this work, we first observe that existing LLM-based methods for KGQA struggle with hallucination on such questions, especially on queries targeting long-tail entities (e.g., non-mainstream and recent entities), thus hindering their applicability in real-world applications especially since their reasoning processes are not easily verifiable. In response, we propose Right for Right Reasons (R^3), a commonsense KGQA methodology that allows for a verifiable reasoning procedure by axiomatically surfacing intrinsic commonsense knowledge of LLMs and grounding every factual reasoning step on KG triples. Through experimental evaluations across three different tasks—question answering, claim verification, and preference matching—our findings showcase R^3 as a superior approach, outperforming existing methodologies and notably reducing instances of hallucination and reasoning errors",

These scenarios often require LLMs to be adapted to meet specific needs, but the limited training data available in practice leads to poor code generation performance.

In this paper, we propose a novel and effective adaptation method DEED, which stands for Data-Efficient adaptation based on Error-Driven learning for code generation. DEED leverages the errors made by LLM as learning opportunities and overcomes its own shortcomings through error revision, thereby achieving efficient learning. Specifically, DEED includes identifying the erroneous code generated by LLM, using Self-revise for code revision, optimizing the model with the revised code, and iteratively adapting the process for continuous improvement. Experimental results show that DEED achieves superior performance compared with mainstream fine-tuning and prompting methods using only a small amount of training data, with an average relative improvement of 54.7% on Pass@1 on multiple code generation datasets. We also verify the effectiveness of Self-revise, which generates revised code that optimizes the model more efficiently compared to the code samples from datasets.

Previous work has shown that LLMs display biases in emotion attribution along gender lines.

Religions, therefore, cultivate certain emotions. Moreover, these rules are explicitly laid out and interpreted by religious leaders. Using emotion attribution, we explore how different religions are represented in LLMs. We find that: Major religions in the US and European countries are represented with more nuance, displaying a more shaded model of their beliefs. Eastern religions like Hinduism and Buddhism are strongly stereotyped. Judaism and Islam are stigmatized -- the models' refusal skyrocket. We ascribe these to cultural bias in LLMs and the scarcity of NLP literature on religion. In the rare instances where religion is discussed, it is often in the context of toxic language, perpetuating the perception of these religions as inherently toxic.

Building upon this observation, we propose a novel and interpretable prompt-tuning method named IntCoOp, which learns to jointly align attribute-level inductive biases and class embeddings during prompt-tuning. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we evaluate IntCoOp across two representative tasks in a few-shot learning setup: generalization to novel classes, and unseen domain shifts. Through extensive experiments across 10 downstream datasets on CLIP, we find that introducing attribute-level inductive biases leads to superior performance against state-of-art prompt tuning frameworks. Notably, in a 16-shot setup, IntCoOp improves CoOp by 7.35% in average performance across 10 diverse datasets",

    "title": "Tool Graph Retriever: Exploring Dependency Graph-based Tool Retrieval for Large Language Models",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "With the remarkable advancement of AI agents, the number of their equipped tools is increasing rapidly. However, integrating all tool information into the limited model context becomes impractical, highlighting the need for efficient tool retrieval methods. In this regard, dominant methods primarily rely on semantic similarities between tool descriptions and user queries to retrieve relevant tools. However, they often consider each tool independently, overlooking dependencies between tools, which may lead to the omission of prerequisite tools for successful task execution. To deal with this defect, in this paper, we propose Tool Graph Retriever (TGR), which exploits the dependencies among tools to learn better tool representations for retrieval. First, we construct a dataset termed TDI300K to train a discriminator for identifying tool dependencies. Then, we represent all candidate tools as a tool dependency graph and use graph convolution to integrate the dependencies into their representations. Finally, these updated tool representations are employed for online retrieval. Experimental results on several commonly used datasets show that our TGR can bring a performance improvement to existing dominant methods, achieving SOTA performance. Moreover, in-depth analyses also verify the importance of tool dependencies and the effectiveness of our TGR",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in many natural language processing tasks. However, our experiment reveals that, in stance detection tasks, LLMs may generate biased stances due to sentiment-stance spurious correlations and preference towards certain individuals and topics, thus harming their performance. Therefore, in this paper, we propose to Mitigate Biases of LLMs in stance detection with Calibration (MB-Cal). To be specific, a novel calibration network is devised to calibrate potential bias in the stance prediction of LLMs. Further, to address the challenge of effectively learning bias representations and the difficulty in the generalizability of debiasing, we construct counterfactual augmented data. This approach enhances the calibration network, facilitating the debiasing and out-of-domain generalization. Experimental results on in-target and zero-shot stance detection tasks show that the proposed MB-Cal can effectively mitigate biases of LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art results",

    "abstract": "This paper tackles the task of emotion-cause pair extraction in the unsupervised domain adaptation setting. The problem is challenging as the distributions of the events causing emotions in target domains are dramatically different than those in source domains, despite the distributions of emotional expressions between domains are overlapped. Inspired by causal discovery, we propose a novel deep latent model in the variational autoencoder (VAE) framework, which not only captures the underlying latent structures of data but also utilizes the easily transferable knowledge of emotions as the bridge to link the distributions of events in different domains. To facilitate knowledge transfer across domains, we also propose a novel variational posterior regularization technique to disentangle the latent representations of emotions from those of events in order to mitigate the damage caused by the spurious correlations related to the events in source domains. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our model outperforms the strongest baseline by approximately 11.05\\% on a Chinese benchmark and 2.45\\% on a English benchmark in terms of weighted-average F1 score.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) possess powerful capabilities and play a crucial role in daily life. Instruction fine-tuning is essential for training LLMs, enabling them to understand human instructions and produce the desired output. Selecting appropriate data for instruction fine-tuning is essential but challenging, existing data selection methods struggle to balance effectiveness and efficiency in real-world scenarios. Given that instruction fine-tuning requires models to respond to a wide variety of questions, we focus on output quality to assess the quality of instruction fine-tuning samples. In this work, we propose a novel data selection framework that evaluates data from unknown sources based on its output. To guide the model in distinguishing instruction fine-tuning data, we train a discriminator that uses outputs from models of varying quality as supervision signals. We establish principles to evaluate model quality, asserting that a model's quality is higher if it is a newer version, has more parameters, and achieves higher scores on well-known benchmarks. This way, the discriminator learns the differences between outputs from different models, enabling it to categorize unknown data into the most similar model outputs.

With the increase in available context length of LLMs, recent experiments have shown that the performance of ICL does not necessarily scale well in many-shot (demonstration) settings. We hypothesize that the reason lies in more demonstrations dispersing the model attention from the query, hindering its understanding of key content, which we validate both theoretically and experimentally. Inspired by how humans learn from examples, we propose a training-free method FocusICL, which conducts triviality filtering to avoid attention being diverted by unimportant contents at token-level and operates hierarchical attention to further ensure sufficient attention towards current query at demonstration-level. We also design an efficient hyperparameter searching strategy for FocusICL based on model perplexity of demonstrations. Comprehensive experiments validate that FocusICL achieves an average performance improvement of 5.2% over vanilla ICL and scales well with many-shot demonstrations",

While knowledge distillation (KD) is a prominent method for this, research on KD for generative language models like LLMs is relatively sparse, and the approach of distilling student-friendly knowledge, which has shown promising performance in KD for classification models, remains unexplored in generative language models. To explore this approach, we propose PromptKD, a simple yet effective method that utilizes prompt tuning - for the first time in KD - to enable generative language models to transfer student-friendly knowledge. Unlike previous works in classification that require fine-tuning the entire teacher model for extracting student-friendly knowledge, PromptKD achieves similar effects by adding a small number of prompt tokens and tuning only the prompt with student guidance. Extensive experiments on instruction-following datasets show that PromptKD achieves state-of-the-art performance while adding only 0.0007% of the teacher's parameters as prompts. Further analysis suggests that distilling student-friendly knowledge alleviates exposure bias effectively throughout the entire training process, leading to performance enhancements",

    "abstract": "Solving grid puzzles involves a significant amount of logical reasoning. Hence, it is a good domain to evaluate reasoning capability of a model which can then guide us to improve the reasoning ability of models. However, most existing works evaluate only the final predicted answer of a puzzle, without delving into an in-depth analysis of the LLMs' reasoning chains (such as where they falter) or providing any finer metrics to evaluate them. Since LLMs may rely on simple heuristics or artifacts to predict the final answer, it is crucial to evaluate the generated reasoning chain beyond overall correctness measures, for accurately evaluating the reasoning abilities of LLMs. To this end, we first develop GridPuzzle, an evaluation dataset comprising of 274 grid-based puzzles with different complexities. Second, we propose a new error taxonomy derived from manual analysis of reasoning chains from LLMs including GPT-4, Claude-3, Gemini, Mistral, and Llama-2. Then, we develop a LLM-based framework for large-scale subjective evaluation (i.e., identifying errors) and an objective metric, PuzzleEval, to evaluate the correctness of reasoning chains. Evaluating reasoning chains from LLMs leads to several interesting findings. We further show that existing prompting methods used for enhancing models' reasoning abilities do not improve performance on GridPuzzle.

Our results show that PBNs, as a mere architectural variation of vanilla LMs, offer more robustness compared to vanilla LMs under both targeted and static settings.

    "abstract": "While current tasks of converting natural language to SQL (NL2SQL) using Foundation Models have shown impressive achievements, adapting these approaches for converting natural language to Graph Query Language (NL2GQL) encounters hurdles due to the distinct nature of GQL compared to SQL, alongside the diverse forms of GQL. Moving away from traditional rule-based and slot-filling methodologies, we introduce a novel approach, $R^3$-NL2GQL, integrating both small and large Foundation Models for ranking, rewriting, and refining tasks. This method leverages the interpretative strengths of smaller models for initial ranking and rewriting stages, while capitalizing on the superior generalization and query generation prowess of larger models for the final transformation of natural language queries into GQL formats. Addressing the scarcity of datasets in this emerging field, we have developed a bilingual dataset, sourced from graph database manuals and selected open-source Knowledge Graphs (KGs). Our evaluation of this methodology on this dataset demonstrates its promising efficacy and robustness",

    "abstract": "The fine-tuning of open-source large language models (LLMs) for machine translation has recently received considerable attention, marking a shift towards data-centric research from traditional neural machine translation. However, the area of data collection for instruction fine-tuning in machine translation remains relatively underexplored. In this paper, we present LexMatcher, a simple yet effective method for data curation, the design of which is driven by the coverage of senses found in bilingual dictionaries. The construction process comprises data retrieval from an existing corpus and data augmentation that supplements the infrequent senses of polysemous words. Utilizing LLaMA2 as our base model, our approach outperforms the established baselines on the WMT2022 test sets and also exhibits remarkable performance in tasks related to word sense disambiguation and specialized terminology translation.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in various natural language processing tasks but struggle with hallucination issues. Existing solutions have considered utilizing LLMs' inherent reasoning abilities to alleviate hallucination, such as self-correction and diverse sampling methods. However, these methods often overtrust LLMs' initial answers due to inherent biases. The key to alleviating this issue lies in overriding LLMs' inherent biases for answer inspection. To this end, we propose a CounterFactual Multi-Agent Debate (CFMAD) framework. CFMAD presets the stances of LLMs to override their inherent biases by compelling LLMs to generate justifications for a predetermined answer's correctness. The LLMs with different predetermined stances are engaged with a skeptical critic for counterfactual debate on the rationality of generated justifications. Finally, the debate process is evaluated by a third-party judge to determine the final answer. Extensive experiments on four datasets of three tasks demonstrate the superiority of CFMAD over existing methods",

To address this gap, we investigate zero-shot domain adaptation for claim verification, where no labeled training data is available for the target domain. We propose a hybrid approach that combines utilizing labeled training data from a source domain via in-context learning, along with topically relevant contexts from target document collections such as Wikipedia by means of RAG.

Bridging the human cognition mechanism into LMMs, we aim for the models to engage with and generate responses that span a wider contextual scene understanding, mitigating hallucinatory outputs.

    "abstract": "Despite demonstrating emergent reasoning abilities, Large Language Models (LLMS) often lose track of complex, multi-step reasoning. Existing studies show that providing guidance via decomposing the original question into multiple subproblems elicits more robustness in LLM reasoning -- a decomposer generates the subproblems, and a solver solves each of these subproblems. However, these techniques fail to accommodate coordination between the decomposer and the solver modules (either in a single model or different specialized ones) -- the decomposer does not keep track of the ability of the solver to follow the decomposed reasoning. In this paper, we propose LM2 to address these challenges. LM2 modularizes the decomposition, solution, and verification into three different language models. The decomposer module identifies the key concepts necessary to solve the problem and generates step-by-step subquestions according to the reasoning requirement. The solver model generates the solution to the subproblems that are then checked by the verifier module; depending upon the feedback from the verifier, the reasoning context is constructed using the subproblems and the solutions. These models are trained to coordinate using policy learning. Exhaustive experimentation suggests the superiority of LM2 over existing methods on in- and out-domain reasoning problems, outperforming the best baselines by 8.1% on MATH, 7.71% on JEEBench, and 9.7% on MedQA problems",

In this paper, we explore the inner mechanisms of safety alignment from the perspective of mechanistic interpretability, focusing on identifying and analyzing *safety neurons* within LLMs that are responsible for safety behaviors. We propose generation-time activation contrasting to locate these neurons and dynamic activation patching to evaluate their causal effects. Experiments on multiple recent LLMs show that: (1) Safety neurons are sparse and effective. We can restore $90$\\% safety performance with intervention only on about $5$\\% of all the neurons. (2) Safety neurons encode transferrable mechanisms. They exhibit consistent effectiveness on different red-teaming datasets. The finding of safety neurons also interprets ''alignment tax''. We observe that the identified key neurons for safety and helpfulness significantly overlap, but they require different activation patterns of the shared neurons. Furthermore, we demonstrate an application of safety neurons in detecting unsafe outputs before generation. Our findings may promote further research on understanding LLM alignment.

We propose a prompt method Finite State Machine (FSM) to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLM for complex tasks in addition to improved effectiveness and trustworthiness. Different from chain-of-thought (COT) methods, FSM addresses MHQA by iteratively decomposing a question into multi-turn sub-questions, and self-correcting in time, improving the accuracy of answers in each step. Specifically, FSM addresses one sub-question at a time and decides on the next step based on its current result and state, in an automaton-like format.

    "abstract": "Though Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable abilities in mathematics reasoning, they are still struggling with performing numeric operations accurately, such as addition and multiplication. Numbers can be tokenized into tokens in various ways by different LLMs and affect the numeric operations performance. Currently, there are two representatives: 1) Tokenize into $1$-digit, and 2) Tokenize into $1\\sim 3$ digit. The difference is roughly equivalent to using different numeral systems (namely base $10$ or base $10^{3}$). In light of this, we study the scaling behavior of different numeral systems in the context of transformer-based large language models. We empirically show that a base $10$ system is consistently more data-efficient than a base $10^{2}$ or $10^{3}$ system across training data scale, model sizes under from-scratch training settings, while different number systems have very similar performances when fine-tuned. Through thorough analysis and experiments, we conclude that tokenizing numbers into $1$-digit is more favorable for LLMs in numerical operations.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "This paper studies in-context learning (ICL) by decomposing the output of large language models into the individual contributions of attention heads and MLPs (components). We observe curious components: good-performing ones that individually do well on a classification task, even when the model performs poorly; bad-performing ones that do much worse than chance; and label-biased components that always predict the same label. We find that component accuracies are well-correlated across different demonstration sets and perturbations of prompt templates, even when the full-model accuracy varies greatly. Based on our findings, we propose component reweighting, which learns to linearly re-scale the component activations from a few labeled examples. Given 24 labeled examples, our method improves by an average of 6.0% accuracy points over 24-shot ICL across 8 tasks on Llama-2-7B. Overall, this paper both enriches our understanding of ICL and provides a practical method for improvement by examining model internals",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has proven effective in aligning large language models with human intentions, yet it often relies on complex methodologies like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) that require extensive hyper-parameter tuning and present challenges in sample efficiency and stability. In this paper, we introduce Inverse-Q*, an innovative framework that transcends traditional RL methods by optimizing token-level reinforcement learning without the need for additional reward or value models. Inverse-Q* leverages direct preference optimization techniques but extends them by estimating the conditionally optimal policy directly from the model's responses, facilitating more granular and flexible policy shaping. Our approach reduces reliance on human annotation and external supervision, making it especially suitable for low-resource settings. We present extensive experimental results demonstrating that Inverse-Q* not only matches but potentially exceeds the effectiveness of PPO in terms of convergence speed and the alignment of model responses with human preferences. Our findings suggest that Inverse-Q* offers a practical and robust alternative to conventional RLHF approaches, paving the way for more efficient and adaptable model training approaches",

In contrast to LoRA and other low-rank adaptation methods such as AdaLoRA, Delta-LoRA not only updates the low-rank matrices $A$ and $B$, but also propagate the learning to the pre-trained weights $W$ via updates utilizing the delta of the product of two low-rank matrices ($A^{(t+1)}B^{(t+1)} - A^{(t)}B^{(t)}$). Such a strategy effectively addresses the limitation that the incremental update of low-rank matrices is inadequate for learning representations capable for downstream tasks. Moreover, as the update of $W$ does not need to compute the gradients of $W$ and store their momentums, Delta-LoRA shares comparable memory requirements and computational costs with LoRA. Extensive experiments show that Delta-LoRA significantly outperforms existing low-rank adaptation methods.

    "abstract": "As the expansion of application of Large Language Models (LLMs), concerns about the safety of LLMs have grown among researchers. Numerous previous studies demonstrated the potential risks of LLMs to generate harmful contents and proposed various safety assessment benchmarks aimed at evaluating the safety risks. However, the evaluation questions in current benchmarks are not only too straightforward to be easily rejected by target LLMs, but also difficult to update questions with practical significance due to their lack of correlation with real-world events, thereby making these benchmarks challenging to sustainably apply in continuous evaluaton tasks. To address these limitations, we propose SafetyQuizzer, a question generation framework for evaluating the safety of LLMs in a more sustained manner. SafetyQuizzer leverages fine-tuned LLM and jailbreaking attack templates to generate weakly offensive questions and so reduces the decline rate. Additionally, by employing retrieval-augmented generation, SafetyQuizzer incorporates the latest events into evaluation questions, overcoming the challenge of question updates and introducing a new dimension of event relevance to enhance the quality of evaluation questions. Our experiments show that evaluation questions generated by SafetyQuizzer significantly reduce the decline rate compared to other benchmarks while still maintaining comparable attack success rate.

    "abstract": "Opinion summarization in e-commerce encapsulates the collective views of numerous users about a product based on their reviews. Typically, a product on an e-commerce platform has thousands of reviews, each review comprising around 10-15 words. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown proficiency in summarization tasks, they struggle to handle such a large volume of reviews due to context limitations. To address this, we propose a scalable framework called XL-OPSUMM, that generates summaries incrementally with the help of an Aspect Dictionary (Refer to Section 3). However, the existing test set, AMASUM, has only 560 reviews per product on average. Due to the lack of a test set with thousands of reviews, we created a new test set called XL-FLIPKART by gathering data from the Flipkart website and generating summaries using GPT-4. Through various automatic evaluations and extensive analysis, we evaluated the framework's efficiency on two datasets, AMASUM and Xl-Flipkart. Experimental results show that our framework, XL-OPSUMM, powered by Llama-3-8B-8k, achieves an average ROUGE-1 F1 gain of 4.38% and a ROUGE-L F1 gain of 3.70% over the next best-performing model",

Then, execution feedback-based rejection sampling can generate data for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) training.

On the other hand, translation-specific LLMs are built by pre-training on domain-specific monolingual corpora and fine-tuning with human-annotated translation data. Despite the superior performance, these methods either demand an unprecedented scale of computing and data or substantial human editing and annotation efforts. In this paper, we develop Ladder, a novel model-agnostic and cost-effective tool to refine the performance of general LLMs for MT. Ladder is trained on pseudo-refinement triplets which can be easily obtained from existing LLMs without additional human cost. During training, we propose a hierarchical fine-tuning strategy with an easy-to-hard schema, improving Ladder's refining performance progressively. The trained Ladder can be seamlessly integrated with any general-purpose LLMs to boost their translation performance. By utilizing Gemma-2B/7B as the backbone, Ladder-2B can elevate raw translations to the level of top-tier open-source models (e.g., refining BigTranslate-13B with +6.91 BLEU and +3.52 COMET for XX→En), and Ladder-7B can further enhance model performance to be on par with the state-of-the-art GPT-4.

    "abstract": "RL-based techniques can be employed to search for prompts that, when fed into a target language model, maximize a set of user-specified reward functions. However, in many target applications, the natural reward functions are in tension with one another -- for example, content preservation vs. style matching in style transfer tasks. Current techniques focus on maximizing the average of reward functions, which does not necessarily lead to prompts that achieve balance across rewards -- an issue that has been well-studied in the multi-objective and robust optimization literature. In this paper, we conduct an empirical comparison of several existing multi-objective optimization techniques adapted to this new setting: RL-based discrete prompt optimization. We compare two methods optimizing the volume of the Pareto reward surface and one method that chooses an update direction that benefits all rewards simultaneously. We evaluate performance on two NLP tasks: style transfer and machine translation, each using three competing reward functions. Our experiments demonstrate that multi-objective methods that directly optimize the volume of the Pareto reward surface perform better and achieve a better balance of all rewards than those that attempt to find monotonic update directions",

    "abstract": "Using prompt-based \"diversity interventions\" is a typical way to improve diversity for Text-to-Image models to depict individuals with various racial or gender traits.

In this work, we propose **DemOgraphic FActualIty Representation (DoFaiR)**, a benchmark to quantify the trade-off between using diversity interventions and preserving demographic factuality in Text-to-Image models. DoFaiR consists of 756 test instances, various diversity prompts, and evaluation metrics to reveal the factuality tax of diversity instructions through an automated, fact-checked, and evidence-supported evaluation pipeline. Experiments with DALLE-3 on DoFaiR unveil that diversity-oriented instructions improve the number of different gender and racial groups in generated images at the cost of accurate historical demographic distributions. To resolve this issue, we propose **Fact-Augmented Intervention** (FAI), which instructs a Large Language Model (LLM) to reflect on factual information about gender and racial compositions of generation subjects in history and incorporate it into the generation context of T2I models. By orienting model generations using the reflected historical truths, FAI remarkably preserves demographic factuality under diversity interventions, while also boosting diversity",

Notably, $\\mathbb{IA}$ is an inference-only method, thus could enhance the safety of LLMs without compromising their helpfulness. Extensive experiments on varying jailbreak benchmarks across ChatGLM, Llama2, Llama3, Vicuna, MPT, DeepSeek, and GPT-3.5 show that $\\mathbb{IA}$ could consistently and significantly reduce the harmfulness in responses (averagely -48.2\\% attack success rate) without compromising the general helpfulness.

In this paper, we introduce a benchmark to evaluate gender-related social biases based on the step-by-step process using CoT prompts. We construct the benchmark for an English reasoning task where the LLM is given a list of words comprising feminine, masculine, and gendered occupational words, and is required to count the number of feminine and masculine words. Our CoT prompts require the LLM to explicitly indicate whether each word in the word list is feminine or masculine. Experimental results show that considering both the step-by-step process and predictions of LLMs improves the quality of bias evaluation. Furthermore, despite the simplicity of the task of counting words, our benchmark produces evaluations of gender-related social biases that are comparable to existing human-scratched benchmarks",

This presents a challenge in understanding the information they capture, and how it is encoded within transformer networks, raising the possibility that encoded biases may remain undetected. This work addresses confounding bias learned during model fine-tuning, when a pretrained language model is adapted to downstream domains and tasks. Building on previous methodologies, we extend them by proposing the Extended Confounding Filter and the Dual Filter. These methods aim to isolate and address weights within the transformer network that are associated with confounding variables through distinct training phases. We evaluate these methods on the \\textit{DementiaBank} dataset, a first-person narrative dataset that contains language of patients with cognitive impairment and healthy controls. We aim to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed methods in the domain of dementia detection as a means to correct for gender-related disparities in class distribution at training time. Our results show that transformer models can overfit to the subpopulation distribution in the training data. By disrupting the weights associated with known confounders, we show that fairer models can be achieved with reduced prediction bias towards specific subgroups. Moreover, our findings highlight resilience of the model against weights deletion and show a trade-off between model performance in dementia detection and the reduction of disparities across gender groups",

ASC follows recent work, Universal Self-Consistency (USC) in using multiple stochastic samples from an LLM to improve the long-form response. Unlike USC which only focuses on selecting the best single generation, ASC picks authentic subparts from the samples and merges them into a superior composite answer. Through extensive experiments and ablations, we show that merging relevant subparts of multiple samples performs significantly better than picking a single sample. ASC demonstrates significant gains over USC on multiple factoids and open-ended QA datasets - ASQA, QAMPARI, QUEST, ELI5 with ChatGPT and Llama3. Our analysis also reveals untapped potential for enhancing long-form generations using approach of merging multiple samples",

Existing methods, wrappers-based methods suffer from limited adaptability and scalability when faced with a new website, while language agents, empowered by large language models (LLMs), exhibit poor reusability in diverse web environments. In this work, we introduce the paradigm of generating web scrapers with LLMs and propose AutoScraper, a two-stage framework that can handle diverse and changing web environments more efficiently. AutoScraper leverages the hierarchical structure of HTML and similarity across different web pages for generating web scrapers. Besides, we propose a new executability metric for better measuring the performance of web scraper generation tasks. We conduct comprehensive experiments with multiple LLMs and demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Our work is now open-source",

    "abstract": "The emergence of large language models~(LLMs) has opened up unprecedented possibilities for automating complex tasks that are often comparable to human performance. Despite their capabilities, LLMs still encounter difficulties in completing tasks that require high levels of accuracy and complexity due to their inherent limitations in handling multifaceted problems single-handedly. This paper introduces `Smurfs', a cutting-edge multi-agent framework designed to revolutionize the application of LLMs. By seamlessly transforming a conventional LLM into a synergistic multi-agent ensemble, Smurfs can enhance the model's ability to solve complex tasks at no additional cost. This is achieved through innovative prompting strategies that allocate distinct roles within the model, thereby facilitating collaboration among specialized agents and forming an intelligent multi-agent system. Our empirical investigation on both open-ended task of StableToolBench and closed-ended task on HotpotQA showcases Smurfs' superior capability in intricate tool utilization scenarios. Notably, Smurfs outmatches all the baseline methods in both experiments, setting new state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, through comprehensive ablation studies, we dissect the contribution of the core components of the multi-agent framework to its overall efficacy. This not only verifies the effectiveness of the framework, but also sets a route for future exploration of multi-agent LLM systems",

We also include LLaMA as a baseline architecture for softmax attention for comparison. These models were trained with six variants, ranging from 70M to 7B parameters on a 300B-token corpus, and evaluated with a total of 1,376 intermediate checkpoints on various downstream tasks. These tasks include validation loss, commonsense reasoning, and information retrieval and generation.

    "title": "Take Off the Training Wheels! Progressive In-Context Learning for Effective Alignment",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Recent studies have explored the working mechanisms of In-Context Learning (ICL). However, they mainly focus on classification and simple generation tasks, limiting their broader application to more complex generation tasks in practice. To address this gap, we investigate the impact of demonstrations on token representations within the practical alignment tasks. We find that the transformer embeds the task function learned from demonstrations into the separator token representation, which plays an important role in the generation of prior response tokens. Once the prior response tokens are determined, the demonstrations become redundant. Motivated by this finding, we propose an efficient Progressive In-Context Alignment (PICA) method consisting of two stages. In the first few-shot stage, the model generates several prior response tokens via standard ICL while concurrently extracting the ICL vector that stores the task function from the separator token representation. In the following zero-shot stage, this ICL vector guides the model to generate responses without further demonstrations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our PICA not only surpasses vanilla ICL but also achieves comparable performance to other alignment tuning methods. The proposed training-free method reduces the time cost (e.g., 5.45×) with improved alignment performance (e.g., 6.57+). Consequently, our work highlights the application of ICL for alignment and calls for a deeper understanding of ICL for complex generations",

Extensive studies across different research focuses, different personality psychometrics, and different LLMs make it challenging to have a holistic overview and further pose difficulties in applying findings to real-world applications. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review by categorizing current studies into three research problems: self-assessment, exhibition, and recognition, based on the intrinsic characteristics and external manifestations of personality in LLMs. For each problem, we provide a thorough analysis and conduct in-depth comparisons of their corresponding solutions. Besides, we summarize research findings and open challenges from current studies and further discuss their underlying causes. We also collect extensive publicly available resources to facilitate interested researchers and developers. Lastly, we discuss the potential future research directions and application scenarios.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly prevalent in our daily lives, leading to an expectation for LLMs to be trustworthy ---- both accurate and well-calibrated (the prediction confidence should align with its ground truth correctness likelihood). Nowadays, fine-tuning has become the most popular method for adapting a model to practical usage by significantly increasing accuracy on downstream tasks. Despite the great accuracy it achieves, we found fine-tuning is still far away from satisfactory trustworthiness due to \"tuning-induced mis-calibration\". In this paper, we delve deeply into why and how mis-calibration exists in fine-tuned models, and how distillation can alleviate the issue. Then we further propose a brand new method named Efficient Trustworthy Distillation (FIRST), which utilizes a small portion of teacher's knowledge to obtain a reliable language model in a cost-efficient way. Specifically, we identify the \"concentrated knowledge\" phenomenon during distillation, which can significantly reduce the computational burden. Then we apply a \"trustworthy maximization\" process to optimize the utilization of this small portion of concentrated knowledge before transferring it to the student. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, where better accuracy (+2.3\\%) and less mis-calibration (-10\\%) are achieved on average across both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, indicating better trustworthiness",

Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has been a widely-used and effective method for fine-tuning LLMs. However, LoRA alone exhibits limited benefits when confronted with multi-task or multi-domain scenarios. Given the prevalent existence of multi-domain challenges in machine translation, this paper focuses on enhancing the Multi-Domain Translation Capabilities of LLMs. We extend LoRA to Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, defined as MoE-LoRA, to address domain conflicts in multi-domain settings. Our approach involves introducing MoE-LoRA solely at higher layers to target specific domain-related knowledge acquisition, preceded by General Cross-Lingual Alignment during the training process. Particularly, we propose a methodology called Expert Margin Optimization to facilitate the transfer of additional knowledge from other domains to enhance the inputs specific to a domain.

Activation sparsification can mitigate these challenges by reducing the number of activated neurons during inference.

Existing susceptibility studies heavily rely on self-reported beliefs, which can be subject to bias, expensive to collect, and challenging to scale for downstream applications. To address these limitations, in this work, we propose a computational approach to efficiently model users' latent susceptibility levels. As shown in previous work, susceptibility is influenced by various factors (e.g., demographic factors, political ideology), and directly influences people's reposting behavior on social media. To represent the underlying mental process, our susceptibility modeling incorporates these factors as inputs, guided by the supervision of people's sharing behavior. Using COVID-19 as a testbed, our experiments demonstrate a significant alignment between the susceptibility scores estimated by our computational modeling and human judgments, confirming the effectiveness of this latent modeling approach. Furthermore, we apply our model to annotate susceptibility scores on a large-scale dataset and analyze the relationships between susceptibility with various factors. Our analysis reveals that political leanings, etc., psychological factors exhibit varying degrees of association with susceptibility to COVID-19 misinformation, and shows that susceptibility is unevenly distributed across different professional and geographical backgrounds",

This process involves abstracting specific instances into higher-level concepts and forming abstract knowledge that can be applied in unfamiliar or novel situations, which can enhance models' inferential capabilities and support the effective transfer of knowledge across various domains. Despite its significance, there is currently a lack of a systematic overview that comprehensively examines existing works in the definition, execution, and application of conceptualization to enhance reasoning tasks. In this paper, we address this gap by presenting the first comprehensive survey of 150+ papers, categorizing various definitions, resources, methods, and downstream applications related to conceptualization into a unified taxonomy, with a focus on the entity and event levels.

We compare the performance of 4 state of the art LLMs on the benchmark, analyzing their performance in dependence of the length of the event sequence considered as well as of the explicitness of the temporal reference.

Recent language models still have much room for improvement in their data efficiency compared to humans. In this paper, we investigate whether language models efficiently use indirect data (indirect evidence), from which they infer sentence acceptability. In contrast, humans use indirect evidence efficiently, which is considered one of the inductive biases contributing to efficient language acquisition. To explore this question, we inject synthetic instances with newly coined \"wug\" words into pretraining data and explore the model's behavior on evaluation data that assess grammatical acceptability regarding those words. We prepare the injected instances by varying their levels of indirectness and quantity. Our experiments surprisingly show that language models do not acquire grammatical knowledge even after repeated exposure to instances with the same structure but differing only in lexical items from evaluation instances in certain language phenomena. Our findings suggest a potential direction for future research: developing models that use latent indirect evidence to acquire grammatical knowledge",

    "title": "Model Tells Itself Where to Attend: Faithfulness Meets Automatic Attention Steering",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various real-world tasks. However, recent studies reveal that LLMs often struggle to fully comprehend and effectively utilize their input contexts, resulting in responses that lack faithfulness or suffer from hallucination. This difficulty becomes particularly evident when the contexts are lengthy or contain distracting information, which can divert LLMs from fully capturing essential evidence. Most prior work focuses on designing effective prompts to guide LLMs in utilizing contextual information more faithfully. For instance, iterative prompting highlights key information through two high-level prompting steps that first ask the LLM to identify important pieces of context and then derive answers accordingly. However, prompting methods are constrained to highlighting key information implicitly in token space, which is often insufficient to fully steer the model's attention. To improve model faithfulness more reliably, we propose AutoPASTA, a method that automatically identifies contextual key information and explicitly highlights it by steering the model's attention scores. Similar to prompting, AutoPASTA is applied at inference time and does not require changing any model parameters. Our experiments on open-book QA demonstrate that AutoPASTA can effectively guide models to grasp essential contextual information, leading to substantially improved model faithfulness and performance, e.g., an average improvement of 11.26% for LLAMA3-8B-Instruct.

To fill this gap, we dissect DPR into two key attributes, i.e., the psychologist's empathy and proactive guidance. We thus present WundtGPT, an empathetic and proactive mental health large language model that is acquired by fine-tuning it with instruction and real conversation between psychologists and patients. It is designed to assist psychologists in diagnosis and help patients who are reluctant to communicate face-to-face understand their psychological conditions. Its uniqueness lies in that it could not only pose purposeful questions to guide patients in detailing their symptoms but also offer warm emotional reassurance. In particular, WundtGPT incorporates \\textbf{Collection of Questions}, \\textbf{Chain of Psychodiagnosis}, and \\textbf{Empathy Constraints} into a comprehensive prompt for eliciting LLMs' questions and diagnoses. Additionally, WundtGPT proposes a reward model to promote alignment with empathetic mental health professionals, which encompasses two key factors: cognitive empathy and emotional empathy.

    "abstract": "Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) pre-trained by next token prediction are inherently proficient in generative tasks. However, their performance on knowledge-driven tasks such as factual knowledge querying remains unsatisfactory. Knowledge graphs (KGs), as high-quality structured knowledge bases, can provide reliable knowledge for LLMs, potentially compensating for their knowledge deficiencies. Aligning LLMs with explicit, structured knowledge from KGs has been a challenge; previous attempts either failed to effectively align knowledge representations or compromised the generative capabilities of LLMs, leading to less-than-optimal outcomes. This paper proposes \\textbf{KaLM}, a \\textit{Knowledge-aligned Language Modeling} approach, which fine-tunes autoregressive LLMs to align with KG knowledge via the joint objective of explicit knowledge alignment and implicit knowledge alignment. The explicit knowledge alignment objective aims to directly optimize the knowledge representation of LLMs through dual-view knowledge graph contrastive learning. The implicit knowledge alignment objective focuses on incorporating textual patterns of knowledge into LLMs through triple completion language modeling.

Combined with improved state space modeling techniques, fMRLRec scales to different dimensions and only requires one-time training to produce multiple models tailored to various granularities.

Furthermore, comprehensive analysis under the framework inspired the development of Confidence-guided Fact-level self-correction (ConFact), which uses high-confidence facts within a response as additional knowledge to improve low-confidence ones.

In this work, we address the limitations of prior discrete diffusion models for conditional long-text generation, particularly in long sequence-to-sequence tasks such as abstractive summarization. Despite fast decoding speeds compared to autoregressive methods, previous diffusion models failed on the abstractive summarization task due to the incompatibility between the backbone architectures and the random noising process. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel semantic-aware noising process that enables Transformer backbones to handle long sequences effectively. Additionally, we propose CrossMamba, an adaptation of the Mamba model to the encoder-decoder paradigm, which integrates seamlessly with the random absorbing noising process. Our approaches achieve state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark summarization datasets: Gigaword, CNN/DailyMail, and Arxiv, outperforming existing discrete diffusion models on ROUGE metrics as well as possessing much faster speed in inference compared to autoregressive models",

    "abstract": "Tokenization is a critical step in every NLP system, yet most works treat it as an isolated component separate from the models they are building. In this paper, we present a framework to jointly learn next-token prediction and segmentation from a sequence of characters or bytes. We evaluate our model on language modeling benchmarks in English, Chinese, and Japanese using both character and byte vocabularies. Our model consistently outperforms baselines on Chinese benchmarks with character vocabulary and shows significant improvements with byte vocabulary. Further latency improvements are achieved by adapting different pooling strategies while maintaining comparable results to the best models. Our main contributions are threefold: we propose a language model that learns to segment the input sequence, conforming to the desired segmentation prior; we demonstrate that our model achieves shorter latency than baselines in token generation; and we show that our model can be applied to three different languages—English, Chinese, and Japanese—demonstrating its potential for wider NLP applications.

Meanwhile, building high-quality benchmarks with much longer text lengths and more demanding tasks to provide comprehensive evaluations is of immense practical interest to facilitate long context understanding research of LLMs. However, prior benchmarks create datasets that ostensibly cater to long-text comprehension by expanding the input of traditional tasks, which falls short to exhibit the unique characteristics of long-text understanding, including long dependency tasks and longer text length compatible with modern LLMs' context window size. In this paper, we introduce a benchmark for extremely long context understanding with long-range dependencies, XL$^2$Bench, which includes three scenarios—Fiction Reading, Paper Reading, and Law Reading—and four tasks of increasing complexity: Memory Retrieval, Detailed Understanding, Overall Understanding, and Open-ended Generation, covering 27 subtasks in English and Chinese. It has an average length of 100K+ words (English) and 200K+ characters (Chinese). Evaluating seven leading LLMs on XL$^2$Bench, we find that their performance significantly lags behind human levels.

Traditional methods often segment sequence into chunks and compress them iteratively with fixed-size memory. However, our empirical analysis shows that the fixed-size memory results in wasted computational and GPU memory resources. Therefore, we introduces Incremental Memory (IM), a method that starts with a small memory size and gradually increases it, optimizing computational efficiency. Additionally, we propose Decremental Chunk based on Incremental Memory (IMDC), which reduces chunk size while increasing memory size, ensuring stable and lower GPU memory usage. Our experiments demonstrate that IMDC is consistently faster (1.45x) and reduces GPU memory consumption by 23.3\\% compared to fixed-size memory, achieving comparable performance on the LongBench Benchmark",

Prior approaches have failed to impart the human-desirable properties within an opinion summary. Recently, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become a dominant strategy in aligning Language Models (LMs) with human values. This motivates us to leverage RLHF for our task. The key to the strategy is learning a reward model ($\\varphi$), which can reflect the latent reward model of humans. The training process for $\\varphi$ requires sizeable human preference data, usually in the order of tens of thousands. However, human goals are subjective, and vary from task-to-task, hindering us from using a general purpose off-the-shelf reward model. This necessitates a large-scale preference annotation for our task, which is expensive and time-consuming.

    "abstract": "Recently, very large language models (LLMs) have shown exceptional performance on several English NLP tasks with just in-context learning (ICL), but their utility in other languages is still underexplored. We investigate their effectiveness for NLP tasks in low-resource languages (LRLs), especially in the setting of *zero-labelled* cross-lingual transfer (0-CLT), where no labelled training data for the target language is available -- however training data from one or more related medium-resource languages (MRLs) is utilized, alongside the available unlabeled test data for a target language. We introduce Self-Supervised Prompting (SSP), a novel ICL approach tailored for the 0-CLT setting. SSP is based on the key observation that LLMs output more accurate labels if in-context exemplars are from the target language (even if their labels are slightly noisy). To operationalize this, since target language training data is not available in 0-CLT, SSP operates in two stages. In Stage I, using source MRL training data, target language's test data is noisily labeled. In Stage II, these noisy test data points are used as exemplars in ICL for further improved labelling. Additionally, our implementation of SSP uses a novel Integer Linear Programming (ILP)-based exemplar selection that balances similarity, prediction confidence (when available) and label coverage. Experiments on three tasks and eleven LRLs (from three regions) demonstrate that SSP strongly outperforms existing SOTA fine-tuned and prompting-based baselines in 0-CLT setup",

This finding is generalizable across models and languages and is more evident in larger models.

    "abstract": "Commonsense Knowledge Bases (CSKB) Population, which aims at automatically expanding knowledge in CSKBs with external resources, is an important yet hard task in NLP. Fang et al. (2021a) proposed a CSKB Population (CKBP) framework with an evaluation set CKBP v1. However, CKBP v1 relies on crowdsourced annotations that suffer from a considerable number of mislabeled answers, and the evaluation set lacks alignment with the external knowledge source due to random sampling. In this paper, we introduce CKBP v2, a new high-quality CSKB Population evaluation set that addresses the two aforementioned issues by employing domain experts as annotators and incorporating diversified adversarial samples to make the evaluation data more representative. We show that CKBP v2 serves as a challenging and representative evaluation dataset for the CSKB Population task, while its development set aids in selecting a population model that leads to improved knowledge acquisition for downstream commonsense reasoning. A better population model can also help acquire more informative commonsense knowledge as additional supervision signals for both generative commonsense inference and zero-shot commonsense question answering. Specifically, the question-answering model based on DeBERTa-v3-large (He et al., 2023b) even outperforms powerful large language models in a zero-shot setting, including ChatGPT and GPT-3.5",

However, the collection and curation of high-quality training data requires significant costs and time investment, especially for collecting user-related information. In this paper we explore the usefulness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating synthetic documents tailored to user's personal interests using user-related information. We introduce a new dataset, Sy-SE-PQA, to study the effectiveness of models fine-tuned on LLM-generated data and study how the complexity of personalization impacts model performances. We build Sy-SE-PQA based on an existing dataset, SE-PQA, which consists of questions and answers posted on the popular StackExchange communities. Starting from questions in SE-PQA, we generate synthetic answers using different prompt techniques and LLMs. Our findings suggest that LLMs have high potential in generating training data, tailored to user's needs, for neural retrieval models and it can be used to replace training data.

However, in Chinese, existing GEC datasets often fail to consider the importance of specific grammatical error types within compositional scenarios, lack research on data collected from native Chinese speakers, and largely overlook cross-sentence grammatical errors. Furthermore, the measurement of the overall fluency of an essay is often overlooked. To address these issues, we present CEFA (Chinese Essay Fluency Assessment), an extensive corpus that is derived from essays authored by native Chinese-speaking primary and secondary students and encapsulates essay fluency scores along with both coarse and fine-grained grammatical error types and corrections. Experiments employing various benchmark models on CEFA substantiate the challenging nature of our dataset. Our findings further highlight the significance of fine-grained annotations in fluency assessment and the mutually beneficial relationship between error types and corrections.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit various emergent abilities. Among these abilities, some might reveal the internal working mechanisms of models. In this paper, we uncover a novel emergent capability in models: the intrinsic ability to perform extended sequences of calculations without relying on chain-of-thought step-by-step solutions. Remarkably, the most advanced models are capable of directly outputting the results of two-digit number additions with lengths extending up to 15 addends. We hypothesize that the model emerges discrete representations of symbols within its hidden states and performs symbolic calculations internally. To test this hypothesis, we design a sequence of experiments that look into the hidden states. Specifically, we first confirm that Implicit Discrete State Representations (IDSRs) exist. Then, we provide interesting observations about the formation of IDSRs from layer, digit, and sequence perspectives. Finally, we confirm that models indeed use IDSRs to produce the final answers. However, we also discover that the state representations are far from lossless in current open-sourced models, leading to inaccuracies in final performance.

Recognizing and managing such scenarios is crucial for LLMs to ensure their reliability, but this exploration remains understudied. This study examines whether LLMs can identify incomplete conditions and appropriately determine when to refrain from using tools. To this end, we address a dataset by manipulating instances from two datasets by removing necessary tools or essential information for tool invocation. We confirm that most LLMs are challenged to identify the additional information required to utilize specific tools and the absence of appropriate tools.

    "abstract": "Pretrained language models memorize vast amounts of information, including private and copyrighted data, raising significant safety concerns. Retraining these models after excluding sensitive data is prohibitively expensive, making machine unlearning a viable, cost-effective alternative. Previous research has focused on machine unlearning for monolingual models, but we find that unlearning in one language does not necessarily transfer to others. This vulnerability makes models susceptible to low-resource language attacks, where sensitive information remains accessible in less dominant languages. This paper presents a pioneering approach to machine unlearning for multilingual language models, selectively erasing information across different languages while maintaining overall performance. Specifically, our method employs an adaptive unlearning scheme that assigns language-dependent weights to address different language performances of multilingual language models. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework compared to existing unlearning baselines, setting a new standard for secure and adaptable multilingual language models",

    "abstract": "Interactive storytelling between parents and children is a common activity in the real world, in which parents expect to teach children both language skills and real-world knowledge beyond the story narratives. While increasing AI-assisted storytelling systems have been developed and used in children's story-based interaction and learning scenarios, existing systems often fall short of generating real-world knowledge infused conversation to meet parents' practical expectation of interactive storytelling, with the foremost reason of existing question-answering (QA) datasets these systems build on focusing mainly on the knowledge answerable within the story content. To bridge this gap, we designed an annotation framework empowered by real-world knowledge graph to facilitate experts' annotations while collecting their mental procedures. Further, we leveraged this annotation framework to build StorySpark, a dataset of 5,868 expert-annotated QA pairs with real-world knowledge beyond story context. A comprehensive benchmarking experiment, including both automated and human expert evaluation within various QA pair generation (QAG) settings, demonstrates the usability of our StorySpark on the story-based knowledgeable QAG task.

However, their low interpretability often leads to errors in unforeseen circumstances, limiting their utility. Many works have focused on creating comprehensive evaluation systems, but previous benchmarks have primarily assessed problem-solving abilities while neglecting the response's uncertainty, which may result in unreliability. Recent methods for measuring LLM reliability are resource-intensive and unable to test black-box models. To address this, we propose UBENCH, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLM reliability. UBENCH includes 3,978 multiple-choice questions covering knowledge, language, understanding, and reasoning abilities. Experimental results show that UBENCH has achieved state-of-the-art performance, while its single-sampling method significantly saves computational resources compared to baseline methods that require multiple samplings. Additionally, based on UBENCH, we evaluate the reliability of 15 popular LLMs, finding GLM4 to be the most outstanding, closely followed by GPT-4.

Weight quantization is an effective technique for reducing the decoding latency and memory requirements of LLMs. Existing approaches primarily aim to maintain the quality of quantized models by preserving outliers in input features, but they still suffer significant quality loss at lower bit widths. Our approach builds on Optimal Brain Quantization (OBQ), an iterative weight-update-based quantization framework. We identify a key limitation of OBQ, specifically that its uniform quantization grid is suboptimal for maintaining model quality, as it introduces large errors to the task loss.

    "abstract": "Despite recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), their performance on tasks involving long contexts remains sub-optimal. In-Context Learning (ICL) with few-shot examples may be an appealing solution to enhance LLM performance in this scenario too. However, na\\\"ively adding ICL examples with long context faces challenges, including domain shifts between demonstrations and the target query and substantial token overhead added for each example. In this work, we propose to automatically generate few-shot examples for long context QA tasks by recycling contexts. Specifically, given a long input context (1-3k tokens) and a query, we generate additional query-output pairs from the given context as few-shot examples. This ensures that the demonstrations come from the same domain as the target query and only add a small number of tokens to the prompt. Furthermore, we enhance each demonstration example by instructing the model to \\textit{explicitly} identify the relevant paragraphs before the answer. This approach acts as a structured Chain of Thought and provides fine-grained attribution to the answer. We apply our method on multiple models and obtain a substantial improvement on various QA datasets with long context, especially when the answer lies within the middle of the text. Surprisingly, despite introducing only single-passage ICL examples, LLMs successfully generalize to multi-hop long-context QA using our approach",

Specifically, LLMs should refuse to answer unsafe tool use relevant instructions and insecure tool responses to ensure their reliability and harmlessness.

To tackle these challenges, this paper introduces Graph Memory-based Editing for Large Language Models (GMeLLo), a straitforward and effective method that merges the explicit knowledge representation of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) with the linguistic flexibility of LLMs. Beyond merely leveraging LLMs for question answering, GMeLLo employs these models to convert free-form language into structured queries and fact triples, facilitating seamless interaction with KGs for rapid updates and precise multi-hop reasoning. Our results show that GMeLLo significantly surpasses current state-of-the-art knowledge editing methods in the multi-hop question answering benchmark, MQuAKE, especially in scenarios with extensive knowledge edits",

Poetry is a lightning rod for the marketing and popular imagination of LLM capabilities because it is a signifier of human creativity and complexity, as well as a popular and culturally significant art form. But what do LLMs really know about poetry? What can they know about poetry? We develop a task to evaluate how well LLMs recognize one aspect of English-language poetry, poetic form, which captures many different poetic features, including rhyme scheme, meter, and word or line repetition. We use this task to reflect on LLMs' current poetic capabilities, as well as the challenges and pitfalls of creating NLP benchmarks for poetry and for other creative tasks. In particular, we use this task to audit and reflect on the poems included in popular pretraining datasets. Our findings have implications for NLP researchers interested in model evaluation, digital humanities and cultural analytics research, and cultural heritage collections",

    "title": "Enhancing Controllable Generation with Improved Control Module Representations",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Controllable generation (CG) has been widely used in large language models (LLMs) for a wide range of language tasks, such as multi-task learning and human preference alignment. For example, prompt-based CG uses curated prompts as inputs (such as system prompts) to control LLMs behaviors. Finetuning-based CG is widely adopted when training data is available; it trains control modules and controls LLM behaviors by plugging these modules into LLMs (e.g., trainable prompts or LoRA weights). Finetuning-based CG can freeze LLMs and only train control modules for efficiency or train LLMs together with control models for effectiveness. We argue that fine-tuning control modules together with LLMs directly is not the optimal optimization strategy since their representations are often initialized irrelevantly to LLMs' representations, which adds more difficulty for optimization. A better optimization should first align control modules with the LLM's representation space and then optimize them together. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective Two-step Freezing-then-Tuning framework (TFT) to achieve better optimization results for finetuning-based CG. Concretely, we first freeze LLMs and only optimize control modules to align their representations with LLMs, and then optimize control modules together with LLMs to ensure performance. Experiment results on two popular human preference alignment datasets and one multi-task learning dataset show that our approach significantly improves the controllable generation qualities compared with one-step optimization widely used in related works, and achieves better or on-par performance compared with other kinds of baselines, such as direct preference optimization",

    "abstract": "Text-to-SQL parsing involves the translation of natural language queries (NLQs) into their corresponding SQL commands. A principal challenge within this domain is the formulation of SQL queries that are not only syntactically correct but also semantically aligned with the natural language input. However, the intrinsic disparity between the NLQ and the SQL poses a significant challenge. In this research, we introduce Keyword Instruction (KeyInst), a novel method designed to enhance SQL formulation by Large Language Models (LLMs). KeyInst essentially provides guidance on pivotal SQL keywords likely to be part of the final query, thus facilitates a smoother SQL query formulation process. We explore two strategies for integrating KeyInst into Text-to-SQL parsing: a pipeline strategy and a single-pass strategy. The former first generates KeyInst for question, which are then used to prompt LLMs. The latter employs a fine-tuned model to concurrently generate KeyInst and SQL in one step. We developed StrucQL, a benchmark specifically designed for the evaluation of SQL formulation. Extensive experiments on StrucQL and other benchmarks demonstrate that KeyInst significantly improves upon the existing Text-to-SQL prompting techniques",

Despite its critical role in model performance, ensuring the quality of this data is challenging due to its sheer volume and the absence of sample-level quality annotations and enhancements. In this paper, we introduce DecorateLM, a data engineering method designed to refine the pretraining corpus through data rating, tagging and editing. Specifically, DecorateLM rates texts against quality criteria, tags texts with hierarchical labels, and edits texts into a more formalized format. Due to the massive size of the pretraining corpus, adopting an LLM for decorating the entire corpus is less efficient. Therefore, to balance performance with efficiency, we curate a meticulously annotated training corpus for DecorateLM using a large language model and distill data engineering expertise into a compact 1.2 billion parameter small language model (SLM). We then apply DecorateLM to enhance 100B billion tokens of the training corpus, selecting 45 billion tokens that exemplify high quality and diversity for the further training of another 1.2 billion parameter LLM. Our results demonstrate that employing such high-quality data can significantly boost model performance, showcasing a powerful approach to enhance the quality of the pretraining corpus",

    "abstract": "Recently, there has been a surge in deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) for decision-making tasks, such as income prediction and crime risk assessments. Due to bias in the pre-training data, LLMs generally present unfairness and discrimination against underprivileged groups. However, traditional fairness enhancement methods are generally impractical for LLMs due to the computational cost of fine-tuning and the black-box nature of powerful LLMs. To deal with this, In-Context Learning (ICL) offers a promising strategy for enhancing LLM fairness through input-output pairs, without the need for extensive retraining. Nevertheless, the efficacy of ICL is hindered by the inherent bias in both data and the LLM itself, leading to the potential exaggeration of existing societal disparities. In this study, we investigate the unfairness problem in LLMs and propose a novel demonstration selection strategy to address data and model biases when applying ICL.

However, this approach restricts LLMs to local performance improvements, neglecting global algorithmic innovation. Therefore, we adopt a completely different perspective by reconstructing the optimization pairs into a problem-oriented approach. This allows for the integration of various ingenious ideas from different programmers tackling the same problem. Experimental results demonstrate that adapting LLMs to problem-oriented optimization pairs significantly enhances their optimization capabilities. Meanwhile, we identified performance bottlenecks within the problem-oriented perspective.

Surprisingly, these safety patterns function as \"keys'' (used as a metaphor for security defense capability) that can be used to open or lock Pandora's Box of LLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the robustness of LLMs against jailbreaking can be lessened or augmented by attenuating or strengthening the identified safety patterns.

To facilitate chart-based reasoning using natural language, various downstream tasks have been introduced recently such as chart question answering, chart summarization, and fact-checking with charts. These tasks pose a unique challenge, demanding both vision-language reasoning and a nuanced understanding of chart data tables, visual encodings, and natural language instructions. Despite the recent success of Large Language Models (LLMs) across diverse NLP tasks, their abilities and limitations in the realm of data visualization remain under-explored, possibly due to their lack of multi-modal capabilities. To bridge the gap, this paper presents one of the first comprehensive evaluations of the recently developed large vision language models (LVLMs) for chart understanding and reasoning tasks. Our evaluation includes a comprehensive assessment of both closed and open-sourced LVLMs across five major chart reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we perform a qualitative evaluation of LVLMs' performance on a diverse range of charts, aiming to provide a thorough analysis.

Such a system would reduce the burden on clinicians, who must otherwise rely on transcribing video recordings and checking them manually for signs of interference. We release a new, expert-annotated dataset for this task, and evaluate multiple state-of-the-art large language models.

In this work, we investigate the relationship between pre-training and fine-tuning by fine-tuning multiple intermediate pre-trained model checkpoints, we find that i) continual pre-training improves the model in a latent way that unveils after fine-tuning; ii) with extra fine-tuning, the datasets that the model does not demonstrate capability gain much more than those that the model performs well during the pre-training stage; iii) although model benefits significantly through supervised fine-tuning, it may forget previously known domain knowledge and the tasks that are not seen during fine-tuning; iv) the supervised fine-tuned model resembles high sensitivity to few-shot evaluation prompts, but this sensitivity can be alleviated by more pre-training",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "The security of multi-turn conversational large language models (LLMs) is understudied despite it being one of the most popular LLM utilization. Specifically, LLMs are vulnerable to data poisoning backdoor attacks, where an adversary manipulates the training data to cause the model to output malicious responses to predefined triggers. Specific to the multi-turn dialogue setting, LLMs are at the risk of even more harmful and stealthy backdoor attacks where the backdoor triggers may span across multiple utterances, giving lee-way to context-driven attacks. In this paper, we explore a novel distributed backdoor trigger attack that serves to be an extra tool in an adversary's toolbox that can interface with other single-turn attack strategies in a plug and play manner. Results on two representative defense mechanisms indicate that distributed backdoor triggers are robust against existing defense strategies which are designed for single-turn user-model interactions, motivating us to propose a new defense strategy for the multi-turn dialogue setting that is more challenging. To this end, we also explore a novel contrastive decoding based defense that is able to mitigate the backdoor with a low computational tradeoff",

    "title": "EPT: Explosive Prompt Tuning For Parameter-Efficient with Large Norm Prompt",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Prompt tuning introduces additional learnable tokens, known as $\\textit{soft prompts}$, to frozen pre-trained language models for parameter-efficient tuning. Unlike fine-tuning, only these soft prompts are trained on downstream tasks rather than all model parameters. While recent prompt tuning approaches that introduce a reparameterization network have shown comparable performance to fine-tuning, they still require a large number of parameters for the soft prompts. In this paper, we empirically show the characteristics of the recent prompt tuning methods, such as the large norm of trained soft prompts and their significant similarity to each other. Inspired by these observations, we propose simple yet effective modifications to the reparameterization network for efficient prompt tuning, which involves inducing large norm, replacing overparameterization with under-parameterization, and focusing on a single prompt. This approach preserves the advantageous characteristics of the soft prompts while significantly reducing the number of parameters. Our comprehensive experiments across 21 diverse NLP datasets show that our method called EPT: Explosive Prompt Tuning, significantly outperforms prompt Tuning and achieves comparable performance full fine-tuning or other parameter-efficient tuning, with only 2.3K parameters during training on T5-base",

Unlike existing methods that primarily focus on the final activation state, InternalInspector conducts a comprehensive analysis across all internal states of every layer to accurately identify both correct and incorrect prediction processes. By benchmarking InternalInspector against existing confidence estimation methods across various natural language understanding and generation tasks, including factual question answering, commonsense reasoning, and reading comprehension, InternalInspector achieves significantly higher accuracy in aligning the estimated confidence scores with the correctness of the LLM's predictions and lower calibration error. Furthermore, InternalInspector excels at HaluEval, a hallucination detection benchmark, outperforming other internal-based confidence estimation methods in this task",

With the advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), many researchers have employed LLMs as the ESC models. However, the evaluation of these LLM-based ESCs remains uncertain. In detail, we first re-organize 2,801 role-playing cards from seven existing datasets to define the roles of the role-playing agent. Second, we train a specific role-playing model called ESC-Role which behaves more like a confused person than GPT-4. Third, through ESC-Role and organized role cards, we systematically conduct experiments using 14 LLMs as the ESC models, including general AI-assistant LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT) and ESC-oriented LLMs (e.g., ExTES-Llama). We conduct comprehensive human annotations on interactive multi-turn dialogues of different ESC models. The results show that ESC-oriented LLMs exhibit superior ESC abilities compared to general AI-assistant LLMs, but there is still a gap behind human performance.

However, data generation at scale using a teacher LLM can be costly, and full finetuning can be computationally expensive. To address this, we introduce Self–Boost, an iterative data augmentation and instruction finetuning strategy that has no external dependence on any teacher models. Self–Boost uses parameter efficient finetuning (PEFT) with Llama 3 8B to instruction finetune a model using the seed data, uses the same model to generate examples similar to the misclassifications, and also the same model to verify and filter the generated examples.

    "abstract": "Large language models have become increasingly prominent, also signaling a shift towards multimodality as the next frontier in artificial intelligence, where their embeddings are harnessed as prompts to generate textual content. Vision-language models (VLMs) stand at the forefront of this advancement, offering innovative ways to combine visual and textual data for enhanced understanding and interaction. However, this integration also enlarges the attack surface. Patch-based adversarial attack is considered the most realistic threat model in physical vision applications, as demonstrated in many existing literature. In this paper, we propose to address patched visual prompt injection, where adversaries exploit adversarial patches to generate target content in VLMs. Our investigation reveals that patched adversarial prompts exhibit sensitivity to pixel-wise randomization, a trait that remains robust even against adaptive attacks designed to counteract such defenses. Leveraging this insight, we introduce SmoothVLM, a defense mechanism rooted in smoothing techniques, specifically tailored to protect VLMs from the threat of patched visual prompt injectors. Our framework significantly lowers the attack success rate to a range between 0% and 5.0% on two leading VLMs, while achieving around 67.3% to 95.0% context recovery of the benign images, demonstrating a balance between security and usability",

This task is crucial for promoting consistent judgments in similar cases, effectively enhancing judicial fairness and improving work efficiency for judges. However, existing works face two main challenges for real-world applications: existing works mainly focus on case-to-case retrieval using lengthy queries, which does not match real-world scenarios; and the limited data scale, with current datasets containing only hundreds of queries, is insufficient to satisfy the training requirements of existing data-hungry neural models. To address these issues, we introduce an automated method to construct synthetic query-candidate pairs and build the largest LCR dataset to date, LEAD, which is hundreds of times larger than existing datasets. This data construction method can provide ample training signals for LCR models. Experimental results demonstrate that model training with our constructed data can achieve state-of-the-art results on two widely-used LCR benchmarks. Besides, the construction method can also be applied to civil cases and achieve promising results. The code and dataset used in this paper will be released to promote the development of LCR",

    "abstract": "To address the issues of insufficient knowledge and hallucination in Large Language Models (LLMs), numerous studies have explored integrating LLMs with Knowledge Graphs (KGs). However, these methods are typically evaluated on conventional Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) with complete KGs, where all factual triples required for each question are entirely covered by the given KG. In such cases, LLMs primarily act as an agent to find answer entities within the KG, rather than effectively integrating the internal knowledge of LLMs and external knowledge sources such as KGs. In fact, KGs are often incomplete to cover all the knowledge required to answer questions. To simulate these real-world scenarios and evaluate the ability of LLMs to integrate internal and external knowledge, we propose leveraging LLMs for QA under Incomplete Knowledge Graph (IKGQA), where the provided KG lacks some of the factual triples for each question, and construct corresponding datasets. To handle IKGQA, we propose a training-free method called Generate-on-Graph (GoG), which can generate new factual triples while exploring KGs. Specifically, GoG performs reasoning through a Thinking-Searching-Generating framework, which treats LLM as both Agent and KG in IKGQA. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that our GoG outperforms all previous methods",

This paper proposes a novel Bayesian in-Context example Selection method (ByCS) for ICL. Extending the inference probability conditioned on in-context examples based on Bayes' theorem, ByCS focuses on the inverse inference conditioned on test input. Following the assumption that accurate inverse inference probability (likelihood) will result in accurate inference probability (posterior), in-context examples are selected based on their inverse inference results. Diverse and extensive cross-tasking and cross-modality experiments are performed with speech, text, and image examples.

To address this, we develop an \\textit{inter-member communication} mechanism that facilitates information sharing, allowing for the detection and mitigation of hallucinatory responses.

    "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) become integral to advancing NLP tasks, their sequential decoding becomes a bottleneck to achieving more efficient inference. Multi-Draft Speculative Decoding (MDSD) emerges as a promising solution, where a small draft model produces a tree of tokens with each path as a draft predicting the target LLM's outputs, which is then verified by the target LLM in parallel. However, current methods rely on Recursive Rejection Sampling (RRS) and its variants, which suffer from low acceptance rates in proceeding drafts, diminishing the merits of multiple drafts. In this work, we investigate this critical inefficiency and sub-optimality through an optimal transport (OT) formulation that aims to maximize the acceptance rate by optimizing the joint distribution $\\pi(x_{1:k},y)$ of $k$-draft tokens $x_{1:k}$ and an accepted token $y$. We show that the OT can be greatly simplified to a much smaller Linear Programming (LP) focusing on a few probabilities in $\\pi(x_{1:k},y)$. Moreover, our analysis of different choices for the marginal distribution $Q(x_{1:k})$ reveals its importance to the sampling effectiveness and efficiency. Motivated by the new insight, we introduce SpecHub, which adopts a special design of $Q(x_{1:k})$ that significantly accelerates the LP and provably achieves a higher acceptance rate than existing strategies. SpecHub can be seamlessly integrated into existing MDSD frameworks, improving their acceptance rate while only incurring linear computational overhead. In extensive experiments, Spechub consistently generates 0.05-0.27 and 0.02-0.16 more tokens per step than RRS with and without replacement and achieves equivalent batch efficiency with half as much concurrency.

Experiments on a public EEG dataset collected for six subjects with image stimuli demonstrate the efficacy of multimodal LLMs (LLaMa-v3, Mistral-v0.3, Phi-v3) validated using BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, BertScore, and GPT-4 based evaluations. This approach marks a significant advancement towards portable, low-cost \"thoughts-to-text\" technology, applicable to neuroscience and NLP",

    "title": "Towards Difficulty-Agnostic Efficient Transfer Learning for Vision-Language Models",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have demonstrated remarkable applicability across a variety of downstream tasks, including zero-shot image classification. Recently, the use of prompts or adapters for efficient transfer learning (ETL) has gained significant attention for effectively adapting to downstream tasks. However, previous studies have overlooked the challenge of varying transfer difficulty of downstream tasks. In this paper, we empirically analyze how each ETL method behaves with respect to transfer difficulty. Our observations indicate that utilizing vision prompts and text adapters is crucial for adaptability and generalizability in domains with high difficulty. Also, by applying an adaptive ensemble approach that integrates task-adapted VLMs with pre-trained VLMs and strategically leverages more general knowledge in low-difficulty and less in high-difficulty domains, we consistently enhance performance across both types of domains. Based on these observations, we propose an adaptive ensemble method that combines visual prompts and text adapters with pre-trained VLMs, tailored by transfer difficulty, to achieve optimal performance for any target domain. Upon experimenting with extensive benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms all baselines, particularly on unseen tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness",

    "title": "A Collaborative Reasoning Framework Powered by Reinforcement Learning and Large Language Models for Complex Questions Answering over Knowledge Graph",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) aims to automatically answer natural language questions by reasoning across multiple triples in knowledge graphs (KGs). Reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods are introduced to enhance model interpretability. Nevertheless, when addressing complex questions requiring long-term reasoning, the RL agent is usually misled by aimless exploration, as it lacks common learning practices with prior knowledge. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been proven to encode vast amounts of knowledge about the world and possess remarkable reasoning capabilities. However, they often encounter challenges with hallucination issues, failing to address complex questions that demand deep and deliberate reasoning. In this paper, we propose a collaborative reasoning framework (CRF) powered by RL and LLMs to answer complex questions based on the knowledge graph. Our approach leverages the common sense priors contained in LLMs while utilizing RL to provide learning from the environment, resulting in a hierarchical agent that uses LLMs to solve the complex KGQA task. By combining LLMs and the RL policy, the high-level agent accurately identifies constraints encountered during reasoning, while the low-level agent conducts efficient path reasoning by selecting the most promising relations in KG. Extensive experiments conducted on four benchmark datasets clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, which surpasses state-of-the-art approaches",

    "title": "Dual-Space Knowledge Distillation for Large Language Models",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Knowledge distillation (KD) is known as a promising solution to compress large language models (LLMs) via transferring their knowledge to smaller models. During this process, white-box KD methods usually minimize the distance between the output distributions of the two models so that more knowledge can be transferred. However, in the current white-box KD framework, the output distributions are from the respective output spaces of the two models, using their own prediction heads. We argue that the space discrepancy will lead to low similarity between the teacher model and the student model on both representation and distribution levels. Furthermore, this discrepancy also hinders the KD process between models with different vocabularies, which is common for current LLMs. To address these issues, we propose a dual-space knowledge distillation (DSKD) framework that unifies the output spaces of the two models for KD. On the basis of DSKD, we further develop a cross-model attention mechanism, which can automatically align the representations of the two models with different vocabularies. Thus, our framework is not only compatible with various distance functions for KD (e.g., KL divergence) like the current framework, but also supports KD between any two LLMs regardless of their vocabularies. Experiments on task-agnostic instruction-following benchmarks show that DSKD significantly outperforms the current white-box KD framework with various distance functions, and also surpasses existing KD methods for LLMs with different vocabularies",

This makes the migration of acceleration methods to the new model more costly and more demanding on device memory. To address this problem, we propose the Make Some Noise (MSN) training framework as a replacement for the supervised fine-tuning stage of the large language model. The training method simply introduces some noise at the input for the model to learn the denoising task. It significantly enhances the parallel decoding capability of the model without affecting the original task capability. In addition, we propose a tree-based retrieval-augmented Jacobi (TR-Jacobi) decoding strategy to further improve the inference speed of MSN models. Experiments in both the general and code domains have shown that MSN can improve inference speed by 2.3-2.7x times without compromising model performance. The MSN model also achieves comparable acceleration ratios to the SOTA model with additional model structure on Spec-Bench",

IUPAC names are widely used in the chemical literature, providing opportunities to train large language models on a vast corpus with contextual expertise. We are motivated to compare these two nomenclatures across various language-molecule scenarios.

    "abstract": "The task of text-to-table receives widespread attention, but its importance and difficulty are underestimated. Existing works use simple datasets like those from table-to-text tasks and employ methods that ignore domain structures. As a bridge between raw text and statistical analysis, the text-to-table task faces challenges from more complex semi-structured texts that refer to certain domain topics in the real world with obvious entities and events, especially from those of social sciences. In this paper, we analyse the limitation of previous datasets with methods and redefine the text-to-table task, based on which we propose a new dataset called CPL (Chinese Private Lending) of case judgments from a real world legal academic project. We further propose TKGT (Text-KG-Table), a two stages domain-aware pipeline, which firstly generates domain knowledge graphs (KGs) classes semi-automatically from raw text with the mixed information extraction (Mixed-IE) method, then adopts the hybrid retrieval augmented generation (Hybird-RAG) method to transform it to tables for downstream needs under the guidance of KGs classes.

While previous research has extensively explored AA from legal, social, and ethical aspects, there is a lack of computational work to investigate this topic from the lens of users on social media. By collecting over 2,500 posts from 23 prominent Reddit communities, our study attempts to gain a better understanding of how online users view AA. We build upon the previous work on stance detection, by introducing a new set of stance categories that can efficiently reflect a diverse range of opinions on AA. Finally, we explore the performance of three LLM-based classifiers, powered with four carefully designed prompts to classify these categories and run several analyses to enhance our understanding of the AA discourse. Our findings show that GPT-4 with instruction and examples is the most efficient for classifying stance. We found opposition towards AA more common than support in our dataset with discussions on college admission, and race more prevalent.

To bridge this gap, we propose a new cooperative multi-agent task, Kitchen-Alien Rush, which includes both out-of-domain multi-episode evaluation, as well as evaluates the effectiveness of hybrid groups in collaboration. Our findings reveal that our evaluation exposes gaps in multi-agent collaboration, as LLM agents struggle to perform in the out-of-domain task and show inconsistent improvement over multiple episodes in hybrid teams.

We propose SEAL (SEcure wAtermarking on LoRA weights), the first watermarking method tailored for LoRA weights. Unlike existing methods that focus on specific layers and are unsuitable for LoRA's unique structure, SEAL embeds a secret, non-trainable matrix between trainable LoRA weights, serving as a passport to claim ownership. SEAL then entangles this passport with the LoRA weights through finetuning, and distributes the finetuned weights after hiding the passport.

An increasing issue is LLMs generating content based on leaked data, and the need to detect and suppress such generated results, including personal information, copyrighted text, and benchmark datasets. A fundamental cause of this issue is leaked data in the training dataset. However, existing research has not sufficiently clarified the relationship between leaked instances in the training data and the ease of output and detection of these leaked instances by LLMs. In this paper, we conduct an experimental survey to elucidate the relationship between the rate of leaked instances in the training dataset and the generation and detection of LLMs in relation to the leakage of personal information, copyrighted texts, and benchmark data. Our experiments reveal that LLMs generate leaked information in most cases despite there being little such data in the training set. Furthermore, the lower the rate of leaked instances, the more difficult it becomes to detect the leakage. When addressing the leakage problem in the training dataset, we must be careful as reducing leakage instances does not necessarily lead to only positive effects. Finally, we demonstrate that explicitly defining the leakage detection task using examples in LLMs can help mitigate the impact of the rate of leakage instances in the training data on detection",

While humans struggle to optimize prompts, they are good at providing feedback about LLM outputs; we therefore introduce a new LLM-driven discrete prompt optimization framework PROMST that incorporates human-designed feedback rules to automatically offer direct suggestions for improvement. We also use an extra learned heuristic model that predicts prompt performance to efficiently sample from prompt candidates.

Despite that, recent studies have shown that these models are susceptible to jailbreak attacks, which refer to an exploitative technique where malicious users can break the safety alignment of the target model and generate misleading and harmful answers. This potential threat is caused by both the inherent vulnerabilities of LLM and the larger attack scope introduced by vision input. To enhance the security of VLMs against jailbreak attacks, researchers have developed various defense techniques. However, these methods either require modifications to the model's internal structure or demand significant computational resources during the inference phase. Multimodal information is a double-edged sword. While it increases the risk of attacks, it also provides additional data that can enhance safeguards.

A path-based reranking algorithm and a specialized prompt template further refine the diagnostic process.

To mitigate this, Post Fine-tuning, including on-policy and off-policy methods, has emerged as a solution to enhance models further, though each has its limitations regarding performance enhancements and susceptibility to overfitting. In this paper, we introduce a novel on-policy approach, called \\textbf{Evolution Strategy Optimization} (ESO), which is designed by harnessing the principle of biological evolution, namely \\emph{survival of the fittest}. Particularly, we consider model tuning as an evolution process, and each output sentence generated by the model can provide a perturbation signal to the model parameter space. Then, the fitness of perturbation signals is quantified by the difference between its score and the averaged one offered by a reward function, steering optimization process. Empirically, the proposed method can achieve superior performance in various tasks and comparable performance in the human alignment one. The code will be publicly available",

    "abstract": "It is often desirable to distill the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) into smaller student models due to compute and memory constraints. One way to do this for classification tasks is via dataset synthesis, which can be accomplished by generating examples of each label from the LLM. Prior approaches to synthesis use few-shot prompting, which relies on the LLM's parametric knowledge to generate usable examples. However, this leads to issues of repetition, bias towards popular entities, and stylistic differences from human text. In this work, we propose Synthesize by Retrieval and Refinement (SynthesizRR), which uses retrieval augmentation to introduce variety into the dataset synthesis process: as retrieved passages vary, the LLM is seeded with different content to generate its examples. We empirically study the synthesis of six datasets, covering topic classification, sentiment analysis, tone detection, and humor, requiring complex synthesis strategies. We find SynthesizRR greatly improves lexical and semantic diversity, similarity to human-written text, and distillation performance, when compared to 32-shot prompting and four prior approaches",

    "abstract": "Large Language Model (LLM) agents significantly extend the capabilities of standalone LLMs, empowering them to interact with external tools (e.g., APIs, functions) and complete various tasks in a self-directed fashion. The challenge of tool use demands that LLMs not only understand user queries and generate answers accurately but also excel in task planning, tool invocation, and result summarization. While traditional works focus on training a single LLM with all these capabilities, performance limitations become apparent, particularly with smaller models. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel approach that decomposes the aforementioned capabilities into a planner, caller, and summarizer. Each component is implemented by a single LLM that focuses on a specific capability and collaborates with others to accomplish the task. This modular framework facilitates individual updates and the potential use of smaller LLMs for building each capability. To effectively train this framework, we introduce a two-stage training paradigm. First, we fine-tune a backbone LLM on the entire dataset without discriminating sub-tasks, providing the model with a comprehensive understanding of the task. Second, the fine-tuned LLM is used to instantiate the planner, caller, and summarizer respectively, which are continually fine-tuned on respective sub-tasks. Evaluation across various tool-use benchmarks illustrates that our proposed multi-LLM framework surpasses the traditional single-LLM approach, highlighting its efficacy and advantages in tool learning",

However, they are not without risks; biases and unfairness inherent in these models could harm those who depend on them.

To bridge this research gap, we present *BajFair*, a Trojan fairness attack methodology. BaFair stealthily crafts a model that operates with accuracy and fairness under regular conditions but, when activated by certain triggers, discriminates and produces incorrect results for specific groups. This type of attack is particularly stealthy and dangerous as it circumvents existing fairness detection methods, maintaining an appearance of fairness in normal use. Our findings reveal that BaFair achieves a remarkable success rate of 88.7% in attacks aimed at targeted groups on average, while only incurring a minimal average accuracy loss of less than 1.2%.

However, it still faces resource consumption challenges during training when scaling up to larger models. Most previous studies have tackled this issue by using pruning techniques, which involve removing LoRA parameters deemed unimportant. Nonetheless, these efforts only analyze LoRA parameter features to evaluate their importance, such as parameter count, size, and gradient. In fact, the output of LoRA (product of LoRA parameter and hidden state), directly impacts the final results. Preliminary experiments indicate that a fraction of LoRA elements possesses significantly high output values, substantially influencing the layer output. Motivated by the observation, we propose LoRA-drop. Concretely, LoRA-drop evaluates the importance of LoRA based on the LoRA output. Then we retain LoRA for important layers and the other layers share the same LoRA. We conduct abundant experiments with models of different scales on NLU and NLG tasks. Results demonstrate that LoRA-drop can achieve performance comparable to full fine-tuning and LoRA, while retaining 50\\% of the LoRA parameters on average",

SkipAlign is developed on the premise that long-range dependencies are fundamental to enhancing an LLM's capacity of long context.

    "abstract": "We present Multi-expert Prompting, an enhanced extension of ExpertPrompting (Xu et al., 2023), which efficiently guides a large language model (LLM) to fulfill an input instruction by simulating multiple expert behaviors. Multi-expert Prompting synthesizes and evaluates responses from these experts, selecting the best among individual and combined responses in a coherent chain of thoughts through our seven carefully designed subtasks based on the Nominal Group Technique (Ven and Delbecq, 1974). It is the pioneer in addressing the challenge of aggregating long-form answers from LLM expert agents within a single turn. Our evaluations demonstrate that Multi-expert Prompting significantly outperforms ExpertPrompting and comparable baselines in enhancing the truthfulness, factuality, informativeness, and usefulness of responses while reducing toxicity and hurtfulness. It further achieves state-of-the-art truthfulness by outperforming the best baseline by 8.69% with ChatGPT. Moreover, it is efficient, explainable, and highly adaptable to diverse scenarios, eliminating the need for manual prompt construction",

    "abstract": "As the typical retraining paradigm is unacceptably time- and resource-consuming, researchers are turning to model editing to find an effective way that supports both consecutive and batch scenarios to edit the model behavior directly. Despite all these practical expectations, existing model editing methods fail to realize all of them. Furthermore, the memory demands for such sequential model editing approaches tend to be prohibitive, frequently necessitating an external memory that grows incrementally over time. To cope with these challenges, we propose CoachHooK, a model editing method that simultaneously supports sequential and batch editing. CoachHooK is memory-friendly as it only needs a small amount of it to store several hook layers whose size remains unchanged over time. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over other batch-supportive model editing methods under both single-round and consecutive batch editing scenarios. Extensive analyses of CoachHooK have been conducted to verify the stability of our method over 1) the number of consecutive steps and 2) the number of editing instances",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Multilingual knowledge editing (MKE) aims to simultaneously revise factual knowledge across multilingual languages within large language models (LLMs). However, most existing MKE methods just adapt existing monolingual editing methods to multilingual scenarios, overlooking the deep semantic connections of the same factual knowledge between different languages, thereby limiting edit performance. To address this issue, we first investigate how LLMs represent multilingual factual knowledge and discover that the same factual knowledge in different languages generally activates a shared set of neurons, which we call language-agnostic factual neurons. These neurons represent the semantic connections between multilingual knowledge and are mainly located in certain layers. Inspired by this finding, we propose a new MKE method by locating and modifying Language-Agnostic Factual Neurons (LAFN) to simultaneously edit multilingual knowledge. Specifically, we first generate a set of paraphrases for each multilingual knowledge to be edited to precisely locate the corresponding language-agnostic factual neurons. Then we optimize the update values for modifying these located neurons to achieve simultaneous modification of the same factual knowledge in multiple languages. Experimental results on Bi-ZsRE and MzsRE benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing MKE methods and achieves remarkable edit performance, indicating the importance of considering the semantic connections among multilingual knowledge",

Today's models mainly focus on the correspondence between images and text, using this for tasks like image captioning and image-text retrieval. However, this covers only a subset of real-world interactions. Novel interactions, such as sarcasm expressed through opposing spoken words and gestures or figurative descriptions of images, remain challenging. In this paper, we introduce an approach to enhance multimodal models, which we call Multimodal Mixtures of Experts (MMoE). The key idea in MMoE is to train separate expert models for each type of interaction, such as redundancy present in both modalities, uniqueness in one modality, or varying degrees of synergy that emerge when both modalities are fused. On two multimodal sarcasm datasets, we obtain new state-of-the-art results. MMoE also provides the opportunity to design smaller specialized experts, and improves the transparency of the modeling process",

EquiSync utilizes a multi-agent framework, incorporating three agents that employ a two-phase approach: Attributes Masking and Attributes Balancing. This method aligns with human values transparently and reduces disparities between social groups. Unlike traditional debiasing techniques, which often lead to performance degradation, EquiSync achieves substantial bias reduction while maintaining or even improving accuracy in downstream tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that EquiSync reduces bias scores by up to 87.7%, with only a marginal performance degradation of up to 6.8% in the BBQ dataset.

ICG is curious, since language models are not completely trained in the way same as the in-context prompt, and the distribution of examples in the prompt differs from that of sequences in the pretrained corpora. This paper provides a systematic study of the ICG ability of language models, covering discussions about its source and influential factors, in the view of both theory and empirical experiments. Concretely, we first propose a plausible latent variable model to describe the distribution of the pretrained corpora, and then formalize ICG as a problem of next topic prediction. With this framework, we can prove that the repetition nature of a few topics ensures the ICG ability on them theoretically. Then, we use this controllable pretrained distribution to generate several medium-scale synthetic datasets (token scale: 2.1B-3.9B) and experiment with different settings of Transformer architectures (parameter scale: 4M-234M).

This potential pitfall may arise from excessive fine-tuning on already well-aligned data, which subsequently leads to over-alignment and degeneration. To address this challenge, we propose $\\textit{FlipGuard}$, a constrained optimization approach to detect and mitigate update regression with focal attention. Specifically, FlipGuard identifies performance degradation using a customized reward characterization and strategically enforces a constraint to encourage conditional congruence with the pre-aligned model during training.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have unveiled remarkable reasoning capabilities by exploiting chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, which generates intermediate reasoning chains to serve as the rationale for deriving the answer. However, current CoT methods either simply employ general prompts such as Let's think step by step, or heavily rely on pre-defined task-specific demonstrations to attain preferable performances, thereby engendering an inescapable gap between performance and generalization. To bridge this gap, we propose GeM-CoT, a Generalizable CoT prompting mechanism in Mixed-task scenarios where the type of input questions is unknown. GeM-CoT first categorizes the question type and subsequently samples or constructs demonstrations from the corresponding data pool in an automatic pattern. With this technical design, GeM-CoT simultaneously enjoys superior generalization capabilities and remarkable performances on 10 public reasoning tasks and 23 BBH tasks",

Existing approaches mainly focus on acquiring affective and cognitive information from text, often neglecting the unique personality traits of individuals and the inherently multimodal nature of human conversation. To this end, we propose enhancing dialogue systems with the ability to generate customized empathetic responses, considering the diverse personality traits of speakers, and we advocate for the incorporation of multimodal data analysis to gain a more detailed comprehension of speakers' emotional states and context. Specifically, we initially identify the speaker's trait across the context. The dialogue system then comprehends the speaker's emotion and situation by emotion perception through the analysis of multimodal inputs. Finally, the response generator models the correlations among the captured personality, emotion, and multimodal data, thereby generating empathetic responses. Extensive experiments are conducted utilizing the MELD dataset and the IEMOCAP dataset to investigate the influence of personality traits on empathetic response generation and validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach",

    "abstract": "While large pre-trained visual-language models have shown promising results on traditional visual question answering benchmarks, it is still challenging for them to answer complex VQA problems which requires diverse world knowledge. Motivated by the research of retrieval-augmented generation in the field of natural language processing, we use Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) to retrieve related knowledge to help the model answer questions. However, DPR conduct retrieving in natural language space, which may not ensure comprehensive acquisition of image information. Thus, the retrieved knowledge is not truly conducive to helping answer the question, affecting the performance of the overall system. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework that leverages the visual-language model to select the key knowledge retrieved by DPR and answer questions. The framework consists of two modules: Selector and Answerer, where both are initialized by the MLLM and parameter-efficiently finetuned by self-bootstrapping: find key knowledge in the retrieved knowledge documents using the Selector, and then use them to finetune the Answerer to predict answers; obtain the pseudo-labels of key knowledge documents based on the predictions of the Answerer and weak supervision labels, and then finetune the Selector to select key knowledge; repeat. Our framework significantly enhances the performance of the baseline on the challenging open-domain Knowledge-based VQA benchmark, OK-VQA, achieving a state-of-the-art accuracy of 62.83\\%",

    "abstract": "Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) are central to our interaction with digital devices. Recently, growing efforts have been made to build models for various GUI understanding tasks. However, these efforts largely overlook an important GUI-referring task: screen reading based on user-indicated points, which we name the Screen Point-and-Read (SPR) task. This task is predominantly handled by rigid accessible screen reading tools, in great need of new models driven by advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). In this paper, we propose a Tree-of-Lens (ToL) agent, utilizing a novel ToL grounding mechanism, to address the SPR task. Based on the input point coordinate and the corresponding GUI screenshot, our ToL agent constructs a Hierarchical Layout Tree. Based on the tree, our ToL agent not only comprehends the content of the indicated area but also articulates the layout and spatial relationships between elements. Such layout information is crucial for accurately interpreting information on the screen, distinguishing our ToL agent from other screen reading tools. We also thoroughly evaluate the ToL agent against other baselines on a newly proposed SPR benchmark, which includes GUIs from mobile, web, and operating systems. Last but not least, we test the ToL agent on mobile GUI navigation tasks, demonstrating its utility in identifying incorrect actions along the path of agent execution trajectories",

Existing research primarily studies privacy by exploring various privacy attacks, defenses, and evaluations within narrowly predefined patterns, while neglecting that privacy is not an isolated, context-free concept limited to traditionally sensitive data (e.g., social security numbers), but intertwined with intricate social contexts that complicate the identification and analysis of potential privacy violations. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers unprecedented opportunities for incorporating the nuanced scenarios outlined in privacy laws to tackle these complex privacy issues. However, the scarcity of open-source relevant case studies restricts the efficiency of LLMs in aligning with specific legal statutes. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel framework, GoldCoin, designed to efficiently ground LLMs in privacy laws for judicial assessing privacy violations. Our framework leverages the theory of contextual integrity as a bridge, creating numerous synthetic scenarios grounded in relevant privacy statutes (e.g., HIPAA), to assist LLMs in comprehending the complex contexts for identifying privacy risks in the real world. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that GoldCoin markedly enhances LLMs' capabilities in recognizing privacy risks across real court cases, surpassing the baselines on different judicial tasks",

Having said that, LLM's capability of extracting factual information from LLMs involving LRLs is an interesting task, though not much explored. In this work, we present Indic-MULAN, a benchmark dataset to evaluate LLM's capability to extract time-aware factual knowledge involving one-to-one and one-to-many relations. Our dataset comprises 34 relations and $\\sim$30K queries covering 11 Indian languages. We experimented with two LLMs, GPT-4(proprietary) and Llama-3(open-source).

This finding has enabled a line of research on psychometric benchmarking of LLMs against human language-comprehension data in order to reverse-engineer humans' linguistic subjective probability distributions and representations. However, to date this work has exclusively involved unimodal (language-only) comprehension data, whereas much human language use takes place in rich multimodal contexts. Here we extend psychometric benchmarking to visual language models (VLMs). We develop a novel experimental paradigm, $\\text{\\emph{Image-Conditioned Maze Reading}}$, in which participants first view an image and then read a text describing an image within the Maze paradigm, yielding word-by-word reaction-time measures with high signal-to-noise ratio and good localization of expectation-driven language processing effects. We find a large facilitatory effect of correct image context on language comprehension, not only for words such as concrete nouns that are directly grounded in the image but even for ungrounded words in the image descriptions. Furthermore, we find that VLM surprisal captures most to all of this effect. We use these findings to benchmark a range of VLMs, showing that models with lower perplexity generally have better psychometric performance, but that among the best VLMs tested perplexity and psychometric performance dissociate. Overall, our work offers new possibilities for connecting psycholinguistics with multimodal LLMs for both scientific and engineering goals",

    "abstract": "Existing works show that augmenting the training data of pre-trained language models (PLMs) for classification tasks fine-tuned via parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods (PEFT) using both clean and adversarial examples can enhance their robustness under adversarial attacks. However, this adversarial training paradigm often leads to performance degradation on clean inputs and requires frequent re-training on the entire data to account for new, unknown attacks. To overcome these challenges while still harnessing the benefits of adversarial training and the efficiency of PEFT, this work proposes a novel approach, called AdpMixup, that combines two paradigms: (1) fine-tuning through adapters and (2) adversarial augmentation via mixup to dynamically leverage existing knowledge from a set of pre-known attacks for robust inference. Intuitively, AdpMixup fine-tunes PLMs with multiple adapters with both clean and pre-known adversarial examples and intelligently mixes them up in different ratios during prediction. Our experiments show AdpMixup achieves the best trade-off between training efficiency and robustness under both pre-known and unknown attacks, compared to existing baselines on five downstream tasks across six varied black-box attacks and 2 PLMs. All source code will be available",

While there has been work trying to acquire this kind of knowledge in the space of vision and language, it has mostly focused on aligning the image patches with the tokens on the language side. However, image patches do not have any meaning to the human eye, and individual tokens do not necessarily carry groundable information in the image. It is groups of tokens which describe different aspects of the scene. In this work, we propose a model which groups the caption tokens as part of its architecture in order to capture a fine-grained representation of the language. We expect our representations to be at the level of objects present in the image, and therefore align our representations with the output of an image encoder trained to discover objects. We show that by learning to group the tokens, the vision-language model has a better fine-grained understanding of vision and language. In addition, the token groups that our model discovers are highly similar to groundable phrases in text, both qualitatively and quantitatively",

On one hand, large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable versatility in various generative tasks such as writing, drawing, and question answering, significantly reducing the time required for many routine tasks. On the other hand, researchers, whose work is not only time-consuming but also highly expertise-demanding, face increasing challenges as they have to spend more time reading, writing, and reviewing papers. This raises the question: how can LLMs potentially assist researchers in alleviating their heavy workload? This study focuses on the topic of LLMs as NLP Researchers, particularly examining how effectively LLMs can perform paper (meta-)reviewing. To address this, we constructed the ReviewCritique dataset, which includes two types of information: (i) NLP papers (initial submissions rather than camera-ready) with both human-written and LLM-generated reviews, and (ii) each review comes with \"deficiency\" labels and corresponding explanations for individual segments, annotated by experts. Using ReviewCritique, this study explores two threads of research questions: (i) \"LLMs as Reviewers\", how do reviews generated by LLMs compare with those written by humans in terms of quality and distinguishability? (ii) \"LLMs as Metareviewers\", how effectively can LLMs identify potential issues, such as Deficient or unprofessional review segments, within individual paper reviews?

In this paper, we introduce a new way of diagnosing whether ICL is functionally equivalent to gradient-based learning. Our approach is based on the inverse frequency effect (IFE) -- a phenomenon in which an error-driven learner is expected to show larger updates when trained on infrequent examples than frequent ones. The IFE has previously been studied in psycholinguistics because humans show this effect in the context of structural priming (the tendency for people to produce sentence structures they have encountered recently); the IFE has been used as evidence that human structural priming must involve error-driven learning mechanisms. In our experiments, we simulated structural priming within ICL and found that LLMs display the IFE, with the effect being stronger in larger models. We conclude that ICL is indeed a type of gradient-based learning, supporting the hypothesis that a gradient component is implicitly computed in the forward pass during ICL. Our results suggest that both humans and LLMs make use of gradient-based, error-driven processing mechanisms",

Test samples produced directly by LLMs always introduce factual errors and lack diversity in the manner of knowledge expression. To overcome the drawbacks, here we propose a novel evaluation method, Predicate-text Dual Transformation (PretextTrans), by introducing predicate transformations into the dynamic evaluation schema. Specifically, each medical knowledge point is firstly transformed into a predicate expression; then, the predicate expression derives a series of variants through predicate transformations; lastly, the produced predicate variants are transformed back into textual expressions, resulting in a series of test samples with both factual reliability and expression diversity. Using the proposed PretextTrans method, we systematically investigate 12 well-known LLMs' mastery of medical factual knowledge based on two medical datasets. The comparison results show that current LLMs still have significant deficiencies in fully mastering medical knowledge, which may illustrate why current LLMs still perform unsatisfactorily in real-world medical scenarios despite having achieved considerable performance on public benchmarks.

Yet, besides NL, LLMs have seen various non-NL formats during pre-training, such as code and logical expression. NL's status as the optimal format for LLMs, particularly in single-LLM reasoning and multi-agent communication, has not been thoroughly examined. In this work, we challenge the default use of NL by exploring the utility of non-NL formats in these contexts. We show that allowing LLMs to autonomously select the most suitable format before reasoning or communicating leads to a 3.3 to 5.7\\% improvement in reasoning efficiency for different LLMs, and up to a 72.7\\% reduction in token usage in multi-agent communication, all while maintaining communicative effectiveness. Our comprehensive analysis further reveals that LLMs can devise a format from limited task instructions and that the devised format is effectively transferable across different LLMs. Intriguingly, the structured communication format decided by LLMs exhibits notable parallels with established agent communication languages, suggesting a natural evolution towards efficient, structured communication in agent communication.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Natural Language Inference (NLI) provides a general task format for evaluating the semantic relations between two pieces of text, which can be useful for various applications such as fact verification and text attribution. However, existing datasets for NLI and models trained on these datasets make assumptions about the context from which the premise and hypothesis are sampled. In this paper, we revisit this reference determinacy (RD) assumption in NLI, i.e., the premise and hypothesis are assumed to refer to the same context when human raters annotate a label. While RD is a practical assumption for constructing a new NLI dataset, we observe that current NLI models—which are typically trained solely on hypothesis-premise pairs created with the RD assumption—fail in many practical settings in which the premise and hypothesis may refer to different contexts. To highlight the impact of this phenomenon in real-world use cases, we introduce the ReFNLI, a diagnostic benchmark for identifying reference ambiguity in NLI examples. In ReFNLI, the premise is retrieved from a knowledge source (i.e., Wikipedia) and does not necessarily refer to the same context as the hypothesis. With ReFNLI, we demonstrate that finetuned NLI models and few-shot prompted LLMs both fail to recognize context mismatch, leading to > 80% false contradiction and > 50% entailment predictions. We discover that the existence of reference ambiguity in NLI examples can in part explain the inherent human disagreements in NLI, and provide insight into how the RD assumption impacts NLI dataset creation process",

    "abstract": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) evolve rapidly as Large Language Models (LLMs) was equipped with vision modules to create more human-like models. However, we should carefully evaluate their applications in different domains, as harmful biases may occur. Our work studies the potential behavioral biases of LVLMs from a behavioral finance perspective, an interdisciplinary area that jointly considers finance and psychology. We propose an end-to-end framework, from data collection to new evaluation metrics, to assess LVLM's reasoning capabilities and dynamic behaviors manifested in two established human financial behavioral biases: recency bias and authority bias. Our evaluations find that recent open-source LVLMs such as LLaVA-NeXT, MobileVLM-V2, Mini-Gemini, MiniCPM-Llama3-V 2.5 and Phi-3-vision suffer significantly from these two biases, while the proprietary model GPT-4o is negligibly impacted.

    "abstract": "Responsible use of authorship verification systems not only requires high accuracies but also interpretable solutions. Neural methods achieve high accuracies, but their representations lack direct interpretability, whereas methods using interpretable linguistic features generally perform worse than neural methods. In this paper, we introduce residualized similarity prediction (RSP), a novel method of supplementing systems using interpretable features with a neural network to improve their performance while maintaining interpretability. The key idea is to use the neural network to predict a residual similarity, i.e. the error in the similarity predicted by the interpretable system. Our evaluation on three datasets shows that using RSP improves authorship verification predictions over a fully interpretable system, multiple neural models, as well as weighted ensembles of these two (RSP yields gains in 17 of the 24 combinations), all while maintaining interpretability as measured using a new interpretability confidence metric",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Cosine similarity between two documents can be computed using token embeddings formed by Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, and used to categorize those documents across a range of uses. However, these similarities are ultimately dependent on the corpora used to train these LLMs, and may not reflect subjective similarity of individuals or how their biases and constraints impact similarity metrics. This lack of cognitively-aware personalization of similarity metrics can be particularly problematic in educational and recommendation settings where there is a limited number of individual judgements of category or preference, and biases can be particularly relevant. To address this, we rely on an integration of an Instance-Based Learning (IBL) cognitive model with LLM embeddings to develop the Instance-Based Individualized Similarity (IBIS) metric. This similarity metric is beneficial in that it takes into account individual biases and constraints in a manner that is grounded in the cognitive mechanisms of decision making. To evaluate the IBIS metric, we also introduce a dataset of human categorizations of emails as being either dangerous (phishing) or safe (ham). This dataset is used to demonstrate the benefits of leveraging a cognitive model to measure the subjective similarity of human participants in an educational setting",

To address this gap, we systematically evaluate biases across seven social factors (e.g., gender, age, religion) using ten LLMs with different prompting methods on eight diverse mental health datasets. Our results show that GPT-4 achieves the best overall balance in performance and fairness among LLMs, although it still lags behind domain-specific models like MentalRoBERTa in some cases. Additionally, our tailored fairness-aware prompts can effectively mitigate bias in mental health predictions, highlighting the great potential for fair analysis in this field",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Path planning is a fundamental scientific problem in robotics and autonomous navigation, requiring the derivation of efficient routes from starting to destination points while avoiding obstacles. Traditional algorithms like A* and its variants are capable of ensuring path validity but suffer from significant computational and memory inefficiencies as the state space grows. Conversely, large language models (LLMs) excel in broader environmental analysis through contextual understanding, providing global insights into environments. However, they fall short in detailed spatial and temporal reasoning, often leading to invalid or inefficient routes. In this work, we propose LLM-A*, an new LLM based route planning method that synergistically combines the precise pathfinding capabilities of A* with the global reasoning capability of LLMs. This hybrid approach aims to enhance pathfinding efficiency in terms of time and space complexity while maintaining the integrity of path validity, especially in large-scale scenarios. By integrating the strengths of both methodologies, LLM-A* addresses the computational and memory limitations of conventional algorithms without compromising on the validity required for effective pathfinding",

The rules we induce capture syntactic information, often not explicitly captured by state of the art neural models. While these rules can be noisy, they are used to learn a label aggregation model with data programming. Subsequently, we jointly train the base classifier along with the label aggregation model to update their parameters. Unlike, past work that employ data programming to label unlabeled data-points, we use it for verifying synthetically generated labeled data. Finally, we combine synthetic data generation and automatic rule induction, via bootstrapping, to iteratively filter the generated rules and data.

We curate a unique dataset of over 6 million game-time comments from opposing perspectives (the teams in the game), each comment grounded in a non-linguistic description of the events that precipitated these comments (live win probabilities for each team). Expert and crowd annotations justify modeling the bias through tagging of implicit and explicit referential expressions and reveal the rich, contextual understanding of language and the world required for this task. For large-scale analysis of intergroup variation, we use LLMs for automated tagging, and discover that some LLMs perform best when prompted with linguistic descriptions of the win probability at the time of the comment, rather than numerical probability. Further, large-scale tagging of comments using LLMs uncovers linear variations in the form of referent across win probabilities that distinguish in-group and out-group utterances",

One of the applications of LLMs is providing question-answering systems that cater to users from different fields. The effectiveness of LLM-based question-answering systems has already been established at an acceptable level for users posing questions in popular and public domains such as trivia and literature. However, it has not often been established in niche domains that traditionally require specialized expertise. To this end, we construct the NEPAQuAD1.0 benchmark to evaluate the performance of three frontier LLMs, Claude Sonnet, Gemini, and GPT-4, when answering questions originating from Environmental Impact Statements prepared by U.S. federal government agencies in accordance with the National Environmental Environmental Act (NEPA). We specifically measure the ability of LLMs to understand the nuances of legal, technical, and compliance-related information present in NEPA documents in different contextual scenarios. For example, we test the LLMs' internal prior NEPA knowledge by providing questions without any context, as well as assess how LLMs synthesize the contextual information present in long NEPA documents to facilitate the question/answering task. We compare the performance of the long context LLMs and RAG powered models in handling different types of questions (e.g., problem-solving, divergent). Our results suggest that RAG powered models significantly outperform the long context models in the answer accuracy regardless of the choice of the frontier LLM.

    "abstract": "Vision-language models (VLMs) pre-trained on extensive datasets can inadvertently learn biases by correlating gender information with specific objects or scenarios. Current methods, focusing on modifying inputs and monitoring changes in the model's output probability scores, often struggle to comprehensively understand bias from the perspective of model components. We propose a framework that incorporates causal mediation analysis to measure and map the pathways of bias generation and propagation within VLMs. This approach allows us to identify the direct effects of interventions on model bias and the indirect effects of interventions on bias mediated through different model components. Our results show that image features are the primary contributors to bias, with significantly higher impacts than text features, specifically accounting for 32.57% and 12.63% of the bias in the MSCOCO and PASCAL-SENTENCE datasets, respectively. Additionally, the image encoder's contribution notably surpasses that of the text encoder and the deep fusion encoder. Further experimentation confirms that contributions from both language and vision modalities are aligned and non-conflicting. Consequently, focusing on blurring gender representations within the image encoder which contributes most to the model bias, reduces bias efficiently by 22.03% and 9.04% in the MSCOCO and PASCAL-SENTENCE datasets, respectively, with minimal performance loss or increased computational demands",

    "title": "UniFashion: A Unified Vision-Language Model for Multimodal Fashion Retrieval and Generation",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "The fashion domain encompasses a variety of real-world multimodal tasks, including multimodal retrieval and multimodal generation. The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence generated content, particularly in technologies like large language models for text generation and diffusion models for visual generation, have sparked widespread research interest in applying these multimodal models in the fashion domain. However, tasks that use embeddings, such as image-to-text or text-to-image retrieval, have been largely ignored from this perspective due to the diverse nature of the multimodal fashion domain. And current research on multi-task single models lack focus on image generation. In this work, we present UniFashion, a unified framework that simultaneously tackles the challenges of multimodal generation and retrieval tasks within the fashion domain, integrating image generation with retrieval tasks and text generation tasks. UniFashion unifies embedding and generative tasks by integrating a diffusion model and LLM, enabling controllable and high-fidelity generation. Our model significantly outperforms previous single-task state-of-the-art models across diverse fashion tasks, and can be readily adapted to manage complex vision-language tasks. This work demonstrates the potential learning synergy between multimodal generation and retrieval, offering a promising direction for future research in the fashion domain",

    "abstract": "Conversational search, unlike single-turn retrieval tasks, requires understanding the current question within a dialogue context. The common approach of *rewrite-then-retrieve* aims to decontextualize questions to be self-sufficient for off-the-shelf retrievers, but most existing methods produce sub-optimal query rewrites due to the limited ability to incorporate signals from the retrieval results. To overcome this limitation, we present a novel framework ***RetPO*** (**Ret**riever's **P**reference **O**ptimization), which is designed to optimize a language model (LM) for reformulating search queries in line with the preferences of the target retrieval systems. The process begins by prompting a large LM to produce various potential rewrites and then collects retrieval performance for these rewrites as the retrievers' preferences. Through the process, we construct a large-scale dataset called ***RF collection***, containing **R**etrievers' **F**eedback on over 410K query rewrites across 12K conversations. Furthermore, we fine-tune a smaller LM using this dataset to align it with the retrievers' preferences as feedback. The resulting model demonstrates superiority on two benchmarks, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art performance of *rewrite-then-retrieve* approaches, including GPT-3.5.

    "abstract": "Generative AI and LLMs in particular are heavily used nowadays for various document processing tasks such as question answering and document summarization. Enterprises are incurring huge costs of operating or using LLMs for their respective use cases. In this work, we propose optimizing the usage costs of LLMs in a quality aware manner for document summarization tasks. Specifically, we propose to exploit the variability of LLM performances across different types and formats of data to maximize the output quality while maintaining expected costs under a budget and latency within a threshold. This presents two challenges: 1) estimating the output quality of LLMs at runtime without invoking each LLM, 2) optimally allocating queries to LLMs such that the objectives are optimized and constraints are satisfied. We propose a model to predict the output quality of LLMs on text summarization, followed by an LP rounding algorithm to optimize the selection of LLMs. We study the problems both theoretically and empirically. Our methods reduce costs by $40\\%- 90\\%$ while improving quality by $4\\%-7\\%$. In addition to the quantitative results, we further show that our model quality estimation aligns majorly with human preferences through a user study.

To tackle these challenges, we propose a distributed PEFT framework called DLoRA. DLoRA enables scalable PEFT operations to be performed collaboratively between the cloud and user devices.

To systematically understand the robustness of LLMs, we present RUPBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate LLM robustness across diverse reasoning tasks. Our benchmark incorporates 15 reasoning datasets, categorized into commonsense, arithmetic, logical, and knowledge-intensive reasoning, and introduces nine types of textual perturbations at lexical, syntactic, and semantic levels. By examining the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-4o, Llama3, Phi-3, and Gemma on both original and perturbed datasets, we provide a detailed analysis of their robustness and error patterns. Our findings highlight that larger models tend to exhibit greater robustness to perturbations. Additionally, common error types are identified through manual inspection, revealing specific challenges faced by LLMs in different reasoning contexts.

However, it is unclear to what degree the model's final answer is faithful to the stated reasoning steps. In this paper, we perform a causal mediation analysis on twelve LLMs to examine how intermediate reasoning steps generated by the LLM influence the final outcome and find that LLMs do not reliably use their intermediate reasoning steps when generating an answer. To address this issue, we introduce FRODO, a framework to tailor small-sized LMs to generate correct reasoning steps and robustly reason over these steps. FRODO consists of an inference module that learns to generate correct reasoning steps using an implicit causal reward function and a reasoning module that learns to faithfully reason over these intermediate inferences using a counterfactual and causal preference objective. Our experiments show that FRODO significantly outperforms four competitive baselines. Furthermore, FRODO improves the robustness and generalization ability of the reasoning LM, yielding higher performance on out-of-distribution test sets. Finally, we find that FRODO's rationales are more faithful to its final answer predictions than standard supervised fine-tuning",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) exhibit enhanced reasoning at larger scales, driving efforts to distill these capabilities into smaller models via teacher-student learning. Previous works simply fine-tune student models on teachers' generated Chain-of-Thoughts (CoTs) data. Although these methods enhance in-domain (IND) reasoning performance, they struggle to generalize to out-of-domain (OOD) tasks.

Specifically, by restructuring the training objectives—removing the answer from outputs and concatenating the question with the rationale as input—CasCoD's two-step learning process ensures that students focus on learning rationales without interference from the preset answers, thus improving reasoning generalizability.

To address this issue, we introduce a novel TOD system named GuidedTOD, which explicitly considers domain-specific guidelines by integrating a policy module. This module employs a Markov Chain, termed Chained Prior, to efficiently encode and dynamically update guideline knowledge. During inference, the Chained Prior re-ranks outputs from the domain-expert language model using beam search, ensuring guideline adherence. Experimental results show that GuidedTOD significantly improves guideline compliance, achieving approximately 20% better action prediction accuracy than state-of-the-art solutions",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Event extraction aims to identify events and then extract the arguments involved in those events. In recent years, there has been a gradual shift from sentence-level event extraction to document-level event extraction research. Despite the significant success achieved in English domain event extraction research, event extraction in Chinese still remains largely unexplored. However, a major obstacle to promoting Chinese document-level event extraction is the lack of fine-grained, wide domain coverage datasets for model training and evaluation. In this paper, we propose DocEE-zh, a new Chinese document-level event extraction dataset comprising over 36,000 events and more than 210,000 arguments. DocEE-zh is an extension of the DocEE dataset, utilizing the same event schema, and all data has been meticulously annotated by human experts. We highlight two features: focus on high-interest event types and fine-grained argument types. Experimental results indicate that state-of-the-art models still fail to achieve satisfactory performance (F1 score of 68\\%), revealing that Chinese DocEE remains an unresolved challenge",

    "abstract": "Yoruba---an African language with roughly 47 million speakers---encompasses a continuum with several dialects. Recent efforts to develop NLP technologies for African languages have focused on their standard dialects, resulting in disparities for dialects and varieties for which there are little to no resources or tools. We take steps towards bridging this gap by introducing a new high-quality parallel text and speech corpus; YORULECT across three domains and four regional yoruba dialects. To develop this corpus, we engaged native speakers, traveling to communities where these dialects are spoken, to collect text and speech data. Using our newly created corpus, we conducted extensive experiments on (text) machine translation, automatic speech recognition, and speech-to-text translation. Our results reveal substantial performance disparities between standard yoruba and the other dialects across all tasks. However, we also show that with dialect-adaptive finetuning, we are able to narrow this gap. We believe our dataset and experimental analysis will contribute greatly to developing NLP tools for Yoruba and its dialects, and potentially for other African languages, by improving our understanding of existing challenges and offering a high-quality dataset for further development. We will release YORULECT dataset and models publicly under an open license",

    "abstract": "An open challenge in recent machine learning is about how to improve the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) in a black-box setting, i.e., without access to detailed information such as output token probabilities. Existing approaches either rely on accessibility (which is often unrealistic) or involve significantly increased train- and inference-time costs. This paper addresses those limitations or shortcomings by proposing a novel approach, namely CoBB (Correct for improving QA reasoning of Black-Box LLMs). It uses a trained adaptation model to perform a seq2seq mapping from the often-imperfect reasonings of the original black-box LLM to the correct or improved reasonings. Specifically, the adaptation model is initialized with a relatively small open-source LLM and adapted over a collection of sub-sampled training pairs. To select the representative pairs of correct and incorrect reasonings, we formulated the dataset construction as an optimization problem that minimizes the statistical divergence between the sampled subset and the entire collection, and solved it via a genetic algorithm. We then train the adaptation model over the sampled pairs by contrasting the likelihoods of correct and incorrect reasonings. Our experimental results demonstrate that CoBB significantly improves reasoning accuracy across various QA benchmarks, compared to the best-performing adaptation baselines",

Existing reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) approaches often fail to capture the plurality of user opinions, instead reinforcing majority viewpoints and marginalizing minority perspectives. To address this, we introduce PERSONA, a comprehensive and reproducible test bed designed to evaluate and improve pluralistic alignment in language models. Our approach utilizes synthetic personas, crafted through a combination of US census data and procedural generation, to simulate a wide array of user profiles with diverse demographic and idiosyncratic attributes. We present a detailed methodology for constructing a representative demographic of 1,586 personas, each enriched with individualistic personality traits and core values. Leveraging this synthetic demographic, we generate a large-scale preference dataset containing 3,868 prompts and 317,200 pairs of diverse feedback. This dataset enables the evaluation of language models' ability to align with both group-level and individual preferences across various controversial and value-laden topics. Our contributions include a systematic evaluation of current LM capabilities in role-playing diverse users, verified through human judges, and the establishment of a benchmark for pluralistic alignment approaches. Our work aims to facilitate the development of more inclusive and representative language models, paving the way for future research in global pluralistic alignment.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "The deployment of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has brought forth a unique vulnerability: susceptibility to malicious attacks through visual inputs. This paper investigates the novel challenge of defending MLLMs against such attacks. Compared to large language models (LLMs), MLLMs include an additional image modality. We discover that images act as a \"foreign language\" that is not considered during safety alignment, making MLLMs more prone to producing harmful responses. Unfortunately, unlike the discrete tokens considered in text-based LLMs, the continuous nature of image signals presents significant alignment challenges, which poses difficulty to thoroughly cover all possible scenarios. This vulnerability is exacerbated by the fact that most state-of-the-art MLLMs are fine-tuned on limited image-text pairs that are much fewer than the extensive text-based pretraining corpus, which makes the MLLMs more prone to catastrophic forgetting of their original abilities during safety fine-tuning. To tackle these challenges, we introduce MLLM-Protector, a plug-and-play strategy that solves two subtasks: 1) identifying harmful responses via a lightweight harm detector, and 2) transforming harmful responses into harmless ones via a detoxifier. This approach effectively mitigates the risks posed by malicious visual inputs without compromising the original performance of MLLMs. Our results demonstrate that MLLM-Protector offers a robust solution to a previously unaddressed aspect of MLLM security",

Still, their growing scale has increased the computational burden, necessitating a balance between efficiency and performance. Low-rank compression, a promising technique, reduces non-essential parameters by decomposing weight matrices into products of two low-rank matrices. Yet, its application in LLMs has not been extensively studied. The key to low-rank compression lies in low-rank factorization and low-rank dimensions allocation. To address the challenges of low-rank compression in LLMs, we conduct empirical research on the low-rank characteristics of large models. We propose a low-rank compression method suitable for LLMs. This approach involves precise estimation of feature distributions through pooled covariance matrices and a Bayesian optimization strategy for allocating low-rank dimensions. Experiments on the LLaMA-2 models demonstrate that our method outperforms existing strong structured pruning and low-rank compression techniques in maintaining model performance at the same compression ratio.\\footnote{The implementation code and model checkpoints are available at \\url{https://github.com/anonymous}.}",

We introduce an iterative human-in-the-loop method to identify media storms in a large-scale corpus of news articles. The text is first transformed into signals of dispersion based on several textual characteristics. In each iteration, we apply unsupervised anomaly detection to these signals; each anomaly is then validated by an expert to confirm the presence of a storm, and those results are then used to tune the anomaly detection in the next iteration. We make available the resulting media storm dataset. Both the method and dataset provide a basis for comprehensive empirical study of media storms",

    "abstract": "The remarkable performance of large language models (LLMs) heavily depends on the prompts they receive. Inappropriate prompts can significantly hinder their performance or trigger undesirable behaviors, such as the amplification of societal biases. Traditional methods for addressing these issues often overlook valuable information from LLMs' pre-training phases and handle training data one by one, leading to a loss of crucial information. This paper presents an innovative framework called Learning to Prompt (L2P), which combines an LLM-based optimizer with meta-learning and the chain of thought mechanism. L2P enables effective optimization for each individual prompt and generalizes to new prompt optimization, significantly improving LLM performance.

    "abstract": "CLIP revolutes vision-language pretraining by using contrastive learning on paired web data. However, the sheer size of these pretrained models makes full-model finetuning exceedingly costly. One common solution is the \"adapter\", which finetunes a few additional parameters while freezing the backbone. It harnesses the heavy-duty backbone while offering a light finetuning for small downstream tasks. This synergy prompts us to explore the potential of augmenting large-scale backbones with traditional machine learning techniques. Often employed in traditional fields and overlooked in the large-scale era, these techniques could provide valuable enhancements. Herein, we delve into the \"adapter ensembles\" in the realm of large-scale pretrained vision-language models. We begin with a proof-of-concept study to establish the efficacy of combining multiple adapters. We then present extensive evidence showing these ensembles excel in a variety of settings, particularly when employing a Multi-Scale Attention (MSA) approach thoughtfully integrated into the ensemble framework. We further incorporate the LoRA to mitigate the additional parameter burden. We focus on vision-language retrieval, using different backbones under constraints of minimal data, parameters, and finetuning budgets.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common mental disorder that exhibits a high incidence rate in children and adolescents, and it is also observed in adults. Currently, there is a lack of objective diagnostic methods for ADHD. Therefore, a three-dimensional residual network (3D-ResNet) deep learning method based on feature extraction from rs-fMRI images for assisting in the diagnosis of ADHD based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and deep learning models was proposed in this paper. Taking into consideration the temporal characteristics of rs-fMRI, we constructed a 3D-ResNet model based on four-dimensional image. The model utilized TimeDistributed to encapsulate residual blocks which allowed the model to extract spatial features from rs-fMRI while preserving its temporal sequence information. We constructed four different hierarchical structures of 3D-ResNet which are subsequently combined with two different bidirectional recurrent neural networks (BRNNs) to extract sequence features. And BRNNs includes bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) and bidirectional gated recurrent unit (Bi-GRU). The proposed method utilized the ADHD-200 Consortium's public dataset for training and was validated by 5-fold cross-validation. The experimental results indicated that the proposed method in this study demonstrated superior performance on the dataset compared to traditional methods (Accuracy: 76.56%, Sensitivity: 80.16%, Specificity: 90.22%). Therefore, adopting this method can further enhance the accuracy of assisting in the diagnosis of ADHD",

Results show that GRAMMATICAL words trigger less errors than LEXICAL words across all languages, and Proper Nouns in Japanese combined with case markers are related to higher accuracy.

    "abstract": "Modern large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have shown remarkable performance on general language tasks but still struggle on complex reasoning tasks, which drives the research on cognitive behaviors of LLMs to explore human-like problem-solving strategies. Along this direction, one representative strategy is self-reflection, which asks an LLM to refine the solution with the feedback generated by itself iteratively. However, our study shows that such reflection-style methods suffer from the Degeneration-of-Thought (DoT) problem: once the LLM has established confidence in its solutions, it is unable to generate novel thoughts later through reflection even if its initial stance is incorrect. To address the DoT problem, we propose a Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) framework, in which multiple agents express their arguments in the state of \"tit for tat\" and a judge manages the debate process to obtain a final solution. Clearly, our MAD framework encourages divergent thinking in LLMs which would be helpful for tasks that require deep levels of contemplation. Experiment results on two challenging datasets, commonsense machine translation and counter-intuitive arithmetic reasoning, demonstrate the effectiveness of our MAD framework. Extensive analyses suggest that the adaptive break of debate and the modest level of \"tit for tat\" state are required for MAD to obtain good performance. Moreover, we find that LLMs might not be a fair judge if different LLMs are used for agents",

These models often facilitate multilingual operations, including querying and conversation. Yet, few research efforts have been devoted to understanding hallucinations in a multilingual context, specifically regarding the equitable treatment of supported languages, due to the lack of available benchmarks. Addressing this gap, this paper first proposes Poly-FEVER, a large-scale publicly accessible multilingual fact extraction and verification dataset for hallucination detection that covers 11 languages and more than 800K fact claims with diverse topics. We utilize Poly-FEVER to evaluate the hallucination detection capabilities of ChatGPT and LLaMA-2 series. Our investigation extends to exploring hallucination causes, employing Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic distribution analysis and web searches to assess resource imbalances. Furthermore, we propose a mitigation approach combining linguistic adjustments and resource-oriented strategies, including a trained LDA model and the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, to enhance the robustness and reliability of multilingual information verification in LLMs. Our findings highlight the critical need for multilingual benchmarks Poly-FEVER and demonstrate the potential of mitigation strategy to address biased detection abilities on hallucinations, thus contributing to the development of more equitable and reliable multilingual LLMs",

    "abstract": "As large language models achieve impressive scores on traditional benchmarks, an increasing number of researchers are becoming concerned about benchmark data leakage during pre-training, commonly known as the data contamination problem. To ensure fair evaluation, recent benchmarks release only the training and validation sets, keeping the test set labels closed-source. They require anyone wishing to evaluate his language model to submit the model's predictions for centralized processing and then publish the model's result on their leaderboard. However, this submission process is inefficient and prevents effective error analysis. To address this issue, we propose to variabilize benchmarks and evaluate language models dynamically. Specifically, we extract variables from each test case and define a value range for each variable. For each evaluation, we sample new values from these value ranges to create unique test cases, thus ensuring a fresh evaluation each time. We applied this variable perturbation method to four datasets: GSM8K, ARC, CommonsenseQA, and TruthfulQA, which cover mathematical generation and multiple-choice tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that this approach provides a more accurate assessment of the true capabilities of language models, effectively mitigating the contamination problem",

We point out that current popular backward chaining implementations (Least-to-most prompting and LAMBADA) fail to implement the necessary features of backward chaining, such as arbitrary-depth recursion and binding propagation. To this end, we propose a novel backward chaining framework, SymBa (Symbolic Backward Chaining). In SymBa, a symbolic solver controls the whole proof process, and an LLM searches for the relevant natural language premises and translates them into a symbolic form for the solver. By this LLM-solver integration, while producing a completely structured proof that is symbolically verified, SymBa achieves significant improvement in performance, proof accuracy, and efficiency in diverse structured reasoning benchmarks compared to baselines",

However, integrating external information into LLM-integrated applications raises significant security concerns. Among these, prompt injection attacks are particularly threatening, where malicious instructions injected in the external text information can exploit LLMs to generate answers as the attackers desire. While both training-time and test-time defense methods have been developed to mitigate such attacks, the unaffordable training costs associated with training-time methods and the limited effectiveness of existing test-time methods make them impractical. This paper introduces a novel test-time defense strategy, named Formatting AuThentication with Hash-based tags (FATH). Unlike existing approaches that prevent LLMs from answering additional instructions in external text, our method implements an authentication system, requiring LLMs to answer all received instructions but selectively filter out responses to user instructions as the final output. To achieve this, we utilize hash-based authentication tags to label each response, facilitating accurate identification of responses according to the user's instructions and improving the robustness against adaptive attacks. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our defense method can effectively defend the indirect prompt injection attacks, achieving state-of-the-art performance under Llama3 and GPT3.5 models across various attack methods",

Extensive evaluation of ten models on MM-MATH reveals significant challenges for existing LMMs, highlighting their limited utilization of visual information and struggles with higher-difficulty problems. The best-performing model achieves only 31% accuracy on MM-MATH, compared to 82% for humans. This highlights the challenging nature of our benchmark for existing models and the significant gap between the multimodal reasoning capabilities of current models and humans. Our process evaluation reveals that diagram misinterpretation is the most common error, accounting for more than half of the total error cases, underscoring the need for improved image comprehension in multimodal reasoning",

    "abstract": "Extractive summarization plays a pivotal role in natural language processing due to its wide-range applications in summarizing diverse content efficiently, while also being faithful to the original content. Despite significant advancement achieved in extractive summarization by Large Language Models (LLMs), these summaries frequently exhibit incoherence. An important aspect of the coherent summary is its readability for intended users. Although there have been many datasets and benchmarks proposed for creating coherent extractive summaries, none of them currently incorporate user intent to improve coherence in extractive summarization. Motivated by this, we propose a systematically created human-annotated dataset consisting of coherent summaries for five publicly available datasets and natural language user feedback, offering valuable insights into how to improve coherence in extractive summaries. We utilize this dataset for aligning LLMs through supervised fine-tuning with natural language human feedback to enhance the coherence of their generated summaries. Preliminary experiments with Falcon-40B and Llama-2-13B show significant performance improvements (~10% Rouge-L) in terms of producing coherent summaries. We further utilize human feedback to benchmark results over instruction-tuned models such as FLAN-T5 which resulted in several interesting findings",

Recent studies have explored leveraging the LLM itself as an optimizer to identify optimal prompts that maximize task accuracy. However, when evaluating prompts, such approaches heavily rely on elusive manually annotated gold labels to calculate task accuracy for each candidate prompt, which hinders its generality. To overcome the limitation, this work proposes GLaPE, a gold label-agnostic prompt evaluation method to alleviate dependence on gold labels. GLaPE is composed of two critical aspects: self-consistency evaluation of a single prompt and mutual-consistency refinement across multiple prompts. Experimental results on 8 widely-recognized reasoning tasks demonstrate that GLaPE can produce more effective prompts, achieving performance comparable to those derived from manually annotated gold labels. Analysis shows that GLaPE provides reliable evaluations aligned with accuracy, even in the absence of gold labels. Code is publicly available at **Anonymous**",

The training cost and complexity for such LLM variants grow rapidly. In this work, we propose to use a soup strategy to assemble these LLM variants into a single well-generalized multimodal LLM (SoupLM) in a cost-efficient manner. Assembling these LLM variants efficiently brings knowledge and specialities trained from different domains and data modalities into an integrated one (e.g., chatbot speciality from user-shared conversations for Vicuna, and visual capacity from vision-language data for LLaVA), therefore, to avoid computing costs of repetitive training on several different domains.

The conversational capabilities of large language models (LLMs) show great potential for providing scalable, real-time student guidance.

It estimates a student's conceptual and syntactical knowledge to dynamically construct a question tree based on their responses and current knowledge state, effectively addressing both independent and dependent mistakes concurrently in a multi-turn interaction setting. In addition to using an existing single-bug debugging benchmark, we construct a more challenging multi-bug dataset of 150 coding problems, incorrect solutions, and bug fixes-- all carefully constructed and annotated by experts. Extensive evaluation shows TreeInstruct's state-of-the-art performance on both datasets, proving it to be a more effective instructor than baselines.

    "abstract": "Stigma is a barrier to treatment for individuals struggling with substance use disorders (SUD), which leads to significantly lower treatment engagement rates. With only 7% of those affected receiving any form of help, societal stigma not only discourages individuals with SUD from seeking help but isolates them, hindering their recovery journey and perpetuating a cycle of shame and self-doubt. This study investigates how stigma manifests on social media, particularly Reddit, where anonymity can exacerbate discriminatory behaviors. We analyzed over 1.2 million posts, identifying 3,207 that exhibited stigmatizing language towards people who use substances (PWUS). Using Informed and Stylized LLMs, we develop a model for de-stigmatization of these expressions into empathetic language, resulting in 1,649 reformed phrase pairs. Our paper contributes to the field by proposing a computational framework for analyzing stigma and destigmatizing online content, and delving into the linguistic features that propagate stigma towards PWUS.

    "abstract": "In Xie et al. (2024), the authors proposed TravelPlanner, a U.S. domestic travel planning benchmark, and showed that LLMs themselves cannot make travel plans that satisfy user requirements with a best success rate of 0.6\\%. The state-of-the-art methods that combine LLMs with external critics, verifiers, and humans can only improve the success rate to 20\\% (Kambhampati et al.). In this work, we propose a framework that enables LLMs to formally formulate and solve combinatorial search problems such as the travel planning problem as a satisfiability modulo theory (SMT) problem, and use SMT solvers to automatically and interactively solve them. The SMT solvers guarantee to find a plan when input constraints are satisfiable. When the input constraints cannot be satisfiable, our LLM-based framework can interactively and adaptively offer modification suggestions to users using SMT solvers' capability of identifying the unsatisfiable core. We evaluate our framework with TravelPlanner and achieve a success rate of 97\\% for satisfiable queries. We also create a separate dataset that contains international travel benchmarks and show that when initial user queries are unsatisfiable, our interactive planning framework can generate valid plans with an average success rate of 78.6\\% for the international travel benchmark and 85.0\\% for TravelPlanner according to diverse humans preferences. We show that our framework could achieve zero-shot generalization to unseen constraints in travel planning problems. In addition, we introduce four new combinatorial optimization tasks and show that our framework could generalize well to new domains in a zero-shot manner",

    "abstract": "The instruction-following ability of large language models enables humans to interact with AI agents in a natural way.However, when required to generate responses of a specific length, large language models often struggle to meet users' needs due to their inherent difficulty in accurately perceiving numerical constraints. To explore the ability of large language models to control the length of generated responses, we propose the Target Length Generation task (TLG) and design two metrics, Precise Match (PM) and Flexible Match (FM) to evaluate the model's performance in adhering to specified response lengths. Furthermore, we introduce a novel, model-agnostic approach called Ruler, which employs Meta Length Tokens (MLTs) to enhance the instruction-following ability of large language models under length-constrained instructions. Specifically, Ruler equips LLMs with the ability to generate responses of a specified length based on length constraints within the instructions. Moreover, Ruler can automatically generate appropriate MLT when length constraints are not explicitly provided, demonstrating excellent versatility and generalization. Comprehensive experiments show the effectiveness of Ruler across different LLMs on Target Length Generation Task, e.g., 28.25 average gain on FM, 18.40 average gain on PM. In addition, we conduct extensive ablation experiments to further substantiate the efficacy and generalization of Ruler. Our code and data will be made publicly available upon publication",

However, due to the limited power of captioning methods, the captions often miss important content in the video, resulting in unsatisfactory retrieval performance. To translate more information into video captions, we designed a novel relevance-boosted caption generation method, bringing extra relevant details into video captions by LLMs. Moreover, to emphasize key information and reduce the noise brought by imagination, we extract key visual tokens from captions and design different templates for structuring these tokens with the proposed structural information extraction, further boosting the retrieval performance. Benefiting from the enriched captions and structuralized information, extensive experiments on several video-text retrieval benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of EASIER over existing fine-tuned and pretraining methods without any data.

Among various techniques, character-level embeddings of numbers have emerged as a promising approach to improve number representation. However, this method has limitations as it leaves the task of aggregating digit representations to the model, which lacks direct supervision for this process. In this paper, we explore the use of mathematical priors to compute aggregated digit embeddings and explicitly incorporate these aggregates into transformer models. This can be achieved either by adding a special token to the input embeddings or by introducing an additional loss function to enhance correct predictions. We evaluate the effectiveness of incorporating this explicit aggregation, analysing its strengths and shortcomings, and discuss future directions to better benefit from this approach.

The data sourced from the Internet often aggregated into datasets like the Common Crawl corpus, presents significant quality variability and necessitates extensive cleaning. Moreover, specific domain knowledge is usually presented in HTML, but there is a lack of effective methods to clean them into the training corpus automatically.

In this paper, inspired by the recent progress in employing LLMs as versatile agents for diverse tasks, we take the initiative to explore the potential of these agents in automating data-cleaning methodologies. By configuring LLMs as an agent team that imitates the human data-cleaning team, we can automatically generate cleaning rules that traditionally require the involvement of data-cleaning experts. These rules are developed using a limited number of data samples and can then be applied broadly to substantial portions of raw data from the same domain.

However, the application of synthetic data to the training of multimodal context-augmented generation systems has been relatively unexplored. This gap in existing work is important because existing vision and language models (VLMs) are not trained specifically for context-augmented generation. Resources for adapting such models are therefore crucial for enabling their use in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) settings, where a retriever is used to gather relevant information that is then subsequently provided to a generative model via context augmentation. To address this challenging problem, we generate SK-VQA: a large synthetic multimodal dataset containing over 2 million question-answer pairs which require external knowledge to determine the final answer. Our dataset is both larger and significantly more diverse than existing resources of its kind, possessing over 11x more unique questions and containing images from a greater variety of sources than previously-proposed datasets.

We observe that our instruction-based prompts generate outputs with 23.7% higher overlap with training data compared to the baseline prefix-suffix measurements. We analyze our attack in two settings: a practical approach with limited access to the sequence, excluding the suffix, and to demonstrate an empirical upper-bound scenario on the power of the attack where we have full sequence access but impose a penalty to discourage direct solutions. Our findings show that (1)instruction-tuned models can expose pre-training data as much as their base-models, if not more so, (2) contexts other than the original training data can lead to leakage, and (3) using instructions proposed by other LLMs can open a new avenue of automated attacks that we should further study and explore",

Our research identifies two critical latent factors affecting RAG's confidence in its predictions: the quality of the retrieved results and the manner in which these results are utilized. To guide RAG models in assessing their own confidence based on these two latent factors, we develop a counterfactual prompting framework that induces the models to alter these factors and analyzes the effect on their answers. We also introduce a benchmarking procedure to collect answers with the option to abstain, facilitating a series of experiments. For evaluation, we introduce several risk-related metrics and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Process supervision, using a trained verifier to evaluate the intermediate steps generated by a reasoner, has demonstrated significant improvements in multi-step problem solving. In this paper, to avoid the expensive effort of human annotation on the verifier training data, we introduce Model-induced Process Supervision (MiPS), a novel method for automating data curation. MiPS annotates an intermediate step by sampling completions of this solution through the reasoning model, and obtaining an accuracy defined as the proportion of correct completions. Inaccuracies of the reasoner would cause MiPS underestimating the accuracy of intermediate steps, therefore, we suggest and empirically show that verification focusing on high predicted scores of the verifier shall be preferred over that of low predicted scores, contrary to prior observations on human curated data. Our approach significantly improves the performance of PaLM 2 on math and coding tasks (accuracy +0.67\\% on GSM8K, +4.16\\% on MATH, +0.92\\% on MBPP compared with an output supervision trained verifier).

    "abstract": "As neural language models achieve human-comparable performance on Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) and see widespread adoption, ensuring their robustness in real-world scenarios has become increasingly important. Current robustness evaluation research, though, primarily develops synthetic perturbation methods, leaving unclear how well they reflect real life. Considering this, we present a framework to automatically examine MRC models on occurring textual perturbations, by replacing paragraph in MRC benchmarks with their counterparts based on available Wikipedia edit history. Such perturbation type is natural as its design does not stem from an artificial generative process, inherently distinct from the previously investigated synthetic approaches. In a large-scale study encompassing various model architectures we observe that natural perturbations result in performance degradation in pre-trained encoder langauge models, with errors extending to Flan-T5 and Large Language Models (LLMs). We also show that exposing encoder-only models to naturally perturbed examples during training contributes to handling natural perturbations. This adversarial training approach, however, is not able to promote performance improvement on the majority of synthetic perturbations, indicating that many types of synthetic noise do not actually exist in our collected real-world textual perturbations. We hope this study will inspire future robustness investigation efforts to focus more on natural perturbations, thus deepening our understanding of how models respond to realistic linguistic challenges and providing insights into practical robustness enhancement strategies",

The listwise approaches, such as RankGPT, have become new state-of-the-art in this task. However, the efficiency of RankGPT models is limited by the maximum context length and relatively high latency of LLM inference. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose PE-Rank, leveraging the single passage embedding as a good context compression for efficient listwise passage reranking. By treating each passage as a special token, we can directly input passage embeddings into LLMs, thereby reducing input length. Additionally, we introduce an inference method that dynamically constrains the decoding space to these special tokens, accelerating the decoding process. For adapting the model to reranking, we employ listwise learning to rank loss for training. Evaluation results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that PE-Rank significantly improves efficiency in both prefilling and decoding, while maintaining competitive ranking effectiveness",

One, we find that adding additional supervisory signals via a dominant language in the LLM, leads to improvements, both under in-context learning and fine-tuning. Two, adapting the target languages to word reordering may be beneficial under ICL, but its impact diminishes with fine tuning.

    "title": "Low-rank Subspace for Binding in Large Language Models",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Entity tracking is essential for complex reasoning. To perform in-context entity tracking, language models (LMs) must bind an entity to its attribute (e.g., bind a container to its content) to recall attribute for a given entity. For example, given a context mentioning \"The coffee is in Box Z, the stone is in Box M, the map is in Box H\", to infer \"Box Z contains the coffee\" later, LMs must bind \"Box Z\" to \"coffee\". To explain the binding behaviour of LMs, existing research introduces a Binding ID mechanism and states that LMs use a abstract concept called Binding ID (BI) to internally mark entity-attribute pairs. However, they have not directly captured the BI information from entity activations. In this work, we provide a novel view of the Binding ID mechanism by localizing the BI information. Specifically, we discover that there exists a low-rank subspace in the hidden state (or activation) of LMs, that primarily encodes BIs. To identify this subspace, we take principle component analysis as our first attempt and it is empirically proven to be effective. Moreover, we also discover that when editing representations along directions in the subspace, LMs tend to bind a given entity to other attributes accordingly. For example, by patching activations along the BI encoding direction we can make the LM to infer \"Box Z contains the stone\" and \"Box Z contains the map\"",

    "abstract": "The illustration or visualization of figurative language, such as linguistic metaphors, is an emerging challenge for existing Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal models. Due to their comparison of seemingly unrelated concepts in metaphors, existing LLMs have a tendency of over-literalization, which illustrates figurative language solely based on literal objects, ignoring the underlying groundings and associations across disparate metaphorical domains. Furthermore, prior approaches have ignored the binding process between visual objects and metaphorical attributes, which further intensifies the infidelity of visual metaphors. To address the issues above, we propose GOME ($GO$unding-based $ME$taphor Binding), which illustrates linguistic metaphors from the grounding perspective elaborated through LLMs. GOME consists of two steps for metaphor illustration, including grounding-based elaboration and scenario visualization. In the elaboration step, metaphorical knowledge is integrated into systematic instructions for LLMs, which employs a CoT prompting method rooted in rhetoric. This approach specifies metaphorical devices such as vehicles and groundings, to ensure accurate and faithful descriptions consumed by text-to-image models. In the visualization step, an inference-time metaphor binding method is realized based on elaboration outputs, which register attentional control during the diffusion process, and captures the underlying attributes from the abstract metaphorical domain. Comprehensive evaluations using multiple downstream tasks confirm that, GOME is superior to isolated LLMs, diffusion models, or their direct collaboration",

    "abstract": "In the realm of image captioning (IC), learning sentence pattern and semantics plays a crucial role. The reason why this aspect has not received enough attention before is that the prevailing IC models utilize the autoregressive IC (AR-IC) paradigm which operates in a word-by-word manner. In this paradigm, coherence and fluency with the previous text are prioritized during word generation, without special considerations for the sentence pattern. While effective, the AR-IC approaches pose inherent challenges for real-time applications due to their time-consuming nature during inference. Unlike the AR-IC counterparts, non-autoregressive IC (NAR-IC) models necessitate simultaneous inference of all words in a caption. However, the existing NAR-IC models have been met with the hurdle of reduced effectiveness in comparison to their autoregressive counterparts. It is largely because they follow the AR-IC approach, neglecting the influence of patterns and semantics on NAR-IC. Considering that the dependency on preceding and following words is eliminated during NAR-IC generation, it becomes crucial to consider the sentence pattern to guide word generation. In this paper, we reconsider the impact of sentence patterns and semantics in NAR-IC training. We delve into NAR-IC and provide tips and tricks for training NAR-IC models, which include knowledge distillation, label selection, image pre-fusion, and NAR+AR enhancement. By meticulously examining the impact of these components on model performance, we achieve the state-of-the-art performance with a single-step generation. This paper aims to provide valuable strategies for those aiming to advance NAR-IC models. Our code will be provided in Supplementary materials",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Binary code analysis is the foundation of crucial tasks in the security domain; thus building effective binary analysis techniques is more important than ever. Large language models (LLMs) although have brought impressive improvement to source code tasks, do not directly generalize to assembly code due to the unique challenges of assembly: (1) the low information density of assembly and (2) the diverse optimizations in assembly code. To overcome these challenges, this work proposes a hierarchical attention mechanism that builds attention summaries to capture the semantics more effectively and designs contrastive learning objectives to train LLMs to learn assembly optimization. Equipped with these techniques, this work develops Nova, a generative LLM for assembly code. Nova outperforms existing techniques on binary code decompilation by up to 146.54%, and outperforms the latest binary code similarity detection techniques by up to 6.17%, showing promising abilities in both assembly generation and understanding tasks",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across various domains, but the limited context window and the expensive computational cost of processing long texts restrict their more comprehensive application. In this paper, we propose Selective Compression Attention (SCA), a general and effective method to expand the context window and reduce memory footprint by compressing the KV cache of LLMs. Specifically, through preliminary experiments, we found that the KV cache contains many similar vectors, resulting in information redundancy, which can be compressed by retaining representative vectors and discarding others. Therefore, SCA continuously selects the most distinctive vectors to keep through a greedy algorithm, reducing information loss during compression. Extensive experiments on various tasks verify the effectiveness of our method. Compared with existing methods, SCA can significantly reduce the impact on model performance under the same compression ratio. Furthermore, the context window of LLMs can be efficiently expanded using SCA without any training, which can even achieve better performance than specially fine-tuned long context models",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we aim to generate text classification data given arbitrary class definitions (i.e., user instruction), so one can train a text classifier without any human annotation or raw corpus. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) lead to pioneer attempts to individually generate texts for each class via prompting. In this paper, we propose Incubator, the first framework that can handle complicated and even mutually dependent classes (e.g., \"\\emph{TED Talk given by Educator}\" and \"\\emph{Other}\"). Specifically, our Incubator is a fine-tuned LLM that takes the instruction of all class definitions as input, and in each inference, it can jointly generate one sample for every class. First, we tune Incubator on the instruction-to-data mappings that we obtained from classification datasets and descriptions on Hugging Face together with in-context augmentation by GPT-4. To emphasize the uniformity and diversity in generations, we refine Incubator by fine-tuning with the cluster centers of semantic textual embeddings of the generated samples. We compare Incubator on various classification tasks with strong baselines such as direct LLM-based inference and training data generation by prompt engineering. Experiments show Incubator is able to (1) outperform previous methods on traditional benchmarks, (2) take label interdependency and user preference into consideration, and (3) enable logical text mining by incubating multiple classifiers",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has become the default approach to fine-tune large language models (LLMs) due to its significant reduction in trainable parameters. However, trainable parameter demand for LoRA increases with increasing model embedding dimensions, leading to high compute costs. Additionally, its backward updates require storing high-dimensional intermediate activations and optimizer states, demanding high peak GPU memory. In this paper, we introduce *large model fine-tuning via spectrally decomposed low-dimensional adaptation (LaMDA)*, a novel approach to fine-tuning large language models, which leverages low-dimensional adaptation to achieve significant reductions in trainable parameters and peak GPU memory footprint. LaMDA freezes a first projection matrix (PMA) in the adaptation path while introducing a low-dimensional trainable square matrix, resulting in substantial reductions in trainable parameters and peak GPU memory usage. LaMDA gradually freezes a second projection matrix (PMB) during the early fine-tuning stages, reducing the compute cost associated with weight updates to enhance parameter efficiency further. We also present an enhancement, LaMDA++, incorporating a ``lite-weight\" adaptive rank allocation for the LoRA path via normalized spectrum analysis of pre-trained model weights. We evaluate LaMDA/LaMDA++ across various tasks, including natural language understanding with the GLUE benchmark, text summarization, natural language generation, and complex reasoning on different LLMs. Results show that LaMDA matches or surpasses the performance of existing alternatives while requiring up to 17.7x fewer parameter updates and up to 1.32x lower peak GPU memory usage during fine-tuning.

    "abstract": "Data scarcity in low-resource languages can be addressed with word-to-word translations from labeled task data in high-resource languages using bilingual lexicons. However, bilingual lexicons often have limited lexical overlap with task data, which results in poor translation coverage and lexicon utilization. We propose lexicon-conditioned data generation LexC-Gen, a method that generates low-resource-language classification task data at scale. Specifically, LexC-Gen first uses high-resource-language words from bilingual lexicons to generate lexicon-compatible task data, and then it translates them into low-resource languages with bilingual lexicons via word translation. Across 17 extremely low-resource languages, LexC-Gen generated data is competitive with expert-translated gold data, and yields on average 5.6 and 8.9 points improvement over existing lexicon-based word translation methods on sentiment analysis and topic classification tasks respectively. Through ablation study, we show that conditioning on bilingual lexicons is the key component of LexC-Gen. LexC-Gen serves as a potential solution to close the performance gap between open-source multilingual models, such as BLOOMZ and Aya-101, and state-of-the-art commercial models like GPT-4o on low-resource-language tasks",

Additionally, we develop a truthfulness detector, inspired by psychological literature, to assess the agents' responses. Our experiments demonstrate that most models can effectively navigate the scenarios. The truthfulness and goal achievement rate vary, with no clear correlation to model size or capability. However, all models are truthful less than 50\\% of the time. We further test the steerability of LLMs towards truthfulness, finding that models can be directed to be deceptive, and even truth-steered models still lie.These findings reveal the complex nature of truthfulness in LLMs and underscore the importance of further research in this area to ensure the safe and reliable deployment of LLMs and AI agents",

    "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) are widely deployed, targeted editing of their knowledge has become a critical challenge. Recently, advancements in model editing techniques, such as Rank-One Model Editing (ROME), have paved the way for updating LLMs with new knowledge. However, the efficacy of these methods varies across different types of knowledge. This study investigates the capability of knowledge editing methods to incorporate new knowledge with varying degrees of \"perplexingness\", a term we use to describe the initial difficulty LLMs have in understanding new concepts. We begin by quantifying the \"perplexingness\" of target knowledge using pre-edit conditional probabilities, and assess the efficacy of edits through post-edit conditional probabilities. Utilizing the widely-used CounterFact dataset, we find significant negative correlations between the \"perplexingness\" of the new knowledge and the edit efficacy across all 12 scenarios. To dive deeper into this phenomenon, we introduce a novel dataset, HierarchyData, consisting of 99 hyponym-hypernym pairs across diverse categories. Our analysis reveal that more abstract concepts (hypernyms) tend to be more perplexing than their specific counterparts (hyponyms). Further exploration into the influence of knowledge hierarchy on editing outcomes indicates that knowledge positioned at higher hierarchical levels is more challenging to modify in some scenarios. Our research highlights a previously overlooked aspect of LLM editing: the variable efficacy of editing methods in handling perplexing knowledge. By revealing how hierarchical relationships can influence editing outcomes, our findings offer new insights into the challenges of updating LLMs and pave the way for more nuanced approaches to model editing in the future",

In task-oriented scenarios, users usually seek personalized consultation about the target subjects they are concerned with rather than general knowledge commonly known by populations. It is essential to identify whether a dialogue solves the user's questions by task-oriented DQE. Existing studies mainly focus on analyzing dialogue semantics and user sentiment, neglecting to understand what the user is concerned about when requesting a consultation. It may cause fatal errors when the response is emotionally friendly but non-informative. In this paper, we propose a knowledge-enhanced DQE model named CoReT, which introduces the Conceptual Knowledge Reasoning for Task-oriented DQE. We first design a simple yet efficient entity linking and relation selection module enabling conceptual reasoning from a knowledge graph. Then, we propose a multi-turn textual encoder to capture the contextual information in dialogues. Finally, we introduce a knowledge enhancement module to fuse conceptual reasoning features into contextual embeddings to produce DQE results. For evaluation, we conduct experiments on two real-world datasets in e-commerce consultation systems, the results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of CoReT compared with the state-of-the-art baselines",

This paper introduces UKoSpeech, a novel Korean ASR system designed to address these issues through a unique two-pronged approach: a Korean data curation pipeline leveraging domain-specific data from sources such as YouTube subtitles, and a domain-specific training framework that utilizes a domain prompt technique for enhanced adaptability. Our results indicate that UKoSpeech not only fills the gap in multilingual ASR research but also provides superior domain-specific performance compared to established ASR systems like Whisper, Google STT, and CLOVA Speech. Through extensive evaluation across diverse domains such as finance, medicine, and law, UKoSpeech demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, establishing a new benchmark for domain-adaptable ASR systems",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Large language Models (LLMs) and AI chatbots have improved people's efficiency in various fields and shown strong capacities in many NLP tasks. However, when extrinsic knowledge contains misinformation from careless mistakes or malicious web texts that users do not realize, there is a higher probability for models to trust wrong external information and generate inaccurate answers that will mislead users. Therefore, we design two principles for models' behaviors in such cases and create a benchmark with counterfactual information in the contexts from existing knowledge bases for further evaluation. We also propose two new metrics to measure the extent to which this misinformation misleads models. Evaluation results show that existing LLMs are susceptible to interference from unreliable external knowledge with counterfactual information, and simple intervention methods make limited contributions to the alleviation of this issue",

However, most of the previous works ignored the value of glyph, which could contain enriched semantic information and can not be fully expressed by the pre-trained embedding in hieroglyphic languages like Chinese. We argue that, compared with combining the sophisticated textual features, glyphic information from visual modality could provide us with extra and straight semantic information in extracting events. Motivated by this, we propose a glyphic multi-modal Chinese event extraction model with hieroglyphic images to capture the intra- and inter-character morphological structure from the sequence. Extensive experiments build a new state-of-the-art performance in the ACE2005 Chinese and KBP Eval 2017 dataset, which underscores the effectiveness of our proposed glyphic event extraction model, and more importantly, the glyphic feature can be obtained at nearly zero cost",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in massively multilingual machine translation systems have significantly enhanced translation accuracy; however, even the best performing systems still generate hallucinations, severely impacting user trust. Detecting hallucinations in Machine Translation (MT) remains a critical challenge, particularly since existing methods excel with High-Resource Languages (HRLs) but exhibit substantial limitations when applied to Low-Resource Languages (LRLs). This paper evaluates hallucination detection approaches using Large Language Models (LLMs) and semantic similarity within massively multilingual embeddings. Our study spans 16 language directions, covering HRLs, LRLs, with diverse scripts. We find that the choice of model is essential for performance. On average, for HRLs, Llama3-70B outperforms the previous state of the art by as much as 0.16 MCC (Matthews Correlation Coefficient). However, for LRLs we observe that Claude Sonnet outperforms other LLMs on average by 0.03 MCC. The key takeaway from our study is that LLMs can achieve performance comparable or even better than previously proposed models, despite not being explicitly trained for any machine translation task.However, their advantage is less significant for LRLs",

Although, numerous approaches have been recently presented like Linformer, Longformer, Performer, Structured state space models (SSMs) etc., yet it remains an unresolved problem. All these models strive to reduce the quadratic time complexity of the attention mechanism to approximate linear time complexity while minimizing the loss in quality due to the effective compression of the long context. Inspired by the cache and virtual memory concepts in computer architecture, we improve the work presented in Long-Short Transformer (Transformer-LS) that implements a sliding window for the short attention and compressed contextual segments for the long attention. Our enhancements include augmenting the architecture with attention on dynamically retrieved uncompressed context segments that indicate high attention at the compressed level. Similar to the cache and virtual memory principle in computers, where in case of a cache or page miss, not only the needed data is retrieved from the random-access memory or the hard disk, but the nearby following data is also obtained. On a similar note, we too retrieve the nearby segments in uncompressed form when a high attention occurs at the compressed level. We further enhance the long-short transformer by augmenting the long attention with compressed overlapping segments to reduce the loss in quality due to segment fragmentation that occurs in sequences with long context. Our results indicate significant improvements over the base line of the long-short transformer in terms of perplexity on the popular benchmarks",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Abstractive summarization models often produce summaries that are inconsistent with the content of the original text. Contrastive learning is an effective strategy for improving the factual consistency of generative text summarization. However, the success of contrastive learning depends largely on the construction of the dataset. Existing contrastive learning methods usually directly consider the gold summaries of summary datasets as factual summaries, and ignore the factual consistency problem of the gold summaries. They mainly focus on the generation of hallucinated summaries, i.e., negative samples, and the construction for negative samples is usually based on the gold summaries rather than from the perspective of the model itself. The quality of the positive and negative samples of these methods is not high enough, which will affect the effect of contrastive learning. Therefore, this paper proposes Model Self-Improvement Contrastive Learning: a method to improve the factual consistency of abstractive summarization. This method begins with fine-tuning the model itself, considering its already acquired knowledge of generating summaries. It focuses on the inference aspect of the generation phase, and delves deeper into the content that may cause factual errors. At the same time, it takes into account the factual consistency of both the positive and negative samples, constructs the negative samples in a targeted manner and improves the positive samples. It then further improves the factual consistency of the model through contrastive learning",

We introduce NormAd, a novel dataset, which includes 2.6k stories that represent social and cultural norms from 75 countries, to assess the ability of LLMs to adapt to different granular levels of socio-cultural contexts such as the country of origin, its associated cultural values, and prevalent social norms. Our study reveals that LLMs struggle with cultural reasoning across all contextual granularities, showing stronger adaptability to English-centric cultures over those from the Global South. Even with explicit social norms, the top-performing model, Mistral-7b-Instruct, achieves only 81.8\\% accuracy, lagging behind the 95.6\\% achieved by humans. Evaluation on NormAd further reveals that LLMs struggle to adapt to stories involving gift-giving across cultures. Due to inherent agreement or sycophancy biases, LLMs find it considerably easier to assess the social acceptability of stories that adhere to norms than those that deviate",

Traditional MMEA methods derive the visual embeddings of entities and combine them with other modal data for alignment by embedding similarity comparison.

To address these challenges, we propose MM-ChatAlign, a novel framework that utilizes the visual reasoning abilities of MLLMs for MMEA. The framework features an embedding-based candidate collection module that adapts to various knowledge representation strategies, effectively filtering out irrelevant reasoning candidates. Additionally, a reasoning and rethinking module, powered by MLLMs, enhances alignment by efficiently utilizing multimodal information.

The first step can be implemented with a high-performing discriminative model and steps 2 and 3 can be implemented either via prompted or fine-tuned LLMs. A key property of this approach is that the step 2 critique model can give fine-grained feedback about errors, made possible by offloading the discrimination to a separate model in step 1.

In RAG, documents are first chunked. Relevant chunks are then retrieved for a specific user query, which are passed as context to a synthesizer LLM to generate the query response. However, the retrieval step can limit performance, as incorrect chunks can lead the synthesizer LLM to generate a false response. This work proposes a zero-shot adaptation of standard dense retrieval steps for more accurate chunk recall. Specifically, a chunk is first decomposed into atomic statements. A set of synthetic questions are then generated on these atoms (with the chunk as the context). Dense retrieval involves finding the closest set of synthetic questions, and associated chunks, to the user query. It is found that retrieval with the atoms leads to higher recall than retrieval with chunks. Further performance gain is observed with retrieval using the synthetic questions generated over the atoms. Higher recall at the retrieval step enables higher performance of the enterprise LLM using the RAG pipeline",

Some methods have proven effective in boosting accuracy by introducing extra verifiers to assess these paths. However, existing verifiers, typically trained on binary-labeled reasoning paths, fail to fully utilize the relative merits of intermediate steps, thereby limiting the effectiveness of the feedback provided. To overcome this limitation, we propose Tree-based Preference Learning Verifier (Tree-PLV), a novel approach that constructs reasoning trees via a best-first search algorithm and collects step-level paired data for preference training. Compared to traditional binary classification, step-level preferences more finely capture the nuances between reasoning steps, allowing for a more precise evaluation of the complete reasoning path. We empirically evaluate Tree-PLV across a range of arithmetic and commonsense reasoning tasks, where it significantly outperforms existing benchmarks. For instance, Tree-PLV achieved substantial performance gains over the Mistral-7B self-consistency baseline on GSM8K (67.55\\% → 82.79\\%), MATH (17.00\\% → 26.80\\%), CSQA (68.14\\% → 72.97\\%), and StrategyQA (82.86\\% → 83.25\\%). Additionally, our study explores the appropriate granularity for applying preference learning, revealing that step-level guidance provides feedback that better aligns with the evaluation of the reasoning process",

    "abstract": "Multi-label text classification (MLTC) aims to assign at least one label from a vast label space to a document. This task is challenging due to the large number of labels, which can range from hundreds to thousands, and the potential interdependence of labels. While previous efforts have achieved success in fully-supervised settings, they have limited performance in more practical weakly-supervised settings. Despite its potential benefits, an auxiliary task of word-to-label alignment that aligns words in the input text to the large label space has been largely overlooked in existing work. Word-to-label alignment is significant, as it provides valuable insights into how words contribute to the overall classification of a document. However, existing MLTC datasets lack ground truth labels for word-to-label alignment for supervised training. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework called OT-Class, which incorporates unsupervised word-to-label alignment into MLTC using optimal transport (OT). Our framework tackles MLTC in a multi-task setting, comprising a primary task that classifies documents using a standard text classification algorithm and an auxiliary task that identifies corresponding labels for all input document words via optimal transport. Our experiments demonstrate that OT-Class outperforms baselines that do not utilize word-to-label alignment, highlighting its effectiveness. A detailed analysis reveals that OT-Class has an amplified advantage in fine-grained label spaces and appropriately influences predictions through word-to-label alignment",

    "abstract": "Prompting serves as the major way humans interact with Large Language Models (LLM). Commercial AI systems commonly define the role of the LLM in system prompts. For example, ChatGPT uses ``You are a helpful assistant'' as part of the default system prompt. Despite current practices to add personas in system prompts, it is unclear how different personas affect the models' performance. In this study, we present a systematic evaluation of personas in system prompts. We create a list of 162 roles covering 6 types of interpersonal relationships and 8 domains of expertise. Through extensive analysis of 4 popular LLMs and 2410 factual questions, we show that adding personas in system prompts does not improve the models' performance over a range of questions compared with the control setting where no persona is added. Despite this, further analysis suggests that the gender, type, and domain of the persona could all affect the consequential prediction accuracy. We further experimented with a list of persona search strategies and found that while aggregating the results from the best personas for each question could significantly lead to higher prediction accuracies, automatically identifying the best persona is challenging and may not be significantly better than random selection. Overall, our result suggests that while adding persona may lead to performance gain in certain settings, the effect of each persona can be largely random",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Human label variation (HLV) is a valuable source of information that arises when multiple human annotators provide different labels for valid reasons. In Natural Language Inference (NLI) earlier approaches to capturing HLV involve either collecting annotations from many crowd workers to represent human judgment distribution (HJD) or use expert linguists to provide detailed explanations for their chosen labels. While the former method provides denser HJD information, obtaining it is resource-intensive. In contrast, the latter offers richer textual information but it is challenging to scale up to many human judges. Besides, large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as evaluators (``LLM judges'') but with mixed results, and few works aim to study HJDs. This study proposes to exploit LLMs to approximate HJDs using a small number of expert labels and explanations. Our experiments show that a few explanations significantly improve LLMs' ability to approximate HJDs with and without explicit labels, thereby providing a solution to scale up annotations for HJD. However, fine-tuning smaller soft-label aware models with the LLM-generated model judgment distributions (MJDs) presents partially inconsistent results: while similar in distance, their resulting fine-tuned models and visualized distributions differ substantially. We show the importance of complementing instance-level distance measures with a global-level shape metric and visualization to more effectively evaluate MJDs against human judgment distributions",

The agents ask questions on the user's behalf, allowing the user to discover unknown unknowns serendipitously. To facilitate user interaction, Co-STORM assists users in tracking the discourse by organizing the uncovered information into a dynamic mind map, ultimately generating a comprehensive report as takeaways. For automatic evaluation, we construct the WildSeek dataset by collecting real information-seeking records with user goals.

We find positive and significant correlations between these ratios and successful image generations.

However, the trade-offs between helpfulness and safety are often found to be a problem, which makes it difficult for a model trained towards one objective to perform well on both.

MOLMA can efficiently address the conflicting or the dominating learning signal issue caused by the trade-offs of inherent, often conflicting, multi-objectives underlying the language model alignment task.

Moreover, we provide an in-depth analysis of the multimodal ethical understanding of existing English and Chinese LVLMs. VALUE-Bench is very helpful to enhance the evaluation of LVLMs' multimodal ethical understanding by providing a nuanced view of their ethical understanding level and ethical decision-making ability in both English and Chinese contexts",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Despite Large Language Models (LLMs) have performed impressively in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, their inherent hallucination phenomena severely challenge their credibility in complex reasoning. Combining explainable Knowledge Graphs (KGs) with LLMs is a promising path to address this issuse. However, structured KGs are difficult to utilize, and how to make LLMs understand and incorporate them is a challenging topic. We thereby reorganize a more efficient structure of KGs, while designing the KG-related instruction tuning and continual pre-training strategies to enable LLMs to learn and internalize this form of representation effectively. Moreover, we construct subgraphs to further enhance retrieval capabilities of KGs via CoT reasoning. Extensive experiments on two KGQA datasets demonstrate that our model achieve convincing performance compared to strong baselines\\footnote{All the code, data and models will be publicly available at \\url{https://anonymous.com}}",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Morphologically rich languages are notoriously challenging to process for downstream NLP applications. This paper presents a new pretrained language model, ByT5-Sanskrit, designed for NLP applications involving the morphologically rich language Sanskrit. We evaluate ByT5-Sanskrit on established Sanskrit word segmentation tasks, where it outperforms previous data-driven approaches by a considerable margin and matches the performance of the current best lexicon-based model. It is easier to deploy and more robust to data not covered by external linguistic resources. It also achieves new state-of-the-art results in Vedic Sanskrit dependency parsing and OCR post-correction tasks. Additionally, based on the Digital Corpus of Sanskrit, we introduce a novel multitask dataset for the joint training of Sanskrit word segmentation, lemmatization, and morphosyntactic tagging tasks. We fine-tune ByT5-Sanskrit on this dataset, creating a versatile multitask model for various downstream Sanskrit applications. We have used this model in Sanskrit linguistic annotation projects, in information retrieval setups, and as a preprocessing step in a Sanskrit machine translation pipeline. We also show that our approach yields new best scores for lemmatization and dependency parsing of other morphologically rich languages. We thus demonstrate that byte-level pretrained language models can achieve excellent performance for morphologically rich languages, outperforming tokenizer-based models and presenting an important vector of exploration when constructing NLP pipelines for such languages",

    "title": "Large Language Models are In-context Teachers for Knowledge Reasoning",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting teaches large language models (LLMs) in context to reason over queries that require more than mere information retrieval. However, human experts are usually required to craft demonstrations for in-context learning (ICL), which is expensive and has high variance. More importantly, how to craft helpful reasoning exemplars for ICL remains unclear. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs can be better in-context teachers for knowledge reasoning. We follow the ``encoding specificity'' hypothesis in human's memory retrieval to assume in-context exemplars at inference should match the encoding context in training data. We are thus motivated to propose Self-Explain to use one LLM's self-elicited explanations as in-context demonstrations for prompting it as they are generalized from the model's training examples. Self-Explain is shown to significantly outperform using human-crafted exemplars and other baselines. We further reveal that for in-context teaching, rationales by distinct teacher LLMs or human experts that more resemble the student LLM's self-explanations are better demonstrations, which supports our encoding specificity hypothesis. We then propose Teach-Back that aligns the teacher LLM with the student to enhance the in-context teaching performance. For example, Teach-Back enables a 7B model to teach the much larger GPT-3.5 in context, surpassing human teachers by around 5% in test accuracy on medical question answering",

In this work, we focus on investigating machine unlearning for LLMs motivated by data protection regulations. In contrast to the growing literature on fine-tuning methods to achieve unlearning, we focus on a comparatively lightweight alternative called soft prompting to realize the unlearning of a subset of training data. With losses designed to enforce forgetting as well as utility preservation, our framework Soft Prompting for Unlearning (SPUL) learns prompt tokens that can be appended to an arbitrary query to induce unlearning of specific examples at inference time without updating LLM parameters. We conduct a rigorous evaluation of the proposed method and our results indicate that SPUL can significantly improve the trade-off between utility and forgetting in the context of text classification with LLMs. We further validate our method using multiple LLMs to highlight the scalability of our framework and provide detailed insights into the choice of hyperparameters and the influence of the size of unlearning data.

Examining each language property individually, we systematically analyze how differences between English and a target language influence the capacity to align the language with an English pretrained representation space. We do so by artificially manipulating the English sentences in ways that mimic specific characteristics of the target language, and reporting the effect of each modification on the quality of alignment with the representation space. We show that while properties such as the script or word order only have a limited impact on the alignment quality, the degree of lexical matching between the two languages, which we define using a measure of translation entropy, greatly affects it",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) present strong general capabilities, and a current compelling challenge is stimulating their specialized capabilities, such as machine translation through low-cost instruction tuning. The standard data for instruction-following is organized as a con-catenated series of instructions, inputs, and outputs. Due to the inherent pattern of the attention mechanism in LLMs, these models tend to concentrate more on nearby tokens. Consequently, there is a high risk of forgetting instructions during the decoding process, particularly when dealing with long contexts. To alleviate the instruction forgetting issue on translation, we propose SWIE (Segment-Weighted Instruction Embedding) and an instruction-following dataset OVERUNDER. SWIE improves the model instruction understanding by adding an instruction representation on the following input and response representations. OVERUNDER improves model faithfulness by comparing over-translation and under-translation samples with the correct translation. We apply our methods to two mainstream open-source LLMs, i.e., BLOOM and LLaMA. Experimental results demonstrate that using SWIE and OVERUNDER in models improves translation performance and faithfulness over the strong baselines. Furthermore, SWIE improves the model performance on various long-context scenarios, including in-context translation, translation on language direction in the instruction-tuning corpus, and translation on zero-shot language pairs. The effectiveness of SWIE is demonstrated on the IFEval instruction-following test set, indicating its potential for broader task applicability",

We use Tree Transformers to generate sentence encodings, while a graph attention network models inter- and intra-sentence dependencies. During training, we implement bidirectional information propagation from word-to-sentence-to-document and vice versa, which enriches the contextual representation.

    "abstract": "Human perception of language depends on personal backgrounds like gender and ethnicity. While existing studies have shown that large language models (LLMs) hold values that are closer to certain societal groups, it is unclear whether their prediction behaviors on subjective NLP tasks also exhibit a similar bias. In this study, leveraging the POPQUORN dataset which contains annotations from diverse demographic backgrounds, we conduct a series of experiments on six popular LLMs to investigate their capabilities to understand demographic differences and their potential biases in predicting politeness and offensiveness. We find that for both tasks, model predictions are closer to the labels from White participants than Asian and Black participants. While we observe no significant differences between the two gender groups for most of the models for offensiveness, LLMs' predictions for politeness are significantly closer to women's ratings. We further explore prompting with specific identity information and show that including a target demographic label in the prompt does not consistently improve models' performance. Our results suggest that LLMs hold gender and racial biases for subjective NLP tasks, and that demographic-infused prompts alone may not be sufficient to mitigate such biases",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) can align language models with non-differentiable reward signals, such as human preferences. However, a major challenge arises from the sparsity of these reward signals - typically, there is only a single reward for an entire output. This sparsity of rewards can lead to inefficient and unstable learning. To address this challenge, our paper introduces an novel framework that utilizes the critique capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce intermediate-step rewards during RL training. Our method involves coupling a policy model with a critic language model, which is responsible for providing comprehensive feedback of each part of the output. This feedback is then translated into token or span-level rewards that can be used to guide the RL training process. We investigate this approach under two different settings: one where the policy model is smaller and is paired with a more powerful critic model, and another where a single language model fulfills both roles. We assess our approach on three text generation tasks: sentiment control, language model detoxification, and summarization. Experimental results show that incorporating artificial intrinsic rewards significantly improve both sample efficiency and the overall performance of the policy model, supported by both automatic and human evaluation",

However, LLMs are susceptible to societal biases due to their exposure to human-generated data. Given that LLMs are being used to gain insights into various societal aspects, it is essential to mitigate these biases. To that end, our study investigates the presence of implicit gender biases in multi-agent LLM interactions and proposes two strategies to mitigate these biases. We begin by creating a dataset of scenarios where implicit gender biases might arise, and subsequently develop a metric to assess the presence of biases. Our empirical analysis reveals that LLMs tend to generate outputs with substantial male biases ($\\geq \\approx 50\\%$ of the time). Furthermore, these biases tend to escalate following multi-agent interactions. To mitigate them, we propose two strategies: self-reflection with in-context examples (ICE); and supervised fine-tuning.

While several applications stand to benefit from this, machine translation systems remain confined to dealing with language in speech and text. In this work, we introduce a new task of translating images to make them culturally relevant. First, we build three pipelines comprising state-of-the-art generative models to do the task. Next, we build a two-part evaluation dataset -- (i) concept: comprising 600 images that are cross-culturally coherent, focusing on a single concept per image; and (ii) application: comprising 100 images curated from real-world applications. We conduct a multi-faceted human evaluation of translated images to assess for cultural relevance and meaning preservation.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "To better interpret the intrinsic mechanism of large language models (LLMs), recent studies focus on monosemanticity on its basic units. A monosemantic neuron is dedicated to a single and specific concept, which forms a one-to-one correlation between neurons and concepts. Despite extensive research in monosemanticity probing, it remains unclear whether monosemanticity is beneficial or harmful to model capacity. To explore this question, we revisit monosemanticity from the feature decorrelation perspective and advocate for its encouragement. We experimentally observe that the current conclusion by \\citet{wang2024learning}, which suggests that decreasing monosemanticity enhances model performance, does not hold when the model changes. Instead, we demonstrate that monosemanticity consistently exhibits a positive correlation with model capacity, in the preference alignment process. Consequently, we apply feature correlation as a proxy for monosemanticity and incorporate a feature decorrelation regularizer into the dynamic preference optimization process. The experiments show that our method not only enhances representation diversity and activation sparsity but also improves preference alignment performance",

    "abstract": "Humans are thought to predict the next words during sentence comprehension, but under unique circumstances, they demonstrate an ability for longer coherent word sequence prediction. In this paper, we investigate whether Transformers can model such hyperprediction observed in humans during sentence processing, specifically in the context of Japanese buzzer quizzes. We conducted eye-tracking experiments where the participants read the first half of buzzer quiz questions and predicted the second half, while we modeled their reading time using the GPT-2. The results showed that the GPT-2 can partially capture human hyperprediction. When the language model was fine-tuned with quiz questions, the perplexity value decreased. Lower perplexity corresponded to higher psychometric predictive power; however, excessive data for fine-tuning led to a decrease in perplexity and the fine-tuned model exhibited a low psychometric predictive power. Overall, our findings suggest that a moderate amount of data is required for fine-tuning in order to model human hyperprediction",

    "abstract": "Many studies show evidence for cognitive abilities in Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs). Researchers have evaluated the cognitive alignment of PLMs, i.e., their correspondence to adult performance across a range of cognitive domains. More recently, the focus has shifted to the developmental alignment of these models: identifying phases during training where improvements in model performance track improvements in children's thinking over development. However, challenges to this use are twofold: (1) PLMs have very different architectures than human minds and brains, and the data sets on which they are trained differ in many ways from the inputs children receive. (2) The \"outputs\" of PLMs are different from the behavioral measures that cognitive scientists collect in their experiments and evaluate their theories against. In this paper, we distill lessons learned from using PLMs for cognitive modeling and outline the pitfalls of attempting to use PLMs, not as engineering artifacts, but as cognitive science and developmental science models. We review assumptions used by researchers to map measures of PLM performance to measures of human performances and then, enumerate criteria for using PLMs as credible accounts of cognition and cognitive development",

To tackle these challenges, we introduce a curated dataset to evaluate methods, test attack strategies, and propose lightweight, real-time defenses to prevent the generation of copyrighted text, ensuring the safe and lawful use of LLMs. Our experiments demonstrate that current LLMs frequently output copyrighted text, and that jailbreaking attacks can significantly increase the volume of copyrighted output.

Our theory is grounded in empirical demonstrations of LMs exhibiting different character traits, such as accurate and logically coherent beliefs and helpful and harmless intentions. We infer belief and intent from LM behaviour, finding their consistency varies with model size, fine-tuning, and prompting. In addition to characterising LM character traits, we evaluate how these traits develop over the course of an interaction. We find that traits such as truthfulness and harmfulness can be stationary, i.e., consistent over an interaction, in certain contexts but may be reflective in different contexts, meaning they mirror the LM's behaviour in the preceding interaction.

We find that current automatic poetry systems are considerably underdiverse along multiple dimensions --- they often do not rhyme sufficiently, are semantically too uniform and even do not match the length distribution of human poetry.

Large language models (LLMs) can be effective at interpreting unstructured text in reports, but they often hallucinate due to a lack of domain-specific knowledge, leading to reduced accuracy and posing challenges for use in clinical settings. To address this, we propose a novel framework that aligns generated internal knowledge with external knowledge through in-context learning (ICL). Our framework employs a retriever to identify relevant units of internal or external knowledge and a grader to evaluate the truthfulness and helpfulness of the retrieved internal-knowledge rules to align and update the knowledge bases. Our knowledge-conditioned approach also improves the accuracy and reliability of LLM outputs by addressing the extraction task in two stages: (i) lung lesion finding detection and primary structured field parsing, followed by (ii) further parsing of lesion description text into additional structured fields. Extensive experiments with expert-curated test datasets demonstrate that this ICL approach can increase the F1 score for key fields (lesion size, margin and solidity) by an average of 12.9\\% over existing ICL methods",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "We investigate how to elicit compositional generalization capabilities in large language models (LLMs). Compositional generalization empowers LLMs to solve complex problems by combining foundational skills, a critical reasoning ability akin to human intelligence. However, even the most advanced LLMs currently struggle with this form of reasoning. We examine this problem within the framework of in-context learning and find that demonstrating both foundational skills and compositional examples grounded in these skills within the same prompt context is crucial. We refer to this prompt structure as skills-in-context (SKiC). With as few as two exemplars, this in-context learning structure enables LLMs to tackle more challenging problems requiring innovative skill combinations, achieving near-perfect systematic generalization across a broad range of tasks. Intriguingly, SKiC also unlocks the latent potential of LLMs, allowing them to more actively utilize pre-existing internal skills acquired during earlier pretraining stages to solve complex reasoning problems. The SKiC structure is robust across different skill constructions and exemplar choices and demonstrates strong transferability to new tasks. Finally, inspired by our in-context learning study, we show that fine-tuning LLMs with SKiC-style data can elicit zero-shot weak-to-strong generalization, enabling the models to solve much harder problems directly with standard prompting",

    "abstract": "Different languages have distinct phonetic systems and vary in their prosodic features making it challenging to develop a Text-to-Speech (TTS) model that can effectively synthesise speech in multilingual settings. Furthermore, TTS architecture needs to be both efficient enough to capture nuances in multiple languages and efficient enough to be practical for deployment. The standard approach is to build transformer based model such as SpeechT5 and train it on large multilingual dataset. As the size of these models grow the conventional fine-tuning for adapting these model becomes impractical due to heavy computational cost. In this paper, we proposes to integrate parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) methods such as adapters and hypernetwork with TTS architecture for multilingual speech synthesis.

Recently, Reinforcement Learning (RL)-free methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have emerged, offering improved stability and scalability while retaining competitive performance relative to RL-based methods. However, while RL-free methods deliver satisfactory performance, they require significant data to develop a robust Supervised Fine-Tuned (SFT) model} and an additional step to fine-tune this model on a preference dataset, which constrains their utility and scalability. In this paper, we introduce Triple Preference Optimization (TPO), a new preference learning method designed to align an LLM with three preferences without requiring a separate SFT step and using considerably less data. Through a combination of practical experiments and theoretical analysis, we show the efficacy of TPO as a single-step alignment strategy. Specifically, we fine-tuned the Phi-2 (2.7B) and Mistral (7B) models using TPO directly on the UltraFeedback dataset, achieving superior results compared to models aligned through other methods such as SFT, DPO, KTO, IPO, CPO, and ORPO. Moreover, the performance of TPO without the SFT component led to notable improvements in the MT-Bench score, with increases of +1.27 and +0.63 over SFT and DPO, respectively. Additionally, TPO showed higher average accuracy, surpassing DPO and SFT by 4.2% and 4.97% on the Open LLM Leaderboard benchmarks",

However, it only focuses on single-turn jailbreaking, given one specific query. On the contrary, the advanced LLMs are designed to handle extremely long contexts and can thus conduct multi-turn conversations. So, we propose exploring multi-turn jailbreaking, in which the jailbroken LLMs are continuously tested more than the initial conversation turn or a single target query. This is an even more serious challenge because 1) it is very common for users to continue asking relevant follow-up questions to clarify certain details, and 2) It is also possible that the initial round of jailbreaking causes the LLMs to consistently respond to additional irrelevant questions, rather than focusing on adversarially targeting each new query. %This approach significantly reduces the cost of jailbreaking. As the first step in exploring multi-turn jailbreaking, we construct a Multi-Turn Jailbreak Benchmark (**MTJ-Bench**) for benchmarking this setting and provide novel insights into this new safety threat.

The framework encompasses social scenarios including binary decision-making, covering both individual and collective decision-making contexts, and is based on Schwartz's value theory for constructing value priorities. Based on this framework, we construct a dataset, which contains a total of 1613 scenarios and 3226 decisions across 283 topics. We evaluated seven popular LLMs and the experimental results reveal commonalities in the value priorities across different LLMs, such as an emphasis on Universalism and Benevolence, while Power and Hedonism are typically given lower priority.

We conducted an extensive evaluation with 13 popular and state-of-art LLMs on SESI. The results indicate the social intelligence of LLMs still has significant room for improvement, with superficially friendliness as a primary reason for errors. Moreover, there exists a relatively low correlation between the social intelligence and academic intelligence exhibited by LLMs, suggesting that social intelligence is distinct from academic intelligence for LLMs. Additionally, while it is observed that LLMs can't ``understand'' what social intelligence is, their social intelligence, similar to that of humans, is influenced by social factors",

However, LMs struggle with the persistent challenge of catastrophic forgetting, which undermines their long-term sustainability in continual learning (CL). Existing approaches usually address the issue by incorporating old task data or task-wise inductive bias into LMs. However, old data and accurate task information are often unavailable or costly to collect, hindering the availability of current CL approaches for LMs. To address this limitation, we introduce ``MIGU''($\\textbf{M}$agn$\\textbf{I}$tude-based $\\textbf{G}$radient $\\textbf{U}$pdating for continual learning), a rehearsal-free and task-label-free method that only updates the model parameters with large magnitudes of output in LMs' linear layers. MIGU is based on our observation that the normalized magnitude distribution of the output in LMs' linear layers is different when the LM models deal with different task data. By imposing this simple constraint on the gradient update process, we can leverage the inherent behaviors of LMs, thereby unlocking their innate CL abilities. Our experiments demonstrate that MIGU is universally applicable to all three LM architectures (T5, RoBERTa, and Llama2), delivering state-of-the-art or on-par performance across continual finetuning and continual pre-training settings on four CL benchmarks. For example, MIGU brings a 15.2\\% average accuracy improvement over conventional parameter-efficient finetuning baselines in a 15-task CL benchmark. MIGU can also seamlessly integrate with all three existing CL types to further enhance performance. We include the code in the submission attachment",

    "title": "Estimating Knowledge in Large Language Models Without Generating a Single Token",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "To evaluate knowledge in large language models (LLMs), current methods query the model and then evaluate its generated responses. In this work, we ask whether evaluation can be done $\\textit{before}$ the model has generated any text. Concretely, is it possible to estimate how knowledgeable a model is about a certain entity, only from its internal computation? We study this question with two tasks: given a subject entity, the goal is to predict (a) the ability of the model to answer common questions about the entity, and (b) the factuality of responses generated by the model about the entity. Experiments with a variety of LLMs show that KEEN, a simple probe trained over internal subject representations, succeeds at both tasks --- strongly correlating with both the QA accuracy of the model per-subject and FActScore, a recent factuality metric in open-ended generation. Moreover, KEEN naturally aligns with the model's hedging behavior and faithfully reflects changes in the model's knowledge after fine-tuning. Lastly, we show a more interpretable yet equally performant variant of KEEN, which highlights a small set of tokens that correlates with the model's lack of knowledge. Being simple and lightweight, KEEN can be leveraged to identify gaps and clusters of entity knowledge in LLMs, and guide decisions such as augmenting queries with retrieval",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown exceptional results on current benchmarks when working individually. The advancement in their capabilities, along with a reduction in parameter size and inference times, has facilitated the use of these models as agents, enabling interactions among multiple models to execute complex tasks. Such collaborations offer several advantages, including the use of specialized models (e.g. coding), improved confidence through multiple computations, and enhanced divergent thinking, leading to more diverse outputs. Thus, the collaborative use of language models is expected to grow significantly in the coming years. In this work, we evaluate the behavior of a network of models collaborating through debate under the influence of an adversary. We introduce pertinent metrics to assess the adversary's effectiveness, focusing on system accuracy and model agreement. Our findings highlight the importance of a model's persuasive ability in influencing others. Additionally, we explore inference-time methods to generate more compelling arguments and evaluate the potential of prompt-based mitigation as a defensive strategy",

    "abstract": "ROME and MEMIT are largely believed to be two different model editing algorithms, with the major difference between them being the ability to perform batched edits. In this paper, we unify these two algorithms under a single conceptual umbrella, optimizing for the same goal, which we call the preservation-memorization objective. ROME uses an equality constraint to optimize this objective to perform one edit at a time, whereas MEMIT employs a more flexible least-square constraint that allows for batched edits. We generalize ROME and enable batched editing with equality constraint in the form of EMMET - an Equality-constrained Mass Model Editing algorithm for Transformers, a new batched memory-editing algorithm. EMMET can perform batched-edits up to a batch-size of 10,000, with very similar performance to MEMIT across multiple dimensions. With the introduction of EMMET, we truly unify ROME and MEMIT and show that both algorithms are equivalent in terms of their optimization objective, their abilities (singular and batched editing), their model editing performance and their limitations",

When applying these findings within a continued pretraining run on top of a well-trained 15B parameter model, we show an improvement of 9\\% in average model accuracy compared to the baseline of continued training on the pretraining set.

To address this challenge, we introduce VisCon-100K, a novel dataset derived from interleaved image-text web documents. Our approach transforms 45K web documents from the OBELICS dataset into 100K image conversation samples. We utilize GPT-4 to generate image-contextual captions and OpenChat 3.5 model to convert these captions into diverse free-form and multiple-choice question-answer pairs. Integrating this dataset for fine-tuning considerably enhances VLM performance across multiple benchmarks. Unlike methods that focus solely on fine-grained visual content, our approach leverages accompanying web context, yielding superior results. We also discover that a 'leaky modality mix,' where conversation samples contain questions answerable from both the image and its contextual caption, outperforms non-leaky combinations of captions and Q\\&A pairs. Our dataset shows strong performance with two popular VLM approaches: text-only large language model (LLM) aligned with a vision encoder using image captions data (ShareGPT4V-7b) and multimodally pretrained LLM (IDEFICS2-8b) using interleaved image-text data. In addition to releasing the VisCon-100K dataset, we provide a contextual captioner trained on this dataset, facilitating scalable fine-tuning data generation for future research and open-source applications",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance on code generation tasks. A recent application of LLMs for code generation is iterative code repair, where a model fixes an incorrect program by rationalizing about errors and generating new code. However, code repair is primarily studied on high-resource languages like Python, and the framework's efficacy is under-explored on low-resource languages. To study code repair for low-resource languages, we propose Distilling Low-Resource Repairs (DistiLRR), an approach that transfers the reasoning and code generation ability from a teacher model to a student model. Our results show that DistiLRR consistently outperforms baselines on low-resource languages, but has similar performance on high-resource languages. To investigate this behavior, we perform a further analysis and find that the correlation between rationale quality and code correctness is weaker than previously perceived. We hypothesize this weakness is magnified in low-resource settings where base models lack deep knowledge of a programming language, leading to wavering benefits of code repair between high-resource and low-resource languages",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "With increased accessibility of machine generated texts, the need for their evaluation has also increased. There are two types of text generation task for which evaluation is required. In open-ended generation tasks (OGT), the model generates de novo text without any input on which to base it. Examples include story generation. In reflective generation tasks (RGT), the model output is generated to reflect an input sequence. An example is machine translation. Evaluation of RGTs is well-researched, and typically uses metrics that compare one or more gold-standard references to the model output. Evaluation of OGTs is less well-researched, and reference-based evaluations are more challenging: as the task is not seeking to reflect an input, there are usually no references. In this paper, we propose a theory of evaluation that covers both RGT and OGT evaluation. Based on this theory, we propose an output-oriented reference generation method for OGTs, develop an automatic language quality evaluation method for OGTs, and review previous literature from this new perspective. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods across informal texts, formal texts, and domain-specific texts. We conduct a meta-evaluation to compare existing and proposed metrics, finding that our approach better aligns with human judgement",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Multilinguality is crucial for extending recent advancements in language modelling to diverse linguistic communities. To maintain high performance while representing multiple languages, multilingual models ideally align representations, allowing what is learned in one language to generalise to others. Prior research has emphasised the importance of parallel data and shared vocabulary elements as key factors for such alignment. In this study, we investigate an unintuitive novel driver of cross-lingual generalisa- tion: language imbalance. In controlled experiments on perfectly equivalent cloned languages, we observe that the existence of a predominant language during training boosts the performance of less frequent languages and leads to stronger alignment of model representations across languages. Further- more, we find that this trend is amplified with scale: with large enough mod- els or long enough training, we observe that bilingual training data with a 90/10 language split yields strictly better performance on both languages than a balanced 50/50 split. Building on these insights, we design training schemes that can improve performance in all cloned languages, even without alter- ing the training data. As we extend our analysis to real languages, we find that infrequent languages still benefit from frequent ones, yet whether language imbalance causes cross-lingual generalisation there is not conclusive",

Downstream data users therefore, neither precisely know which tables to request access for and make use of, nor can easily understand complex cryptic terminology (in column names, etc) employed by the data producers. Specifically, the lack of descriptive metadata for tables has emerged as a significant obstacle to effective data governance and utilization. To tackle this, our work introduces TabMeta, a new natural language task aimed at automatically generating comprehensive metadata for arbitrarily complex tables, enabling non-expert users to discover, understand and use relevant data more effectively. First, we curate a unique benchmark dataset for the TabMeta task, consisting of table descriptions and column descriptions for 302 tables spanning 30 industry domains. Second, we propose two novel tabular metadata evaluation strategies (a) a robust and consistent LLM-Judge based framework which aligns with human judgement and employs confidence scores suited for tabular metadata and (b) ML based metrics to capture quality of the generated metadata such as conciseness, coherence and information gain. Finally, we also show that our metadata enhancement framework substantially improves the performance of tabular data discovery and search by a factor of 3-4x",

Two datasets, posterior to this study, are known for their quality or difficulty on this task. The third one, build for this occasion, is composed of LLM outputs.

Many existing works tackle this problem by generating synthetic data from the training data and then training models on them, recently using Large Language Models (LLMs).

To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel method that augments training data by incorporating a wealth of examples from other datasets, along with the given training data. Specifically, we first retrieve relevant instances from other datasets, such as their input-output pairs or contexts, based on their similarities with the given seed data, and prompt LLMs to generate new samples with the contextual information within and across the original and retrieved samples. This approach can ensure that the generated data is not only relevant but also more diverse than what could be achieved using the limited seed data alone.

Users report that interactive task elicitation requires less effort than prompting or example labeling and surfaces novel considerations not initially anticipated by users.

We propose PETapter, a novel method that effectively combines PEFT methods with PET-style classification heads to boost few-shot learning capabilities without the significant computational overhead typically associated with full model training. We validate our approach on three established NLP benchmark datasets and one real-world argument mining dataset. We show that PETapter not only achieves comparable performance to full few-shot fine-tuning using pattern-exploiting training (PET), but also provides greater reliability and higher parameter efficiency while enabling higher modularity and easy sharing of the trained modules",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "As events progress, news articles often update with new information: if we are not cautious, we risk propagating outdated facts. In this work, we hypothesize that linguistic features indicate factual fluidity, and that we can _predict which facts in a news article will update_ using solely the text of a news article (i.e. not external resources like search engines). We test this hypothesis, first, by isolating fact-updates in large news revisions corpora. News articles may update for many reasons (e.g. factual, stylistic, narrative). We introduce the _NewsEdits 2.0_ taxonomy, an edit-intentions schema that separates fact updates from stylistic and narrative updates in news writing. We annotate over 9,200 pairs of sentence revisions and train high-scoring ensemble models to apply this schema. Then, taking a large dataset of silver-labeled pairs, we show that we can predict when facts will update in older article drafts with high precision. Finally, to demonstrate the usefulness of these findings, we construct a language model question asking (LLM-QA) abstention task. Inspired by \\newcite{kasai2022realtime}, we wish the LLM to abstain from answering questions when information is likely to become outdated. Using our predictions, we show, LLM absention reaches _near oracle levels of accuracy_",

A critical aspect of this advancement is the alignment process, which ensures that these models perform tasks in ways that align with human values and expectations. Current alignment methods, such as direct preference optimization (DPO) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), focus primarily on alignment during training phase. However, these methods often involve complex and resource-intensive training processes, posing significant challenge for their implementation. Therefore, we propose \\textbf{InferAligner}, a simple yet effective method for harmlessness alignment during inference phase. InferAligner decouples harmlessness from helpfulness. During the training phase, it focuses solely on enhancing the target model's capabilities on downstream tasks. In the inference phase, it utilizes safety steering vectors extracted from the aligned model to guide the target model towards harmlessness alignment. Experimental results show that our method can be very effectively applied to domain-specific models in finance, medicine, and mathematics, as well as to multimodal large language models (MLLMs) such as LLaVA. It significantly diminishes the attack success rate (ASR) of both harmful instructions and jailbreak instructions, while maintaining almost unchanged performance in downstream tasks",

    "abstract": "Memory-efficient finetuning of large language models (LLMs) has recently attracted huge attention with the increasing size of LLMs, primarily due to the constraints posed by GPU memory limitations and the effectiveness of these methods compared to full finetuning. Despite the advancements, current strategies for memory-efficient finetuning, such as QLoRA, exhibit inconsistent performance across diverse bit-width quantizations and multifaceted tasks. This inconsistency largely stems from the detrimental impact of the quantization process on preserved knowledge, leading to catastrophic forgetting and undermining the utilization of pretrained models for finetuning purposes. In this work, we introduce a novel quantization framework named ApiQ, designed to restore the lost information from quantization by concurrently initializing the LoRA components and quantizing the weights of LLMs. This approach ensures the maintenance of the original LLM's activation precision while mitigating the error propagation from shallower into deeper layers. Through comprehensive evaluations conducted on a spectrum of language tasks with various LLMs, ApiQ demonstrably minimizes activation error during quantization.

However, the complexities in the question types (bridge v.s. comparison questions) and the reasoning types (sequential v.s. parallel reasonings) require more novel and fine-grained prompting methods to enhance the performance of MHQA under the zero-shot setting. In this paper, we propose StoC-ToT, a Stochastic Tree-of-Thought reasoning prompting method with constrained decoding for MHQA and conduct a detailed comparison with other reasoning prompts on different question types and reasoning types. Specifically, we construct a tree-like reasoning structure by prompting the model to break down the original question into smaller sub-questions to form different reasoning paths.

To address these issues, we propose the chain-of-verification (CoV-RAG) to enhance the external retrieval correctness and internal generation consistency. Specifically, we integrate the verification module into the RAG, engaging in scoring, judgment, and rewriting. To correct external retrieval errors, CoV-RAG retrieves new knowledge using a revised query. To correct internal generation errors, we unify QA and verification tasks with a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning during training.

In this paper, we identify topical differences in gender bias across different regions and propose a region-aware bottom-up approach for bias assessment. Our proposed approach uses gender-aligned topics for a given region and identifies gender bias dimensions in the form of topic pairs that are likely to capture gender societal biases. Several of our proposed bias topic pairs are on par with human perception of gender biases in these regions in comparison to the existing ones, and we also identify new pairs that are more aligned than the existing ones. In addition, we use our region-aware bias topic pairs in a Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT)-based evaluation metric to test for gender biases across different regions in different data domains.

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative, incurable condition and a leading cause of morbidity among individuals over 65 in the US. The screening and early diagnosis of AD condition is usually based on the patient's electrical health records (HERs), including clinical observations, cognitive tests, patient profiles, and medical-imaging-aided diagnoses. However, above information for researchers is highly fragmented. One of the most critical clinical diagnostic notes is stored in structured tables using specialized terminological formats. This presents significant challenges to the accessibility and readability for non-experts, thereby hindering information processing and the development of general medical AI systems. This work proposes a novel pipeline for processing AD clinical diagnostic information: (1) we collect clinical data from the largest AD dataset of Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), explain abbreviations and terminology, and organize the information in an accessible manner for those without expert knowledge of AD. (2) Leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), we present a GPT-based method that effectively transforms tabular clinical data into fluent and faithful natural language diagnostic reports, as demonstrated by our experimental results. (3) We further explore the inherently multi-modal nature of medical data, collecting and processing a total of 10387 volumetric T1-weighted MRI scans from ADNI. (4) Finally, we discuss the existing limitations in applying multimodality EHRs for brain disease analysis and propose forward-looking directions to meet the demands of the neuroimaging domain.

Typically, pruning focuses on the resulting efficiency gains at the cost of effectiveness. However, when looking at how individual data points are affected by pruning, it turns out that a particular subset of data points always bears most of the brunt (in terms of reduced accuracy) when pruning, but this effect goes unnoticed when reporting the mean accuracy of all data points. These data points are called PIEs and have been studied in image processing, but not in NLP. In a study of various NLP datasets, pruning methods, and levels of compression, we find that PIEs impact inference quality considerably, regardless of class frequency, and that BERT is more prone to this than BiLSTM. We also find that PIEs contain a high amount of data points that have the largest influence on how well the model generalises to unseen data. This means that when pruning, with seemingly moderate loss to accuracy across all data points, we in fact hurt tremendously those data points that matter the most. We trace what makes PIEs both hard and impactful to inference to their overall longer and more semantically complex text.

Inspired by the famous weighting scheme TF-IDF, we discovered that Shannon information entropy actually has a natural dual. To complement the classical Shannon information entropy which measures the uncertainty we propose a novel information quantity, namely troenpy. Troenpy measures the certainty and commonness of the underlying distribution. So entropy and troenpy form an information twin. To demonstrate its usefulness, we propose a conditional troenpy based weighting scheme for document with class labels, namely positive class frequency (PCF). On a collection of public datasets we show the PCF based weighting scheme outperforms the classical TF-IDF and a popular Optimal Transport based word moving distance algorithm in a kNN setting with respectively more than 22.9 and 26.5 classification error reduction while the corresponding entropy based approach completely fails. We further developed a new odds-ratio type feature, namely Expected Class Information Bias(ECIB), which can be regarded as the expected odds ratio of the information twin across different classes. In the experiments we observe that including the new ECIB features and simple binary term features in a simple logistic regression model can further significantly improve the performance. The proposed simple new weighting scheme and ECIB features are very effective and can be computed with linear time complexity",

    "title": "LOOK-M: Look-Once Optimization in KV Cache for Efficient Multimodal Long-Context Inference",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Long-context Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demand substantial computational resources for inference as the growth of their multimodal Key-Value (KV) cache, in response to increasing input lengths, challenges memory and time efficiency. Unlike single-modality LLMs that manage only textual contexts, the KV cache of long-context MLLMs includes representations from multiple images with temporal and spatial relationships and related textual contexts. The predominance of image tokens means traditional optimizations for LLMs' KV caches are unsuitable for multimodal long-context settings, and no prior works have addressed this challenge. In this work, we introduce \\textbf{\\textsc{LOOK-M}}, a pioneering, fine-tuning-free approach that efficiently reduces the multimodal KV cache size while maintaining performance comparable to a full cache. We observe that during prompt prefill, the model prioritizes more textual attention over image features, and based on the multimodal interaction observation, a new proposed text-prior method is explored to compress the KV cache. Furthermore, to mitigate the degradation of image contextual information, we propose several compensatory strategies using KV pairs merging. \\textbf{\\textsc{LOOK-M}}\\footnote{The source code will be made publicly available.} demonstrates that with a significant reduction in KV Cache memory usage, such as reducing it by \\textbf{80\\%} in some cases, it not only achieves approximately \\textbf{1.3x} faster decoding but also maintains or even \\textbf{enhances} performance across a variety of long context multimodal tasks",

    "title": "Unifying Demonstration Selection and Compression for In-Context Learning",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "In-context learning (ICL) enables LLMs to exhibit spectacular emergent capabilities in various scenarios. Unfortunately, introducing demonstrations easily makes the prompt length explode, bringing a significant burden to hardware. In addition, random demonstrations usually achieve limited improvements in ICL, necessitating demonstration selection among accessible candidates. Previous studies introduce extra modules to perform demonstration compression or selection independently. In this paper, we propose an ICL framework UniICL, which \\textbf{Uni}fies demonstration selection and compression, and final response generation via a single frozen LLM. UniICL leverages the understanding ability of well-trained LLMs to independently compress different demonstrations into compressed features, and then a learnable projection layer converts features to LLM-acceptable compressed virtual tokens. Apart from substituting original demonstrations to reduce input length, virtual tokens are again used to select potential demonstrations. candidate demonstrations and inference input. Finally, current queries together with selected compressed virtual tokens are fed into the same frozen LLM for response generation. UniICL is a parameter-efficient framework that only contains 17M trainable parameters originating from the projection layer and a learnable embedding. We build UniICL upon two backbones and conduct experiments over in- and out-domain datasets of both generative and understanding tasks, encompassing ICL scenarios with plentiful and limited demonstration candidates. Results show that UniICL effectively unifies $12 \\times$ compression, demonstration selection, and response generation, efficiently scaling up the baseline from 4-shot to 64-shot ICL with 24 GB CUDA allocation\\footnote{The code and model will be released in the final version.}",

    "abstract": "Prompt learning is susceptible to intrinsic bias present in pre-trained language models (LMs), resulting in sub-optimal performance of prompt-based zero/few-shot learning. In this work, we propose a null-input prompting method to calibrate intrinsic bias encoded in pre-trained LMs. Different from prior efforts that address intrinsic bias primarily for social fairness and often involve excessive computational cost, our objective is to explore enhancing LMs' performance in downstream zero/few-shot learning while emphasizing the efficiency of intrinsic bias calibration. Specifically, we leverage a diverse set of auto-selected null-meaning inputs generated from GPT-4 to probe intrinsic bias of pre-trained LMs. Utilizing the bias-reflected probability distribution, we formulate a distribution disparity loss for bias calibration, where we exclusively update bias parameters (0.1% of total parameters) of LMs towards equal probability distribution. Experimental results show that the calibration promotes an equitable starting point for LMs while preserving language modeling abilities. Across a wide range of datasets, including sentiment analysis and topic classification, our method significantly improves zero/few-shot learning performance of LMs for both in-context learning and prompt-based fine-tuning (on average 9% and 2%, respectively)",

    "abstract": "Continual learning (CL) in large language models (LLMs) is an evolving domain that focuses on developing strategies for efficient and sustainable training. Our primary emphasis is on \\emph{continual domain-adaptive pretraining}, a process designed to equip LLMs with the ability to integrate new information from various domains while retaining previously learned knowledge and enhancing cross-domain knowledge transfer without relying on domain-specific identification. Unlike previous studies, which mostly concentrate on a limited selection of tasks or domains and primarily aim to address the issue of forgetting, our research evaluates the adaptability and capabilities of LLMs to changing data landscapes in practical scenarios. To this end, we introduce a new benchmark designed to measure the adaptability of LLMs to these evolving data environments, offering a comprehensive framework for evaluation. We examine the impact of model size on learning efficacy and forgetting, as well as how the progression and similarity of emerging domains affect the knowledge transfer within these models. Our findings uncover several key insights: (i) performance improves only if the adaptation corpora match the original pretraining scale, (ii) smaller models are particularly sensitive to continual pretraining, showing the most significant rates of both forgetting and learning, (iii) when the sequence of domains shows semantic similarity, continual pretraining enables LLMs to specialize better compared to stand-alone pretraining, and (iv) fine-tuning performance on standard benchmarks is indeed influenced by continual pretraining domains.

This paper explores a critical issue in assessing the reliability of LLMs: the consistency between their words and deeds. To quantitatively explore this consistency, we developed a novel evaluation benchmark, the Words and Deeds Consistency Test (WDCT), which establishes a strict correspondence between word-based and deed-based questions across different domains, including opinion versus action, non-ethical value versus action, ethical value versus action, and theory versus application. The evaluation results reveal a widespread inconsistency between words and deeds across LLMs and domains. Subsequently, we conducted experiments with either word alignment or deed alignment to observe their impact on the other aspect. The experiment results indicate that alignment only on words or deeds poorly and unpredictably influences the other aspect. This supports our hypothesis that the underlying knowledge guiding LLMs' choices of words or deeds is not contained within a unified space",

Despite growing interest in the subfield, a commonly voiced criticism is that it lacks actionable insights and therefore has little impact on NLP. In this paper, we seek to quantify the impact of IA research on the broader field of NLP. We approach this with a mixed-methods analysis of: (1) a citation graph of 185K+ papers built from all papers published at ACL and EMNLP conferences from 2018 to 2023, and (2) a survey of 138 members of the NLP community. Our quantitative results show that IA work is well-cited outside of IA, and central in the NLP citation graph. Through qualitative analysis of survey responses and manual annotation of 556 papers, we find that NLP researchers build on findings from IA work and perceive it is important for progress in NLP, multiple subfields, and rely on its findings and terminology for their own work. Many novel methods are proposed based on IA findings and highly influenced by them, but highly influential non-IA work cites IA findings without being driven by them. We end by summarizing what is missing in IA work today and provide a call to action, to pave the way for a more impactful future of IA research",

Our adaptable prompt-based evaluation method, Llam-Eval, offers significant flexibility in terms of evaluation model, material, criteria, and is free of cost. We evaluate GPT variations, Llama, Mixtral, Gemma, Cohere, and Gemini. Overall, we find that GPT and Cohere are powerful scientific protocol formulators.

However, we currently lack a fundamental understanding of what kinds of linguistic distances contribute to PD, and to what extent. Furthermore, studies of cross-lingual generalization are confounded by unknown quantities of CRL language traces in the training data, and by the frequent lack of availability of evaluation data in lower-resource related languages and dialects. To address these issues, we model phonological, morphological, and lexical distance as Bayesian noise processes to synthesize artificial languages that are controllably distant from the HRLN. We quantitatively and qualitatively analyse PD as a function of underlying noise parameters, offering insights on model robustness to isolated and composed linguistic phenomena, and the impact of task and HRL characteristics on PD. We calculate parameter posteriors on real CRL-HRLN pair data and show that they follow computed trends of artificial languages, demonstrating the viability of our noisers. Our framework offers a cheap solution to estimating task performance on an unseen CRL given HRLN performance using its posteriors, as well as for diagnosing observed PD on a CRL in terms of its linguistic distances from its HRLN, and opens doors to principled methods of mitigating performance degradation",

In this paper, we address two difficult open problems associated with confounding signals in translationese classification. First, we use probing to provide direct evidence that these classifiers learn and use spurious topic correlations, some potentially unknown. Second, we introduce adversarial training as a strategy to mitigate any spurious topic correlation, including those unknown apriori.

Therefore, we propose FOOL: FOur-fold Obscure Lexical, a new coarse-grained WSD dataset, which includes four different test sets designed to assess the robustness of language models in WSD tasks. Two sets feature typical WSD scenarios, while the other two include sentences with opposing contexts to challenge the models further.

To further enhance retrieval performance, knowledge distillation techniques, often leveraging robust cross-encoder rerankers, have been extensively explored. However, existing approaches primarily distill knowledge from pointwise rerankers, which assign absolute relevance scores to documents, thus facing challenges related to inconsistent standards. This paper introduces Pairwise Relevance Distillation (PairDistill) to leverage pairwise reranking, offering fine-grained distinctions between similarly relevant documents to enrich the training of dense retrieval models. Our experiments demonstrate that PairDistill outperforms existing methods, achieving new state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks. This highlights the potential of PairDistill in advancing dense retrieval techniques effectively.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we address the challenge of identifying real-world events that could have caused observed anomalies in time-series data of public indicators. Previously, this was a daunting task in a data analysis pipeline due to the open-ended nature of the answer domain. However, with the advent of modern large language models (LLMs), this task appears within reach. Our experiments on three diverse public time-series datasets shows that while LLMs can retrieve meaningful events with a single prompt, they often struggle with establishing the causal validity of these events. To enhance causal validity, we design a set of carefully crafted cross-questions that check adherence to fundamental assumptions of causal inference in a temporal setting. The responses when combined through a simple feature-based classifier, improve the accuracy of causal event attributation from average of 65\\% to 90\\%. Our approach, including the questions, features, and classifier, generalizes across different datasets, serving as a meta-layer for temporal causal reasoning on event-anomaly pairs.

We propose a new selective PEFT method, namely SparseGrad, that performs well on MLP blocks. We transfer layer gradients to a space where only about 1\\% of the layer's elements remain significant. By converting gradients into a sparse structure, we reduce the number of updated parameters.

We compare how well automatic metrics correlate to each other and whether they agree with human judgments of factuality. Our analysis reveals that while the lexical metrics are ineffective, NLI-based metrics perform well, correlating with human annotations in many settings and often outperforming supervised models.

In this paper, we explore ways to improve reasoning capabilities of LLMs through (1) exploration of different chains of thought and (2) validation of the individual steps of the reasoning process. We propose three general principles that a model should adhere to while reasoning: (i) Relevance, (ii) Mathematical Accuracy, and (iii) Logical Consistency. We apply these constraints to the reasoning steps generated by the LLM to improve the accuracy of the final generation. The constraints are applied in the form of verifiers: the model itself is asked to verify if the generated steps satisfy each constraint. To further steer the generations towards high-quality solutions, we use the perplexity of the reasoning steps as an additional verifier. We evaluate our method on 4 distinct types of reasoning tasks, spanning a total of 9 different datasets. Experiments show that our method is always better than vanilla generation, and, in 6 out of the 9 datasets, it is better than best-of N sampling which samples N reasoning chains and picks the lowest perplexity generation",

Although classifying scope is an important topic, there is minimal research on how to utilize NLP techniques to determine scope. The incorporation of unsupervised learning methods in determining textual scope presents a novel approach within the NLP field. This paper expands the use of unsupervised techniques to classify text according to its semantic specificity without directly relying on vast amounts of pre-labeled data.

In contrast to the prior methods that use random masking schemes for Masked Acoustic Modeling (MAM), we introduce a novel selective and adaptive masking strategy. Specifically, during SSL training, we progressively introduce harder regions to the model for reconstruction. Our approach automatically selects hard regions and is built on the observation that the reconstruction loss of individual frames in MAM can provide natural signals to judge the difficulty of solving the MAM pre-text task for that frame. To identify these hard regions, we employ a teacher model that first predicts the frame-wise losses and then decides which frames to mask. By learning to create challenging problems, such as identifying harder frames and solving them simultaneously, the model is able to learn more effective representations and thereby acquire a more comprehensive understanding of the speech. Quantitatively, EH-MAM outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines across various low-resource speech recognition and SUPERB benchmarks by 5%-10%. Additionally, we conduct a thorough analysis to show that the regions masked by EH-MAM effectively capture useful context across speech frames",

    "title": "Improving Linguistic Diversity of Large Language Models with Possibility Exploration Fine-Tuning",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "While Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in replicating human-like abilities, there are concerns about a reduction in the linguistic diversity of their outputs. This results in the homogenization of viewpoints and perspectives, as well as the underrepresentation of specific demographic groups. Although several fine-tuning and prompting techniques have been suggested to tackle the issue, they are often tailored to specific tasks or come with a substantial increase in computational cost and latency. This makes them challenging to apply to applications that demand very low latency, such as chatbots and virtual assistants. We propose Possibility Exploration Fine-Tuning (PEFT), a task-agnostic framework that enhances the text diversity of LLMs without increasing latency or computational cost. Given the same prompt, models fine-tuned with PEFT can simultaneously generate multiple diverse responses, each corresponding with a controllable possibility number. Experiments with Mistral 7B and LLAMA 2 on open-domain dialogue generation demonstrate that PEFT significantly enhances output diversity, as shown by a lower similarity between candidate responses. As PEFT focuses more on semantic diversity rather than lexical diversity, it can remarkably reduce demographic bias in dialogue systems",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Recent studies have highlighted the presence of cultural biases in Large Language Models (LLMs), yet often lack a robust methodology to dissect these phenomena comprehensively. Our work aims to bridge this gap by delving into the Food domain—a universally relevant yet culturally diverse aspect of human life. We introduce FmLAMA, a multilingual dataset centered on food-related cultural facts and variations in food practices. We analyze LLMs across various architectures and configurations, evaluating their performance in both monolingual and multilingual settings. By leveraging templates in six different languages, we investigate how LLMs interact with language-specific and cultural knowledge. Our findings reveal that (1) LLMs demonstrate a pronounced bias towards food knowledge prevalent in the United States; (2) Incorporating relevant cultural context significantly improves LLMs' ability to access cultural knowledge; (3) The efficacy of LLMs in capturing cultural nuances is highly dependent on the interplay between the probing language, the specific model architecture, and the cultural context in question. This research underscores the complexity of integrating cultural understanding into LLMs and emphasizes the importance of culturally diverse datasets to mitigate biases and enhance model performance across different cultural domains",

In this paper, we revisit fine-tuning such smaller models using a novel dual-encoder architecture with a joint contrastive and cross-entropy loss. Unlike previous methods that employ a fixed linear layer for predicate representations, our approach uses a second encoder to compute instance-specific predicate representations by infusing them with real entity spans from corresponding input instances. We conducted experiments on three different RE datasets from both general and biomedical domains.

    "abstract": "The tool-use Large Language Models (LLMs) that integrate with external Python interpreters have significantly enhanced mathematical reasoning capabilities for open-source LLMs, while tool-free methods chose another track: augmenting math reasoning data. However, a great method to integrate the above two research paths and combine their advantages remains to be explored. In this work, we firstly include new math questions via multi-perspective data augmenting methods and then synthesize code-nested solutions to them. The open LLMs (i.e., Llama-2) are finetuned on the augmented dataset to get the resulting models, MuMath-Code ($\\mu$-Math-Code). During the inference phase, our MuMath-Code generates code and interacts with the external python interpreter to get the execution results. Therefore, MuMath-Code leverages the advantages of both the external tool and data augmentation. To fully leverage the advantages of our augmented data, we propose a two-stage training strategy: In Stage-1, we finetune Llama-2 on pure CoT data to get an intermediate model, which then is trained on the code-nested data in Stage-2 to get the resulting MuMath-Code. Our MuMath-Code-7B achieves 83.8 on GSM8K and 52.4 on MATH, while MuMath-Code-70B model achieves new state-of-the-art performance among open methods---achieving 90.7% on GSM8K and 55.1% on MATH.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Backdoors are hidden behaviors that are only triggered once an AI system has been deployed. Bad actors looking to create successful backdoors must design them to avoid activation during training and evaluation. Since data used in these stages often only contains information about events that have already occurred, a simple backdoor trigger could be a model recognizing data that is in the future relative to when it was trained. Through prompting experiments and by probing internal activations, we show that current large language models (LLMs) can distinguish past from future events, with probes on model activations achieving 90% accuracy. We train models with backdoors triggered by a temporal distributional shift; they activate when the model is exposed to news headlines beyond their training cut-off dates. Fine-tuning on helpful, harmless and honest (HHH) data does not work well for removing simpler backdoor triggers but is effective on our backdoored models, although this distinction is smaller for the larger-scale model we tested. We also find that an activation-steering vector representing a model's internal representation of the date influences the rate of backdoor activation. We take these results as initial evidence that, at least for models at the modest scale we test, standard safety measures are enough to remove these backdoors",

In this paper, we propose a pipeline that exploits this bias to do explicit inductive inference. Our pipeline uses an LLM to transform a premise into a set of attested alternatives, and then aggregate answers of the derived new entailment inquiries to support the original inference prediction. On a directional predicate entailment benchmark, we demonstrate that by applying this simple pipeline, we can improve the overall performance of LLMs on inference and substantially alleviate the impact of their attestation bias",

However, existing works have not yet focused on this specific modality or on creative text in general regarding machine-generated content detection methods and datasets. In response, we have curated the first dataset of high-quality synthetic lyrics and conducted a comprehensive quantitative evaluation of various few-shot content detection approaches, testing their generalization capabilities and complementing this with a human evaluation. Our best few-shot detector, based on LLM2Vec, surpasses stylistic and statistical methods, which shown competitive in other domains at distinguishing human-written from machine-generated content. It also shown good generalization capabilities to new artists and models, and effectively detects post-generation paraphrasing.

We train reward models on various popular truthfulness datasets and subsequently evaluate their political bias. Our findings reveal that optimizing reward models for truthfulness on these datasets tends to result in a left-leaning political bias. We also find that existing open-source reward models (i.e. those trained on standard human preference datasets) already show a similar bias and that the bias is larger for larger models.

OPPU integrates parametric user knowledge in the personal PEFT parameters with non-parametric knowledge from retrieval and profiles, adapting LLMs to user behavior shifts. Experimental results demonstrate that OPPU significantly outperforms existing prompt-based methods across seven diverse tasks in the LaMP benchmark.

We empirically validate our framework by showing that humans can consistently evaluate stories based on PDS (0.72 Krippendorff's alpha). We also explore techniques for automating the PDS to easily scale future analyses. GPT-4o, combined with a novel Mixture-of-Personas (MoP) prompting strategy, achieves an average Spearman correlation of 0.51 with human judgment while Llama-3-70B scores as high as 0.68 for empathy.

However, their performance decreases on tasks requiring deeper reasoning steps. Recent techniques aim to combine the strengths of both reasoning programs and LLMs by converting natural language problems into formal logic specifications, thereby enhancing reasoning task performance. Despite these advancements, LLMs often struggle with ambiguities and complex cases, leading to reasoning errors in the formal method step. In this paper, based on the observation that LLMs can provide the implicit common sense facts when asked explicitly, we propose \\textsc{iLens} (\\textbf{I}terative \\textbf{L}ogical \\textbf{E}nhancement via \\textbf{N}eurosymbolic Computation and Common \\textbf{S}ense), a new iterative neurosymbolic system for logical inferences which integrates the two systems in an iterative manner. Initially, we translate the problem specifications into AMR graphs, and then convert them into first-order logic (FOL) expressions to minimize inaccurate interpretations from natural language to FOL. Subsequently, we use formal theorem provers (Prover9, Mace4) to deduce the conclusion. Within this process, we ask the theorem prover to generate counterexamples based on the given premises when the theorem prover fails to provide a definite answer, then prompting the LLM to identify any implicit common sense facts. These facts are then incorporated back into the theorem to attempt proof completion. Through the iterative steps and leveraging the GPT-4 API in conjunction with Prover9 and Mace4, our new proposed \\textsc{iLens} system significantly reduces uncertain and error cases and achieves 80.22\\% accuracy on the challenging FOLIO dataset, setting a new state of the art",

    "abstract": "With rapid progress made in language qualities such as fluency and consistency via large language models (LLMs), there has been increasing interest in assessing alignment with diverse human preferences. Traditional metrics heavily rely on lexical similarity with human-written references and have been observed to suffer from a poor correlation with human evaluation. Furthermore, they ignore the diverse preferences of humans, a key aspect in evaluating open-ended tasks like story generation. Inspired by these challenges, we introduce an interpretable open-ended evaluation framework PerSE to assess the alignment with a specific human preference. It is tuned to deduce the specific preference from a given personal profile and evaluate the alignment between the generation and the personal preference. PerSE also explains its assessment by a detailed comment or several fine-grained scores. This enhances its interpretability, making it more suitable to tailor a personalized generation. Our 13B LLaMA-2-based PerSE shows a 15.8% increase in Kendall correlation and a 13.7% rise in accuracy on zero-shot reviewers compared to GPT-4. It also outperforms GPT-4 by 46.01% in the Kendall correlation on new domains, indicating its transferability",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown capabilities close to human performance in various analytical tasks, leading researchers to use them for time and labor-intensive analyses. However, their capability to handle highly specialized and open-ended tasks in domains like policy studies remains in question. This paper investigates the efficiency and accuracy of LLMs in specialized tasks through a structured user study focusing on Human-LLM partnership. The study, conducted in two stages—Topic Discovery and Topic Assignment—integrates LLMs with expert annotators to observe the impact of LLM suggestions on what is usually human-only analysis. Results indicate that LLM-generated topic lists have significant overlap with human generated topic lists, with minor hiccups in missing document-specific topics. However, LLM suggestions may significantly improve task completion speed, but at the same time introduce anchoring bias, potentially affecting the depth and nuance of the analysis, raising a critical question about the trade-off between increased efficiency and the risk of biased analysis",

    "title": "Optimizing Class-Level Code Generation: Enhancing In-Context Learning in Large Language Models with Pruning Techniques",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Recently, many large language models (LLMs) have been proposed, showing advanced proficiency in code generation. Such generation focuses on generating independent and often method-level code, thus leaving it unclear how LLMs perform in generating more complicated tasks. To fill this research gap, researchers have studied to construct prompt to achieve good performance in complicated code generation, i.e., class-level code generation, and they have launched a corresponding benchmark, ClassEval, on generating and evaluating class-level code. However, the obvious difficulty of class-level code generation prompt construction lies in that class-level prompt has longer texts than those of method-level code generation, and at the same time the input length of the released models always has a limitation, such as: GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 with 4096 tokens and 8192 tokens limitations respectively.\\\\ Therefore, it is important to research how to construct the class-level prompt by pruning some code tokens. Through the pruning strategy, we add more code examples into prompt to deliver as many semantic information as possible to LLMs. We introduce a new pruning strategy, namely attention-guided strategy, to this research point. By this pruning strategy, we conduct experiments on code generation by GPT-3.5, a kind of LLM proved to achieve excellent performance on generation tasks. In our work, we adopt ClassEval benchmark dataset specialized for class-level code generation to conduct our experiments. Additionally, we evaluate the strategy both in method-level and class-level metrics, finding that this pruning strategy is effective to prune appropriate tokens for LLM to generate class-level code. Above all, attention-guided strategy outperforms the randomly pruning strategy with 4.2\\%, 10.2\\% and 13\\% higher class-level code generation accuracy by LLM. We also analyze the impact of the quantity of code reduction on the quality of code generation in LLM, concluding that pruning under 40\\% of code snippets with extra 4 examples included can take great advantage of the intelligence of LLM to contribute to perfect class-level code generation",

This paper provides a comprehensive survey of recent approaches to mitigating both types of misinformation in LLMs. It explores internal and external prevention methods, along with various techniques for misinformation tracing and detection.

To this end, we introduce Personalized Pieces (Per-Pcs), a framework that allows users to safely share and assemble personalized PEFT efficiently with collaborative efforts. Per-Pcs involves selecting sharers, breaking their PEFT into pieces, and training gates for each piece. These pieces are added to a pool, from which target users can select and assemble personalized PEFT using their history data. This approach preserves privacy and enables fine-grained user modeling without excessive storage and computation demands. Experimental results show Per-Pcs outperforms non-personalized and PEFT retrieval baselines, offering performance comparable to OPPU with significantly lower resource use across six tasks. Further analysis highlights Per-Pcs's robustness concerning sharer count and selection strategy, pieces sharing ratio, and scalability in computation time and storage space.

Existing evaluations of LVLMs primarily focus on the multi-faceted capabilities in natural circumstances, lacking automated and quantifiable assessment for self-driving, let alone the severe road corner cases. In this paper, we propose CODA-LM, the very first benchmark for the automatic evaluation of LVLMs for self-driving corner cases. We adopt a hierarchical data structure to prompt powerful LVLMs to analyze complex driving scenes and generate high-quality pre-annotation for human annotators, and for LVLM evaluation, we show that using the text-only large language models (LLMs) as judges reveals even better alignment with human preferences than the LVLM judges. Moreover, with CODA-LM, we build CODA-VLM, a new driving LVLM surpassing all the open-sourced counterparts on CODA-LM. Our CODA-VLM performs comparably with GPT-4V, even surpassing GPT-4V by +21.42% on the regional perception task.

While neural methods have made significant strides in this area, they often fail to fully harness the rich semantic potential of language models (LMs). Prompt learning, a novel approach that reformulates downstream tasks as cloze-style or prefix-style prediction challenges for Masked Language Models using specialized prompt templates, has shown considerable promise across various Natural Language Processing (NLP) domains. However, the dynamic word lengths typical in LJP labels present a challenge to the standard prompt templates designed for single-word [MASK] tokens commonly used in many NLP tasks. To address this gap, we introduce the Prompt4LJP framework, a pioneering method tailored to incorporate the knowledge of LMs into the LJP task by effectively accommodating dynamic word lengths in labels. This framework leverages a dual-slot prompt template and correlation scoring to maximize the utility of LMs without requiring additional resources or complex tokenization schemes. Our method significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques on the CAIL-2018 dataset, thereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability of LJP. This contribution not only advances the field of LJP but also demonstrates a novel application of prompt learning to complex tasks involving dynamic word lengths",

Focused on the fact that there is redundant information in input frames, we propose a novel deduplication method that reduces the embedded visual features by employing visual speech units. Through the proposed deduplication and Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA), VSP-LLM can be trained in a computationally efficient manner.

Traditional retrieval pipelines require tailored document parsing techniques and content extraction modules to prepare input for indexing.

To this end, we propose Document Screenshot Embedding (DSE), a novel retrieval paradigm that regards document screenshots as a unified input format, which does not require any content extraction preprocess and preserves all the information in a document (e.g., text, image and layout). DSE leverages a large vision-language model to directly encode document screenshots into dense representations for retrieval. To evaluate our method, we first craft the dataset of Wiki-SS, a 1.3M Wikipedia web page screenshots as the corpus to answer the questions from the Natural Questions dataset. In such a text-intensive document retrieval setting, DSE shows competitive effectiveness compared to other text retrieval methods relying on parsing. For example, DSE outperforms BM25 by 17 points in top-1 retrieval accuracy. Additionally, in a mixed-modality task of slide retrieval, DSE significantly outperforms OCR text retrieval methods by over 15 points in nDCG@10. These experiments show that DSE is an effective document retrieval paradigm for diverse types of documents. Model checkpoints, code, and Wiki-SS collection will be released",

We do, curiously, observe languages previously unseen by MLMs consistently benefit from transfer from \\textit{almost any} language. We additionally use our modular approach to quantify negative interference efficiently and categorize languages accordingly.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offers an effective approach for addressing question answering (QA) tasks. However, the imperfections of the retrievers in RAG models often result in the retrieval of irrelevant information, which could introduce noises and degrade the performance, especially when handling multi-hop questions that require multiple steps of reasoning. To enhance the multi-hop reasoning ability of RAG models, we propose TRACE. TRACE constructs knowledge-grounded reasoning chains, which are a series of logically connected knowledge triples, to identify and integrate supporting evidence from the retrieved documents for answering questions. Specifically, TRACE employs a KG Generator to create a knowledge graph (KG) from the retrieved documents, and then uses an Autoregressive Reasoning Chain Constructor to build reasoning chains. Experimental results on three multi-hop QA datasets show that TRACE achieves an average performance improvement of up to 14.03% compared to using all the retrieved documents. Moreover, the results indicate that using reasoning chains as context, rather than the entire documents, is often sufficient to correctly answer questions",

To address this, we introduce SDS-CLIP, a lightweight and sample-efficient distillation method to enhance CLIP's compositional visio-linguistic reasoning. Our approach fine-tunes CLIP using a distillation objective borrowed from large text-to-image generative models like Stable-Diffusion, which are known for their strong visio-linguistic reasoning abilities. On the challenging Winoground benchmark, SDS-CLIP improves the visio-linguistic performance of various CLIP models by up to 7%, while on the ARO dataset, it boosts performance by up to 3%.

In this paper, we begin by examining this phenomenon by focusing on knowledge understanding and instruction following, with the latter identified as the main contributor to forgetting during fine-tuning. Consequently, we propose the Instruction Vector (IV) framework to capture model representations highly related to specific instruction-following capabilities, thereby making it possible to understand model-intrinsic forgetting. Through the analysis of IV dynamics pre and post-training, we suggest that fine-tuning mostly adds specialized reasoning patterns instead of erasing previous skills, which may appear as forgetting. Building on this insight, we develop IV-guided training, which aims to preserve original computation graph, thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Empirical tests on three benchmarks confirm the efficacy of this new approach, supporting the relationship between IVs and forgetting. Our code will be made available soon",

    "abstract": "With the recent advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), efforts have been made to leverage LLMs in crucial social science study methods, including predicting human features of social life such as presidential voting. Existing works suggest that LLMs are capable of generating human-like responses. Nevertheless, it is unclear how well LLMs work and where the plausible predictions derive from. This paper critically examines the performance of LLMs as social predictors, pointing out the source of correct predictions and limitations. Based on the notion of mutability that classifies social features, we design three realistic settings and a novel social prediction task, where the LLMs make predictions with input features of the same mutability and accessibility with the response feature. We find that the promising performance achieved by previous studies is because of input shortcut features to the response, which are hard to capture in reality; the performance degrades dramatically to near-random after removing the shortcuts. With the comprehensive investigations on various LLMs, we reveal that LLMs struggle to work as expected on social prediction when given ordinarily available input features without shortcuts. We further investigate possible reasons for this phenomenon and suggest potential ways to enhance LLMs for social prediction",

To overcome the challenge of cross-task generalization, task-level LoRA combination is proposed, which does not require training a model for new tasks. Instead, it learns the LoRA combination weights based on a small number of samples to form the task model. However, task-level LoRA combination only utilize a few task modules due to its reliance on the weight enumeration method, and it also overlooks the specificity between different instances. Therefore, we proposed an instance-level LoRA composition for cross-task generalization, which selects appropriate multiple task LoRAs for each input instance and dynamically determines the composition weights.

Although uncertainty-based selection is unreliable with few annotated data, we present CoverICL, an adaptive graph-based selection algorithm, that effectively incorporates uncertainty sampling into selective annotation for ICL. First, CoverICL builds a nearest-neighbor graph based on the semantic similarity between candidate ICL examples. Then, CoverICL employs uncertainty estimation by the LLM to identify hard examples for the task. Selective annotation is performed over the active graph of the hard examples, adapting the process to the particular LLM used and the task tackled. CoverICL selects the most representative examples by solving a Maximum Coverage problem, approximating diversity-based sampling. Extensive experiments on nine datasets and six LLMs show that, by incorporating uncertainty via coverage on the active graph, CoverICL (1) outperforms existing AL methods for ICL by 2--4.6\\% accuracy points, (2) is up to 2x more budget-efficient than SOTA methods for low-budget AL, and (3) generalizes better across tasks compared to non-graph alternatives",

    "title": "Liar, Liar, Logical Mire: A Benchmark for Suppositional Reasoning in Large Language Models",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Knights and knaves problems represent a classic genre of logical puzzles where characters either tell the truth or lie. The objective is to logically deduce each character's identity based on their statements. The challenge arises from the truth-telling or lying behavior, which influences the logical implications of each statement. Solving these puzzles requires not only direct deductions from individual statements, but the ability to assess the truthfulness of statements by reasoning through various hypothetical scenarios. As such, knights and knaves puzzles serve as compelling examples of suppositional reasoning. In this paper, we introduce $\\textit{TruthQuest}$, a benchmark for suppositional reasoning based on the principles of knights and knaves puzzles. Our benchmark presents problems of varying complexity, considering both the number of characters and the types of logical statements involved. Evaluations on $\\textit{TruthQuest}$ show that large language models like Llama 3 and Mixtral-8x7B exhibit significant difficulties solving these tasks. A detailed error analysis of the models' output reveals that lower-performing models exhibit a diverse range of reasoning errors, frequently failing to grasp the concept of truth and lies. In comparison, more proficient models primarily struggle with accurately inferring the logical implications of potentially false statements",

Our complexity measure also accounts for spurious states of a ToM problem designed to make it apparently harder. We use our method to assess the complexity of five widely adopted ToM benchmarks. On top of this framework, we design a prompting technique that augments the information available to a model with a description of how the environment changes with the agents' interactions. We name this technique Discrete World Models (DWM) and show how it elicits superior performance on ToM tasks",

However, integrating listening capabilities effectively remains a significant challenge for generalization and complex auditory task execution. In this work, we introduce WavLLM, a robust and adaptive speech large language model featuring dual encoders—a Whisper encoder for semantics and a WavLM encoder for speaker characteristics. Within the two-stage curriculum learning framework, WavLLM first builds its foundational capabilities by optimizing on mixed elementary single tasks, followed by advanced multi-task training on more complex tasks such as combinations of the elementary tasks. To enhance the flexibility and adherence to different tasks and instructions, a prompt-aware LoRA weight adapter is introduced in the second advanced multi-task training stage. We validate the proposed model on universal speech benchmarks and also apply it to specialized speech-question-answer (SQA) dataset, and speech Chain-of-Thought (CoT) evaluation set. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of speech tasks on the same model size, exhibiting robust generalization capabilities in executing complex tasks using CoT approach.

It is non-trivial to collect a large high-quality dataset of human comparisons between translations, especially for low-resource languages. To address this issue, we propose a cost-effective preference learning strategy, optimizing reward models by distinguishing between human and machine translations. In this manner, the reward model learns the deficiencies of machine translation compared to human and guides subsequent improvements in machine translation. Experimental results demonstrate that \\textit{RLHF} can effectively enhance translation quality and this improvement benefits other translation directions not trained with \\textit{RLHF}. Further analysis indicates that the model's language capabilities play a crucial role in preference learning.

It has been well explored through a two-step paradigm: initially identifying potential visual entities using object detection methods and then aligning the extracted textual entities with their corresponding visual entities. However, when it comes to fine-grained MNERG, the long-tailed distribution of textual entity categories and the performance of object detectors limit the effectiveness of traditional methods. Specifically, more detailed classification leads to many low-frequency categories, and existing object detection methods often fail to pinpoint subtle regions within images. To address these challenges, we propose the Granular Entity Mapper (GEM) framework. Firstly, we design a multi-granularity entity recognition module, followed by a reranking module based on the Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to incorporate hierarchical information of entity categories, visual cues, and external textual resources collectively for accurate fine-grained textual entity recognition. Then, we utilize a pre-trained Large Visual Language Model (LVLM) as an implicit visual entity grounder that directly deduces relevant visual entity regions from the entire image without the need for bounding box training.

This raises an intriguing question: Is it possible to predict the accuracy of LLM outputs by scrutinizing the reasoning chains they generate? To answer this research question, we introduce a benchmark, R2PE, designed specifically to explore the relationship between reasoning chains and performance in various reasoning tasks spanning five different domains. This benchmark aims to measure the falsehood of the final output of LLMs based on the reasoning steps.

We developed several datasets featuring implicit patterns, such as sequences determining answers through parity or identifying reducible terms in calculations. We then evaluated the models' understanding of these patterns under both fine-tuning and ICL across models ranging from 0.5B to 7B parameters. The results indicate that models employing ICL can quickly grasp deep patterns and significantly improve accuracy. In contrast, fine-tuning, despite utilizing thousands of times more training samples than ICL, achieved only limited improvements.

Then, we propose generalization-based approaches to unmask such deeply concealed contamination. Specifically, we examine the LLM's performance change after modifying the original benchmark by replacing the false answer choices with correct ones from other questions. Contaminated models can hardly generalize to such easier situations, where the false choices can be \\emph{not even wrong}, as all choices are correct in their memorization.

Despite their potential, LLMs are susceptible to reasoning errors and hallucinations that may be harmful in use cases where accurate reasoning is critical. This challenge underscores the need for verifiable, debuggable, and repairable LLM reasoning. Recent works have made progress toward verifiable reasoning with LLMs by using them as either (i) a reasoner over an axiomatic knowledge base, or (ii) a semantic parser for use in existing logical inference systems. However, both settings are unable to extract commonsense axioms from the LLM that are not already formalized in the knowledge base, and also lack a reliable method to repair missed commonsense inferences. In this work, we present LLM-TRes, a logical reasoning framework based on the notion of \"theory resolution\" that allows for seamless integration of the commonsense knowledge from LLMs with a verifiable logical reasoning framework that mitigates hallucinations and facilitates debugging of the reasoning procedure as well as repair. We crucially prove that repaired axioms are theoretically guaranteed to be given precedence over flawed ones in our theory resolution inference process. We conclude by evaluating on three diverse language-based reasoning tasks -- preference reasoning, deductive reasoning, and causal commonsense reasoning -- and demonstrate the superior performance of LLM-TRes vs. state-of-the-art LLM-based reasoning methods in terms of both accuracy and reasoning correctness",

In this paper, we propose an LLM-based data transformation pipeline to generate multiple-choice question-answer (MCQA) data from raw sources such as textbooks. Furthermore, we extend this process by proposing a pseudo-open-book reasoning approach, wherein student LLMs are trained to first recreate the original textbook excerpts used to generate the questions, before answering them. We evaluate our methods using the Llama2 13B model on domain-specific subsections from the MMLU testing set, and observe an improvement of up to 18.8% in testing accuracy, increasing from 45.8% to 64.6%, without accessing the corresponding MMLU training set",

    "title": "Revealing The Intrinsic Ability of Generative Text Summarizers for Irrelevant Document Detection",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "In Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), generative models are prone to performance degradation due to retrieved irrelevant documents. Adding irrelevant documents to the training data and retraining language models incurs significant costs. Supervised models can detect irrelevant documents in the retrieved results and avoid retraining, but they cannot counter domain shifts in the real world. By introducing a method that emphasizes the unique features of infrequent words, we reveal the ability of the cross-attention mechanism to detect irrelevant documents within the inputs of generative models. We present CODE, a novel irrelevant document detector using a closed-form expression rooted in cross-attention scores. Our experimental results validate the superiority of CODE under in-domain and cross-domain detection. For in-domain detection, CODE achieves a 5.80% FPR at 95% TPR vs. 30.3% by supervised baseline on the T5-Large and Delve domain. When sampling irrelevant documents from out-of-domain, the FPR of CODE decreases from 5.8% to 0.1%, while the FPR of the supervised baseline increases from 30.3% to 34.3%. For more insight, we highlight the importance of cross-attention, word frequency normalization, and integrating in-domain irrelevant documents during pretraining",

In this paper, we present World to Code (W2C), a meticulously curated multi-modal data construction pipeline that organizes the final generation output into a Python code format. Experiments have demonstrated the high quality of W2C by improving various existing visual question answering and visual grounding benchmarks across different VLMs. Further analysis also demonstrates that the new code parsing ability of VLMs presents better cross-modal equivalence than the commonly used detail caption ability.

    "abstract": "Argument mining (AM) involves extracting argument components and predicting relations between them to create argumentative graphs, which are essential for applications requiring argumentative comprehension. To automatically provide high-quality graphs, previous works require a large amount of human-annotated training samples to train AM models. Instead, we leverage a large language model (LLM) to assign pseudo-labels to training samples for reducing reliance on human-annotated training data. However, the training data weakly-labeled by the LLM are too noisy to develop an AM model with reliable performance. In this paper, to improve the model performance, we propose a center-based component detector that refines the boundaries of the detected components and a relation denoiser to deal with noise present in the pseudo-labels when classifying relations between detected components. Experimentally, our AM model improves the boundary detection obtained from the LLM by up to $16$\\% in terms of IoU75 and of the relation classification obtained from the LLM by up to $12$\\% in terms of macro-F1 score. Our AM model achieves new state-of-the-art performance in weakly-supervised AM, showing up to a $6$\\% improvement over the state-of-the-art component detector and up to a $7$\\% improvement over the state-of-the-art relation classifier.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "The idea of personality in descriptive psychology, traditionally defined through observable behavior, has now been extended to Large Language Models (LLMs) to better understand their behavior. This raises a question: do LLMs exhibit distinct and consistent personality traits, similar to humans? Existing self-assessment personality tests, while applicable, lack the necessary validity and reliability for precise personality measurements. To address this, we introduce TRAIT, a new tool consisting of 8K multi-choice questions designed to assess the personality of LLMs with validity and reliability. TRAIT is built on the psychometrically validated human questionnaire, Big Five Inventory (BFI) and Short Dark Triad (SD-3), enhanced with the ATOMIC10X knowledge graph for testing personality in a variety of real scenarios. TRAIT overcomes the reliability and validity issues when measuring personality of LLM with self-assessment, showing the highest scores across three metrics: refusal rate, prompt sensitivity, and option order sensitivity. It reveals notable insights into personality of LLM: 1) LLMs exhibit distinct and consistent personality, which is highly influenced by their training data (i.e. data used for alignment tuning), and 2) current prompting techniques have limited effectiveness in eliciting certain traits, such as high psychopathy or low conscientiousness, suggesting the need for further research in this direction",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Mixture of experts (MoE) has become the standard for constructing production-level large language models (LLMs) due to its promise to boost model capacity without causing significant overheads. Nevertheless, existing MoE methods usually enforce a constant top-$k$ routing for all tokens, which is arguably restrictive because various tokens (e.g., \"<EOS>\" vs. \"apple\") may require various numbers of experts for feature abstraction. Lifting such a constraint can help make the most of limited resources and unleash the potential of the model for downstream tasks. In this sense, we introduce **AdaMoE** to realize token-adaptive routing for MoE, where different tokens are permitted to select a various number of experts. AdaMoE makes minimal modifications to the vanilla MoE with top-$k$ routing---it simply introduces a fixed number of *null experts*, which do not consume any FLOPs, to the expert set and increases the value of $k$. AdaMoE does not force each token to occupy a fixed number of null experts but ensures the average usage of the null experts with a load-balancing loss, leading to an adaptive number of null/true experts used by each token. AdaMoE exhibits a strong resemblance to MoEs with expert choice routing while allowing for trivial auto-regressive modeling. AdaMoE is easy to implement and can be effectively applied to pre-trained (MoE-)LLMs. Extensive studies show that AdaMoE can reduce average expert load (FLOPs) while achieving superior performance. For example, on the ARC-C dataset, applying our method to fine-tuning Mixtral-8x7B can reduce FLOPs by 14.5% while increasing accuracy by 1.69%",

It has long been debated whether such categorical distinctions, referred to in philosophy as analytic vs.\\ synthetic, can be made and what effect they should have on theories and models of semantic meaning. In this paper, we use gender (male vs.\\ female) as a case study to explore whether large language models (LLMs) differentiate analytic inferences about gender (e.g., that a woman is female) from synthetic inferences (e.g., that nurses are most often female). We find that, by and large, there are not substantial mechanistic differences, but rather the difference appears to be a matter of degree--i.e., how strongly the inference is encoded and how easily it is overwritten by contextual information.

    "abstract": "In interactions between users and language model agents, user utterances frequently exhibit ellipsis (omission of words or phrases) or imprecision (lack of exactness) to prioritize efficiency. This can lead to varying interpretations of the same input based on different assumptions or background knowledge. It is thus crucial for agents to adeptly handle the inherent ambiguity in queries to ensure reliability. However, even state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) still face challenges in such scenarios, primarily due to the following hurdles: (1) LLMs are not explicitly trained to deal with ambiguous utterances; (2) the degree of ambiguity perceived by the LLMs may vary depending on the possessed knowledge. To address these issues, we propose Alignment with Perceived Ambiguity (APA), a novel pipeline that aligns LLMs to manage ambiguous queries by leveraging their own assessment of ambiguity (i.e., perceived ambiguity). Experimental results on question-answering datasets demonstrate that APA empowers LLMs to explicitly detect and manage ambiguous queries while retaining the ability to answer clear questions. Furthermore, our finding proves that APA excels beyond training with gold-standard labels, especially in out-of-distribution scenarios",

Our dataset is created by utilizing three existing multi-hop datasets: HotpotQA, 2WikiMultihopQA, and MuSiQue. Instead of relying solely on factual reasoning, we enhance the existing multi-hop questions by adding another layer of questioning that involves one, two, or all three of the following types of reasoning: commonsense, arithmetic, and symbolic.

We also design various cases to analyze the reasoning steps in the question-answering process. Our results show that models perform well on initial multi-hop questions but struggle with our extended questions, indicating that our dataset is more challenging than previous ones.

Progress on large language models (LLMs) has prompted a series of recent works applying them to KGC, e.g., via zero/few-shot prompting. Despite successes on small domain-specific datasets, these models face difficulties scaling up to text common in many real-world applications. A principal issue is that in prior methods, the KG schema has to be included in the LLM prompt to generate valid triplets; larger and more complex schema easily exceed the LLMs' context window length. Furthermore, there are scenarios where a fixed pre-defined schema is not available and we would like the method to construct an intrinsically high-quality KG with accurate information and a succinct self-generated schema. To address these problems, we propose a three-phase framework named Extract-Define-Canonicalize (EDC): open information Extraction (OIE) followed by schema definition and post-hoc Canonicalization. EDC is flexible in that it can be applied to settings where a target schema is available and when it is not; in the latter case, it constructs a schema automatically and applies self-canonicalization. We demonstrate on three KGC benchmarks that EDC is able to extract high-quality triplets without any parameter tuning and with significantly larger schemas compared to prior works. To improve performance, we further introduce a trained component that retrieves schema elements relevant to the input text; this improves the LLMs' extraction performance in a retrieval-augmented generation-like manner",

However, existing prompt-based models are primarily focused on studying prompt generation and prompt strategies with complete modality settings, which does not accurately reflect real-world scenarios where partial modality information may be missing. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive investigation into prompt learning behavior when modalities are incomplete, revealing the high sensitivity of prompt-based models to missing modalities. To this end, we propose a novel $\\underline{\\textbf{Mu}}$lti-step $\\underline{\\textbf{A}}$daptive $\\underline{\\textbf{P}}$rompt Learning $(\\textbf{MuAP}) $framework, aiming to generate multimodal prompts and perform multi-step prompt tuning, which adaptively learns knowledge by iteratively aligning modalities. Specifically, we generate multimodal prompts for each modality and devise prompt strategies to integrate them into the Transformer model. Subsequently, we sequentially perform prompt tuning from single-stage and alignment-stage, allowing each modality-prompt to be autonomously and adaptively learned, thereby mitigating the imbalance issue caused by only textual prompts that are learnable in previous works.

    "title": "Rater Cohesion and Quality from a Vicarious Perspective",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Human feedback is essential for building human-centered AI systems across domains where disagreement is prevalent, such as AI safety, content moderation, or sentiment analysis. Many disagreements, particularly in politically charged settings, arise because raters have opposing values or beliefs. Vicarious annotation is a method for breaking down disagreement by asking raters how they think others would annotate the data. In this paper, we explore the use of vicarious annotation with analytical methods for moderating rater disagreement. We employ rater cohesion metrics to study the potential influence of political affiliations and demographic backgrounds on raters' perceptions of offense. Additionally, we utilize CrowdTruth's rater quality metrics, which consider the demographics of the raters, to score the raters and their annotations. We study how the rater quality metrics influence the in-group and cross-group rater cohesion across the personal and vicarious levels",

    "title": "On the Effects of Fine-tuning Language Models for Text-Based Reinforcement Learning",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Text-based reinforcement learning involves an agent interacting with a fictional environment using observed text and admissible actions in natural language to complete a task. Previous works have shown that agents can succeed in text-based interactive environments even in the complete absence of semantic understanding or other linguistic capabilities. The success of these agents in playing such games suggests that semantic understanding may not be important for the task. This raises an important question about the benefits of LMs in guiding the agents through the game states. In this work, we show that rich semantic understanding leads to efficient training of text-based RL agents. Moreover, we describe the occurrence of semantic degeneration as a consequence of inappropriate fine-tuning of language models in text-based reinforcement learning (TBRL). Specifically, we describe the shift in the semantic representation of words in the LM, as well as how it affects the performance of the agent in tasks that are semantically similar to the training games. We believe these results may help develop better strategies to fine-tune agents in text-based RL scenarios",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Deploying large language models (LLMs) faces challenges with resource constraints and inference efficiency. Recent research has focused on using smaller task-specific models enhanced by distilling knowledge rationales from LLMs. However, previous works have primarily emphasized the effectiveness of positive knowledge distillation, while overlooking knowledge noise and the potential benefits of negative knowledge. In this paper, we first propose a general approach called quality-guided contrastive rationale distillation for reasoning capacity learning, considering contrastive learning perspectives. For positive knowledge, we collect positive rationales through self-consistency to denoise the LLM rationales generated by temperature sampling. For negative knowledge, we propose a novel approach that generates negative rationales by sampling previous iterations of smaller language models with a high temperature value. Finally, we design a contrastive loss to distill both positive and negative knowledge into smaller language models, where an online-update discriminator is used to assess the quality of the rationales, and assign weights to better optimize the training process. Through extensive experiments on multiple reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms the previous distillation methods and produces higher-quality rationales",

Despite its broad applications, the theoretical fundamentals of GCD remain underexplored, particularly in the context of formal language theory. In this work, we introduce the concept of tokenization as an inverse homomorphism, which maps the original string language to a token language defined on the alphabet of token IDs. The fact that tokenization is an inverse homomorphism is important for the efficiency of GCD, providing both a theoretical basis and an efficient construction method for the GCD algorithm. We further extend this framework to support Unicode characters, which are essential for multilingual NLP applications",

Finally, we fine-tune ViLamr on MCoT-Instruct with a meticulously designed reasoning progressive-enhancement tuning scheme, encouraging ViLamr to follow the cognitive process of ``understanding before reasoning''.

Experiments on benchmark datasets for ABSA demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) can accurately extract opinion units using a few-shot approach.

The method eliminates the need for labelled data and allows the LLM to dynamically define aspect types.

Although many benchmarks exist, they mainly focus on specific predefined model abilities, such as world knowledge, reasoning, etc. Based on these ability scores, it is hard for users to determine which LLM best suits their particular needs. To address these issues, we propose to evaluate LLMs from a user-centric perspective and design this benchmark to measure their efficacy in satisfying user needs under distinct intents. Firstly, we collect 1,846 real-world use cases from a user study with 712 participants from 23 countries. This first-hand data helps us understand actual user intents and needs in LLM interactions, forming the User Reported Scenarios (URS) dataset, which is categorized with six types of user intents. Secondly, based on this authentic dataset, we benchmark 10 LLM services with GPT-4-as-Judge. Thirdly, we show that benchmark scores align well with human preference in both real-world experience and pair-wise annotations, achieving Pearson correlations of 0.95 and 0.94, respectively. This alignment confirms that the URS dataset and our evaluation method establish an effective user-centric benchmark.

We develop language-aware and hard-negative based contrastive losses for improving the cross-lingual and fine-grained fact retrieval and verification process used within this framework.

We observe that, in previous research, researchers have often focused on how to let large language models(LLMs) correctly solve an MWP. However, focusing solely on the reasoning behind each step of a correct inference process is insufficient. We prefer that LLMs can provide guidance on the process of solving MWPs for students in educational settings. Therefore, they need to adjust the strategy based on the student's responses. We notice that, unlike existing mathematical datasets, students typically do not provide overly detailed descriptions of their steps in the real world. As a result, it is crucial for LLMs to possess the capability to understand the intention they produce those equations. We treat MEIR as a generation task, requiring models to summarize the intent in a single sentence. We also propose a data augmentation framework and utilized this framework to generate a benchmark called Grade School Math Intention(GSMI). To evaluate MEIR task, we benchmark serveral LLMs on GSMI dataset. The results indicate that there is still significant room for improvement in the performance of general-purpose LLMs on the MEIR task.

Through an analysis of LLMs' internal factual recall at each reasoning step via Knowledge Neurons, we reveal that LLMs fail to harness the critical factual associations under certain circumstances. Instead, they tend to opt for alternative, shortcut-like pathways to answer reasoning questions. By manually manipulating the recall process of parametric knowledge in LLMs, we demonstrate that enhancing this recall process directly improves reasoning performance whereas suppressing it leads to notable degradation. Furthermore, we assess the effect of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, a powerful technique for addressing complex reasoning tasks. Our findings indicate that CoT can intensify the recall of factual knowledge by encouraging LLMs to engage in orderly and reliable reasoning.

We validate RAG robustness by applying our GARAG to standard QA datasets, incorporating diverse retrievers and LLMs. The experimental results show that GARAG consistently achieves high attack success rates. Also, it significantly devastates the performance of each component and their synergy, highlighting the substantial risk that minor textual inaccuracies pose in disrupting RAG systems in the real world.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at providing information acquired during pretraining on large-scale corpora and following instructions through user prompts. This study investigates whether the quality of LLM responses varies depending on the demographic profile of users. Considering English as the global lingua franca, along with the diversity of its dialects among speakers of different native languages, we explore whether non-native English speakers receive lower-quality or even factually incorrect responses from LLMs more frequently. Our results show that performance discrepancies occur when LLMs are prompted by native versus non-native English speakers and persist when comparing native speakers from Western countries with others. Additionally, we find a strong anchoring effect when the model recognizes or is made aware of the user's nativeness, which further degrades the response quality when interacting with non-native speakers. Our analysis is based on a newly collected dataset with over 12,000 unique annotations from 124 annotators, including information on their native language and English proficiency",

In this study, we apply this technique to semantic role labeling, constructing a model that effectively captures the relationships between spans and labels and determines spans accurately. Our model integrates the characteristics of both a conventional span-based model, which predicts spans for labels, and a model that is comparable to state-of-the-art, which predicts labels for spans. In our experiments, we apply these models to NPCMJ-PT, a Japanese corpus that is annotated with semantic role labels and has about 52,500 entries. The semantic roles are defined with 32 types of labels such as Arg0, Arg1 and ArgM-LOC, which are similar to PropBank.

    "abstract": "Multilingual large language models (LLMs) have greatly increased the ceiling of performance on non-English tasks. However, the mechanisms behind multilingualism in these LLMs are poorly understood. Of particular interest is the degree to which internal representations are shared between languages. Recent work on neuron analysis of LLMs has focused on the monolingual case, and the limited work on the multilingual case has not considered the interaction between tasks and linguistic representations. In our work, we investigate how neuron activation is shared across languages by categorizing neurons into four distinct groups according to their responses across different languages for a particular input: all-shared, partial-shared, specific, and non-activated. This categorization is combined with a study of neuron attribution, i.e. the importance of a neuron w.r.t an output. Our analysis reveals the following insights: (i) the linguistic sharing patterns are strongly affected by the type of task, but neuron behavior changes across different inputs even for the same task; (ii) all-shared neurons play a key role in generating correct responses; (iii) boosting multilingual alignment by increasing all-shared neurons can enhance accuracy on multilingual tasks.

In particular, the synthetic texts generated by LLMs may infringe the IP of the data being used to train the LLMs. To this end, it is imperative to be able to perform source attribution by identifying the data provider who contributed to the generation of a synthetic text by an LLM. In this paper, we show that this problem can be solved by watermarking, i.e., by enabling an LLM to generate synthetic texts with embedded watermarks that contain information about their source(s). We identify the key properties of such watermarking frameworks (e.g., source attribution accuracy, robustness against adversaries), and propose a source attribution framework that satisfies these key properties due to our algorithmic designs. Our framework enables an LLM to learn an accurate mapping from the generated texts to data providers, which sets the foundation for effective source attribution.

    "abstract": "The global escalation in emergency department patient visits poses significant challenges to efficient clinical management, particularly in clinical triage. Traditionally managed by human professionals, clinical triage is susceptible to substantial variability and high workloads. Although large language models (LLMs) demonstrate promising reasoning and understanding capabilities, directly applying them to clinical triage remains challenging due to the complex and dynamic nature of the clinical triage task. To address these issues, we introduce TriageAgent, a novel heterogeneous multi-agent framework designed to enhance collaborative decision-making in clinical triage. TriageAgent leverages LLMs for role-playing, incorporating self-confidence and early-stopping mechanisms in multi-round discussions to improve document reasoning and classification precision for triage tasks. In addition, TriageAgent employs the medical Emergency Severity Index (ESI) handbook through a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach to provide precise clinical knowledge and integrates both coarse- and fine-grained ESI-level predictions in the decision-making process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TriageAgent outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based methods on three clinical triage test sets. Furthermore, we have released the first public benchmark dataset for clinical triage with corresponding ESI levels and human expert performance for comparison",

The prerequisite for these RPAs lies in the capability of LLMs to understand characters from fictional works. Previous efforts have evaluated this capability via basic classification tasks or characteristic imitation, failing to capture the nuanced character understanding with LLMs. In this paper, we propose evaluating LLMs' character understanding capability via the character profiling task, i.e., summarizing character profiles from corresponding materials, a widely adopted yet understudied practice for RPA development. Specifically, we construct the CROSS dataset from literature experts and assess the generated profiles by comparing ground truth references and their applicability in downstream tasks. Our experiments, which cover various summarization methods and LLMs, have yielded promising results.

The most recent studies focus on generating complete sentiment quadruples through end-to-end generative models.

To address these issues, we propose a novel Representative Chain-of-Reasoning framework (RCR), with the aim of providing representative knowledge for large language models (LLMs) and fully activating their reasoning capabilities for ASQP. Specifically, we develop a Chain Prompting (ChaPT) module to decompose the ASQP task into three subtasks using the stepby-step reasoning mechanism. Then, a Representative Demonstration Retriever (RepDR) is introduced to provide ChaPT with representative demonstrations, balancing diversity and similarity, and enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs at each step.

However, previous studies have less examined FCE in LLMs thoroughly, which needs more consideration of confounding biases, general situations, and prompt changes. Therefore, in this paper, we conduct two studies to deeply examine the FCE phenomenon in LLMs. In Study 1, we investigate whether LLMs have FCE. In Study 2, we explore how various prompting styles affect the demonstration of FCE. As a result of these studies, we identified that popular LLMs have FCE.

This paper focuses on a significant facet of out-of-context reasoning: Out-of-Context Knowledge Reasoning (OCKR), which is to combine multiple knowledge to infer new knowledge. We designed a synthetic dataset with seven representative OCKR tasks to systematically assess the OCKR capabilities of LLMs. Using this dataset, we evaluated the LLaMA2-13B-chat model and discovered that its proficiency in this aspect is limited, regardless of whether the knowledge is trained in a separate or adjacent training settings. Moreover, training the model to reason with complete reasoning data did not result in significant improvement. Training the model to perform explicit knowledge retrieval helps in only one of the tasks, indicating that the model's limited OCKR capabilities are due to difficulties in retrieving relevant knowledge. Furthermore, we treat cross-lingual knowledge transfer as a distinct form of OCKR, and evaluate this ability.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in domain-specific machine translation (MT). However, one major issue is that LLMs trained on general corpus might not generalize well to specific domains due to the lack of domain-specific knowledge. To address this issue, this paper focuses on enhancing the domain-specific MT capability of LLMs, by providing high-quality training datasets and proposing a novel fine-tuning framework denoted by DragFT. DragFT augments LLMs via three techniques: Dictionary-enhanced prompting improves domain-specific terminology translation; RAG-based few-shot example selection provides high-quality examples that simulate both the domain and style characteristics; Fine-tuning with few-shot examples further boosts fine-tuning with in-domain examples. We deploy DragFT on three well-known LLM backbones to validate its effectiveness. The results on three domain-specific datasets show that DragFT achieves a significant performance boost and shows superior performance compared to strong baselines such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o. The drastic performance improvement of DragFT over existing LLMs can be attributed to the incorporation of relevant knowledge while mitigating noise.

Despite its promising performance, ICL suffers from instability with the choice and arrangement of examples. Additionally, crafted adversarial attacks pose a notable threat to the robustness of ICL. However, existing attacks are either easy to detect, rely on external models, or lack specificity towards ICL. This work introduces a novel transferable attack against ICL to address these issues, aiming to hijack LLMs to generate the target response or jailbreak. Our hijacking attack leverages a gradient-based prompt search method to learn and append imperceptible adversarial suffixes to the in-context demos without directly contaminating the user queries. Comprehensive experimental results across different generation and jailbreaking tasks highlight the effectiveness of our hijacking attack, resulting in distracted attention towards adversarial tokens and consequently leading to unwanted target outputs. We also propose a defense strategy against hijacking attacks through the use of extra clean demos, which enhances the robustness of LLMs during ICL. Broadly, this work reveals the significant security vulnerabilities of LLMs and emphasizes the necessity for in-depth studies on their robustness",

We introduce Astraios, a suite of 28 instruction-tuned OctoCoder models using 7 tuning methods and 4 model sizes up to 16 billion parameters. Through investigations across 5 tasks and 8 different datasets encompassing both code comprehension and code generation tasks, we find that FFT generally leads to the best downstream performance across all scales, and PEFT methods differ significantly in their efficacy based on the model scale. LoRA usually offers the most favorable trade-off between cost and performance. Further investigation into the effects of these methods on both model robustness and code security reveals that larger models tend to demonstrate reduced robustness and less security. At last, we explore the relationships among updated parameters, and task performance. We find that the tuning effectiveness observed in small models generalizes well to larger models, and the validation loss in instruction tuning can be a reliable indicator of overall downstream performance. We believe that our findings of PEFT can generalize to other decoder-only LLMs",

    "title": "RoLoRA: Fine-tuning Rotated Outlier-free LLMs for Effective Weight-Activation Quantization",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), as a representative Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method, significantly enhances the training efficiency by updating only a small portion of the weights in Large Language Models (LLMs). Recently, weight-only quantization techniques have also been applied to LoRA methods to reduce the memory footprint of fine-tuning. However, applying weight-activation quantization to the LoRA pipeline is under-explored, and we observe substantial performance degradation primarily due to the presence of activation outliers. In this work, we propose RoLoRA, the first LoRA-based scheme to apply rotation for outlier elimination, and then fine-tune rotated outlier-free LLMs for effective weight-activation quantization. Different from previous work tackling the outlier challenges from a post-training perspective, we propose rotation-aware fine-tuning to eliminate and preserve the outlier-free characteristics brought by rotation operations. RoLoRA can improve low-bit LoRA convergence and post-training quantization robustness in weight-activation settings. RoLoRA is evaluated across various LLM series (LLaMA2, LLaMA3, LLaVA-1.5), tasks, and quantization settings, achieving up to 29.5% absolute accuracy gain of 4-bit weight-activation quantized LLaMA2-13B on commonsense reasoning tasks compared to LoRA baseline. We further demonstrate its effectiveness on Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) and prove the compatibility with advanced LoRA variants",

Direct knowledge editing emerged as an efficient alternative, where it locates a stale factual knowledge in the LLM's layers and edits those layers' weights in order for the LLM to generate new factual knowledge. We observed that MEMIT, state-of-the art knowledge editing algorithm is not used at its full potential. In this paper, we empirically demonstrated the limitations of executing only one single MEMIT update. We then proposed an intuitive and straightforward solution, Running MEMIT twice, and showed its effectiveness over two knowledge editing datasets compared to strong baselines. We conducted extensive analysis to understand the effectiveness of our solution. In particular we analyzed multiple runs of MEMIT and found out the performance to plateaus at second run of MEMIT. To discern the reason we analyzed the gradients between each run and found negligible change in gradients between second and third run of MEMIT",

    "abstract": "Decoder-only architecture performs poorly in multilingual neural machine translation, despite its potential benefits in zero-shot translation, i.e., translation of unseen language pairs during training. In this work, we identify the main issue of the decoder-only architecture as its lack of language transfer capability. Specifically, representations from different source languages are not aligned in the representational subspace of the target language. We propose dividing the decoding process into two stages so that target tokens are explicitly excluded in the first stage to implicitly boost the transfer capability across languages. Additionally, we impose contrastive learning on translation instructions, resulting in improved performance in zero-shot translation. We conduct experiments on TED-19 and OPUS-100 datasets, considering both training from scratch and fine-tuning scenarios. Experimental results show that, compared to the encoder-decoder architecture, our methods not only perform competitively in supervised translations but also achieve improvements of up to 3.39 BLEU, 6.99 chrF++, 3.22 BERTScore, and 4.81 COMET in zero-shot translations",

While many researchers have studied LLM personalization and role-playing, they primarily use LLM-as-a-Judge for evaluation without thoroughly examining its validity. This paper investigates the reliability of LLM-as-a-Personalized-Judge—asking LLMs to judge user preferences based on persona. Our results suggest that LLM-as-a-Personalized-Judge is less reliable for personalization than previously believed, showing low agreement with human ground truth. We observed that the personas provided to the LLM often have limited predictive power for the tasks, leading us to introduce verbal uncertainty estimation. We find that powerful LLMs are aware of the certainty of their prediction and can achieve high agreement with ground truth on high-certainty samples, indicating a promising approach for building reliable and scalable proxies for evaluating LLM personalization. Our human annotation reveals that third-person crowd worker evaluations of personalized preferences are even worse than LLM predictions, highlighting the challenges of evaluating LLM personalization",

    "abstract": "A significant portion of the textual data used in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) exhibits gender biases, particularly due to the use of masculine generics (masculine words that are supposed to refer to mixed groups of men and women), which can perpetuate and amplify stereotypes. Gender rewriting, a NLP task that involves automatically detecting and replacing gendered forms with neutral or opposite forms (e.g., from masculine to feminine), can be employed to mitigate these biases. Such systems are available for English, Arabic, Portuguese and German, but no French system is available. We create an original French gender-neutral rewriting system using collective nouns, which are gender-fixed in French. This paper presents GeNRe, the very first French gender-neutral rewriting system. We introduce a rule-based system (RBS) tailored for the French language alongside two fine-tuned large language models trained on data generated by our RBS. We also explore the use of instruction models to enhance the performance of our other systems and find that Claude 3 Opus combined with our dictionary achieves results close to our RBS.

    "abstract": "Misinformation is prevalent in various fields such as education, politics, health, etc., causing significant harm to society. However, current methods for cross-domain misinformation detection rely on time and resources consuming fine-tuning and complex model structures. With the outstanding performance of LLMs, many studies have employed them for misinformation detection. Unfortunately, they focus on in-domain tasks and do not incorporate significant sentiment and emotion features (which we jointly call affect). In this paper, we propose RAEmoLLM, the first retrieval augmented (RAG) LLMs framework to address cross-domain misinformation detection using in-context learning based on affective information. It accomplishes this by applying an emotion-aware LLM to construct a retrieval database of affective embeddings. This database is used by our retrieval module to obtain source-domain samples, which are subsequently used for the inference module's in-context few-shot learning to detect target domain misinformation. We evaluate our framework on three misinformation benchmarks. Results show that RAEmoLLM achieves significant improvements compared to the zero-shot method on three datasets, with the highest increases of 20.69\\%, 23.94\\%, and 39.11\\% respectively.

Models who unequally represent global cultures can reinforce harmful stereotypes. Evaluating the extent of cultural bias in an LLM, then, is crucial to equitable model development. Most previous works focus on question-answering (QA) tasks~\\cite{palta-rudinger-2023-fork}. QA tasks focus on one correct answer given the cultural context, despite in many cases, there being a group of correct answers with shared characteristics for a given question. We proposed a task focusing on word groups, Word Grouping Game (WGG) that implicitly evaluates the model's cultural knowledge and norms. In WGG, LLMs are given a pool of words, where they must separate the words into groups of four words tied under a common topic. In order to perform well in the game, the model also needs to perform culture-related reasoning. We evaluated the game with two cultures, Latinx/Hispanic and Chinese, in both the native language and an English translation for comparison. Through experimentation, we find biases towards Chinese culture-based groupings, as well as disparities in performance between open- and closed-source models based on the language used for a given game",

Furthermore, we propose architecture learning techniques and introduce a gradual pruning schedule during fine-tuning to exhaustively explore the optimal setting and the minimal intrinsic subspaces for each language, resulting in a lightweight yet effective fine-tuning procedure.

    "abstract": "Private data, being larger and quality-higher than public data, can greatly improve large language models (LLM). However, due to privacy concerns, this data is often dispersed in multiple silos, making its secure utilization for LLM training a challenge. Federated learning (FL) is an ideal solution for training models with distributed private data, but traditional frameworks like FedAvg are unsuitable for LLM due to their high computational demands on clients. An alternative, split learning, offloads most training parameters to the server while training embedding and output layers locally, making it more suitable for LLM. Nonetheless, it faces significant challenges in security and efficiency. Firstly, the gradients of embeddings are prone to attacks, leading to potential reverse engineering of private data. Furthermore, the server's limitation of handling only one client's training request at a time hinders parallel training, severely impacting training efficiency. In this paper, we propose a Federated Learning framework for LLM, named FL-GLM, which prevents data leakage caused by both server-side and peer-client attacks while improving training efficiency. Specifically, we first place the input block and output block on local client to prevent embedding gradient attacks from server. Secondly, we employ key-encryption during client-server communication to prevent reverse engineering attacks from peer-clients. Lastly, we employ optimization methods like client-batching or server-hierarchical, adopting different acceleration methods based on the actual computational capabilities of the server. Experimental results on NLU and generation tasks demonstrate that FL-GLM achieves comparable metrics to centralized chatGLM model, validating the effectiveness of our federated learning framework",

This capability contrasts with human reading and writing habits, where it is uncommon to remember and use particularly distant information, except in cases of foreshadowing. In this paper, we aim to explore which kinds of words benefit more from long contexts in language models. By analyzing the changes in token probabilities with increasing context length, we find that content words (e.g., nouns, adjectives) and the initial tokens of words benefit the most. Frequent patterns in the context (N-grams) also significantly impact predictions. Additionally, the model's prior knowledge plays a crucial role in influencing predictions, especially for rare tokens. We also observe that language models become more confident with longer contexts, resulting in sharper probability distributions. This overconfidence may contribute to the increasing probabilities of tokens with distant contextual information.

To bridge these gaps, we introduce a novel, modularized and open-source methods for concept map extraction that addresses efficiency by using semantic and sub-symbolic techniques with a new preliminary summarisation component. Moreover, we compare the pipeline approaches with three end-to-end Large Language Models methods. The best models for our pipeline and our end-to-end baseline achieve state-of-the-art results on METEOR metrics, with F1 scores of $25.69$ and $28.5$ respectively and on ROUGE-2 recall, with scores of $24.26$ and $24.3$. This contribution advances the task of automated concept map extraction, opening doors to wider applications supporting learning. The code is open-access and available",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Despite the success of integrating large language models into the development of conversational systems, many studies have shown the effectiveness of retrieving and augmenting external knowledge for informative responses. Hence, many existing studies commonly assume the *always* need for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) in a conversational system without explicit control. This raises a research question about such a necessity. In this study, we propose to investigate the need for each turn of system response to be augmented with external knowledge. In particular, by leveraging human judgements on the binary choice of adaptive augmentation, we develop *RAGate*, a gating model, which models conversation context and relevant inputs to predict if a conversational system requires RAG for improved responses. We conduct extensive experiments on devising and applying *RAGate* to conversational models and well-rounded analyses of different conversational scenarios. Our experimental results and analysis indicate the effective application of *RAGate* in RAG-based conversational systems in identifying system responses for appropriate RAG with high-quality responses in a high generation confidence. This study also identifies the correlation between the generation's confidence level and the relevance of the augmented knowledge",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Generally, the ${\\it decoder\\-only}$ large language models (LLMs) are adapted to context-aware neural machine translation (NMT) in a concatenating way, where LLMs take the concatenation of the source sentence (i.e., intra-sentence context) and the inter-sentence context as the input, and then to generate the target tokens sequentially. This adaptation strategy, i.e., concatenation mode, considers intra-sentence and inter-sentence contexts with the same priority, despite an apparent difference between the two kinds of contexts. In this paper, we propose an alternative adaptation approach, named ${\\bf D}$ecoding-${\\bf e}$nhanced ${\\bf M}$ulti-phase ${\\bf P}$rompt ${\\bf T}$uning (DeMPT), to make LLMs discriminately model and utilize the inter- and intra-sentence context and more effectively adapt LLMs to context-aware NMT. First, DeMPT divides the context-aware NMT process into three separate phases. During each phase, different continuous prompts are introduced to make LLMs discriminately model various information. Second, DeMPT employs a heuristic way to further discriminately enhance the utilization of the source-side inter- and intra-sentence information at the final decoding phase. Experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms the concatenation method, and further improves the performance of LLMs in discourse modeling",

Watermarks with low imperceptibility are easily stolen and analyzed by malicious users, who can then forge watermarked text. To fill this research gap, we design Balanced Watermark (BW) by balancing the watermark strength across the vocabulary, achieving a fit to a non-watermarked LLM distribution to enhance imperceptibility. To effectively evaluate the imperceptibility of watermarks, we design a metric to evaluate for the first time.

    "abstract": "Biomedical Terminology Normalization aims to identify the standard term in a specified termbase for non-standardized mentions from social media or clinical texts, employing the mainstream \"Recall and Re-rank\" framework. Instead of the traditional pretraining-finetuning paradigm, we would like to explore the possibility of accomplishing this task through a tuning-free paradigm using powerful Large Language Models (LLMs), hoping to address the costs of re-training due to discrepancies of both standard termbases and annotation protocols. Another major obstacle in this task is that both mentions and terms are short texts. Short texts contain an insufficient amount of information that can introduce ambiguity, especially in a biomedical context. Therefore, besides using the advanced embedding model, we implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based knowledge enhancement module. This module introduces an LLM agent that expands the short texts into accurate, harmonized, and more informative descriptions using a search engine and a domain knowledge base. Furthermore, we present an innovative tuning-free biomedical terminology normalization agent collaboration framework.

Their token-by-token decoding from scratch wastes a lot of inference steps in generating dense text, which can be directly copied from PDF files. To solve this problem, we introduce EditTrans, whose features allow identifying a queue of to-be-edited text from a PDF before starting to generate markup language.

However, LLMs do not suit well for scenarios that require on-device processing, energy efficiency, low memory footprint, and response efficiency.

This paper explores the 'less is more' paradigm by addressing the challenge of designing accurate yet efficient Small Language Models (SLMs) for resource constrained devices.

MobiLlama is a SLM design that initiates from a larger model and applies a careful parameter sharing scheme to reduce both the pre-training and the deployment cost.

One effective approach to mitigate these costs is compressing the long input contexts. Existing methods typically leverage the self-attention mechanism of the large model itself for context compression. While these methods have achieved notable results, the compression process still entails quadratic complexity. To overcome this limitation, we propose the In-Context Former (IC-Former). This method does not rely on the target large model but instead utilizes cross-attention mechanisms to extract and condense information from the contextual embeddings. The computational overhead of our method grows linearly with the compression range. Experimental results indicate that our method requires only 1/32 of the floating-point operations of the baseline during compression and improves processing speed by 68 to 112 times while achieving 90\\% of the baseline performance on evaluation metrics.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Increasing concerns about privacy leakage issues in academia and industry arise when employing NLP models from third-party providers to process sensitive texts. To protect privacy before sending sensitive data to those models, we suggest sanitizing sensitive text using two common strategies used by humans: i) deleting sensitive expressions, and ii) obscuring sensitive details by abstracting them. To explore the issues and develop a tool for text rewriting, we curate the first corpus, coined \\ourBenchmark, through both crowdsourcing and the use of large language models (LLMs). Compared to the prior works based on differential privacy, which lead to a sharp drop in information utility and unnatural texts, the human-inspired approaches result in more natural rewrites and offer an improved balance between privacy protection and data utility, as demonstrated by our extensive experiments.

    "title": "Large Language Models are Students at Various Levels: Zero-shot Question Difficulty Estimation",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Recent advancements in educational platforms have emphasized the importance of personalized education. Accurately estimating question difficulty based on the group level of a student is essential for personalized question recommendations. Several studies have focused on predicting question difficulty using student question-solving records or textual information about the questions. However, these approaches require a large amount of student question-solving records and fail to account for the subjective difficulties perceived by different student groups. To address these limitations, we propose the LLaSA framework that utilizes large language models to represent students at various levels. LLaSA estimates question difficulty using student abilities derived from their question-solving records. Furthermore, the zero-shot LLaSA can estimate question difficulty without any student question-solving records. In evaluations on the DBE-KT22 and ASSISTMents 2005–2006 benchmarks, the zero-shot LLaSA demonstrated a performance comparable to those of strong baseline models even without any training. When evaluated using the classification method, LLaSA outperformed the baseline models, achieving state-of-the-art performance. In addition, the zero-shot LLaSA achieved a high correlation compared with the question difficulty derived from the question-solving records of students, suggesting the potential of LLaSA for real world applications",

    "title": "Text Clustering as Classification with LLMs",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Text clustering remains valuable in real-world applications where manual labeling is cost-prohibitive. It facilitates efficient organization and analysis of information by grouping similar texts based on their representations. However, implementing this approach necessitates fine-tuned embedders for downstream data and sophisticated similarity metrics. To address this issue, this study presents a novel framework for text clustering that effectively leverages the in-context learning capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs). Instead of fine-tuning embedders, we propose to transform the text clustering into a classification task via LLM. First, we prompt LLM to generate potential labels for a given dataset. Second, after integrating similar labels generated by the LLM, we prompt the LLM to assign the most appropriate label to each sample in the dataset. Our framework has been experimentally proven to achieve comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art clustering methods that employ embeddings, without requiring complex fine-tuning or clustering algorithms.

A single event edit leads to updates in multiple entailed knowledge triplets. (2) Completeness. Beyond updating factual knowledge, event-level editing also requires considering the event influences and updating LLMs' knowledge about future trends. We construct a high-quality event-level editing benchmark ELKEN, consisting of $1,515$ event edits, $6,449$ questions about factual knowledge, and $10,150$ questions about future tendencies. We systematically evaluate the performance of various knowledge editing methods and LLMs on this benchmark. We find that ELKEN poses significant challenges to existing knowledge editing approaches.

However, adversarial images often struggle to deceive all prompts effectively in the context of cross-prompt migration attacks, as the probability distribution of the tokens in these images tends to favor the semantics of the original image rather than the target tokens. To address this challenge, we propose a Contextual-Injection Attack (CIA) that employs gradient-based perturbation to inject target tokens into both visual and textual contexts, thereby improving the probability distribution of the target tokens. By shifting the contextual semantics towards the target tokens instead of the original image semantics, CIA enhances the cross-prompt transferability of adversarial images. Extensive experiments on the BLIP2, InstructBLIP, and Llava models show that CIA outperforms existing methods in cross-prompt transferability, demonstrating its potential for more effective adversarial strategies in VLMs",

To address these issues, we introduce OrthogonalE, a novel KGE model employing matrices for entities and block-diagonal orthogonal matrices with Riemannian optimization for relations. This approach not only enhances the generality and flexibility of KGE models but also captures several relation patterns that rotation-based methods can identify.

Such experimental appraisals have pointed toward the LLMs' apparent ability to perform causal reasoning or to grasp uncertainty. In this paper, we investigate whether these abilities are measurable outside of tailored prompting and MCQ by reformulating these issues as direct text completion - the foundation of LLMs. To achieve this goal, we define scenarios with multiple possible outcomes and we compare the prediction made by the LLM through prompting (their Stated Answer) to the probability distributions they compute over these outcomes during next token prediction (their Revealed Belief). Our findings suggest that the Revealed Belief of LLMs significantly differs from their Stated Answer and hint at multiple biases and misrepresentations that their beliefs may yield in many scenarios and outcomes.

This is predominantly because we demonstrate that LLMs can autonomously produce chain-of-thought (CoT) style reasoning with no custom prompts merely while generating longer responses, which lead to consistent predictions that are more accurate. In the zero-shot setting, by sampling Mixtral-8x7B model multiple times and considering longer responses, we achieve nearly 85% of its self-consistency performance obtained through zero-shot CoT prompting on the GSM8K and MultiArith datasets.

Many sought to mitigate this by restricting the attention window within the pre-trained length. However, these methods introduce new issues such as ignoring the middle context and requiring additional training. To address these problems, we propose LongHeads, a training-free framework that enhances LLM's long context ability by unlocking multi-head attention's untapped potential. Instead of allowing each head to attend to the full sentence, which struggles with generalizing to longer sequences, we allow each head to process in-distribution length by selecting and attending to important context chunks. To this end, we propose a chunk selection strategy that relies on the inherent correlation between the query and the key representations, efficiently distributing context chunks to different heads. In this way, each head ensures it can effectively process attended tokens within the trained length, while different heads in different layers can collectively process longer contexts. LongHeads works efficiently in linear time, and fits seamlessly with many LLMs that use relative positional encoding. LongHeads achieves 100\\% accuracy at the 128k length on passkey retrieval task, verifying LongHeads' efficacy in extending the usable context window for existing models",

Existing methods either rely on various stringent assumptions or ignore the intricate dependency relations inherent in natural language, causing inaccurate estimation results. In response to this limitation, this paper introduces a novel perturbation-based approach for estimating the PLMs' interest, comprising two crucial designs, i.e., the co-perturbation strategy and an adaptive optimization algorithm. Specifically, the strategy aims to inject noises across all input words, thereby confronting the inherent combinatorial explosion challenge. Furthermore, the proposed adaptive algorithm focuses on the estimation of interest degree for disentangling the output changes caused by the co-perturbation setting. Through extensive experimentation on various PLMs and datasets, we verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "As the parameter scale of large language models (LLMs) grows, jointly training knowledge graph (KG) embeddings with model parameters to enhance LLM capabilities becomes increasingly costly. Consequently, the community has shown interest in developing prompt strategies that effectively integrate KG information into LLMs. However, the format for incorporating KGs into LLMs lacks standardization; for instance, KGs can be transformed into linearized triples or natural language (NL) text. Current prompting methods often rely on a trial-and-error approach, leaving researchers with an incomplete understanding of which KG input format best facilitates LLM comprehension of KG content. To elucidate this, we design a series of experiments to explore LLMs' understanding of different KG input formats within the context of prompt engineering. Our analysis examines both literal and attention distribution levels. Through extensive experiments, we indicate a counter-intuitive phenomenon: when addressing fact-related questions, unordered linearized triples are more effective for LLMs' understanding of KGs compared to fluent NL text. Furthermore, noisy, incomplete, or marginally relevant subgraphs can still enhance LLM performance. Finally, different LLMs have distinct preferences for different formats of organizing unordered triples",

    "title": "Recurrent Alignment with Hard Attention for Hierarchical Text Rating",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "While large language models (LLMs) excel at understanding and generating plain text, they are not tailored to handle hierarchical text structures or directly predict task-specific properties such as text rating. In fact, selectively and repeatedly grasping the hierarchical structure of large-scale text is pivotal for deciphering its essence. To this end, we propose a novel framework for hierarchical text rating utilizing LLMs, which incorporates Recurrent Alignment with Hard Attention (RAHA). Particularly, hard attention mechanism prompts a frozen LLM to selectively focus on pertinent leaf texts associated with the root text and generate symbolic representations of their relationships. Inspired by the gradual stabilization of the Markov Chain, recurrent alignment strategy involves feeding predicted ratings iteratively back into the prompts of another trainable LLM, aligning it to progressively approximate the desired target. Experimental results demonstrate that RAHA outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on three hierarchical text rating datasets. Theoretical and empirical analysis confirms RAHA's ability to gradually converge towards the underlying target through multiple inferences. Additional experiments on plain text rating datasets verify the effectiveness of this Markov-like alignment. Our data and code can be available in https://anonymous.4open.science/r/RAHA/",

    "abstract": "With the continuous progress of remote sensing technology, an increasing number of remote sensing images containing rich geographical and environmental information is obtained. Unlike natural images, remote sensing images usually cover a large area and have complex spatial distribution, making it a challenge to accurately extract and describe changes from images. In order to effectively mine and utilize the rich semantic information contained in the image to guide the decoder to generate high-quality change descriptions, we propose an efficient semantic attention network (ESAN). Specifically, we first perform global efficient semantic representation (GESR) on the obtained remote sensing feature map to promote the understanding of complex scenes in remote sensing images. Then we further propose a cross-semantic feature enhancement module (CSFE) to effectively distinguish semantic changes from irrelevant changes. Finally, we input the obtained image features into the adaptive multi-layer Transformer decoder to guide the generation of change description.

    "abstract": "Ensembling multiple models has always been an effective approach to push the limits of existing performance and is widely used in classification tasks by simply averaging the classification probability vectors from multiple classifiers to achieve better accuracy. However, in the thriving open-source Large Language Model (LLM) community, ensembling methods are rare and typically limited to ensembling the full-text outputs of LLMs, such as selecting the best output using a ranker, which leads to underutilization of token-level probability information.

Furthermore, we observed that most of the tokens in the answer are simple and do not affect the correctness of the final answer. Therefore, we also experimented with ensembling only key tokens, and the results showed better performance with lower latency across benchmarks",

    "abstract": "Proactive dialogue has become a crucial yet challenging aspect of human-computer interaction, applicable to various non-collaborative dialogue tasks such as negotiation, persuasion, and psychological counseling. However, current proactive dialogue systems are hindered by their simplistic single-turn interactions and lack of capability for multi-turn, long-term strategy planning, which obstructs effective goal completion. Additionally, corpus-based training procedures are inadequate for addressing low-resource environments and transferability requirements across different dialogue tasks. In this paper, we introduce a proactive dialogue strategy planning (ProDSP) method to overcome these challenges. By utilizing a small supervised fine-tuning language model, we enable the anticipation of future strategy sequences as simulation hints. This approach guides large language models (LLMs) in generating goal-oriented responses and facilitates training within an interactive environment using another LLM-based user simulator. To assess online user feedback during the training process, we employ a GPT-4-based user simulator to represent goal-oriented rewards through multi-faceted metrics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model surpasses competitive baselines in both strategy planning and dialogue generation for emotional support and negotiation tasks, offering a more adaptive and efficient approach to proactive dialogue strategy planning",

MSEs serve as structured assessments to evaluate behavioral and cognitive functioning across various domains, aiding mental health professionals in diagnosis and treatment monitoring. However, in developing countries, access to mental health support is limited, leading to an overwhelming demand for mental health professionals. Resident doctors often conduct initial patient assessments and create summaries for senior doctors, but their availability is constrained, resulting in extended patient wait times. This study addresses the challenge of generating concise summaries from MSEs through the evaluation of various language models. Given the scarcity of relevant mental health conversation datasets, we developed a 12-item descriptive MSE questionnaire and collected responses from 405 participants, resulting in 9720 utterances covering diverse mental health aspects. Subsequently, we assessed the performance of five well-known pre-trained summarization models, both with and without fine-tuning, for summarizing MSEs. Our comprehensive evaluation, leveraging metrics such as ROUGE, SummaC, and human evaluation, demonstrates that language models can generate automated coherent MSE summaries for doctors. With this paper, we release our collected conversational dataset and trained models publicly for the mental health research community",

MuSE can further enhance sarcasm understanding and has attracted increasing research interest.

However, most existing training methods rely on extracting supervision signals from LLMs' weights or their output probabilities, which is not only resource-intensive but also incompatible with black-box LLMs. In this paper, we introduce $Intermediate Distillation$, a data-efficient knowledge distillation training scheme that treats LLMs as black boxes and distills their knowledge via an innovative LLM-ranker-retriever pipeline, solely using LLMs' ranking generation as the supervision signal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method can significantly improve the performance of retriever models with only 1,000 training instances. Moreover, our distilled retriever model significantly boosts performance in question-answering tasks within the RAG framework, demonstrating the potential of LLMs to economically and effectively train smaller models",

    "abstract": "Top-view perspective denotes a typical way in which humans read and reason over different types of maps, and it is vital for localization and navigation of humans as well as of `non-human' agents, such as the ones backed by large Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Nonetheless, spatial reasoning capabilities of modern VLMs in this setup remain unattested and underexplored. In this work, we study their capability to understand and reason over spatial relations from the top view. The focus on top view also enables controlled evaluations at different granularity of spatial reasoning; we clearly disentangle different abilities (e.g., recognizing particular objects versus understanding their relative positions). We introduce the TopViewRS (Top-View Reasoning in Space) dataset, consisting of 11,384 multiple-choice questions with either realistic or semantic top-view map as visual input. We then use it to study and evaluate VLMs across 4 perception and reasoning tasks with different levels of complexity. Evaluation of 10 representative open- and closed-source VLMs reveals the gap of more than 50% compared to average human performance, and it is even lower than the random baseline in some cases. Although additional experiments show that Chain-of-Thought reasoning can boost model capabilities by 5.82% on average, the overall performance of VLMs remains limited. Our findings underscore the critical need for enhanced model capability in top-view spatial reasoning and set a foundation for further research towards human-level proficiency of VLMs in real-world multimodal tasks",

    "abstract": "While large language models (LLMs) excel in many domains, their complexity and scale challenge deployment in resource-limited environments. Current compression techniques, such as parameter pruning, often fail to effectively utilize the knowledge from pruned parameters. To address these challenges, we propose Manifold-Based Knowledge Alignment and Layer Merging Compression (MKA), a novel approach that uses manifold learning and the Normalized Pairwise Information Bottleneck (NPIB) measure to merge similar layers, reducing model size while preserving essential performance. We evaluate MKA on multiple benchmark datasets and various LLMs. Our findings show that MKA not only preserves model performance but also achieves substantial compression ratios, outperforming traditional pruning methods. Moreover, when coupled with quantization, MKA delivers even greater compression. Specifically, on the MMLU dataset using the Llama3-8B model, MKA achieves a compression ratio of 43.75\\% with a minimal performance decrease of only 2.82\\%. The proposed MKA method offers a resource-efficient and performance-preserving model compression technique for LLMs",

However, the sheer volume of these imposes a considerable computational burden and annotation cost. To investigate a label-efficient instruction tuning method that allows the model itself to actively sample subsets that are equally or even more effective, we introduce a self-evolving mechanism DiverseEvol. In this process, a model iteratively augments its training subset to refine its own performance, without requiring any intervention from humans or more advanced LLMs. The key to our data sampling technique lies in the enhancement of diversity in the chosen subsets, as the model selects new data points most distinct from any existing ones according to its current embedding space. Extensive experiments across three datasets and benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of DiverseEvol. Our models, trained on less than 4\\% of the original dataset, maintain or improve performance compared with finetuning on full data.

We call these aspects the *proxies of culture*, and organize them across two dimensions of demographic and semantic proxies. We also categorize the probing methods employed. Our analysis indicates that only certain aspects of ``culture,'' such as values and objectives, have been studied, leaving several other interesting and important facets, especially the multitude of semantic domains (Thompson et al., 2020) and aboutness (Hershcovich et al., 2022), unexplored.

Specifically, we provide potential lies and basic facts and then analyze why this sentence may be a lie by combining factual inconsistencies and intent behind them. Compared with deception detection, this task is more applicable to real-world scenarios. For example, in interrogation, the police should judge whether a person is lying based on solid evidence.

    "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive multiple step-by-step reasoning capabilities in recent natural language processing (NLP) reasoning tasks, many studies are interested in distilling reasoning abilities into smaller language models (SLMs) via fine-tuning. Previous distillation methods usually utilize the capabilities of LLMs to generate chain-of-thought (CoT) samples to teach SLMs. However, this distillation approach performs poorly in certain scenarios due to the limitations of CoT. In this work, we introduce a novel \\textbf{Mixed Distillation} (MD) framework, distilling multiple step-by-step reasoning abilities into SLMs. First, we leverage LLMs to generate multiple step-by-step reasoning rationales by sampling automatically. Then, we create high-quality, well-balanced mixed thought data and design a novel multi-task loss to help SLMs better learn and adaptively activate multiple step-by-step reasoning. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that MD enhances both single-path (using either CoT or PoT) and multi-path (using both CoT and PoT) reasoning abilities of SLMs during inference across reasoning tasks. Notably, a single model generated by MD exceeds the comprehensive performance of an ensemble of two individual CoT and PoT distilled models. Mistral-7B using MD can achieve remarkable improvements of 87.5\\%, 74.0% and 77.1% on SVAMP, GSM8K and ASDIV, respectively, outperforming the teacher model, GPT-3.5-Turbo.

Concretely, we determine the final next-token predictions by amplifying the predictions from the original model and downplaying the induced untruthful predictions via contrastive decoding. Experimental results on both discrimination-based and generation-based hallucination evaluation benchmarks, such as TruthfulQA and \\textsc{FActScore}, demonstrate that our proposed ICD methods can effectively enhance the factuality of LLMs across various task formats, model sizes, and model families.

Using data from a human survey, we estimated a belief network encompassing 18 topics loading on two non-overlapping latent factors. We then seeded LLM-based agents with an opinion on one topic, and assessed the alignment of its expressed opinions on remaining test topics with corresponding human data. Role-playing based on demographic information alone did not align LLM and human opinions, but seeding the agent with a single belief greatly improved alignment for topics related in the belief network, and not for topics outside the network.

    "abstract": "Despite the significant progress of large language models (LLMs) in various tasks, they often produce factual errors due to their limited internal knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which enhances LLMs with external knowledge sources, offers a promising solution. However, these methods can be misled by irrelevant paragraphs in retrieved documents. Due to the inherent uncertainty in LLM generation, inputting the entire document may introduce off-topic information, causing the model to deviate from the central topic and affecting the relevance of the generated content. To address these issues, we propose the Retrieve-Plan-Generation (RPG) framework. RPG generates plan tokens to guide subsequent generation in the plan stage. In the answer stage, the model selects relevant fine-grained paragraphs based on the plan and uses them for further answer generation. This plan-answer process is repeated iteratively until completion, enhancing generation relevance by focusing on specific topics. To implement this framework efficiently, we utilize a simple but effective multi-task prompt-tuning method, enabling the existing LLMs to handle both planning and answering. We comprehensively compare RPG with baselines across 5 knowledge-intensive generation tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach",

Consequently, they are easy to detect using straightforward detection methods, diminishing the efficacy of such attacks. To address this issue, we propose a Distribution-Aware Adversarial Attack (DA$^3$) method.

Existing logical reasoning evaluation benchmarks often focus primarily on simplistic single-step or multi-step reasoning with a limited set of inference rules. Furthermore, the lack of datasets for evaluating non-monotonic reasoning represents a crucial gap since it aligns more closely with human-like reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose Multi-LogiEval, a comprehensive evaluation dataset encompassing multi-step logical reasoning with various inference rules and depths. Multi-LogiEval covers three logic types — propositional, first-order, and non-monotonic consisting of more than 30 inference rules and more than 60 of their combinations with various depths.

Experimental results show that there is a significant drop in the performance of LLMs as the reasoning steps/depth increases (average accuracy of ~68% at depth-1 to ~43% at depth-5).

    "abstract": "We evaluated 20+ Transformer models for ranking of long documents (including recent LongP models trained with FlashAttention) and compared them with a simple FirstP baseline, which applies the same model to the truncated input (at most 512 tokens). We used MS MARCO Documents v1 as a primary training set and evaluated both the zero-shot transferred and fine-tuned models. On MS MARCO, TREC DLs, and Robust04 no long-document model outperformed FirstP by more than 5% in NDCG and MRR (when averaged over all test sets). We conjectured this was not due to models' inability to process long context, but due to a positional bias of relevant passages, whose distribution was skewed towards the beginning of documents. We found direct evidence of this bias in some test sets, which motivated us to create MS MARCO FarRelevant (based on MS MARCO Passages) where the relevant passages were not present among the first 512 tokens. Unlike standard collections where we saw both little benefit from incorporating longer contexts and limited variability in model performance (within a few %), experiments on MS MARCO FarRelevant uncovered dramatic differences among models. The FirstP models per- formed roughly at the random-baseline level in both zero-shot and fine-tuning scenarios. Simple aggregation models including MaxP and PARADE Attention had good zero-shot accuracy, but benefited little from fine-tuning. Most other models had poor zero-shot performance (sometimes at a random baseline level), but outstripped MaxP by as much as 13-28% after finetuning. Thus, the positional bias not only diminishes benefits of processing longer document contexts, but also leads to model over- fitting to positional bias and performing poorly in a zero-shot setting when the distribution of relevant passages changes substantially.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "The evaluation of image captions, looking at both linguistic fluency and semantic correspondence to visual contents, has witnessed a significant effort. Still, despite advancements such as the CLIPScore metric, multilingual captioning evaluation has remained relatively unexplored. This work assesses the use of CLIPScore in multilingual captioning, evaluating different models in a variety of settings. To address the lack of multilingual test data, we consider two different strategies: (1) using machine-translated datasets with human judgements, and (2) re-purposing multilingual datasets that target inference and reasoning. Our results show that multilingual CLIP models can perform on par with their English-centric counterparts on English benchmarks while allowing for multilingual assessments. Performance increases with model finetuning and according to model size. Larger models, trained with more data, attained similar performance to more advanced methods that extended the original CLIPScore. Tests with machine-translated data show that multilingual CLIPScore can also maintain a high correlation with human judgements across different languages, and additional tests with natively multilingual and multicultural data further attest to the high-quality assessments",

    "abstract": "Non-Factoid (NF) Question Answering (QA) is challenging to evaluate due to diverse potential answers and no objective criterion. The commonly used automatic evaluation metrics like ROUGE or BERTScore cannot accurately measure semantic similarities or answers from different perspectives. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been resorted to for NFQA evaluation due to their compelling performance on various NLP tasks. Common approaches include pointwise scoring of each candidate answer and pairwise comparisons between answers. Inspired by the evolution from pointwise to pairwise to listwise in learning-to-rank methods, we propose a novel listwise NFQA evaluation approach, that utilizes LLMs to rank candidate answers in a list of reference answers sorted by descending quality. Moreover, for NF questions that do not have multi-grade or any golden answers, we leverage LLMs to generate the reference answer list of various quality to facilitate the listwise evaluation. Extensive experimental results on three NFQA datasets, i.e., ANTIQUE, the TREC-DL-NF, and WebGLM show that our method has significantly higher correlations with human annotations compared to automatic scores and common pointwise and pairwise approaches",

Efficient methods for knowledge editing of LLMs are crucial. Existing datasets for knowledge editing typically assume that new knowledge is injected as a simple sentence that details a single tuple, such as \"Ellie Kemper is a citizen of United States of America''. However, we are concerned that these datasets are inadequate for evaluating real-world scenarios. In-the-wild text data from natural settings often contains ambiguous relationships between entities and does not solely detail a single tuple. This difference can lead to a drop in performance for existing methods. In this study, we present a new dataset, MQuAKE-Wild, which features new knowledge presented in a style that resembles naturally occurring text. The new dataset provides a benchmark to evaluate the performance of existing methods in scenarios that are more representative of real-world applications. Our findings indicate that current methods perform poor on such a dataset.

Owing to the increased parallelism, our method demonstrates higher efficiency in inference compared to autoregressive methods. Specifically, Amphista models an Auto-embedding Block capable of parallel inference, incorporating bi-directional attention to enable interaction between different drafting heads. Additionally, Amphista implements Staged Adaptation Layers to facilitate the transition of semantic information from the base model's autoregressive inference to the drafting heads' non-autoregressive speculation, thereby achieving paradigm transformation and feature fusion. We conduct a series of experiments on a suite of Vicuna models using MT-Bench and Spec-Bench.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) rapidly advance, increasing concerns arise regarding risks about the actual authorship of texts we see online and in the real world. The task of distinguishing LLM-authored texts is complicated by the nuanced and overlapping behaviors of both machines and humans. In this paper, we challenge the current practice of considering the LLM-generated text detection a binary classification task of differentiating human from AI. Instead, we introduce a novel ternary text classification scheme, adding an ''undecided'' category for texts that could be attributed to either source, and we show that this new category is crucial to understand how to make the detection result more explainable to lay users. This research shifts the paradigm from merely classifying to explaining machine-generated texts, emphasizing the need for detectors to provide clear and understandable explanations to users. Our study involves creating four new datasets comprised of texts from various LLMs and human authors. Based on the new datasets, we performed binary classification tests to ascertain the most effective state-of-the-art (SOTA) detection methods and identified SOTA LLMs capable of producing harder-to-detect texts. Then, we constructed a new dataset of texts generated by the two top-performing LLMs and human authors, and asked three human annotators to produce ternary labels with explanation notes. This dataset was used to investigate how three top-performing SOTA detectors behave in the new ternary classification context. Our results highlight why the ''undecided'' category is much needed from the viewpoint of explainability. Additionally, we conducted an analysis of explainability of the three best-performing detectors and the explanation notes of the human annotators, revealing insights about the complexity of explainable detection of machine-generated texts. Finally, we propose guidelines for developing future detection systems with improved explanatory power",

The core idea of RA2FD is to use a teacher-student framework to distill the faithfulness capacity of a teacher, which is an oracle RAG model that generates multiple knowledge-infused responses. The student retrieval-free model learns how to generate faithful responses from these teacher labels through sequence-level distillation and contrastive learning. Experiment results show that RA2FD let the faithfulness performance of an RFG model surpass the previous SOTA RFG baseline on three knowledge-grounded dialogue datasets by an average of 33% and even matching an RAG model's performance while significantly improving inference efficiency",

We evaluate both the syntactic and semantic knowledge of these models using developmentally-inspired evaluations. Through pretraining experiments, we test whether the global developmental ordering or the local discourse ordering of children's training data support high performance relative to other datasets. The local properties of the data affect model results, but somewhat surprisingly, global properties do not. Further, child language input is not uniquely valuable for training language models.

In detail, we use the nearest centroid classification on the hidden states, assigning the category of the nearest centroid previously observed from a few-shot calibration set to the test sample as the predicted label. Our experiments on 3 models and 10 classification datasets indicate that Hidden Calibration consistently outperforms current token-based calibrations by about 20%.

Specifically, we divide the queries and responses of conversations into several time slices and then adopt a time-division-multiplexing (TDM) encoding-decoding strategy to pseudo-simultaneously process these slices. Furthermore, to make LLMs proficient enough to handle real-time conversations, we build a fine-tuning dataset consisting of alternating time slices of queries and responses as well as covering typical feedback types in instantaneous interactions. Our experiments show that although the queries and responses of conversations are segmented into incomplete slices for processing, LLMs can preserve their original performance on standard benchmarks with a few fine-tuning steps on our dataset.

This framework assesses the capabilities of multi-modal LLMs, such as GPT-4 with Vision (GPT-4V), Gemini Pro Vision, LLaVA-Med, and RadFM, in generating descriptions for prospectively-identified findings. By employing a decomposition technique based on GPT-4, GPTRadScore compares these generated descriptions with gold-standard report sentences, analyzing their accuracy in terms of body part, location, and type of finding. Evaluations demonstrated a high correlation with clinician assessments and highlighted its potential over traditional metrics, such as BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE.

Using GPTRadScore, we found that while GPT-4V and Gemini Pro Vision fare better, their performance revealed significant areas for improvement, primarily due to limitations in the dataset used for training these models. To demonstrate this potential, RadFM was fine-tuned and it resulted in significant accuracy improvements: location accuracy rose from 3.41\\% to 12.8\\%, body part accuracy from 29.12\\% to 53\\%, and type accuracy from 9.24\\% to 30\\%, thereby validating our hypothesis",

We conduct an in-depth analysis of the performance of both dense and sparse retrieval methods in comparison to Entity Retrieval. Our findings reveal that our method not only leads to more accurate answers to entity-centric questions but also operates more efficiently",

    "abstract": "Speculative decoding stands as a pivotal technique to expedite inference in autoregressive (large) language models. This method employs a smaller \\textit{draft} model to speculate a block of tokens, which the \\textit{target} model then evaluates for acceptance. Despite a wealth of studies aimed at increasing the efficiency of speculative decoding, the influence of generation configurations on the decoding process remains poorly understood, especially concerning decoding temperatures. This paper delves into the effects of decoding temperatures on speculative decoding's efficacy. Beginning with knowledge distillation (KD), we first highlight the challenge of decoding at higher temperatures, and demonstrate KD in a consistent temperature setting could be a remedy. We also investigate the effects of out-of-domain testing sets with out-of-range temperatures. Building upon these findings, we take an initial step to further the speedup for speculative decoding, particularly in a high-temperature generation setting. Our work offers new insights into how generation configurations drastically affect the performance of speculative decoding, and underscores the need for developing methods that focus on diverse decoding configurations",

Most existing approaches encode images and videos into separate feature spaces, which are then fed as inputs to large language models. However, due to the lack of unified tokenization for images and videos, namely misalignment before projection, it becomes challenging for a Large Language Model (LLM) to learn multi-modal interactions from several poor projection layers. In this work, we unify visual representation into the language feature space to advance the foundational LLM towards a unified LVLM. As a result, we establish a simple but robust LVLM baseline, **Video-LLaVA**, which learns from a mixed dataset of images and videos, mutually enhancing each other. As a result, Video-LLaVA outperforms Video-ChatGPT by **5.8%, 9.9%, 18.6%, and 10.1%** on MSRVTT, MSVD, TGIF, and ActivityNet, respectively. Additionally, our Video-LLaVA also achieves superior performances on a broad range of 9 image benchmarks.

Despite efforts to align these models with human preferences, it remains uncertain whether such alignment may amplify pre-existing social biases.

In this paper, we investigate aligned LLMs for biases across underrepresented evaluation dimensions such as gender-diverse representation and multilingual accessibility. Through a comprehensive evaluation of 12 models, we uncover several key findings: (1) gender-diverse disparities persist after alignment and can be measured both in extrinsic model output and intrinsic reward analysis (2) aligned models reflect linguistic norms which favor higher-resourced languages, potentially disadvantaging lower-resource languages.

By extracting and organizing them into a structured format, we replace the human-written references with visual contexts and help VLMs better understand the image, enhancing evaluation performance.

To address this, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) incorporates external document chunks to expand LLM knowledge. Furthermore, compressing information from document chunks through extraction or summarization can improve LLM performance. Nonetheless, LLMs still struggle to notice and utilize scattered key information, a problem known as the \"lost-in-the-middle\" syndrome. Therefore, we typically need to restructure the content for LLM to recognize the key information. We propose $\\textit{Refiner}$, an end-to-end extract-and-restructure paradigm that operates in the post-retrieval process of RAG. $\\textit{Refiner}$ leverages a single decoder-only LLM to adaptively extract query-relevant contents verbatim along with the necessary context, and section them based on their interconnectedness, thereby highlights information distinction, and aligns downstream LLMs with the original context effectively. Experiments show that a trained $\\textit{Refiner}$ (with 7B parameters) exhibits significant gain to downstream LLM in improving answer accuracy, and outperforms other state-of-the-art advanced RAG and concurrent compressing approaches in various single-hop and multi-hop QA tasks. Notably, $\\textit{Refiner}$ achieves a 80.5% tokens reduction and a 1.6-7.0% improvement margin in multi-hop tasks compared to the next best solution. $\\textit{Refiner}$ is a plug-and-play solution that can be seamlessly integrated with RAG systems, facilitating its application across diverse open-source frameworks",

However, a key challenge lies in devising effective plans to guide action prediction in GUI tasks, though planning have been widely recognized as effective for decomposing complex tasks into a series of steps. Specifically, given the dynamic nature of environmental GUIs following action execution, it is crucial to dynamically adapt plans based on environmental feedback and action history.We show that the widely-used ReAct approach fails due to the excessively long historical dialogues. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach called Dynamic Planning of Thoughts (D-PoT) for LLM-based GUI agents.D-PoT involves the dynamic adjustment of planning based on the environmental feedback and execution history.

Our method encompasses two types of attacks: poisoning demonstration examples and poisoning demonstration prompts, which can make models behave in alignment with predefined intentions. ICLAttack does not require additional fine-tuning to implant a backdoor, thus preserving the model's generality. Furthermore, the poisoned examples are correctly labeled, enhancing the natural stealth of our attack method. Extensive experimental results across several language models, ranging in size from 1.3B to 180B parameters, demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack method, exemplified by a high average attack success rate of 95.0% across the three datasets on OPT models",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "The adaptation of Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents to execute tasks via natural language prompts represents a significant advancement, notably eliminating the need for explicit retraining or fine tuning, but are constrained by the comprehensiveness and diversity of the provided examples, leading to outputs that often diverge significantly from expected results, especially when it comes to the open-ended questions. This paper introduces the Memory Sharing, a framework which integrates the real-time memory filter, storage and retrieval to enhance the In-Context Learning process. This framework allows for the sharing of memories among multiple agents, whereby the interactions and shared memories between different agents effectively enhance the diversity of the memories. The collective self-enhancement through interactive learning among multiple agents facilitates the evolution from individual intelligence to collective intelligence. Besides, the dynamically growing memory pool is utilized not only to improve the quality of responses but also to train and enhance the retriever. We evaluated our framework across three distinct domains involving specialized tasks of agents. The experimental results demonstrate that the MS framework significantly improves the agents' performance in addressing open-ended questions",

Experimental results indicate that the average character-level accuracy of the VITS-based data augmentation method matches the best performance observed among traditional data augmentation methods before model transfer. After model transfer, the average character-level accuracy of the VITS-based data augmentation method significantly outperforms all traditional methods, surpassing Speed Perturbation, the best-performing traditional method, by 3.5%, as well as Tacotron2 and Fastspeech.

We consider each of these documents as templatic views of the same underlying knowledge/content, and we aim to unify the generation and evaluation of these templatic views. We begin by showing that current LLMs are capable of generating various document formats with little to no supervision. Further, a simple augmentation involving a structured intermediate representation can improve performance, especially for smaller models. We then introduce a novel unified evaluation framework that can be adapted to measuring the quality of document generators for heterogeneous downstream applications. This evaluation is adaptable to a range of user defined criteria and application scenarios, obviating the need for task specific evaluation metrics.

Research in this field generally consist of two main perspectives: local-level encoding and global-level aggregating, respectively refer to textual node information unification ($e.g.$, using Language Models) and structure-augmented modeling ($e.g.$, using Graph Neural Networks). Most existing works focus on combining different information levels but overlook the interconnections, $i.e.$, the contextual textual information among nodes, which provides semantic insights to bridge local and global levels.

We demonstrate the appropriateness of these dimensions by examining their correlations and distinctions.

Existing methods rely on the stance extracted from the evidence, achieving good performance with annotated gold evidence, but performing poorly with system-retrieved evidence. The key issue is that the existing model is only exposed to annotated gold evidence during training, inevitably leading to confirmation bias. Such bias refers to that the model tends to treat low-quality system-retrieved evidence as high-quality gold evidence during testing, thus resulting in low robustness and generalization of the model. To mitigate the bias, we propose a novel multi-check framework with causal intervention and counterfactual reasoning. It incorporates three independent checkers to verify claims from diverse perspectives, thereby ensuring a more balanced and accurate fact-checking. Specifically, we first construct two distinct types of counterfactual instances via causal intervention. Then, we apply counterfactual reasoning to train three independent checkers with tailored counterfactual instances or annotated samples. During inference, we eliminate confirmation bias by synthesizing the verification results of all checkers.

    "abstract": "Despite recent advancements in AI and NLP, negotiation remains a difficult domain for AI agents. Traditional game-theoretic approaches that have worked well in two-player zero-sum games struggle in the context of negotiation due to their inability to learn human-compatible strategies. On the other hand, approaches that only use human data tend to be domain-specific and lack the theoretical guarantees provided by strategies grounded in game-theory. Motivated by the notion of fairness as a criteria for optimality in general sum games, we propose a negotiation framework called FDHC which incorporates fairness into both the reward design and search to learn human-compatible negotiation strategies. Our method includes a novel, RL+search technique called LGM-Zero which leverages a pre-trained language model to retrieve human-compatible offers from large action spaces. Our results show that our method is able to achieve more egalitarian negotiation outcomes and improve negotiation quality",

    "abstract": "Information retrieval models that aim to search for the relevant documents to the given query have shown many successes, which have been applied to diverse tasks. However, the query provided by the user is oftentimes very short, which challenges the retrievers to correctly fetch relevant documents. To tackle this, existing studies have proposed expanding the query with a couple of additional (user-related) features related to the query. Yet, they may be suboptimal to effectively augment the query, meanwhile, there is plenty of information available to augment it in a relational database. In this work, motivated by this, we present a novel retrieval framework called Database-Augmented Query representation (DAQu), which augments the original query with various (query-related) metadata across multiple tables. In addition, as the number of features in the metadata can be very large and there is no order among them, we encode them with our graph-based set encoding strategy, which considers hierarchies of features in the database without order. We validate DAQu in diverse retrieval scenarios that can incorporate metadata from the relational database, demonstrating that ours significantly enhances overall retrieval performance, compared to existing query augmentation methods",

Current methods can easily eliminate most incorrect answers, narrowing the candidate pool to a tiny area called the candidate zone. However, these methods often fail to find the correct answer within this zone, primarily because the entities within the candidate zone are similar in subgraph structure or relational connectivity, causing significant interference. These methods, which either model the graph structure of entities or the paths of relationships, can only address one type of similarity. To address this issue, we propose a model called the $\\textbf{R}$elation Causal Logic $\\textbf{I}$nference and $\\textbf{E}$ntity $\\textbf{S}$tructure Learning (RIES), which consists of two modules: relation inference and entity structure. These two modules model the causal logic of relations over time and the temporal evolution of entities' subgraph structure, respectively, allowing for the differentiation of candidates similar in subgraph structure and relational connectivity.

In this work, we investigate the extent to which modern LMs generate $n$-grams from their training data, evaluating both (i) the probability LMs assign to complete training $n$-grams and (ii) $n$-novelty, the proportion of $n$-grams generated by an LM that did not appear in the training data (for arbitrarily large $n$). To enable arbitrary-length $n$-gram search over a corpus in constant time, we develop Rusty-DAWG, a novel search tool inspired by indexing of genomic data. We compare the novelty of LM-generated text to human-written text and explore factors that affect generation novelty, focusing on the Pythia models. We find that, for $n > 4$, LM-generated text is *less novel* than human-written text, though it is *more novel* for smaller $n$. Larger LMs and more constrained decoding strategies both *decrease novelty*. Finally, we show that LMs complete $n$-grams with lower loss if they are less frequent in the training data. Overall, our results reveal factors influencing the novelty of LM-generated text, and we release Rusty-DAWG to facilitate further pretraining data research",

By leveraging expert and automatic annotations, we uncover significant discrepancies between the LLM- and human- written stories. While human-written stories are suspenseful, arousing, and diverse in narrative structures, LLM stories are homogeneously positive and lack tension. Next, we measure narrative reasoning skills as a precursor to generative capacities, concluding that most LLMs fall short of human abilities in discourse understanding. Finally, we show that explicit integration of aforementioned discourse features can enhance storytelling, as is demonstrated by over 40\\% improvement in neural storytelling in terms of diversity, suspense, and arousal.

This complexity and diversity in SGG leads to underrepresentation, where parts of triplet labels are rare or even unseen during training, resulting in imprecise predictions. To tackle this, we propose integrating the pretrained Vision-language Models to enhance representation. However, due to the gap between pretraining and SGG, direct inference of pretrained VLMs on SGG leads to severe bias, which stems from the imbalanced predicates distribution in the pretraining language set. To alleviate the bias, we introduce a novel LM Estimation to approximate the unattainable predicates distribution. Finally, we ensemble the debiased VLMs with SGG models to enhance the representation, where we design a certainty-aware indicator to score each sample and dynamically adjust the ensemble weights. Our training-free method effectively addresses the predicates bias in pretrained VLMs, enhances SGG's representation, and significantly improve the performance",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the task of Chinese lexical simplification (CLS), which aims to replace complex words in a given sentence with simpler alternatives that retain the original meaning. One of the challenges in CLS is the scarcity of data resources. Previous unsupervised methods exhibit limited performance, while supervised methods struggle because of the lack of annotated data. We begin by evaluating the few-shot performance of several dialogue models at various scales on CLS, discovering that their effectiveness is sensitive to different word types. For large but expensive Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, excel at simplifying in-dictionary common words and Chinese idioms compared to smaller models. Therefore, we propose an automatic knowledge distillation approach that generates training data for common words and Chinese idioms using GPT-4, and then use the training data to fine-tune smaller models in a unified but word-type aware manner. Besides, even GPT-4 encounters difficulties with out-of-dictionary (OOD) words. To address this, we employ a retrieval-based interpretation augmentation strategy, injecting relevant information from external sources into context. The experimental results show that the fine-tuned small models can obtain superior performance than GPT-4 for simplifying common words and idioms, which optimizes the balance between CLS performance and computational cost. The interpretation augmentation strategy can improve the performance of most models for simplifying OOD words",

Ranking techniques have been adopted in RAG systems to sort the retrieved contexts by their relevance to the query so that users can select the most useful contexts for their downstream tasks. While many existing ranking methods rely on the similarity between the embedding vectors of the context and query to measure relevance, it is important to note that similarity does not equate to relevance in all scenarios. Some ranking methods use large language models (LLMs) to rank the contexts by putting the query and the candidate contexts in the prompt and asking LLM about their relevance. The scalability of those methods is contingent on the number of candidate contexts and the context window of those LLMs. Also, those methods require fine-tuning the LLMs, which can be computationally expensive and require domain-related data. In this work, we propose a scalable ranking framework that does not involve LLM training. Our framework uses an off-the-shelf LLM to hypothesize the user's query based on the retrieved contexts and ranks the contexts based on the similarity between the hypothesized queries and the user query. Our framework is efficient at inference time and is compatible with many other context retrieval and ranking techniques.

However, it is limited to questions on single documents, neglecting harder cases that may require *cross-document reasoning* and *optimization*, for example, \"What is the maximum number of scholarships attainable?\" Such questions over multiple documents are not only more challenging due to more context having to understand, but also because the model has to (1) explore all possible combinations of unmentioned conditions and (2) understand the relationship between conditions across documents, to reason about the optimal outcome.

In addition, to enhance model performance, we introduce a novel loss function, decoupled cross-entropy loss (deXent), specifically tailored for the MDD task to facilitate better supervised label learning. A comprehensive set of empirical results carried out on the speechocean762 benchmark dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in multi-aspect multi-granular assessments. Furthermore, our proposed approach also yields considerable improvement in MDD performance over a competitive baseline, achieving an F1-score of 63.32%",

    "title": "FastLexRank: Efficient Lexical Ranking for Structuring Social Media Posts",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we present FastLexRank, a computationally efficient adaptation of the LexRank algorithm, which is an unsupervised approach to ranking texts based on graph-based centrality scoring of sentences, which we have tailored to be efficient text ranking. Addressing the computational and memory complexities of the original LexRank, FastLexRank employs a new algorithm to approximate the stationary distribution of sentence graphs, thereby enhancing efficiency while maintaining the quality of summarization. The correlation of FastLexRank's centrality scores with the original LexRank scores approaches a perfect match, and the Kendall rank correlation between ranked sequences produced by the original and the new approximation approach also reaches this high level of agreement. The paper details these algorithmic modifications and their transformative effect on the size of the data sets that can be processed, e.g., large social media corpora. Empirical results confirm FastLexRank's ability to effectively generate centrality scores for sentences in large social media corpora, underscoring its suitability for real-time analysis in various applications. We further suggest that FastLexRank can act as a ranker to identify the most central tweet, which can then be integrated with more advanced NLP technologies, such as Large Language Models, for enhanced analysis. This research contributes to Natural Language Processing by offering a scalable solution for text centrality calculation, critical for managing the ever-increasing volume of digital content",

    "abstract": "The task of Text-to-SQL enables anyone to retrieve information from SQL databases using natural language. Despite several challenges, recent models have made remarkable advancements in this task using large language models (LLMs). Interestingly, we find that LLM-based models without fine-tuning exhibit distinct natures compared to their fine-tuned counterparts, leading to inadequacies in current evaluation metrics to accurately convey their performance. Thus, we analyze the two primary metrics, Test Suite Execution Accuracy (EXE) and Exact Set Matching Accuracy (ESM), to examine their robustness for this task and address shortcomings. We compare the performance of 9 LLM-based models using EXE, the original ESM, and our improved ESM (called ESM+). Our results show that EXE and ESM have high false positive and negative rates of 11.3% and 13.9%, while ESM+ gives those of 0.1% and 2.6% respectively, providing a significantly more stable evaluation. We release the ESM+ script as open-source for the community to contribute, while enjoying a more reliable assessment of Text-to-SQL",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims to predict aspect-based elements from the given text, mainly including four elements, i.e., aspect category, sentiment polarity, aspect term, and opinion term. Extracting pair, triple, or quad of elements is defined as compound ABSA. Due to its challenges and practical applications, such a compound scenario has become an emerging topic. Recently, large language models (LLMs), e.g. ChatGPT, present impressive abilities in tackling various human instructions. In this work, we are particularly curious whether ChatGPT still possesses superior performance in handling compound ABSA tasks. To assess the performance of ChatGPT, we design a novel framework, called ChatABSA. Concretely, we design two strategies: constrained prompts, to automatically organize the returned predictions; post-processing, to better evaluate the capability of ChatGPT in recognition of implicit information. The overall evaluation involves 5 compound ABSA tasks and 8 publicly available datasets. We compare ChatGPT with few-shot supervised baselines and fully supervised baselines, including corresponding state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on each task. Experimental results show that ChatABSA exhibits excellent aspect-based sentiment analysis capabilities and overwhelmingly beats few-shot supervised methods under the same few-shot settings. Surprisingly, it can even outperform fully supervised methods in some cases. However, in most cases, it underperforms fully supervised methods, and there is still a huge gap between its performance and the SOTA method. Moreover, we also conduct a series of correlation analyses to gain a deeper understanding of its sentiment analysis capabilities",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are used by many to generate code in a pair-programming-like setting. However, intents in users' coding instructions are ambiguous, and models are limited in their ability to use dialogue to disambiguate intent to produce unambiguous code. This presents a fundamental difficulty in code generation, wherein the ambiguity in natural language can lead to seemingly correct programs that are different from the intended. We propose to use dialogue to reduce this ambiguity, specifically in the plotting domain, and contribute an analysis of the different types of ambiguity that may exist in multi-modal code generation. Based on our analysis, we propose different pragmatic models to inform dialogue strategies for ambiguity resolution, including those based on Rational Speech Acts (cooperative), Discourse Theory (discoursive), and Questions under Discussion (inquisitive). Finally, we compare these dialogue strategies in a simulated dialogue setting — operationalizing the pragmatic models via prompting. Our findings suggest that discoursive and cooperative reasoning styles show the best results regarding executability and disambiguation, while inquisitive reasoning performs the best in disambiguation for vagueness. These suggest that simulated dialogues with pragmatic frameworks can resolve ambiguities in code generation",

LawInstruct covers 17 global jurisdictions, 24 languages and a total of 12M examples across diverse tasks such as legal QA, summarization of court cases, and legal argument mining. We evaluate our models on LegalBench, measuring legal reasoning across five categories in 162 challenging and realistic legal tasks, and MMLU, to measure potential drops in general reasoning capabilities.

In this paper, we introduce a framework grounded in group and symmetry principles, which have played a crucial role in fields such as physics and mathematics, and offer another way to evaluate their capabilities. While the proposed framework is general, to showcase the benefits of employing these properties, we focus on arithmetic reasoning and investigate the performance of these models on four group properties: closure, identity, inverse, and associativity. Our findings reveal that LLMs studied in this work struggle to preserve group properties across different test regimes. In the closure test, we observe biases towards specific outputs and an abrupt degradation in their performance from 100% to 0% after a specific sequence length. They also perform poorly in the identity test, which represents adding irrelevant information in the context, and show sensitivity when subjected to inverse test, which examines the robustness of the model with respect to negation. In addition, we demonstrate that breaking down problems into smaller steps helps LLMs in the associativity test that we have conducted. To support these tests we have developed a synthetic dataset which will be released",

This paper introduces a framework that incorporates the compute budget into the evaluation, providing a more informative comparison that takes into account both performance metrics and computational cost. In this budget-aware perspective, we find that complex reasoning strategies often don't surpass simpler baselines purely due to algorithmic ingenuity, but rather due to the larger computational resources allocated. When we provide a simple baseline like chain-of-thought self-consistency with comparable compute resources, it frequently outperforms reasoning strategies proposed in the literature.

Our findings indicate that GPT-4 can generate persuasive analyses affecting the decisions of both amateurs and professionals. Furthermore, we evaluate the generated text from the aspects of grammar, persuasiveness, logical coherence, and usefulness. The results highlight a high correlation between real-world evaluation through audience reactions and the current multi-dimensional evaluators commonly used for generative models. Overall, this paper shows the potential and risk of using generated text to sway human decisions and also points out a new direction for evaluating generated text, i.e., leveraging the reactions and decisions of readers.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Recent approaches to controlled text generation (CTG) often involve manipulating the weights or logits of base language models (LMs) at decoding time. However, these methods are inapplicable to latest black-box LMs and ineffective at preserving the core semantics of the base LM's original generations. In this work, we propose Locate&Edit(L&E), an efficient and flexible energy-based approach to CTG, which edits text outputs from a base LM using off-the-shelf energy models. Given text outputs from the base LM, L&E first locates spans that are most relevant to constraints (e.g., toxicity) utilizing energy models, and then edits these spans by replacing them with more suitable alternatives. Importantly, our method is compatible with black-box LMs, as it requires only the text outputs. Also, since L&E doesn't mandate specific architecture for its component models, it can work with a diverse combination of available off-the-shelf models. Moreover, L&E preserves the base LM's original generations, by selectively modifying constraint-related aspects of the texts and leaving others unchanged. These targeted edits also ensure that L&E operates efficiently. Our experiments confirm that L&E achieves superior semantic preservation of the base LM generations and speed, while simultaneously obtaining competitive or improved constraint satisfaction. Furthermore, we analyze how the granularity of energy distribution impacts CTG performance and find that fine-grained, regression-based energy models improve constraint satisfaction, compared to conventional binary classifier energy models",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced instruction-following capabilities. However, most Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) datasets are predominantly in English, limiting model performance in other languages. Traditional methods for creating multilingual IFT datasets—such as translating existing English IFT datasets or converting existing NLP datasets into IFT datasets by templating—struggle to capture linguistic nuances and ensure prompt (instruction) diversity. To address this issue, we propose a novel method for collecting multilingual IFT datasets that preserves linguistic naturalness and ensures prompt diversity. This approach leverages English-focused LLMs, monolingual corpora, and a scoring function to create high-quality, diversified IFT datasets in multiple languages. Experiments demonstrate that LLMs finetuned using these IFT datasets show notable improvements in both generative and discriminative tasks, indicating enhanced language comprehension by LLMs in non-English contexts. Specifically, on the multilingual summarization task, LLMs using our IFT dataset achieved 17.57% and 15.23% improvements over LLMs fine-tuned with translation-based and template-based datasets, respectively",

While further SFT and RLHF-based safety training can be conducted in multi-modal settings, collecting multi-modal training datasets poses a significant challenge. Inspired by the structural design of recent multi-modal models, where all input modalities are ultimately fused into the language space, we explore whether unlearning solely in the textual domain can be effective for cross-modality safety alignment. Our empirical evaluation across seven datasets demonstrates promising transferability --- textual unlearning in VLMs significantly reduces the Attack Success Rate (ASR) to less than 8% and in some cases, even as low as nearly 2% for both text-based and vision-text-based attacks, alongside preserving the utility. Moreover, our experiments show that unlearning with a multi-modal dataset offers no potential benefits but incurs significantly increased computational demands",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Utilizing large language models (LLMs) for zero-shot document ranking is done in one of two ways: 1) prompt-based re-ranking methods, which require no further training but are only feasible for re-ranking a handful of candidate documents due to computational costs; and 2) unsupervised contrastive trained dense retrieval methods, which can retrieve relevant documents from the entire corpus but require a large amount of paired text data for contrastive training. In this paper, we propose PromptReps, which combines the advantages of both categories: no need for training and the ability to retrieve from the whole corpus. Our method only requires prompts to guide an LLM to generate query and document representations for effective document retrieval. Specifically, we prompt the LLMs to represent a given text using a single word, and then use the last token's hidden states and the corresponding logits associated with the prediction of the next token to construct a hybrid document retrieval system. The retrieval system harnesses both dense text embedding and sparse bag-of-words representations given by the LLM. We further explore variations of this core idea that consider the generation of multiple words, and representations that rely on multiple embeddings and sparse distributions. Our experimental evaluation on the MSMARCO, TREC deep learning and BEIR zero-shot document retrieval datasets illustrates that this simple prompt-based LLM retrieval method can achieve a similar or higher retrieval effectiveness than state-of-the-art LLM embedding methods that are trained with large amounts of unsupervised data, especially when using a larger LLM",

In this paper, we introduce a novel context preparation approach called HiGenQA, which employs Automatic Hint Generation (HG) systems.

We evaluate our approach across three QA datasets including TriviaQA, Natural Questions, and Web Questions, examining how the number and order of hints impact performance. Our findings show that HiGenQA surpasses both retrieval-based and generation-based approaches. We demonstrate that hints enhance the accuracy of answers more than retrieved and generated contexts",

Similar single-label XWS settings have been explored recently, however, these methods cannot be easily adapted for multi-label. We observe that (1) most documents have a dominant class covering the majority of content and (2) long-tail labels would appear in some documents as a dominant class. Therefore, we first utilize the user description to prompt a large language model (LLM) for dominant keyphrases of a subset of raw documents, and then construct a (initial) label space via clustering. We further apply a zero-shot multi-label classifier to locate the documents with small top predicted scores, so we can revisit their dominant keyphrases for more long-tail labels. We iterate this process to discover a comprehensive label space and construct a multi-label classifier as a novel method, X-MLClass. X-MLClass exhibits a remarkable increase in ground-truth label space coverage on various datasets, for example, a 40\\% improvement on the AAPD dataset over topic modeling and keyword extraction methods.

Our approach consists of two components: a large language model and a minimal distortion model. At each decoding step, the large language model calculates the probabilities of the next token based on the preceding context. Then, the distortion model adjusts these probabilities to penalize the generation of tokens that deviate too far from the input. Different from the prior supervised fine-tuning and prompt-based approaches, our approach enables efficient CSC without requiring additional training or task-specific prompts. To address practical challenges, we propose a length reward strategy to mitigate the local optima problem during beam search decoding, and a faithfulness reward strategy to reduce over-corrections. Comprehensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves LLM performance, enabling them to compete with state-of-the-art domain-general CSC models",

During inference, the adversarial hidden state is first combined with sampled noise, then denoised iteratively and finally ensembled to produce a robust text representation.

    "abstract": "Document-grounded goal-oriented dialogue systems are designed to respond to user queries by leveraging relevant external information. Previous studies have mainly focused on handling free-form documents, often overlooking structured data such as list items, which can represent a range of nuanced semantic relations. Motivated by the observation that even advanced language models like GPT-3.5 often miss semantic cues from lists, this paper aims to enhance dialogue systems for better interpretation and use of structured lists. To this end, we introduce the List2Dial dataset, a novel benchmark to evaluate the ability of dialogue systems to respond effectively using list information. This dataset is created from unlabeled customer service documents using language models and model-based filtering processes to enhance data quality, and can be used both to fine-tune and evaluate dialogue models. Apart from directly generating responses through fine-tuning models, we further investigate the explicit use of Intermediate Steps for List (ISL) information, including list types and alignment with user background, which better reflects how humans assess list items before formulating responses. Our experimental results demonstrate that models trained on List2Dial with our ISL approach outperform baselines across various metrics. Specifically, our fine-tuned Flan-T5-XL model shows increases of 3.1% in ROUGE-L, 4.6% in correctness, 4.5% in faithfulness, and 20.6% in completeness compared to models without applying filtering and the proposed ISL method.

Through extensive experiments, we show that prompting-based rationales align better with human-annotated rationales than attribution-based rationales, and demonstrate reasonable alignment with humans even when model performance is poor. We additionally find that the faithfulness limitations of prompting-based methods, which are identified in previous work, may be linked to their collapsed predictions. By fine-tuning these models on the corresponding datasets, both prompting and attribution methods demonstrate improved faithfulness. Our study sheds light on more rigorous and fair evaluations of LLM rationales, especially for prompting-based ones. Code and data will be released upon paper acceptance",

Our contributions are fourfold: First, we introduce a framework using a real, anonymized resume dataset from the Healthcare, Finance, and Construction industries, meticulously used to avoid confounding factors. It evaluates gender hiring biases across hierarchical levels, including Level bias, Spread bias, Taste-based bias, and Statistical bias. This framework can be generalized to other social traits and tasks easily. Second, we propose novel statistical and computational hiring bias metrics based on a counterfactual approach, including Rank After Scoring (RAS), Rank-based Impact Ratio, Permutation Test-Based Metrics, and Fixed Effects Model-based Metrics. These metrics, rooted in labor economics, NLP, and law, enable holistic evaluation of hiring biases. Third, we analyze hiring biases in ten state-of-the-art LLMs. Six out of ten LLMs show significant biases against males in healthcare and finance. An industry-effect regression reveals that the healthcare industry is the most biased against males. GPT-4o and GPT-3.5 are the most biased models, showing significant bias in all three industries. Conversely, Gemini-1.5-Pro, Llama3-8b-Instruct, and Llama3-70b-Instruct are the least biased. The hiring bias of all LLMs, except for Llama3-8b-Instruct and Claude-3-Sonnet, remains consistent regardless of random expansion or reduction of resume content.

In this paper, we revisit similarity-based metrics, showing that this failure stems from the comparison text selection and its granularity. We propose a new zero-shot factuality evaluation metric, Sentence-BERT Score (SBERTScore), which compares sentences between the summary and the source document. It outperforms widely-used word-word metrics including BERTScore and can compete with existing NLI and QA-based factuality metrics on the benchmark without needing any fine-tuning.

To address this, we introduce Fusion for Language Representations (FLARE) in adapters, a method designed to improve both the representation quality and downstream performance for languages other than English. FLARE integrates source and target language representations within the bottlenecks of low-rank LoRA adapters using lightweight linear transformations. This maintains parameter efficiency as the method does not require additional parameters, while improving transfer performance, further narrowing the performance gap to English. Another key advantage of the proposed latent representation fusion is that it does not increase the number of input tokens, thus maintaining computational efficiency. Moreover, FLARE provides flexibility to integrate various types of representations, e.g., we show that it is possible to fuse latent translations extracted from machine translation models. Our results demonstrate FLARE's effectiveness on natural language understanding tasks, reducing the performance gap to English across all tasks",

While such extraction methods are widely used, evaluating their effectiveness remains an open question. Moreover, some existing practices heavily rely on slow and laborious human annotation procedures. Inspired by recently introduced LLM-based judge methods, we propose a novel methodology that decomposes quality into five main metrics along different aspects of evaluation. This framing simplifies and expedites the manual evaluation process and enables automatic and independent LLM-based evaluation. As a test case, we apply our approach to a corpus of Holocaust survivor testimonies, motivated both by its relevance to title set extraction and by this pursuit's moral significance. We validate the methodology by experimenting with naturalistic and synthetic title set generation systems and compare their performance with the methodology",

    "abstract": "The effectiveness of autoregressive LLMs has allowed many language and vision tasks to be reframed as generative problems. Generative visual language models (VLMs) have recently shown potential across various downstream tasks. However, it is still an open question whether, and to what extent, these models can properly understand a multimodal context where language and vision provide complementary information---a mechanism routinely in place in human language communication. In this work, we test various VLMs on the task of generating action descriptions consistent with both an image's visual content and an intention or attitude (not visually grounded) conveyed by a textual prompt. Our results show that BLIP-2 is not far from human performance when the task is framed as a generative multiple-choice problem, while other models struggle. Furthermore, the actions generated by BLIP-2 in an open-ended generative setting are better than those by the competitors; indeed, human annotators judge most of them as plausible continuations for the multimodal context. Our study reveals substantial variability among VLMs in integrating complementary multimodal information, yet BLIP-2 demonstrates promising trends across most evaluations, paving the way for seamless human-computer interaction",

Past work has primarily treated entity linking as a standard supervised learning problem. However, supervised entity matching models often do not generalize well to new data, and collecting exhaustive labeled training data is often cost prohibitive. Further, recent efforts have adopted LLMs for this task in few/zero-shot settings, exploiting their general knowledge. But LLMs are prohibitively expensive for performing inference at scale for real-world entity matching tasks. As an efficient alternative, we re-cast entity matching as a conditional generation task as opposed to binary classification. This enables us to \"distill\" LLM reasoning into smaller entity matching models via natural language explanations. This approach achieves strong performance, especially on out-of-domain generalization tests (10.85% F-1) where standalone generative methods struggle.

To address this limitation, we propose PORTIA, an alignment-based system designed to mimic human comparison strategies to calibrate position bias in a lightweight yet effective manner. Specifically, PORTIA splits the answers into multiple segments, taking into account both length and semantics, and merges them back into a single prompt for evaluation by LLMs. Extensive experiments with six LLMs on 11,520 answer pairs demonstrate that PORTIA markedly enhances the consistency rates for all models and forms of comparison tested, achieving an average relative improvement of 47.46\\%. It also enables GPT-3.5 to achieve performance comparable to GPT-4 and elevates GPT-4's consistency rate up to 98\\%.

A known pitfall of this approach is the \\emph{catastrophic forgetting} of prior knowledge that happens during fine-tuning. A common approach to alleviate such forgetting is to rehearse samples from prior tasks during fine-tuning. Several existing works assume a fixed memory buffer to store prior task examples, while relying on inferences (forward passes) with the model at hand for choosing examples for rehearsal from the buffer. However, given the increasing computational cost of model inference, and decreasing cost of data storage, we focus on the setting to rehearse samples with a fixed computational budget instead of a fixed memory budget. We propose a sampling scheme, \\texttt{\\bf mix-cd}, that prioritizes rehearsal of ``collateral damage'' samples, which are samples predicted correctly by the prior model but forgotten by the incrementally tuned one. The crux of our scheme is a procedure to efficiently estimate the density of collateral damage samples without incurring additional model inferences.

In this study we evaluate the potential for LLMs to be part of the solution for mitigating online dis/misinformation rather than the problem. Employing a public expert annotated dataset and a curated sample of social media content we evaluate the performance of GPT-4 and fine-tuned GPT-3.5-turbo on climate misinformation classification task, comparing them to existing climate-focused computer-assisted tools and expert assessments. Results show that fine-tuned GPT-3.5-turbo outperforms GPT-4 and a BERT-based model for classifying climate misinformation and functions at the equivalency of climate change experts with over 20 years of experience in climate communication. These findings highlight the potential of fine-tuned LLMs in 1) facilitating civil society organizations with limited technical expertise to engage in a range of governance tasks with respect to climate misinformation, and 2) encourage further exploration of AI-driven solutions for detecting climate dis/misinformation",

    "abstract": "An important factor when it comes to generating fact-checking explanations is the selection of evidence: intuitively, high-quality explanations can only be generated given the right evidence. In this work, we investigate the impact of human-curated vs. machine-selected evidence for explanation generation using large language models. To assess the quality of explanations, we focus on transparency (whether an explanation cites sources properly) and utility (whether an explanation is helpful in clarifying a claim). Surprisingly, we found that large language models generate similar or higher quality explanations using machine-selected evidence, suggesting carefully curated evidence (by humans) may not be necessary. That said, even with the best model, the generated explanations are not always faithful to the sources, suggesting further room for improvement in explanation generation for fact-checking",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Automatic diagnosis (AD) represents a pivotal area in healthcare, where patient symptoms are analyzed for disease diagnosis. Traditional approaches depend on extracting features from symptoms and diseases within collected patient cases. However, real-life patient data collection poses challenges, often resulting in incomplete clinical datasets that can lead to misdiagnosis, especially for new diseases or unrecorded symptoms. Recently, retrieval-augmented large language models (RA-LLMs) have shown significant promise in addressing knowledge-intensive Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. To mitigate reliance on previously seen data, we propose a two-layer AD system, termed Dx-LLM, leveraging RA-LLMs. Dx-LLM first constructs a disease-symptom knowledge graph from an external dataset of disease symptom descriptions and conducts initial disease filtering to identify potential candidate diseases based on patient symptoms. Subsequently, in the second layer, we utilize the robust language understanding and generation capabilities of LLMs to re-rank these candidates, thereby producing refined diagnostic outcomes. This two-layer approach reduces the computational load on the second-layer LLM by narrowing down the disease candidates in the first layer. Our results demonstrate that Dx-LLM achieves hit@10 scores of 71.41\\% and 70.38\\% across 1058 diseases in English and Chinese datasets, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art baselines",

We use language models fine-tuned with differential privacy to generate data and incorporate NLI-based filtering to improve text coherence. In contrast to prior work, we generate and evaluate data for fine-grained applications in real high-stakes domains. Our results show that prior simplistic evaluations have failed to highlight utility, privacy, and fairness issues in the synthetic data generated, and while NLI-based filtering can help alleviate some of these weaknesses, the quality of the synthetic data generated still necessitates further improvements",

Based on the intuition that different dimensions correspond to different frequency of changes in RoPE encoding, we conducted a dimension-level analysis to investigate the correlation between a hidden dimension of an attention head and its contribution to capturing long-distance dependencies. Using our correlation metric, we identified a particular type of attention heads, which we named \\emph{Positional Heads}, from various length-extrapolated models. These heads exhibit a strong focus on long-range information interaction and play a pivotal role in long input processing, as evidence by our ablation. We further demonstrate the correlation between the efficiency of length extrapolation and the extension of the high-dimensional attention allocation of these heads.

    "abstract": "In recent years, numerous studies have sought to enhance the capabilities of pretrained language models (PLMs) for Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) tasks by integrating structural information from knowledge graphs. However, existing approaches have not effectively combined the structural attributes of knowledge graphs with the textual descriptions of entities to generate robust entity encodings. To address this issue, this paper proposes MoCoKGC (Momentum Contrast Entity Encoding for Knowledge Graph Completion), which incorporates three primary encoders: the entity-relation encoder, the entity encoder, and the momentum entity encoder. Momentum contrast learning not only provides more negative samples but also allows for the gradual updating of entity encodings. Consequently, we reintroduce the generated entity encodings into the encoder to incorporate the graph's structural information. Additionally, MoCoKGC enhances the inferential capabilities of the entity-relation encoder through deep prompts of relations. On the standard evaluation metric, Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), the MoCoKGC model demonstrates superior performance, achieving a 7.1% improvement on the WN18RR dataset and an 11% improvement on the Wikidata5M dataset, while also surpassing the current best model on the FB15k-237 dataset.

    "abstract": "In-context learning methods are popular inference strategies where Large Language Models (LLMs) are elicited to solve a task using provided demonstrations without parameter updates. Among these approaches are the reasoning methods, best exemplified by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Program-Aided Language Models (PAL), which elicit LLMs to generate reasoning paths, thus promoting accuracy and attracting increasing attention. However, despite the success of these methods, the ability to deliver multi-step reasoning remains limited to a single language, making it challenging to generalize to other languages and hindering global development. In this work, we propose Cross-lingual Program-Aided Language Models (CrossPAL), a method for aligning reasoning programs across languages. In particular, our method delivers programs as intermediate reasoning steps in different languages through a double-step cross-lingual prompting mechanism inspired by the Program-Aided approach. In addition, we introduce Self-consistent CrossPAL (SCrossPAL) to ensemble different reasoning paths across languages.

However, these locate-and-edit methods suffer from heavy computational overhead and lack theoretical validation.

The growing language interpretation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), including in formal languages, are lowering the barriers for autoformalization. However, LLMs alone are not capable of consistently and reliably delivering autoformalization, in particular as the complexity and specialization of the target domain grows. As the field evolves into the direction of systematically applying autoformalization towards large mathematical libraries, the need to improve syntactic, terminological and semantic control increases. This paper proposes the coordinated use of three mechanisms, most-similar retrieval augmented generation (MS-RAG), denoising steps and auto-correction with syntax error feedback (Auto-SEF) to improve autoformalization quality. The empirical analysis, across different models, demonstrates that these mechanisms can deliver autoformalizaton results which are syntactically, terminologically and semantically more consistent.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive language understanding and generation capabilities, enabling them to answer a wide range of questions across various domains. However, these models are not flawless and often produce responses that contain errors or misinformation. These inaccuracies, commonly referred to as hallucinations, render LLMs unreliable and even unusable in many scenarios. In this paper, our focus is on mitigating the issue of hallucination in LLMs, particularly in the context of question-answering. Instead of attempting to answer all questions, we explore a refusal mechanism that instructs LLMs to refuse to answer challenging questions in order to avoid errors. We then propose a simple yet effective solution called Learn to Refuse (L2R), which incorporates the refusal mechanism to enable LLMs to recognize and refuse to answer questions that they find difficult to address. To achieve this, we utilize a structured knowledge base to represent all the LLM's understanding of the world, enabling it to provide traceable gold knowledge. This knowledge base is separate from the LLM and initially empty. It can be filled with validated knowledge and progressively expanded. When an LLM encounters questions outside its domain, the system recognizes its knowledge scope and determines whether it can answer the question independently. Additionally, we introduce a method for automatically and efficiently expanding the knowledge base of LLMs. Through qualitative and quantitative analysis, we demonstrate that our approach enhances the controllability and reliability of LLMs",

This limitation is an inherent performance ceiling that is increasingly glaring compared to their natively-contextual LLM counterparts. A common explanation is the lack of document-level annotations for existing training data. This work investigates whether having such annotations would be helpful for training traditional MT systems at scale. Working with a private parallel and monolingual data set, we build large-scale, state-of-the-art contextual MT systems into German, French, and Russian. We find that these systems are harmed when including contextual training examples sourced from mined parallel bitext. We also show that these improvements are invisible when using contrastive score-based test sets; instead, models must be tested directly on their ability to generate correct outputs, or with standard metrics on discourse-dense test sets. This provides evidence that mined parallel bitext does not contain reliable contextual signals---perhaps because it was translated in a sentence-level manner.

Based on the above two insights, we introduce a new scheme, named TF-Attack, for Transferable and Fast adversarial attacks on LLMs. TF-Attack employs an external LLM as a third-party overseer rather than the victim model to identify critical units within sentences. Moreover, TF-Attack introduces the concept of Importance Level, which allows for parallel substitutions of attacks.

Most current research focuses on either width-only or a blend of width and depth pruning, with little comparative analysis between the two units (width vs. depth) concerning their impact on LLM inference efficiency. In this work, we show that simple depth pruning can effectively compress LLMs while achieving comparable or superior performance to recent width pruning studies. Our pruning method boosts inference speeds, especially under memory-constrained conditions that require limited batch sizes for running LLMs, where width pruning is ineffective.

Meanwhile, a parallel body of work has shown that accurate fact completions can result from various inference processes, including predictions based on superficial properties of the query or even pure guesswork. In this paper, we present a taxonomy of relevant prediction mechanisms and observe that a well-known dataset for interpreting the inference process of LMs for fact completion misses important distinctions in this taxonomy. With this in mind, we propose a model-specific recipe for constructing precise testing data, which we call PrepMech. We use this data to investigate the sensitivity of a popular interpretability method, causal tracing (CT), to different prediction mechanisms. We find that while CT produces different results for different mechanisms, aggregations are only representative of the mechanism that corresponds to the strongest signal. In summary, we contribute tools for a more granular study of fact completion in language models and analyses that provide a more nuanced understanding of the underlying mechanisms",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful tools with extensive applications, but their tendency to memorize private information raises significant concerns as private data leakage can easily happen. In this paper, we introduce Private Association Editing (PAE), a novel defense approach for private data leakage. PAE is designed to effectively remove Personally Identifiable Information (PII) without retraining the model. Our approach consists of a four-step procedure: detecting memorized PII, applying PAE cards to mitigate memorization of private data, verifying resilience to targeted data extraction (TDE) attacks, and ensuring consistency in the post-edit LLMs. The versatility and efficiency of PAE, which allows for batch modifications, significantly enhance data privacy in LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of PAE in mitigating private data leakage. We believe PAE will serve as a critical tool in the ongoing effort to protect data privacy in LLMs, encouraging the development of safer models for real-world applications",

    "abstract": "Since large language models (LLMs) achieve significant success in recent years, the hallucination issue remains a challenge, and numerous benchmarks are proposed for hallucination detection. Nevertheless, some of these benchmarks are not naturally generated by LLMs but are intentionally induced. Also, many merely focus on the factuality hallucination while ignoring the faithfulness hallucination. Additionally, although dialogue pattern is more widely utilized in the era of LLMs, current benchmarks only concentrate on sentence-level and passage-level hallucination. In this study, we propose DiaHalu, the first dedicated dialogue-level hallucination evaluation benchmark for LLMs to our knowledge. Initially, we integrate the collected topics into system prompts and facilitate a dialogue between two LLMs. Subsequently, we manually modify the contents that do not adhere to human language conventions and then have LLMs re-generate, simulating authentic human-machine interaction scenarios. Finally, professional scholars annotate all the samples in the dataset. DiaHalu covers four common multi-turn dialogue domains and five hallucination subtypes, extended from factuality and faithfulness hallucination. Experiments through some well-known LLMs and detection methods on the dataset show that DiaHalu is a challenging benchmark, holding significant value for further research",

This paper presents a comprehensive study exploring the empathetic responding capabilities of four state-of-the-art LLMs: GPT-4, LLaMA-2-70B-Chat, Gemini-1.0-Pro, and Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct in comparison to a human baseline. We engaged 1,000 participants in a between-subjects user study, assessing the empathetic quality of responses generated by humans and the four LLMs to 2,000 emotional dialogue prompts meticulously selected to cover a broad spectrum of 32 distinct positive and negative emotions. Our findings reveal a statistically significant superiority of the empathetic responding capability of LLMs over humans. GPT-4 emerged as the most empathetic, marking approximately 31% increase in responses rated as \"Good\" compared to the human benchmark. It was followed by LLaMA-2, Mixtral-8x7B, and Gemini-Pro, which showed increases of approximately 24%, 21%, and 10% in \"Good\" ratings, respectively. We further analyzed the response ratings at a finer granularity and discovered that some LLMs are significantly better at responding to specific emotions compared to others. The suggested evaluation framework offers a scalable and adaptable approach for assessing the empathy of new LLMs, avoiding the need to replicate this study's findings in future research",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) can be abused at scale to create non-factual content and spread disinformation. Detecting LLM-generated content is essential to mitigate these risks, but current classifiers often fail to generalize in open-world contexts. Prior work shows that LLMs tend to rewrite LLM-generated content less frequently, which can be used for detection and naturally generalizes to unforeseen data. However, we find that the rewriting edit distance between human and LLM content can be indistinguishable across domains, leading to detection failures. We propose training an LLM to rewrite input text, producing minimal edits for LLM-generated content and more edits for human-written text, deriving a distinguishable and generalizable edit distance difference across different domains. Experiments on text from 21 independent domains and three popular LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini, and Llama-3) show that our classifier outperforms the state-of-the-art zero-shot classifier by up to 27.1\\% on AUROC score and the rewriting classifier by 6\\% on F1 score.

Language-specific modeling methods show promise in reducing interference. However, they often rely on heuristics to distribute capacity and struggle to foster cross-lingual transfer via isolated modules. In this paper, we explore intrinsic task modularity within multilingual networks and leverage these observations to circumvent interference under multilingual translation. We show that neurons in the feed-forward layers tend to be activated in a language-specific manner. Meanwhile, these specialized neurons exhibit structural overlaps that reflect language proximity, which progress across layers. Based on these findings, we propose Neuron Specialization, an approach that identifies specialized neurons to modularize feed-forward layers and then continuously updates them through sparse networks.

    "abstract": "Scale is often attributed as one of the factors that cause an increase in the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs), resulting in models with billion and trillion parameters. One of the limitations of such large models is the high computational requirements that limit their usage, deployment, and debugging in resource-constrained scenarios. Two commonly used alternatives to bypass these limitations are to use the smaller versions of LLMs (e.g. Llama 7B instead of Llama 70B) or lower the memory requirements by using quantization. While both approaches effectively address the limitation of resources, their impact on model performance needs thorough examination to make an informed decision. For instance, given a certain memory budget that fits a large model with low precision and a small model with high precision, what would be the right choice that results in good performance? In this study, we aim to answer such questions and investigate the effect of model scale and quantization on the performance using two major families of open-source instruct models. Our extensive zero-shot experiments reveal that larger models generally outperform their smaller counterparts, suggesting that scale remains an important factor in enhancing performance. Moreover, large models show exceptional resilience to precision reduction and serve as a better solution than smaller models at high precision under similar memory requirements",

We then separate the identification and classification functions of LLMs by selectively masking the optimization of tokens during fine-tuning. During the inference stage, we alternately contrast output distributions derived from sub-task models. This approach aims to selectively enhance the identification and classification capabilities while minimizing the influence of other inherent abilities in LLMs. Additionally, we propose an alternate adaptive constraint strategy to more effectively adjust the scale and scope of contrastive tokens.

As large language models (LLMs) become a primary tool for understanding events at scale, they can be useful for elucidating these harms. However, labeling harmful events is challenging due to the subjectivity of labels such as \"toxicity\" and \"hate.\" Motivated by the rise of antisemitism, this paper presents a case study of the capability of LLMs to discover reports of antisemitic events. We pilot the task of hateful event classification on the AMCHA Corpus, a continuously updated dataset with expert-labeled instances of 3 coarse-grained categories and 14 fine-grained types of antisemitism. We show that incorporating domain knowledge from fine-grained taxonomies is needed to make LLMs more effective at this task. Our experiments find that providing precise definitions from a fine-grained taxonomy of antisemitism can steer GPT-4 and Llama-3 to perform better on tagging antisemitic event descriptions to a limited extent, with GPT-4 achieving up to a 14\\% increase in mean weighted F1. However, our results suggest that LLMs are still far from perfect at understanding antisemitic events, suggesting avenues for future work on more creative LLM alignment and more policy work on creating precise definitions of antisemitism",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Document-level relation extraction (DocRE) aims to extract relations between entities from unstructured document text. Compared to sentence-level relation extraction, it requires more complex semantic understanding from a broader text context. Currently, some studies are utilizing logical rules within evidence sentences to enhance the performance of DocRE. However, in the data without provided evidence sentences, researchers often obtain a list of evidence sentences for the entire document through evidence retrieval (ER). Therefore, DocRE suffers from two challenges: firstly, the relevance between evidence and entity pairs is weak; secondly, there is insufficient extraction of complex cross-relations between long-distance multi-entities. To overcome these challenges, we propose GEGA, a novel model for DocRE. The model leverages graph neural networks to construct multiple weight matrices, guiding attention allocation to evidence sentences. It also employs multi-scale representation aggregation to enhance ER. Subsequently, we integrate the most efficient evidence information to implement both fully supervised and weakly supervised training processes for the model. We evaluate the GEGA model on three widely used benchmark datasets: DocRED, Re-DocRED, and Revisit-DocRED. The experimental results indicate that our model has achieved comprehensive improvements compared to the existing SOTA model",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Modern text-to-image generation models are capable of producing realistic and high-quality images. However, user prompts often contain ambiguities, making it difficult for these systems to interpret users' actual intentions. Consequently, users often need to modify their prompts several times to ensure the generated images meet their expectations. Although some previous works aim to refine prompts for generating images that align with user requirements, comprehending the true needs of users, particularly non-expert individuals, remains a challenge for the model. In this research, we aim to enhance the visual parameter-tuning process, making the model user-friendly for individuals without specialized knowledge and it can better understand user needs. We propose a human-machine co-adaption strategy by maximizing the mutual information between the user's prompts and the pictures under modification as the optimizing target in order to make the system better adapt to user needs. We find that an improved model can reduce the necessity for multiple rounds of adjustments. We also collect multi-round dialogue datasets with prompts and images pairs and user intent.

By leveraging adjacent edge features in the graph, our model can assist downstream tasks such as node classification. The connection between nodes in graph data is often enriched by the adjacent edges, which provide more effective and abundant information. To exploit this, our model combines edge features and node features in the attention calculation, convolving them together to generate new attention coefficients. This approach facilitates efficient information transmission and aggregation between nodes, leading to improved performance. We apply our new model to several citation networks commonly used in the field of graph neural networks for node classification, and compare it with the current mainstream graph convolution neural network models.

This study investigates the dual capabilities of LLMs as both facilitators and defenders against CSE threats.

Our findings reveal that, while off-the-shelf LLMs generate high-quality CSE content, their detection capabilities are suboptimal, leading to increased operational costs for defense. In response, we propose $\\textbf{ConvoSentinel}$, a modular defense pipeline that improves detection at both the message and the conversation levels, offering enhanced adaptability and cost-effectiveness. The retrieval-augmented module in $\\textbf{ConvoSentinel}$ identifies malicious intent by comparing messages to a database of similar conversations, enhancing CSE detection at all stages.

Inspired by recent work that leverages transliteration in encoder-only models, we investigate whether transliteration is also effective in improving LLMs' performance for low-resource languages written in non-Latin scripts. To this end, we propose three prompt templates, where the target-language text is represented in (1) its original script, (2) Latin script, or (3) both. We apply these methods to several representative LLMs of different sizes on various tasks including text classification and sequential labeling.

    "abstract": "Memory-augmented Large Language Models (LLMs) can recall and reason on recalled past contexts (named recall-reason step). However, multiple recall-reason steps may produce biased thoughts, i.e., inconsistent reasoning paths over the same recalled results. Motivated by that humans only memorize the metacognition thoughts in mind rather than event details, we propose a novel memory-augmented framework called Think-in-Memory (TiM) to flexibly utilize the historical context. Concretely, we formulate a self-organizing memory mechanism equipped with a metacognition space and stationary operation actions, leveraging role-playing LLM agents to achieve thought generator, retriever, and organizer. Supported by such multi-agent self-organization, TiM can imitate human-level metacognition to memorize and update history context as metacognition thoughts without suffering from reasoning inconsistency. TiM can process ultra-long history context in a plug-and-play paradigm to benefit downstream interactions. To conduct evaluations under more complex tasks, clinical diagnosis is adopted as the evaluation task: (1) we formulate a role-play simulator to simulate long-term interactions between the doctor and patient. (2) we collect a multi-turn medical consultations dataset from the real-world hospitals. Besides, two daily conversation datasets are also involved. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves remarkable improvements on memory-augmented long-term dialogues about both daily and medical topics",

    "title": "Exploiting Reversible Semantic Parsing and Text Generation for Error Correction with Pre-trained LLMs",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Semantic parsing and text generation are reversible processes when working with Discourse Representation Structures (DRS). Obviously, errors can arise in both the parsing (text-to-DRS) and generation (DRS-to-text). This paper presents an approach that exploits the reversible nature of these tasks to automatically correct such errors without additional model training. We leverage pre-trained large language models (LLMs) in two pipeline setups: Pars-Gen-Pars and Gen-Pars-Gen, where the output of one model serves as the input to the next. In the Pars-Gen-Pars pipeline, input text is parsed into a DRS, then used to generate text, which is finally parsed again. Conversely, the Gen-Pars-Gen pipeline starts with a DRS, generates text, parses it, and regenerates text from the parsed DRS. Interestingly, by propagating the data through these reversible pipelines, errors from the initial parse or generation step can be mitigated, instead of being amplified. Experiments on the Parallel Meaning Bank dataset demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, with improved performance over baseline models on semantic parsing (SMATCH) and text generation (BLEU, METEOR, COMET, chrF, BERT-Score) metrics. Our error analysis also sheds light on the types of mistakes addressed by each pipeline setup. The proposed method offers a simple yet effective way to enhance DRS-based natural language processing without costly model retraining",

SoFa expands the analysis beyond the binary comparison of stereotypical versus anti-stereotypical identities to include a diverse range of identities and stereotypes. Comparing our methodology with existing benchmarks, we reveal that biases within language models are more nuanced than acknowledged, indicating a broader scope of encoded biases than previously recognized. Benchmarking LMs on SoFa, we expose how identities expressing different religions lead to the most pronounced disparate treatments across all models.

Understanding these arguments requires selective vision: only specific visual stimuli within an image are relevant to the argument, and relevance can only be understood within the context of a broader argumentative structure. While visual arguments are readily appreciated by human audiences, we ask: are today's AI capable of similar understanding? We collect and release VisArgs, an annotated corpus designed to make explicit the (usually implicit) structures underlying visual arguments. VisArgs includes 1,611 images accompanied by three types of textual annotations: 5,112 visual premises (with region annotations), 5,574 commonsense premises, and reasoning trees connecting them to a broader argument. We propose three tasks over VisArgs to probe machine capacity for visual argument understanding: localization of premises, identification of premises, and deduction of conclusions. Experiments demonstrate that 1) machines cannot fully identify the relevant visual cues. The top-performing model, GPT-4-O, achieved an accuracy of only 78.5%, whereas humans reached 98.0%. All models showed a performance drop, with an average decrease in accuracy of 19.5%, when the comparison set was changed from objects outside the image to irrelevant objects within the image.

Given that MLMs are continuously trained with increasing amounts of additional data collected over time, an important yet unanswered question is how the social biases encoded with MLMs vary over time. In particular, the number of social media users continues to grow at an exponential rate, and it is a valid concern for the MLMs trained specifically on social media data whether their social biases (if any) would also amplify over time. To empirically analyse this problem, we use a series of MLMs pretrained on chronologically ordered temporal snapshots of corpora. Our analysis reveals that, although social biases are present in all MLMs, most types of social bias remain relatively stable over time (with a few exceptions). To further understand the mechanisms that influence social biases in MLMs, we analyse the temporal corpora used to train the MLMs. Our findings show that some demographic groups, such as male, obtain higher preference over the other, such as female on the training corpora constantly",

The evaluation benchmark includes 3,452 high-quality exclusionary queries, each of which has been manually annotated. The training set contains 70,293 exclusionary queries, each paired with a positive document and a negative document. We conduct detailed experiments and analyses, obtaining three main observations: (i) existing retrieval models with different architectures struggle to comprehend exclusionary queries effectively; (ii) although integrating our training data can improve the performance of retrieval models on exclusionary retrieval, there still exists a gap compared to human performance; and (iii) generative retrieval models have a natural advantage in handling exclusionary queries",

    "title": "DocCHA: Towards LLM-Augmented Interactive Online diagnosis System",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great capabilities in addressing many application tasks. Among various applications, one eye-catching domain is Conversational Health Agents (CHAs), which are interactive conversational systems that can provide people with various health-related services. However, existing CHAs mainly focus on providing static health services, and lack interactive online diagnosis for patients. In the clinical setting, the initial symptoms that patients provide may lack comprehensiveness and detail, thus online interaction with patients to request additional information is important. To alleviate this problem, we propose DocCHA, an online interactive diagnosis system that interacts with patients by requesting additional information and continuesly improving the diagnosis confidence until providing patients with a reliable diagnosis. Moreover, DocCHA leverages Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with Google search API, StatPearls and Wikipedia to provide patients with detailed and reliable health suggestions. We evaluate DocCHA's performance on the IMCS21 dataset, a Chinese online diagnosis dataset consists of conversations between patients and doctors. Experimental results show that DocCHA's diagnosis accuracy reaches 89.2\\% with 4 rounds of additional information request interactions with patients. Besides, the generated suggestion after RAG outperforms the direct prompt in terms of relevance, coherence, accuracy and completeness",

    "abstract": "Ensuring the verifiability of model answers is a fundamental challenge for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in the question answering (QA) domain. Recently, self-citation prompting was proposed to make large language models (LLMs) generate citations to supporting documents along with their answers. However, self-citing LLMs often struggle to match the required format, refer to non-existent sources, and fail to faithfully reflect LLMs' context usage throughout the generation. In this work, we present MIRAGE --Model Internals-based RAG Explanations -- a plug-and-play approach using model internals for faithful answer attribution in RAG applications. MIRAGE detects context-sensitive answer tokens and pairs them with retrieved documents contributing to their prediction via saliency methods. We evaluate our proposed approach on a multilingual extractive QA dataset, finding high agreement with human answer attribution. On open-ended QA, MIRAGE achieves citation quality and efficiency comparable to self-citation while also allowing for a finer-grained control of attribution parameters. Our qualitative evaluation highlights the faithfulness of MIRAGE's attributions and underscores the promising application of model internals for RAG answer attribution.

With the recent interest in Large Language Models (LLMs), we study the ability of LLMs to produce persuasive text. As opposed to prior work which focuses on particular domains or types of persuasion, we conduct a general study across various domains to measure and benchmark to what degree LLMs produce persuasive text - both when explicitly instructed to rewrite text to be more or less persuasive and when only instructed to paraphrase. To this end, we construct a new dataset, Persuasive-Pairs, of pairs each consisting of a short text and of a text rewritten by an LLM to amplify or diminish persuasive language. We multi-annotate the pairs on a relative scale for persuasive language. This data is not only a valuable resource in itself, but we also show that it can be used to train a regression model to predict a score of persuasive language between text pairs. This model can score and benchmark new LLMs across domains, thereby facilitating the comparison of different LLMs. Finally, we discuss effects observed for different system prompts. Notably, we find that different `personas' in the system prompt of LLaMA3 change the persuasive language in the text substantially, even when only instructed to paraphrase. These findings underscore the importance of investigating persuasiveness in LLM generated text",

This work seeks to understand the strengths and limitations of editing methods, facilitating practical applications of communicative AI. We focus on three key research questions. RQ1: Can edited LLMs behave consistently resembling communicative AI in realistic situations? RQ2: To what extent does the rephrasing of prompts lead LLMs to deviate from the edited knowledge memory? RQ3: Which knowledge features are correlated with the performance and robustness of editing? Our empirical studies uncover a substantial disparity between existing editing methods and the practical application of LLMs. On rephrased prompts that are flexible but common in realistic applications, the performance of editing experiences a significant decline. Further analysis shows that more popular knowledge is memorized better, easier to recall, and more challenging to edit effectively",

We propose two novel approaches that facilitate the recovery of future context information, thereby mitigating AR exposure bias.

Second, the Bidirectional Contextual Transformer (BC-Transformer) captures global contextual information through its innovative graph architecture. Experiments demonstrate that our BC-Transformer achieves translation quality comparable to that of the Autoregressive Transformer (ART) while maintaining the superior generation speed of the DA-Transformer.

These abilities can enhance the quality of text produced by automatic speech recognition (ASR), enabling the selection of words that are more semantically accurate.

In this work, we propose a novel ASR model that integrates the text generation capabilities of LLMs, while ensuring proper alignment with speech inputs. Specifically, our model is built on the attention-based encoder-decoder (AED) structure, with the LLM serving as a front-end feature extractor for the decoder. The decoder is trained to predict words from the LLM-derived features, where cross-attention accounts for aligning these features with the speech encodings from the encoder. We also design an effective prompting strategy that uses a hypothesized text sequence to extract linguistic information beneficial for performing ASR.

    "abstract": "Transformer and pre-trained language models have advanced various tasks in artificial intelligence. Typically, transformer decoders for language generation are trained using LM loss. The LM loss function predicts the next token from the outputs of previous tokens. LM loss is trained such that transformer decoders can generate autoregressively. In addition, transformers use self-attention to derive outputs, which generally assigns a high attention weight to self-tokens. Therefore, the transformer decoder may over-focus on the token $t-1$ when predicting token $t$ because it predicts token $t$ through self-attention up to token $t-1$. The proposed method prevents the transformer decoder from overfocusing on token $t-1$ when predicting token $t$. Instead of predicting token $t$ using the output of token $t-1$, we use a new input to predict token $t$. We also add a CPT module to the transformer decoder, which prevents token $t-1$ from being used in the attention query by cross-attention using the new input. Moreover, we measured the performance of machine translation and document summarization to verify that the proposed methodology can mitigate overfocusing problem and improve the performance. In our experiments, the proposed methodology improved performance. Also, it can distribute the focused attention to a few specific tokens, including the self-token.

To address this challenge, we introduce a novel human summarization preference alignment framework AlignSum. This framework consists of three parts: Firstly, we construct a Data Pymarid with extractive, abstractive, and human-annotated summary data. Secondly, we conduct the Gaussian Resampling to remove summaries with extreme lengths. Finally, we implement the two-stage hierarchical fine-tuning with Data Pymarid after Gaussian Resampling. We apply AlignSum to PLMs on the human-annotated CNN/DailyMail and BBC XSum datasets.

Concretely, we experiment with RetNet, Mamba, and hybrid versions of Mamba which incorporate attention mechanisms. Our findings demonstrate that Mamba is highly competitive with transformers on sentence and paragraph-level datasets, where in the latter both models benefit from shifting the training distribution towards longer sequences. Further analysis show that integrating attention into Mamba improves translation quality, robustness to sequence length extrapolation, and the ability to recall named entities",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Fine-tuning is a prominent technique to adapt a pre-trained language model to downstream scenarios. In parameter-efficient fine-tuning, only a small subset of modules are trained over the downstream datasets, while leaving the rest of the pre-trained model frozen to save computation resources. In recent years, a popular productization form arises as Model-as-a-Service (MaaS), in which vendors provide abundant pre-trained language models, server resources and core functions, and customers can fine-tune, deploy and invoke their customized model by accessing the one-stop MaaS with their own private dataset. In this paper, we identify the model and data privacy leakage risks in MaaS fine-tuning, and propose a Split-and-Privatize (SAP) framework, which manage to mitigate the privacy issues by adapting the existing split learning architecture. Furthermore, we propose a contributing-token-identification (CTI) method to alleviate the utility degradation caused by privatization. The proposed framework is sufficiently investigated by experiments, and the results indicate that it can enhance the empirical privacy by $68\\%$ at the cost of $1\\%$ model performance degradation on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank dataset",

    "abstract": "Efficiently deriving structured workflows from unannotated dialogs remains an underexplored and formidable challenge in computational linguistics. Automating this process could significantly accelerate the manual design of workflows in new domains and enable the grounding of large language models in domain-specific flowcharts, enhancing transparency and controllability. In this paper, we introduce Dialog2Flow (D2F) embeddings, which differ from conventional sentence embeddings by mapping utterances to a latent space where they are grouped according to their communicative and informative functions (i.e., the actions they represent). D2F allows for modeling dialogs as continuous trajectories in a latent space with distinct action-related regions. By clustering D2F embeddings, the latent space is quantized, and dialogs can be converted into sequences of region/action IDs, facilitating the extraction of the underlying workflow. To pre-train D2F, we build a comprehensive dataset by unifying twenty task-oriented dialog datasets with normalized per-turn action annotations. We also introduce a novel soft contrastive loss that leverages the semantic information of these actions to guide the representation learning process, showing superior performance compared to standard supervised contrastive loss. Evaluation against various sentence embeddings, including dialog-specific ones, demonstrates that D2F yields superior qualitative and quantitative results across diverse domains",

Although summaries generated by these large language models are smooth and capture key information sufficiently, the quality of their output depends on the prompt and the generated text is somewhat procedural to a certain extent. In order to understand whether large language models truly understand human needs, we construct LecSumm, in which we recruit 200 college students to write summaries for lecture notes on ten different machine learning topics, and analyzed real world human summary needs in the dimensions of summary length structure, modality and content depth. We further evaluate fine-tuned and prompt-based language models on LecSumm and show that the commercial GPT models showed better performance in summary coherence, fluency and relevance, but still fall shot in faithfulness and can better capture human needs even with advanced prompt design while fine-tuned models do not effectively learn human needs from the data.

    "abstract": "Personalized product search aims to learn personalized preferences from search logs and adjust the ranking lists returned by engines. Previous studies have extensively explored excavating valuable features to build accurate interest profiles. However, they overlook that the user's attention varies on product attributes(e.g., brand, category). Users may especially prefer specific attributes or switch their preferences between attributes dynamically. Instead, existing approaches mix up all attribute features and let the model automatically extract useful ones from rather complex scenarios. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a dynamic multi-attribute interest learning model to tackle the influences from attributes to user interests. Specifically, we design two interest profiling modules: attribute-centered and attribute-aware profiling. The former focuses on capturing the user's preferences on a single attribute, while the latter focuses on addressing the interests correlated with multi-attribute within the search history. Besides, we devise a dynamic contribution weights strategy that sends explicit signals to the model to determine the impacts of different attributes better. Experimental results on large-scale datasets illustrate that our model significantly improves the results of existing methods",

We annotated these stimuli at multiple semantic levels, which enabled us to extract latent representations of LLMs for this content. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs predict human brain activity more accurately than traditional language models, particularly for complex background stories. Furthermore, we identify distinct brain regions associated with different semantic representations, including multi-modal vision-semantic representations, which highlights the importance of modeling multi-level and multi-modal semantic representations simultaneously.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and AI-generated feedback (RLAIF) have become prominent techniques that significantly enhance the functionality of pre-trained language models (LMs). These methods harness feedback, sourced either from humans or AI, as direct rewards or to shape reward models that steer LM optimization. Nonetheless, the effective integration of rewards from diverse sources presents a significant challenge due to their disparate characteristics. To address this, recent research has developed algorithms incorporating strategies such as weighting, ranking, and constraining to handle this complexity. Despite these innovations, a bias toward disproportionately high rewards can still skew the reinforcement learning process and negatively impact LM performance. This paper explores a methodology for reward composition that enables simultaneous improvements in LMs across multiple dimensions. Inspired by fairness theory, we introduce a training algorithm that aims to reduce disparity and enhance stability among various rewards. Our method treats the aggregate reward as a dynamic weighted sum of individual rewards, with alternating updates to the weights and model parameters. For efficient and straightforward implementation, we employ an estimation technique rooted in the mirror descent method for weight updates, eliminating the need for gradient computations. The empirical results under various types of rewards across a wide range of scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our method",

To address these challenges, it is crucial to develop large-scale benchmarks that can comprehensively assess the performance of LLMs in basic language tasks. In this paper, we introduce a bilingual benchmark, CWUM, to investigate the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in understanding and manipulating natural language at both character and word levels. CWUM consists of 15 simple text editing tasks, e.g., letter counting, word reversing, Chinese character inserting, etc. We conduct extensive experiments on eight advanced LLMs, including base models and instruction-tuned (chat) variants. The experimental results highlight significant failures of existing LLMs on CWUM tasks that humans can solve perfectly with 100% accuracy. On English tasks of CWUM, the average accuracy of GPT-4, LLaMA-3-70B, and Qwen-72B is 66.64%, 39.32%, and 33.16%, respectively, which lags far behind human performance. Instruction-tuning the base model does not lead to a distinct performance improvement, as the average accuracy of LLaMA-3-70B-Instruct on English tasks is only 1.44% higher than that of the base LLaMA-3-70B. Ultimately, we show that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) can enhance model performance on CWUM without compromising its ability to generalize across general tasks",

Since adversaries may not know or have access to the judge-LLMs, we propose a simple surrogate attack where a surrogate model is first attacked, and the learned attack phrase then transferred to unknown judge-LLMs. We propose a practical algorithm to determine the short universal attack phrases and demonstrate that when transferred to unseen models, scores can be drastically inflated such that irrespective of the assessed text, maximum scores are predicted. It is found that judge-LLMs are signficantly more susceptible to these adversarial attacks when used for absolute scoring, as oppopsed to comparative assessment.

Based on this ontology, we created a new set of labels on top of the commonly-used MRPC dataset, creating a new classification benchmark task called SPT Classification, including explanations for a subset of the dataset. We hope that our contributions will improve the usefulness of automatic paraphrase classification and generation methods for various real-world NLP applications. We will release the dataset and associated models and code for the baselines when the paper is accepted",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "With the proliferation of large language models (LLMs), knowledge distillation (KD) has emerged as a promising methodology to address the challenges of large model sizes and high computational costs in real-world applications. However, existing KD methods often ignore the difficulty variations within the datasets used for distillation, leading to inefficient resource allocation and suboptimal training outcomes. In this paper, we propose Difficulty-Aware and Adaptive Distillation (D2A2), an efficient and performance-enhancing distillation framework. The key idea is to incorporate the inherent difficulty of problems, as indicated by the uncertainty of LLMs shown when making decisions about the ultimate predictions, into the distillation process. Specifically, we integrate this into data filtering and model training phases to enhance the effectiveness of distillation. In difficulty-aware data filtering phase, we use semantic entropy to measure response uncertainty and prioritize difficult samples for further distillation. In difficulty-adaptive training phase, we dynamically adjust the focus on challenging samples by updating the distillation loss based on the student model's performance. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate our framework outperforms existing methods with fewer data and exhibits versatile performance across various models and datasets",

To this end, we aim to swiftly acquire essential language skills for character development, greatly enhancing role-playing comfort. In this work, we present RoleCraft, an innovative framework designed to enrich personalized role-playing experiences. Central to this framework is RoleInstruct, a distinctive dataset featuring emotional annotations, transitioning from traditional celebrity-focused roles to more authentic, daily non-celebrity roles,each accompanied by carefully crafted character descriptions. We combined RoleInstruct with open-source instructions from the general domain, employing a hybrid instruction tuning strategy to create RoleCraft-GLM. Experiments in role-playing demonstrate that our model excels in generating dialogue that accurately reflects character traits and emotions, outperforming most mainstream LLMs, including GPT-4.

In this work, we present a thorough evaluation of very recent, small-sized LLMs (SLMs) on the task of Aspect-Based Summarization of Climate Change Reports. In doing so, we show that modern SLMs are sufficiently good for the task and can bring value in assisting with summarization for policymakers while being more efficient than their bigger counterparts without significant performance deterioration. We also show how energy consumption among SLMs themselves does not correlate with better performance, further proving the point that smaller models can be effectively used for the task. Finally, we release the new dataset that we collected to perform our experiments, from which we hope research in NLP for climate change and research in efficient Aspect-Based Summarization with LLMs can develop further",

    "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has recently demonstrated the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the knowledge-intensive tasks such as Question-Answering (QA). RAG expands the query context by incorporating external knowledge bases to enhance the response accuracy. However, it would be inefficient to access LLMs multiple times for each query and unreliable to retrieve all the relevant documents by a single query. We have found that even though there is low relevance between some critical documents and query, it is possible to retrieve the remaining documents by combining parts of the documents with the query. To mine the relevance, a two-stage retrieval framework called **D**ynamic-**R**elevant **R**etrieval-**A**ugmented **G**eneration (**DR-RAG**) is proposed to improve document retrieval recall and the accuracy of answers while maintaining efficiency. Additionally, a compact classifier is applied to two different selection strategies to determine the contribution of the retrieved documents to answering the query and retrieve the relatively relevant documents. Meanwhile, DR-RAG call the LLMs only once, which significantly improves the efficiency of the experiment. The experimental results on multi-hop QA datasets show that DR-RAG can significantly improve the accuracy of the answers and achieve new progress in QA systems",

In fact, it has been found that instruction tuning on these intermediary reasoning steps improves model performance.

We call this method Divergent CoT (DCoT). We find that instruction tuning on DCoT datasets boosts the performance of even smaller, and therefore more accessible, LLMs. Through a rigorous set of experiments spanning a wide range of tasks that require various reasoning types, we show that fine-tuning on DCoT consistently improves performance over the CoT baseline across model families and scales (1.3B to 70B). Through a combination of empirical and manual evaluation, we additionally show that these performance gains stem from models generating multiple divergent reasoning chains in a single inference step, indicative of the enabling of self-correction in language models.

We created a dataset with various types of evidence and analyzed its response and confidence using verbalized confidence, token probability, and sampling. From the perspective of verbalized confidence, our research has shown that we can interpret that language models can generally reflect evidence in their confidence and calibration.

Yet, the unique opportunities presented by the cryptocurrency market, noted for its on-chain data's transparency and the critical influence of off-chain signals like news, remain largely untapped by LLMs. This work aims to bridge the gap by developing an LLM-based trading agent, CryptoTrade, which uniquely combines the analysis of on-chain and off-chain data. This approach leverages the transparency and immutability of on-chain data, as well as the timeliness and influence of off-chain signals, providing a comprehensive overview of the cryptocurrency market. CryptoTrade incorporates a reflective mechanism specifically engineered to refine its daily trading decisions by analyzing the outcomes of prior trading decisions. This research makes two significant contributions. Firstly, it broadens the applicability of LLMs to the domain of cryptocurrency trading. Secondly, it establishes a benchmark for cryptocurrency trading strategies.

Noise, understood as ``aberrant sonic behaviour,'' is not only an auditory phenomenon but also a cultural construct tied to the processes of civilization and urbanization. By leveraging topic modeling techniques and fine-tuned BERT-based language models trained on Danish and Norwegian texts, we analyze a corpus of over 800 novels to extract and examine noise-related topics. We identify and track the prevalence of noise in these texts, offering insights into the literary perceptions of noise during the Scandinavian ``Modern Breakthrough'' period (1870-1899). Our contributions include the development of a comprehensive dataset annotated for noise-related segments and their categorization into human-made, non-human-made, and musical noises. This study illustrates the framework's potential for enhancing the understanding of the relationship between noise and its literary representations, providing a deeper appreciation of the auditory elements that enrich literary works",

They usually rely on a single criterion, which struggles with handling various types of instructions. 2. They depend on specialized and highly differentiated procedures, and thus combining them makes the RAG system more complicated and leads to higher response latency. To address these challenges, we propose Unified Active Retrieval (UAR). UAR contains four orthogonal criteria and casts them into plug-and-play classification tasks, which achieves multifaceted retrieval timing judgements with negligible extra inference cost. We further introduce the Unified Active Retrieval Criteria (UAR-Criteria), designed to process diverse active retrieval scenarios through a standardized procedure.

In the era of generative AI, coherence assessment is essential for many NLP tasks; summarization, long-form question-answering, etc. Current NLP approaches for modeling coherence often rely on a proxy task, specifically sentence reordering. However, such an approach may not capture the full range of factors contributing to coherence. To bridge this gap, in this work we employ the formal linguistic definition of \\citet{Reinhart:1980} of what makes a discourse coherent, consisting of three conditions --- {\\em cohesion, consistency} and {\\em relevance} -- and formalize these conditions as respective computational tasks. We hypothesize that (i) a model trained on all of these tasks will learn the features required for coherence detection, and that (ii) a joint model for all tasks will exceed the performance of models trained on each task individually. We evaluate this modeling approach on two human-rated coherence benchmarks: one of automatically-generated stories and one of real-world texts. Our experiments confirm that jointly training on the proposed tasks leads to better performance on each task compared with task-specific models, and to better performance on assessing coherence overall, compared with strong baselines.

We evaluated the performance differences based on various model architectures (e.g., image encoders, modality alignment, and LLMs) and image scopes (e.g., entire scene, person, and facial expression). In addition, we investigated the impact of providing persona information on the emotion prediction performance of the models and analyzed how personality traits and speaking styles influenced the emotion prediction process.

Driven by advances in pre-trained language models and contrastive learning techniques, leading sentence representation methods can already achieved average Spearman's correlation scores of approximately 86 across seven STS benchmarks in SentEval. However, further improvements have become increasingly marginal, with no existing method attaining an average score higher than 87 on these tasks. This paper conducts an in-depth analysis of this phenomenon and concludes that the upper limit for Spearman's correlation scores using contrastive learning is 87.5. To transcend this ceiling, we propose an innovative approach termed Pcc-tuning, which employs Pearson's correlation coefficient as a loss function to refine model performance beyond contrastive learning. Experimental results demonstrate that Pcc-tuning markedly surpasses previous state-of-the-art strategies, raising the Spearman's correlation score to above 90",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive adaptability in various fields, yet the optimal pathway of autonomous model evolution remains under-explored. Drawing inspiration from the self-driven learning process of humans, we introduce \\textit{SELF} (Self-Evolution with Language Feedback), a novel learning framework that empowers LLMs to continually self-improve their abilities. SELF initiates with a meta-skill learning process that equips the LLMs with capabilities for self-feedback and self-refinement. SELF employs language-based feedback for detailed and nuanced evaluations, pinpointing response flaws and suggesting refinements. Subsequently, the model engages in an iterative process of self-evolution: they autonomously generate responses to unlabeled instructions, refine these responses interactively, and use the refined and filtered data for iterative self-training, thereby progressively boosting their capabilities. Moreover, the SELF framework equips the model with the ability to self-refine during inference, leading to further improved response quality. Our experiments on mathematical and general tasks demonstrate that SELF enables the model to continually self-improve without human intervention. The SELF framework indicates a promising direction for the autonomous evolution of LLMs, transitioning them from passive information receivers to active participants in their development",

    "title": "Leveraging LLMs for Formal Grammar Generation in Programming Contest Testing",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Test cases are crucial for ensuring the program's correctness and evaluating performance in programming. The high diversity of test cases within constraints is necessary to distinguish between correct and incorrect answers. Automated source code generation is currently a popular area due to the inefficiency of manually generating test cases. Recent attempts involve generating conditional cases from problem descriptions using deep-learning models that learn from source code. However, this task requires a combination of complex skills such as extracting syntactic and logical constraints for a given test case from a problem, and generating test cases that satisfy the constraints. In this work, we introduce a modified context-free grammar that explicitly represents the syntactical and logical constraints embedded within programming problems. Our innovative framework for automated test case generation separates restriction extraction from test case generation, simplifying the task for the model. Our experimental results show that, compared to current methods, our framework produces test cases that are more precise and effective.

    "title": "Relevant or Random: Can LLMs Truly Perform Analogical Reasoning?",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Analogical reasoning is a unique ability of humans to address unfamiliar challenges by transferring strategies from relevant past experiences. One key finding in psychology is that compared with irrelevant past experiences, recalling relevant ones can help humans better handle new tasks. Coincidentally, the NLP community has also recently found that self-generating relevant examples in the context can help large language models (LLMs) better solve a given problem than hand-crafted prompts. However, it is yet not clear whether relevance is the key factor eliciting such capability, i.e., can LLMs benefit more from self-generated relevant examples than irrelevant ones? In this work, we systematically explore whether LLMs can truly perform analogical reasoning on a diverse set of reasoning tasks. With extensive experiments and analysis, we show that self-generated random examples can surprisingly achieve comparable or even better performance, e.g., 4% performance boost on GSM8K with random biological examples. We find that the accuracy of self-generated examples is the key factor and subsequently design two improved methods with significantly reduced inference costs. Overall, we aim to advance a deeper understanding of LLM analogical reasoning and hope this work stimulates further research in the design of self-generated contexts",

    "abstract": "Direct speech translation (ST) models often struggle with rare words. Incorrect translation of these words can have severe consequences, impacting translation quality and user trust. While rare word translation is inherently challenging for neural models due to sparse learning signals, real-world scenarios often allow access to translations of past recordings on similar topics. To leverage these valuable resources, we propose a retrieval-and-demonstration approach to enhance rare word translation accuracy in direct ST models. First, we adapt existing ST models to incorporate retrieved examples for rare word translation, which allows the model to benefit from prepended examples, similar to in-context learning. We then develop a cross-modal (speech-to-speech, speech-to-text, text-to-text) retriever to locate suitable examples. We demonstrate that standard ST models can be effectively adapted to leverage examples for rare word translation, improving rare word translation accuracy over the baseline by 17.6% with gold examples and 8.5% with retrieved examples. Moreover, our speech-to-speech retrieval approach outperforms other modalities and exhibits higher robustness to unseen speakers. Our code is in the submission",

Nevertheless, it is quite a challenge for existing methods to predefine an optimal factor due to the exponential search space. In view of this, we introduce PSC (Phase Shift Calibration), a small module for calibrating the frequencies predefined by existing methods.

    "title": "Quantifying Multilingual Performance of Large Language Models Across Languages",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "The development of Large Language Models (LLMs) relies on extensive text corpora, which are often unevenly distributed across languages. This imbalance results in LLMs performing significantly better on high-resource languages like English, German, and French, while their capabilities in low-resource languages remain inadequate. Currently, there is a lack of quantitative methods to evaluate the performance of LLMs in these low-resource languages. To address this gap, we propose the Language Ranker, an intrinsic metric designed to benchmark and rank languages based on LLM performance using internal representations. By comparing the LLM's internal representation of various languages against a baseline derived from English, we can assess the model's multilingual capabilities in a robust and language-agnostic manner. Our analysis reveals that high-resource languages exhibit higher similarity scores with English, demonstrating superior performance, while low-resource languages show lower similarity scores, underscoring the effectiveness of our metric in assessing language-specific capabilities. Besides, the experiments show that there is a strong correlation between the LLM's performance in different languages and the proportion of those languages in its pre-training corpus. These insights underscore the efficacy of the Language Ranker as a tool for evaluating LLM performance across different languages, particularly those with limited resources",

    "abstract": "Fully End-to-End Task-Oriented Dialogue Systems (Fully ETOD) retrieve knowledge from a knowledge base in a differentiable manner and generate responses using a language model generator without the need for modular training. However, Fully ETOD faces some challenges. During the retrieval process, the retriever retrieves the knowledge base in a black-box manner, making it difficult for the generator to differentiate the large amount of knowledge obtained by the retriever. This leads to a degradation in the quality of the responses and the trustworthiness of the system. Moreover, as the size of the knowledge base grows, it may exacerbate the risk of this problem. To address this challenge, we first design a dataset for Fully ETOD based on large-scale knowledge bases called FakeRest to solve the scarcity of annotated dialogue data based on large-scale knowledge bases. We also propose a User-need-driven Chain of Thought Framework (Uni-ETOD) for Fully ETOD, which aims to guide LLMs to gradually understand users' thought processes and improve the quality of responses in Fully ETOD. We use ChatGPT, Gemini, Llama3, Mistral, and ChatGLM as the backbone models of the system. On FakeRest, we comprehensively evaluate the capability of each step of Uni-ETOD.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have recently dramatically pushed the state of the art in image captioning and many image understanding tasks (e.g., visual question answering). LVLMs, however, often \\textit{hallucinate} and produce captions that mention concepts that cannot be found in the image. These hallucinations erode the trustworthiness of LVLMs and are arguably among the main obstacles to their ubiquitous adoption. Recent work suggests that addition of grounding objectives---those that explicitly align image regions or objects to text spans---reduces the amount of LVLM hallucination. Although intuitive, this claim is not empirically justified as the reduction effects have been established, we argue, with flawed evaluation protocols that (i) rely on data (i.e., MSCOCO) that has been extensively used in LVLM training and (ii) measure hallucination via question answering rather than open-ended caption generation. In this work, in contrast, we offer the first systematic analysis of the effect of fine-grained object grounding on LVLM hallucination under an evaluation protocol that more realistically captures LVLM hallucination in open generation. Our extensive experiments over three backbone LLMs reveal that grounding objectives have little to no effect on object hallucination in open caption generation",

However, the transfer performance is often hindered when a low-resource target language is written in a different script than the high-resource source language, even though the two languages may be related or share parts of their vocabularies. Inspired by recent work that uses transliteration to address this problem, our paper proposes a transliteration-based post-pretraining alignment (PPA) method aiming to improve the cross-lingual alignment between languages using diverse scripts. We select two areal language groups, $\\textbf{Mediterranean-Amharic-Farsi}$ and $\\textbf{South+East Asian Languages}$, wherein the languages are mutually influenced but use different scripts. We apply our method to these language groups and conduct extensive experiments on a spectrum of downstream tasks. The results show that after PPA, models consistently outperform the original model (up to 50\\% for some tasks) in English-centric transfer. In addition, when we use languages other than English as sources in transfer, our method obtains even larger improvements. We will make our code and models publicly available",

    "abstract": "Previous research on radiology report generation has made significant progress in terms of increasing the clinical accuracy of generated reports. In this paper, we emphasize another crucial quality that it should possess, i.e., inter-report consistency, which refers to the capability of generating consistent reports for semantically equivalent radiographs. This quality is even of greater significance than the overall report accuracy in terms of ensuring the system's credibility, as a system prone to providing conflicting results would severely erode users' trust. Regrettably, existing approaches struggle to maintain inter-report consistency, exhibiting biases towards common patterns and susceptibility to lesion variants. To address this issue, we propose ICon, which improves the inter-report consistency of radiology report generation. Aiming at enhancing the system's ability to capture the similarities in semantically equivalent lesions, our approach involves first extracting lesions from input images and examining their characteristics. Then, we introduce a lesion-aware mixup technique to ensure that the representations of the semantically equivalent lesions align with the same attributes, by linearly interpolating them during the training phase. Extensive experiments on three publicly available chest X-ray datasets verify the effectiveness of our approach, both in terms of improving the consistency and accuracy of the generated reports",

This severely impairs the model's generative accuracy, making it challenging for LVLMs to be implemented in real-world medical scenarios to assist doctors in diagnosis. Enhancing the training data for downstream medical generative tasks is an effective way to address model hallucination. Moreover, the limited availability of training data in the medical field and privacy concerns greatly hinder the model's accuracy and generalization capabilities. In this paper, we introduce a method that mimics human cognitive processes to construct fine-grained instruction pairs and apply the concept of chain-of-thought (CoT) from inference scenarios to training scenarios, thereby proposing a method called MedThink.

We imagine a process where sources are selected to fall into different categories. Learning the article's plan means predicting the categorization scheme chosen by the journalist. Inspired by latent-variable modeling, we first develop metrics to select the most likely plan underlying a story. Then, working with professional journalists, we adapt five existing approaches to planning and introduce three new ones. We find that two approaches, or schemas: stance and social affiliation best explain source plans in most documents. However, other schemas like textual entailment explain source plans in factually rich topics like ``Science''. Finally, we find we can predict the most suitable schema given just the article's headline with reasonable accuracy.

    "abstract": "While being proven to be effective across nearly all natural language processing tasks, transformer-based models have several obvious limitations. Amongst them, arguably the most significant one is the quadratic complexity -- both in time and space -- of the vanilla self-attention mechanism. As a result, most existing pre-trained language models, such as BERT, have a fixed maximum context window. This potentially creates a mismatch between the context window size and the data applied to fine-tuning it. This gives rise to the study of long document classification -- the task to optimize performance when the length of the input document exceeds the model's maximum token. Inspired by retrieval-augmented generation techniques used by large language models in recent years, we propose a method that uses similar techniques to retrieve the most relevant sections of a long document, which is then fed into a traditional transformer-based model.

To further enhance model sparsity, we introduce a counterfactual data impact factor, which adjusts the specific influence of counterfactual data on the model training outcomes. The CAST method achieved the best accuracy rates of 90.2\\% and 76\\% in counterfactual data augmentation tasks for sentiment analysis and natural language inference tasks.

First, does multilingual transfer ability exist in English-centric models and how does it compare with multilingual pretrained models? Second, does it only appears when English is the source language for the English-centric model? Third, how does it vary in different tasks? We take multilingual reasoning ability as our focus and conduct extensive experiments across four types of reasoning tasks. We find that the multilingual pretrained model does not always outperform an English-centric model. Furthermore, English appears to be a less suitable source language, and the choice of source language becomes less important when the English-centric model scales up. In addition, different types of tasks exhibit different multilingual transfer abilities. These findings demonstrate that English-centric models not only possess multilingual transfer ability but may even surpass the transferability of multilingual pretrained models if well-trained.

    "title": "BlockPruner: Fine-grained Pruning for Large Language Models",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "With the rapid growth in the size and complexity of large language models (LLMs), the costs associated with their training and inference have escalated significantly. Research indicates that certain layers in LLMs harbor substantial redundancy, and pruning these layers has minimal impact on the overall performance. While various layer pruning methods have been developed based on this insight, they generally overlook the finer-grained redundancies within the layers themselves. In this paper, we delve deeper into the architecture of LLMs and demonstrate that finer-grained pruning can be achieved by targeting redundancies in multi-head attention (MHA) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) blocks. We propose a novel, training-free structured pruning approach called BlockPruner. Unlike existing layer pruning methods, BlockPruner segments each Transformer layer into MHA and MLP blocks. It then assesses the importance of these blocks using perplexity measures and applies a heuristic search for iterative pruning. We applied BlockPruner to LLMs of various sizes and architectures and validated its performance across a wide range of downstream tasks. Experimental results show that BlockPruner achieves more granular and effective pruning compared to state-of-the-art baselines",

This inclusion can lead to cheatingly high scores on model leaderboards, yet result in disappointing performance in real-world applications. To address this benchmark contamination problem, we first propose a set of requirements that practical contamination detection methods should follow. Following these proposed requirements, we introduce PaCoST, a Paired Confidence Significance Testing to effectively detect benchmark contamination in LLMs. Our method constructs a counterpart for each piece of data with the same distribution, and performs statistical analysis of the corresponding confidence to test whether the model is significantly more confident under the original benchmark. We validate the effectiveness of PaCoST and apply it on popular open-source models and benchmarks. We find that almost all models and benchmarks we tested are suspected contaminated more or less.

However, they may be long, complex, and non-compliant with laws and regulations. Therefore, automated compliance checking of privacy policy texts is needed. In this paper, we introduce the first dataset and task for automated compliance checking of Chinese privacy policy texts. Our dataset provides human experts' compliance annotation at both the document level and the fine-grained level. The fine-grained annotation includes both the existing named entity recognition (NER) task and 11 new sentence classification (SC) tasks for compliance checking. We treat the NER and classification subtasks as discriminative legal attributes that can help models to generate reliable compliance results and easy-to-understand explanations. Additionally, we further pretrain BERT-Chinese on a large corpus of compliance-related texts and evaluate it on all the tasks. Our results show that our further pre-trained BERT model outperforms the baseline models and demonstrates the potential of NLP techniques for automated compliance checking of privacy policies.

    "abstract": "Spurred by advancements in scale, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong few-shot learning ability via in-context learning (ICL). However, the performance of ICL has been shown to be highly sensitive to the selection of few-shot demonstrations. Selecting the most suitable examples as context remains an ongoing challenge and an open problem. Existing literature has highlighted the importance of selecting examples that are diverse or semantically similar to the test sample while ignoring the fact that the optimal selection dimension, i.e., diversity or similarity, is task-specific. Based on how the test sample is answered, we propose Iterative Demonstration Selection (IDS) to leverage the merits of both dimensions. Using zero-shot chain-of-thought reasoning (Zero-shot-CoT), IDS iteratively selects examples that are diverse but still strongly correlated with the test sample as ICL demonstrations. Specifically, IDS applies Zero-shot-CoT to the test sample before demonstration selection. The output reasoning path is then used to choose demonstrations that are prepended to the test sample for inference. The generated answer is followed by its corresponding reasoning path for extracting a new set of demonstrations in the next iteration. After several iterations, IDS adopts majority voting to obtain the final result. Through extensive experiments on tasks including reasoning, question answering, and topic classification, we demonstrate that IDS can consistently outperform existing ICL demonstration selection methods",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Efficient knowledge editing of large language models is crucial for replacing obsolete information or incorporating specialized knowledge on a large scale. However, previous methods implicitly assume that knowledge is localized and isolated within the model, an assumption that oversimplifies the interconnected nature of model knowledge. The premise of localization results in an incomplete knowledge editing, whereas an isolated assumption may impair both other knowledge and general abilities. These two assumptions result in instability in the performance of knowledge editing methods. To transcend these assumptions, we introduce StableKE, a method that adopts a novel perspective based on knowledge augmentation rather than knowledge localization. Inspired by the diversity and extensiveness of training data in the pretraining phase, StableKE integrates two automated knowledge augmentation strategies in the instruction fine-tuning phase: Semantic Paraphrase Enhancement (SPE), which diversifies knowledge descriptions to facilitate the teaching of new information to the model, and Contextual Description Enrichment (CDE), which expands the surrounding knowledge to prevent the forgetting of related information. StableKE surpasses other knowledge editing methods, demonstrating stability both edited knowledge and multi-hop knowledge, while also preserving unrelated knowledge and general abilities.

    "abstract": "Alignment with human preferences is an important step in developing accurate and safe large language models. This is no exception in machine translation (MT), where better handling of language nuances and context-specific variations leads to improved quality. However, preference data based on human feedback can be very expensive to obtain and curate at a large scale. Automatic metrics, on the other hand, can induce preferences, but they might not match human expectations perfectly. In this paper, we propose an approach that leverages the best of both worlds. We first collect sentence-level quality assessments from professional linguists on translations generated by multiple high-quality MT systems and evaluate the ability of current automatic metrics to recover these preferences. We then use this analysis to curate a new dataset, MT-Pref (metric-induced translation preference) dataset, which comprises 18k instances covering 18 language directions, using texts sourced from multiple domains post-2022. We show that aligning TOWER models on MT-Pref significantly improves translation quality on WMT23 and FLORES benchmarks",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are typically fine-tuned on diverse and extensive datasets sourced from various origins to develop a comprehensive range of skills, such as writing, reasoning, chatting, coding, and more. Each skill has unique characteristics, and these datasets are often heterogeneous and imbalanced, making the fine-tuning process highly challenging. Balancing the development of each skill while ensuring the model maintains its overall performance requires sophisticated techniques and careful dataset curation. In this work, we propose a general, model-agnostic, reinforcement learning framework, Mixture-of-Skills (MoS), that learns to optimize data usage automatically during the fine-tuning process. This framework ensures the optimal comprehensive skill development of LLMs by dynamically adjusting the focus on different datasets based on their current learning state. To validate the effectiveness of MoS, we conduct extensive experiments using three diverse LLM backbones on two widely used benchmarks and demonstrate that MoS substantially enhances model performance. Building on the success of MoS, we propose MoSpec, an adaptation for task-specific fine-tuning, which harnesses the utilities of various datasets for a specific purpose. Our work underlines the significance of dataset rebalancing and present MoS as a powerful, general solution for optimizing data usage in the fine-tuning of LLMs for various purposes",

To overcome this, we introduce P2G, a novel framework for plug-and-play grounding in MLLMs. P2G utilizes the tool-usage potential of MLLMs to employ expert agents for on-the-fly grounding of critical visual and textual elements in images, thereby enabling deliberate reasoning through multimodal prompting. Additionally, we develop P2GB, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' proficiency in understanding inter-object relationships and textual content in challenging high-resolution images. Extensive experiments on visual reasoning tasks demonstrate the superiority of P2G, achieving performance comparable to GPT-4V on P2GB with a 7B backbone.

    "abstract": "Zero-shot singing voice synthesis (SVS) with style transfer and style control aims to generate high-quality singing voices with unseen timbres and styles (including singing method, emotion, rhythm, technique, and pronunciation) from audio and text prompts. However, the multifaceted nature of singing styles poses a significant challenge for effective modeling, transfer, and control. Furthermore, current SVS models often fail to generate singing voices rich in stylistic nuances for unseen singers. To address these challenges, we introduce TCSinger, the first zero-shot SVS model for style transfer across cross-lingual speech and singing styles, along with multi-level style control. Specifically, TCSinger proposes three primary modules: 1) the clustering style encoder employs a clustering vector quantization model to stably condense style information into a compact latent space; 2) the Style and Duration Language Model (S&D-LM) concurrently predicts style information and phoneme duration, which benefits both; 3) the style adaptive decoder uses a novel mel-style adaptive normalization method to generate singing voices with enhanced details.

Our Word Confusion model reframes semantic similarity in terms of feature-based classification confusion. We train a classifier to map from contextual embeddings to words and use the classifier confusion (the probability of choosing confound word c instead of correct target t) as a measure of the similarity of c and t. We show that Word Confusion outperforms cosine similarity in matching human similarity judgments across several datasets (MEN, WirdSim353, and SimLex), can measure similarity using predetermined features of interest, and enables qualitative analysis on real-world data.

However, current KE approaches, which only operate on (subject, relation, object) triple. We both theoretically and empirically observe that this simplified setting often leads to uncertainty when determining the deduction anchors, causing low confidence in their answers. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel task of event-based knowledge editing that pairs facts with event descriptions. This task manifests not only a closer simulation of real-world editing scenarios but also a more logically sound setting, implicitly defining the deduction anchor and enabling LLMs to propagate knowledge confidently. We curate a new benchmark dataset Evedit derived from the CounterFact dataset and validate its superiority in improving model confidence. Moreover, while we observe that the event-based setting is significantly challenging for existing approaches, we propose a novel approach Self-Edit that showcases stronger performance, achieving 55.6% consistency improvement while maintaining the naturalness of generation",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) improve their capabilities in handling complex tasks, the issues of computational cost and efficiency due to long prompts are becoming increasingly prominent. To accelerate model inference and reduce costs, we propose an innovative prompt compression framework called LanguaShrink. Inspired by the observation that LLM performance depends on the density and position of key information in the input prompts, LanguaShrink leverages psycholinguistic principles and the Ebbinghaus memory curve to achieve task-agnostic prompt compression. This effectively reduces prompt length while preserving essential information. We referred to the training method of OpenChat.The framework introduces part-of-speech priority compression and data distillation techniques, using smaller models to learn compression targets and employing a KL-regularized reinforcement learning strategy for training.\\cite{wang2023openchat} Additionally, we adopt a chunk-based compression algorithm to achieve adjustable compression rates. We evaluate our method on multiple datasets, including LongBench, ZeroScrolls, Arxiv Articles, and a newly constructed novel test set. Experimental results show that LanguaShrink maintains semantic similarity while achieving up to 26 times compression. Compared to existing prompt compression methods, LanguaShrink improves end-to-end latency by 1.43 times",

    "abstract": "Persuasion plays a pivotal role in a wide range of applications, from health intervention, to the promotion of social good. Persuasive chatbots can accelerate the positive effects of persuasion in such applications. Existing methods rely on fine-tuning persuasive chatbots with task-specific training data which is costly, if not infeasible, to collect. To address this issue, we propose a method to leverage the generalizability and inherent persuasive abilities of large language models (LLMs) in creating effective and truthful persuasive chatbot for any given domain in a zero-shot manner. Unlike previous studies which used pre-defined persuasion strategies, our method first uses an LLM to generate responses, then extracts the strategies used on the fly, and replaces any unsubstantiated claims in the response with retrieved facts supporting the strategies. We applied our chatbot, PersuaBot, to three significantly different domains needing persuasion skills: donation solicitation, recommendations, and health intervention. Our experiments on simulated and human conversations show that our zero-shot approach is more persuasive than prior work, while achieving factual accuracy surpassing state-of-the-art knowledge-oriented chatbots. Our study demonstrated that when persuasive chatbots are employed responsibly for social good, it is an enabler of positive individual and social change",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Recent studies indicate that shortcut learning behavior exists in language models, and thus a number of mitigation methods are proposed, such as advanced PLMs and debiasing methods. However, few studies have explored how different factors affect the robustness of language models. To bridge this gap, we study the different PLMs and analyze the effect of representations and classifiers on robustness using probing techniques on the NLU tasks. First, we find that the low robustness of language models is not due to the inseparability of representations on the challenging dataset. Second, we find that a potential reason for the difficulty in improving the robustness of language models is the significantly high similarity between the representations with opposite semantics from in-distribution and out-of-distribution. Third, we find that debiasing methods are likely to distort representations and merely improve performance by better classifiers in some cases. Finally, we propose a probing tool to measure the impact on the robustness of language models from representations and classifiers using the decoupled training strategy with debiasing methods. In addition, we conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets, suggesting the effectiveness of the proposed methods",

However, it is unclear if this success is limited to explicitly-mentioned causal facts in the pretraining data which the model can memorize. Thus, this work investigates: Can LLMs infer causal relations from other relational data in text? To disentangle the role of memorized causal facts vs inferred causal relations, we finetune LLMs on synthetic data containing temporal, spatial and counterfactual relations, and measure whether the LLM can then infer causal relations. We find that: (a) LLMs are susceptible to inferring causal relations from the order of two entity mentions in text (e.g. X mentioned before Y implies X causes Y); (b) if the order is randomized, LLMs still suffer from the post hoc fallacy, i.e. X occurs before Y (temporal relation) implies X causes Y. We also find that while LLMs can correctly deduce the absence of causal relations from temporal and spatial relations, they have difficulty inferring causal relations from counterfactuals, questioning their understanding of causality",

Previous studies mainly apply a demonstration retriever to retrieve demonstrations and use top-$k$ demonstrations for in-context learning (ICL).

In this paper, we formulate the demonstration selection as a \\textit{retrieve-then-rerank} process and introduce the DemoRank framework.

In this paper, we investigate the use of self-training in language agents, which can generate supervision from the agent itself, offering a promising alternative without relying on human or stronger model demonstrations. Self-training, however, requires high-quality model-generated samples, which are hard to obtain for challenging language agent tasks. To address this, we present Reflection-Reinforced Self-Training (Re-ReST), which uses a \\textit{reflector} to refine low-quality generated samples during self-training. The reflector takes the agent's output and feedback from an external environment (e.g., unit test results in code generation) to produce improved samples. This technique enhances the quality of inferior samples and efficiently enriches the self-training dataset with higher-quality samples. We conduct extensive experiments on open-source language agents across tasks, including multi-hop question answering, sequential decision-making, code generation, visual question answering, and text-to-image generation.

    "abstract": "For extremely weak-supervised text classification, pioneer research generates pseudo labels by mining texts similar to the class names from the raw corpus, which may end up with very limited or even no samples for the minority classes. Recent works have started to generate the relevant texts by prompting LLMs using the class names or definitions; however, there is a high risk that LLMs cannot generate in-distribution (i.e., similar to the corpus where the text classifier will be applied) data, leading to ungeneralizable classifiers. In this paper, we combine the advantages of these two approaches and propose to bridge the gap via a novel framework, \\emph{text grafting}, which aims to obtain clean and near-distribution weak supervision for minority classes.

Then, the templates are filled by state-of-the-art LLMs to synthesize near-distribution texts falling into minority classes.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Despite advancements in English-dominant generative large language models, further development is needed for low-resource languages to enhance global accessibility. The primary methods for representing these languages are monolingual and multilingual pretraining. Monolingual pretraining is expensive due to hardware requirements, and multilingual models often have uneven performance across languages. This study explores an alternative solution by adapting large language models, primarily trained on English, to low-resource languages. We assess various strategies, including continual training, instruction fine-tuning, task-specific fine-tuning, and vocabulary extension. The results show that continual training improves language comprehension, as reflected in perplexity scores, and task-specific tuning generally enhances performance of downstream tasks. However, extending the vocabulary shows no substantial benefits. Additionally, while larger models improve task performance with few-shot tuning, multilingual models perform worse than their monolingual counterparts when adapted",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Many open-ended conversations (e.g., tutoring lessons or business meetings) revolve around pre-defined reference materials, like worksheets or meeting bullets. To provide a framework for studying such conversation structure, we introduce **Problem-Oriented Segmentation & Retrieval** (POSR), the task of _jointly_ breaking down conversations into segments and linking each segment to the relevant reference item. As a case study, we apply POSR to education where effectively structuring lessons around problems is critical yet difficult. We present **LessonLink**, the first dataset of real-world tutoring lessons, featuring 3,500 segments, spanning 24,300 minutes of instruction and linked to 116 SAT Math problems. We define and evaluate several joint and independent approaches for POSR, including segmentation (e.g., TextTiling), retrieval (e.g., ColBERT), and large language models (LLMs) methods. Our results highlight that modeling POSR as one joint task is essential: POSR methods outperform independent segmentation and retrieval pipelines by up to +$76$% on joint metrics and surpass traditional segmentation methods by up to +$78$% on segmentation metrics. We demonstrate POSR's practical impact on downstream education applications, deriving new insights on the language and time use in real-world lesson structures.** *Pronounced as ``poser'' (\\textipa{/\\textprimstress poz\\textschwa r/}), a perplexing problem. **You can find our code and LessonLink dataset as a zip file in our submission.

We realize a novel reservoir Transformer that bounds the learning in linear time by handling different input lengths in a cascaded way. For a long-term context, the reservoir with non-linear readout learns sample dependencies from the beginning to the end of a sequential dataset; To learn more accurately the medium-term context such as previous sentences, we apply a recurrent memory mechanism; and finally for the short-term dependencies in one sentence, we learn with the Transformer.

    "abstract": "Autoregressive Large Language Models (e.g., LLaMa, GPTs) are omnipresent achieving remarkable success in language understanding and generation. However, such impressive capability typically comes with a substantial model size, which presents significant challenges for autoregressive token-by-token generation. To mitigate computation overload incurred during generation, several early-exit and layer-dropping strategies have been proposed. Despite some promising success due to the redundancy across LLMs layers on metrics like Rough-L/BLUE, our careful knowledge-intensive evaluation unveils issues such as generation collapse, hallucination, and noticeable performance drop even at the trivial exit ratio of ~10-15\\% of layers. We attribute these errors primarily to ineffective handling of the KV cache through state copying during early exit. In this work, we observe the saturation of computationally expensive feed-forward blocks of LLM layers and propose FFN-SkipLLM, which is a novel fine-grained skip strategy for autoregressive LLMs. FFN-SkipLLM leverages an input-adaptive feed-forward skipping approach that can skip ~25-30\\% of FFN blocks of LLMs with marginal change in performance on knowledge-intensive generation tasks without any requirement to handle the KV cache. Our extensive experiments and ablation studies across benchmarks like MT-Bench, Factoid-QA, and variable-length text summarization illustrate how our simple and easy-to-use method can facilitate faster autoregressive decoding.

Language varies along several axes, most importantly, language instance (e.g. French) and domain (e.g. news). While adapting NLP models to new languages within a single domain, or to new domains within a single language, is widely studied, research in joint adaptation is hampered by the lack of evaluation datasets. This prevents the transfer of NLP systems from well-resourced languages and domains to non-dominant language-domain combinations. To address this gap, we introduce M2QA, a multi-domain multilingual question answering benchmark. M2QA includes 13,500 SQuAD 2.0-style question-answer instances in German, Turkish, and Chinese for the domains of product reviews, news, and creative writing. We use M2QA to explore cross-lingual cross-domain performance of fine-tuned models and state-of-the-art LLMs, and investigate modular approaches to domain and language adaptation. We witness 1) considerable performance _variations_ across domain-language combinations within model classes and 2) considerable performance _drops_ between source and target language-domain combinations across all model sizes. We demonstrate that M2QA is far from solved and new methods to effectively transfer both linguistic and domain-specific information are necessary",

Consequently, although Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate fluent text, they often introduce inaccuracies by hallucinating content not found in the original source. While supervised fine-tuning methods that maximize likelihood contribute to this issue, they do not consistently enhance the faithfulness of the summaries. Preference-based optimization methods, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), can further refine the model to align with human preferences. However, these methods still heavily depend on costly human feedback.

We introduce three key enhancements: (1) Meta-class analysis which, instead of labeling non-entailed premise-hypothesis pairs with the less informative \"neutral\" entailment label, provides additional context by analyzing overarching meta-relationships between classes; (2) Feasible hypothesis filtering, which removes unlikely hypotheses from consideration based on pairs of entity types; and (3) Group-based prediction selection, which further improves performance by selecting highly confident predictions. MetaEntail-RE is conceptually simple and empirically powerful, yielding significant improvements over conventional relation extraction techniques and other NLI formulations.

Despite advancements, challenges persist due to the complexity and diversity inherent in medical tasks, which can be categorized as knowledge-intensive tasks and alignment-required tasks.

    "abstract": "The alignment of large language models (LLMs) is crucial not only for unlocking their potential in specific tasks but also for ensuring that responses meet human expectations and adhere to safety and ethical principles. To address the challenges of current alignment methodologies, we introduce self-evolution fine-tuning (SEFT) for LLM alignment, aiming to eliminate the need for annotated samples while retaining the stability and efficiency of SFT. SEFT first trains an adaptive reviser to elevate low-quality responses while maintaining high-quality ones. The reviser then gradually guides the policy's optimization by fine-tuning it with enhanced responses. The method excels in utilizing unlimited unannotated data to optimize policies via supervised fine-tuning. Our experiments on AlpacaEval and MT-Bench demonstrate the effectiveness of SEFT and its advantages over existing alignment techniques",

    "abstract": "Natural language explanations represent a proxy for evaluating explainable and multi-step Natural Language Inference (NLI) models. However, assessing the validity of explanations for NLI is challenging as it typically involves the crowd-sourcing of apposite datasets, a process that is time-consuming and prone to logical errors. To address existing limitations, this paper investigates the verification and refinement of natural language explanations through the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Theorem Provers (TPs). Specifically, we present a neuro-symbolic framework, named Explanation-Refiner, that integrates TPs with LLMs to generate and formalise explanatory sentences and suggest potential inference strategies for NLI. In turn, the TP is employed to provide formal guarantees on the logical validity of the explanations and to generate feedback for subsequent improvements. We demonstrate how Explanation-Refiner can be jointly used to evaluate explanatory reasoning, autoformalisation, and error correction mechanisms of state-of-the-art LLMs as well as to automatically enhance the quality of explanations of variable complexity in different domains",

We introduce a large-scale dataset comprising over 7 million questions from 17 marketplaces across 11 languages. We then perform automatic translation on the Electronics category of our dataset, naming it as McMarket. We focus on two subtasks: review-based answer generation and product-related question ranking. For each subtask, we label a subset of McMarket using an LLM and further evaluate the quality of the annotations via human assessment. We then conduct experiments to benchmark our dataset, using models ranging from traditional lexical models to LLMs in both single-market and cross-market scenarios across McMarket and the corresponding LLM subset.

To address this issue, we construct an event-oriented long video understanding benchmark, \\emph{\\textbf{Event-Bench}}, building upon existing datasets and human annotations.

Task arithmetic has emerged as a cost-effective approach for MTL. It enables performance enhancement across multiple tasks by adding their corresponding task vectors to a pre-trained model. However, the current lack of a method that can simultaneously achieve optimal performance, computational efficiency, and data privacy limits their application to LLMs. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{M}odel \\textbf{E}xclusive \\textbf{T}ask \\textbf{A}rithmetic for merging \\textbf{GPT}-scale models (MetaGPT) which formalizes the objective of model merging into a multi-task learning framework, aiming to minimize the average loss difference between the merged model and each individual task model.

To counter this, we propose learning script-agnostic representations using several different experimental strategies (upscaling, flattening, and script mixing) focusing on four major Dravidian languages (Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, and Malayalam). We find that word-level script randomization and exposure to a language written in multiple scripts is extremely valuable for downstream script-agnostic language identification, while also maintaining competitive performance on naturally occurring text",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate robust capabilities across various fields, leading to a paradigm shift in LLM-enhanced Recommender System (RS). Research to date focuses on point-wise and pair-wise recommendation paradigms, which are inefficient for LLM-based recommenders due to high computational costs. However, existing list-wise approaches also fall short in ranking tasks due to misalignment between ranking objectives and next-token prediction. Moreover, these LLM-based methods struggle to effectively address the order relation among candidates, particularly given the scale of ratings. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the large language model framework with Aligned Listwise Ranking Objectives (ALRO). ALRO is designed to bridge the gap between the capabilities of LLMs and the nuanced requirements of ranking tasks. Specifically, ALRO employs explicit feedback in a listwise manner by introducing soft lambda loss, a customized adaptation of lambda loss designed for optimizing order relations. This mechanism provides more accurate optimization goals, enhancing the ranking process. Additionally, ALRO incorporates a permutation-sensitive learning mechanism that addresses position bias, a prevalent issue in generative models, without imposing additional computational burdens during inference. Our evaluative studies reveal that ALRO outperforms both existing embedding-based recommendation methods and LLM-based recommendation baselines",

However, distilled versions of pretrained models are not always available. Also, the exact pipeline of model distillation that does not lead to the ASM problem is not clear.

Nevertheless, the inherent low rank of update parameters in LoRA may limit its expressiveness required for adapting to new sub-tasks. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we propose a PEFT method called Hadamard high-Rank Adaptation (HiRA) to keep update parameters with a high rank, thereby enhancing the model capacity. The proposed HiRA method consists of two components, including a Hadamard component based on the Hadamard product and an offset component with low-rank structure. By combining those two components in an additive way, the proposed HiRA method can learn high-rank update parameters with introducing little computational overhead.

Recent works indicate that LLMs have modeled rich knowledge, albeit not effectively triggered or awakened. Inspired by this, we propose a novel knowledge-augmented framework, Imagination-Augmented-Generation (IAG), which simulates the human capacity to compensate for knowledge deficits while answering questions solely through imagination, thereby awakening relevant knowledge in LLMs without relying on external resources. Guided by IAG, we propose an imagine richer context method for question answering (IMcQA).

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Merging Large Language Models (LLMs) is a cost-effective technique for combining multiple expert LLMs into a single versatile model, retaining the expertise of the original ones. However, current approaches often overlook the importance of safety alignment during merging, leading to highly misaligned models. This work investigates the effects of model merging on alignment. We evaluate several popular model merging techniques, demonstrating that existing methods do not only transfer domain expertise but also propagate misalignment. We propose a simple two-step approach to address this problem: (i) generating synthetic safety and domain-specific data, and (ii) incorporating these generated data into the optimization process of existing data-aware model merging techniques. This allows us to treat alignment as a skill that can be maximized in the resulting merged LLM. Our experiments illustrate the effectiveness of integrating alignment-related data during merging, resulting in models that excel in both domain expertise and alignment",

Weight-only quantization has emerged as a promising solution to address these challenges. Previous research suggests that fine-tuning through up and down rounding can enhance performance. In this study, we introduce SignRound, a method that utilizes signed gradient descent (SignSGD) to optimize rounding values and weight clipping within just 200 steps. SignRound integrates the advantages of Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) and Post-Training Quantization (PTQ), achieving exceptional results across 2 to 4 bits while maintaining low tuning costs and avoiding additional inference overhead. For example, SignRound achieves absolute average accuracy improvements ranging from 6.91\\% to 33.22\\% at 2 bits.

    "abstract": "Recent major milestones have successfully decoded non-invasive brain signals (e.g. functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalogram (EEG)) into natural language. Despite the progress in model design, how to split the datasets for training, validating, and testing still remains a matter of debate. Most of the prior researches applied subject-specific data splitting, where the decoding model is trained and evaluated per subject. Such splitting method poses challenges to the utilization efficiency of dataset as well as the generalization of models. In this study, we propose a cross-subject data splitting criterion for brain-to-text decoding on various types of cognitive dataset (fMRI, EEG), aiming to maximize dataset utilization and improve model generalization. We undertake a comprehensive analysis on existing cross-subject data splitting strategies and prove that all these methods suffer from data leakage, namely the leakage of test data to training set, which significantly leads to overfitting and overestimation of decoding models. The proposed cross-subject splitting method successfully addresses the data leakage problem and we re-evaluate some SOTA brain-to-text decoding models as baselines for further research",

However it is challenging to construct a large-scale, high-quality TPR dataset due to expensive annotation and privacy protection. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have approached human performance on many NLP tasks, creating the possibility to expand high-quality TPR datasets. This paper proposes the first LLM-based Data Augmentation (LLM-DA) method for TPR. LLM-DA uses LLMs to rewrite the text in the TPR dataset, achieving high-quality expansion concisely and efficiently. These rewritten texts are able to increase text diversity while retaining the original key semantic concepts. To alleviate hallucinations of LLMs, LLM-DA introduces a Text Faithfulness Filter to filter out unfaithful rewritten text. To balance the contributions of original and augmented text, a Balanced Sampling Strategy is proposed to control the proportion of original and augmented text used for training. LLM-DA is a plug-and-play method that can be integrated into various TPR models. Comprehensive experiments show that LLM-DA can improve the retrieval performance of current TPR models",

Moreover, we identify the human-interpretable FFN neurons within both feature-enhancing and feature-predicting stages.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Transliterating related languages that use different scripts into a common script is effective for improving crosslingual transfer in downstream tasks. However, this methodology often makes pretraining a model from scratch unavoidable, as transliteration brings about new subwords not covered in existing multilingual pretrained language models (mPLMs). This is undesirable because it requires a large computation budget. A more promising way is to make full use of available mPLMs. To this end, this paper proposes a simple but effective framework: $\\textbf{Trans}$literate-$\\textbf{M}$erge-$\\textbf{I}$nitialize ($\\textbf{TransMI}$). TransMI is a strong baseline well-suited for data that is transliterated into a common script by exploiting an mPLM and its tokenizer. TransMI has three stages: ($\\textbf{a}$) transliterate the vocabulary of an mPLM into a common script; ($\\textbf{b}$) merge the new vocabulary with the original vocabulary; and ($\\textbf{c}$) initialize the embeddings of the new subwords. We apply TransMI to three strong recent mPLMs. Our experiments demonstrate that TransMI not only preserves the mPLM's ability to handle non-transliterated data, but also enables it to effectively process transliterated data, thereby facilitating crosslingual transfer. The results show consistent improvements of 3\\% to 34\\% for different mPLMs and tasks. We will make our code and models publicly available",

    "abstract": "Multimodal emotion recognition systems rely heavily on the full availability of modalities, suffering significant performance declines when modal data is incomplete. To tackle this issue, we present the Cross-Modal Alignment, Reconstruction, and Refinement (CM-ARR) framework, an innovative approach that sequentially engages in cross-modal alignment, reconstruction, and refinement phases to handle missing modalities and enhance emotion recognition. This framework utilizes unsupervised distribution-based contrastive learning to align heterogeneous modal distributions, reducing discrepancies and modeling semantic uncertainty effectively. The reconstruction phase applies normalizing flow models to transform these aligned distributions and recover missing modalities. The refinement phase employs supervised point-based contrastive learning to disrupt semantic correlations and accentuate emotional traits, thereby enriching the affective content of the reconstructed representations. Extensive experiments on the IEMOCAP and MSP-IMPROV datasets confirm the superior performance of CM-ARR under conditions of both missing and complete modalities. Specifically, with all missing conditions on IEMOCAP and MSP-IMPROV, CM-ARR shows absolute improvements of 2.11% and 2.12%, 1.71% and 1.96% in WAR and UAR, respectively.

This tendency frequently results in inaccurate summary generation. In response to this challenge, we formulate dialogue summarization as an extract-then-generate task. To tackle the extraction phase, we introduce an algorithm designed to identify Utterances Most related to speakers' key Intents (UMIs). These UMIs serve as labels to train an extraction model. Moving to the generation phase, we view a dialogue as parallel original-extracted streams. Correspondingly, we present a model named Row-Column Fusion Dual-Encoders and Utterance Prefix for Dialogue Summarization, abbreviated as RCUPS, with the goal of enhancing the model's ability to discern utterances and align with our sentence-level extraction. RCUPS integrates the row-column wise fusion module, which amalgamates vector representations from a dual-branch encoder. In the decoding stage, an utterance-level prefix is strategically employed to emphasize crucial details, while weight decay is applied to non-UMIs to mitigate their influence. To assess the effectiveness of RCUPS, comprehensive experiments on SAMSum, DialogSum, and TODSum datasets show significant improvements over robust baselines",

Studies indicate that assigning LLMs the roles of experts, a strategy known as role-play prompting, can enhance their performance in the corresponding domains. However, the prompt needs to be manually designed for the given problem, requiring certain expertise and iterative modifications. To this end, we propose self-prompt tuning, making LLMs themselves generate role-play prompts through fine-tuning. Leveraging the LIMA dataset as our foundational corpus, we employ GPT-4 to annotate role-play prompts for each data points, resulting in the creation of the LIMA-Role dataset. We then fine-tune LLMs like Llama-2-7B and Mistral-7B on LIMA-Role. Consequently, the self-prompt tuned LLMs can automatically generate expert role prompts for any given question. We extensively evaluate self-prompt tuned LLMs on widely used NLP benchmarks and open-ended question test.

We employ these methods on Mistral 7B and Mixtral 8x7B models, leveraging a large-scale clinical pretraining dataset of 50 billion tokens and an instruct fine-tuning dataset of 500 million tokens. Our evaluation across various clinical tasks reveals nuanced insights. While continuous pretraining beyond 250 billion tokens yields marginal improvements, instruct fine-tuning emerges as a more influential factor. Notably, NEFTune, designed primarily to enhance generation quality, surprisingly demonstrates additional gains on our benchmark. These findings underscore the importance of tailoring fine-tuning strategies and exploring innovative techniques to optimize LLM performance in the clinical domain",

A solution to address this issue involves retrieving external knowledge at various granularities. However, this strategy typically suffers from decreased precision in coarse-grained retrieval and omissions in fine-grained retrieval. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel framework designed for the legal domain, named Supplemental Enhancement of Action Segments (SEAS). SEAS utilizes few-shot prompting to extract action segments from legal texts, which are then used to enhance the retrieval of complete legal texts. In the Japanese Law Retrieval task, SEAS significantly enhances the performance of three distinct embedding models. Furthermore, in the Chinese Legal Question Answering task, SEAS outperforms all baselines across all metrics",

However, several significant challenges still persist in LLMs for ranking: (1) LLMs are constrained by limited input length, precluding them from processing a large number of documents simultaneously; (2) The output document sequence is influenced by the input order of documents, resulting in inconsistent ranking outcomes; (3) Achieving a balance between cost and ranking performance is quite challenging. To tackle these issues, we introduce a novel documents ranking method called TourRank, which is inspired by the tournament mechanism. This approach alleviates the impact of LLM's limited input length through intelligent grouping, while the tournament-like points system ensures robust ranking, mitigating the influence of the document input sequence. We test TourRank with different LLMs on the TREC DL datasets and the BEIR benchmark. Experimental results show that TourRank achieves state-of-the-art performance at a reasonable cost",

    "abstract": "Sign language processing (SLP) is often reduced to translation using state-of-the-art computer vision models combined with neural machine translation systems. Comparatively, a growing field of instruct-tuned large language models can accomplish multiple NLP tasks end-to-end. However, signed languages are not included in these models; instead, special translation models are developed for signed languages. This paper proposes that SLP can be included in the (large) language model development, freeing sign language models from the necessity of low-resource multimodal learning from scratch. We introduce the first text-only and multimodal large (7B) LLaMA-based language models to be pre-trained and then fine-tuned on a sign language recognition task. We propose new prompting and fine-tuning strategies for text-only and multimodal SLP, incorporating both linguistics of signed languages and theoretically motivated strategies to mitigate catastrophic forgetting (of spoken language). We test the generalization of these models to other SLP tasks, showing LLMs are also capable sign language models that are still adept at spoken language tasks and, by changing the prompt, can even generalize to new prosodic and iconic sign translation tasks. Finally, we analyze trade-offs between our text-only and multimodal models. Our code and model checkpoints will be open-source. We will update our model suite as newer open-source LLMs, datasets, and SLP tasks become available",

Additionally, MoE significantly increases the number of parameters, posing a computational cost challenge. Therefore, in this paper, we propose MoSLD, a mixture-of-shared-LoRAs model with a dropout strategy. MoSLD addresses these challenges by sharing the upper projection matrix in LoRA among different experts, encouraging the model to learn general knowledge across tasks, while still allowing the lower projection matrix to focus on the unique features of each task. The application of dropout mitigates parameter overfitting in LoRA.

Recent work has focused on decoding techniques to improve factuality in decoding by leveraging LLMs' hierarchical representation of factual knowledge, manipulating the predicted distributions at inference time. Current state-of-the-art approaches refine decoding by contrasting logits from a lower layer with the final layer to exploit information related factuality within the model forward procedure. However, such methods often assume the final layer is most reliable one and the lower layer selection process depends on it. In this work, we first propose logit extrapolation of critical token probabilities beyond the last layer for more accurate contrasting. We additionally employ layer-wise entropy-guided lower layer selection, decoupling the selection process from the final layer.

We introduce a metric called the Count of Sequential Intermediate Digits (CSID), which measures the complexity of arithmetic equations by counting the missing steps in digit reasoning. Our empirical findings suggest that increasing the model size does little to improve the handling of equations with high CSID values. We propose RevOrder, a method that incorporates techniques such as reversing the output order, step-by-step decomposition, and rollback mechanisms to maintain a low CSID, thereby enhancing the solvability of arithmetic equations in LMs. RevOrder also introduces a more compact reasoning process, which reduces the token requirements without affecting the CSID, significantly enhancing token efficiency. Comprehensive testing shows that RevOrder achieves perfect accuracy in operations such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication, and substantially improves performance in division tasks, especially with large numbers where traditional models falter. Additionally, applying RevOrder to fine-tune the LLaMA2-7B model on the GSM8K math task led to a significant reduction in equation calculation errors by 46\\% and increased the overall score from 41.6 to 44.4.

    "abstract": "Deceptive reviews are becoming increasingly common, especially given the increase in performance and the prevalence of LLMs. While work to date has addressed the development of models to differentiate between truthful and deceptive human reviews, much less is known about the distinction between real reviews and AI-authored fake reviews. Moreover, most of the research so far has focused primarily on English, with very little work dedicated to other languages. In this paper, we compile and make publicly available the MAiDE-up dataset, consisting of 10,000 real and 10,000 AI-generated fake hotel reviews, balanced across ten languages. Using this dataset, we conduct extensive linguistic analyses to (1) compare the AI fake hotel reviews to real hotel reviews, and (2) identify the factors that influence the deception detection model performance. We explore the effectiveness of several models for deception detection in hotel reviews across three main dimensions: sentiment, location, and language. We find that these dimensions influence how well we can detect AI-generated fake reviews",

    "abstract": "Recent studies show the growing significance of document retrieval in the generation of LLMs within the scientific domain by bridging their knowledge gap. However, dense retrievers often struggle with domain-specific retrieval and complex query-document relationships, particularly when query segments correspond to various parts of a document. To alleviate such prevalent challenges, this paper introduces $\\texttt{MixGR}$, which improves dense retrievers' awareness of query-document matching across various levels of granularity in queries and documents using a zero-shot approach. $\\texttt{MixGR}$ fuses various metrics based on these granularities to a united score that reflects a comprehensive query-document similarity. Our experiments demonstrate that $\\texttt{MixGR}$ outperforms previous document retrieval by 22.6% and 10.4% on nDCG@5 with unsupervised and supervised retrievers, respectively, averaged on queries containing multiple subqueries from four scientific retrieval datasets. Moreover, the efficacy of two downstream scientific question-answering tasks highlights the advantage of $\\texttt{MixGR}$ to boost the application of LLMs in the scientific domain",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "While advancements in Vision Language Models (VLMs) have significantly improved the alignment of visual and textual data, these models primarily focus on aligning images with short descriptive captions. This focus limits their ability to handle complex text interactions, particularly with longer texts such as lengthy captions or documents, which have not been extensively explored yet. In this paper, we introduce Meet At The Embedding (MATE), a novel approach that combines the capabilities of VLMs with Large Language Models (LLMs) to overcome this challenge without the need for additional image-long text pairs. Specifically, we replace the text encoder of the VLM with a pretrained LLM-based encoder that excels in understanding long texts. To bridge the gap between VLM and LLM, MATE incorporates a projection module that is trained in a multi-stage manner. It starts by aligning the embeddings from the VLM text encoder with those from the LLM using extensive text pairs. This module is then employed to seamlessly align image embeddings closely with LLM embeddings. We propose two new cross-modal retrieval benchmarks to assess the task of connecting images with long texts (lengthy captions / documents). Extensive experimental results demonstrate that MATE effectively connects images with long texts, uncovering diverse semantic relationships",

The reliability of this benchmark has been confirmed in several ways. Subsequent experiments with existing LLMs have led to the following findings: (i) Chinese medical LLMs underperform on this benchmark, especially where medical reasoning and factual consistency are vital, underscoring the need for advances in clinical knowledge and diagnostic accuracy. (ii) Several general-domain LLMs demonstrate substantial potential in medical clinics, while the limited input capacity of many medical LLMs hinders their practical use.

Despite recent research aiming to improve prediction efficiency, multi-sample speculative decoding has been overlooked due to varying numbers of accepted tokens within a batch in the verification phase.

The use of automatic pronunciation assessment helps avoid the subjectivity of human evaluation, which often shows weak correlations among raters, making automated methods more reliable.

Eighteen pronunciation assessment metrics, including automatic phone recognition, self-supervised models, and Goodness of Pronunciation (GOP) were used to evaluate learner pronunciations over 12 repetitions of 7 pseudo-words.

Three acoustic perception models are evaluated: an English model (M1) based on the XLS-R framework and fine-tuned on the TIMIT corpus, a non-native model (M2) also based on XLS-R but fine-tuned on the L2-ARCTIC corpus, and a Chinese model (M3) using a sequence-to-sequence architecture with connectionist temporal classification (CTC) fine-tuned on the AISHELL-1 corpus. A corpus of seven pseudo-words designed to challenge Chinese learners of English is used to assess the models' performance in capturing the acoustic perception of L2 learners. The Levenshtein distance between recognised sequences and reference sequences for Chinese and English speakers is employed as an evaluation metric, along with the ratio of these distances. Results show that the non-native model (M2) outperforms the English (M1) and Chinese (M3) models in minimising the Levenshtein distance for Chinese speakers and achieves the lowest ratio, indicating its effectiveness in modelling the acoustic perception of L2 learners. These findings suggest that incorporating non-native speech data in acoustic perception models can improve the simulation of teacher-learner interaction in L2 pronunciation learning",

We first design a bi-directional attention mechanism to expand the visual receptive field to address the problem of confusing image objects. Building on this, to alleviate the persistent hallucinations in generated sentences, we propose a dual contrastive adapting strategy to enhance the positive effect of images during the next token prediction stage.

Our system utilizes a dual-stream architecture, which firstly transcribes the text on the two streams separately, and then combines the outputs. We evaluate the proposed model on four datasets: Flickr8k, ADE20k, COCO, and OpenImages. The experimental results show that VHASR can effectively utilize key information in images to enhance the model's speech recognition ability. Its performance not only surpasses unimodal ASR, but also achieves SOTA among existing image-based multimodal ASR",

    "title": "Comparing Neighbors Together Makes it Easy: Jointly Comparing Multiple Candidates for Efficient and Effective Retrieval",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "A common retrieve-and-rerank paradigm involves retrieving a broad set of relevant candidates using a fast bi-encoder, followed by applying expensive but accurate cross-encoders to a limited candidate set. However, relying on this small subset is often prone to error propagation from the bi-encoders, restricting the overall performance. To address these issues, we propose the Comparing Multiple Candidates (CMC) framework, which compares a query and multiple candidate embeddings jointly through shallow self-attention layers. While providing contextualized representations, CMC is scalable enough to handle multiple comparisons simultaneously, where comparing 2K candidates takes only twice as long as comparing 100. Practitioners can use CMC as a lightweight and effective reranker to improve top-1 accuracy. Moreover, negligible extra latency through parallelism enables CMC reranking to \\textit{virtually enhance} a neural retriever. Experimental results demonstrate that CMC, virtually enhancing retriever, significantly improves recall@k (+6.7, +3.5\\%-p for R@16, R@64) compared to the first retrieval stage on the ZeSHEL dataset. Also, we conduct experiments for direct reranking on entity, passage, and dialogue ranking. The results indicate that CMC is not only faster (11x) than \\ce\\ but also often more effective, with improved prediction performance in Wikipedia entity linking (+0.7\\%-p) and DSTC7 dialogue ranking (+3.3\\%-p)",

However, correlation methods tend to capture only the ability of metrics to differentiate between good and bad source-translation pairs, overlooking their reliability in distinguishing alternative translations for the same source. In this paper, we confirm that this is indeed the case by showing that current metrics are insensitive to nuanced differences in translation quality. This effect is most pronounced when the quality is high and the variance among alternatives is low. Given this finding, we shift towards detecting high-quality correct translations, an important problem in practical decision-making scenarios where a binary check of correctness is prioritized over a nuanced evaluation of quality. Using the MQM framework as the gold standard, we systematically stress-test the ability of current metrics to identify translations with no errors as marked by humans.

Existing approaches to attribution have only been evaluated in RAG settings, where the initial retrieval confounds LLM performance. This is crucially different from the long document setting, where retrieval is not needed, but could help. Thus, a long document specific evaluation of attribution is missing. To fill this gap, we present LAB, a benchmark of 6 diverse long document tasks with attribution, and experiment with different approaches to attribution on 4 LLMs of different sizes, both prompted and fine-tuned. We find that *citation*, i.e. response generation and evidence extraction in one step, mostly performs best.

We also find that evidence quality can predict response quality on datasets with simple responses, but not so for complex responses, as models struggle with providing evidence for complex claims.

    "abstract": "In recent years, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with vision processing capability have shown substantial advancements, excelling particularly in interpreting general images. Their application in domain-specific tasks, like those in the medical fields, is further enhanced through continuous visual instruction fine-tuning (CVIF). Despite these advancements, a significant challenge arises from label noise encountered during the collection of domain-specific data. Our studies reveal that this label noise can adversely affect the learning of vision projection embeddings and contribute to inaccuracies in LLMs' fine-tuning, often leading to hallucinations. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework designed to minimize the impact of label noise. Our approach focuses on stabilizing the learning of vision embeddings and reducing the effect of label noise through the inherent semantic understanding of uncertainty in LLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework maintains robust performance in general visual question-answer (VQA) tasks while showing significant effectiveness in medical VQA tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to specifically address and analyze the impact of label noise in CVIF",

We propose null-shot prompting, a counter-intuitive approach where we intentionally instruct LLMs to look at and utilize information from a null section. We investigate null-shot prompting on a wide range of tasks, including arithmetic reasoning, commonsense reasoning, and reading comprehension. We observe a substantial increase in performance in arithmetic reasoning tasks for various models, with up to a 44.62% increase compared to a baseline in one model. Therefore, we investigate deeper into this task by utilizing a more challenging mathematics problem-solving benchmark. We observe that LLMs benefit from hallucination in null-shot prompting in this task and discuss the mathematical topics that benefit the most from introducing hallucination in the prompt. We continue our investigation by evaluating hallucination detection abilities of the LLMs when using null-shot prompting. We find surprising results where hallucination in prompts can improve hallucination detection abilities of many LLMs. We also examine the effects of introducing both reasoning, which is known to mitigate hallucination, and hallucination simultaneously in the prompt and observe another surprising turn for the mathematics problem-solving benchmark with many performance improvements. We hope this paper will spark more interest, investigations, and discussions on how hallucination in prompts LLMs and even bolsters them in certain cases",

However, the recognition of intents still presents a challenge in the case of ConvXAI, since little training data exist and the domain is highly specific, as there is a broad range of XAI methods to map requests onto. In order to bridge this gap, we present CoXQL, the first dataset for user intent recognition in ConvXAI, covering 31 intents, seven of which require filling multiple slots. Subsequently, we enhance an existing parsing approach by incorporating template validations, and conduct an evaluation of several LLMs on CoXQL using different parsing strategies.

Therefore, by decomposing an unsafe query into several sub-queries for multi-turn dialogue, we induced LLMs to answer harmful sub-questions incrementally, culminating in an overall harmful response. Our experiments, conducted across a wide range of LLMs, indicate current inadequacies in the safety mechanisms of LLMs in multi-turn dialogue. Our findings expose vulnerabilities of LLMs in complex scenarios involving multi-turn dialogue, presenting new challenges for the safety of LLMs",

    "abstract": "Southeast Asia (SEA) is a region rich in linguistic diversity and cultural variety, with over 1,300 indigenous languages and a population of 671 million people. However, prevailing AI models suffer from a significant lack of representation of texts, images, and audio datasets from SEA, compromising the quality of AI models for SEA languages. Evaluating models for SEA languages is challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality datasets, compounded by the dominance of English training data, raising concerns about potential cultural misrepresentation. To address these challenges, through a collaborative movement, we introduce SEACrowd, a comprehensive resource center that fills the resource gap by providing standardized corpora in nearly 1,000 SEA languages across three modalities. Through our SEACrowd benchmarks, we assess the quality of AI models on 36 indigenous languages across 13 tasks, offering valuable insights into the current AI landscape in SEA. Furthermore, we propose strategies to facilitate greater AI advancements, maximizing potential utility and resource equity for the future of AI in SEA",

While mainstream MRC methods predominantly leverage extractive strategies using encoder-only models such as BERT, generative approaches face the issue of $\\textit{out-of-control generation}$ -- a critical problem where answers generated are often incorrect, irrelevant, or unfaithful to the source text. To address these limitations in generative models for extractive MRC, we introduce the $\\textbf{Q}$uestion-$\\textbf{A}$ttended $\\textbf{S}$pan $\\textbf{E}$xtraction ($\\textit{QASE}$) module.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Large vision-language models (LVLMs) hallucinate: certain context cues in an image may trigger the language module's overconfident and incorrect reasoning on abnormal or hypothetical objects. Though a few benchmarks have been developed to investigate LVLM hallucinations, they mainly rely on hand-crafted corner cases whose fail patterns may hardly generalize, and finetuning on them could undermine their validity. These motivate us to develop the first automatic benchmark generation approach, AUTOHALLUSION, that harnesses a few principal strategies to create diverse hallucination examples. It probes the language modules in LVLMs for context cues and uses them to synthesize images by: (1) adding objects abnormal to the context cues; (2) for two co-occurring objects, keeping one and excluding the other; or (3) removing objects closely tied to the context cues. It then generates image-based questions whose ground-truth answers contradict the language module's prior. A model has to overcome contextual biases and distractions to reach correct answers, while incorrect or inconsistent answers indicate hallucinations. AUTOHALLUSION enables us to create new benchmarks at the minimum cost and thus overcomes the fragility of hand-crafted benchmarks. It also reveals common failure patterns and reasons, providing key insights to detect, avoid, or control hallucinations. Comprehensive evaluations of top-tier LVLMs, e.g., GPT-4V(ision), Gemini Pro Vision, Claude 3, and LLaVA-1.5, show a 97.7% and 98.7% success rate of hallucination induction on synthetic and real-world datasets of AUTOHALLUSION, paving the way for a long battle against hallucinations",

    "abstract": "Reasoning encompasses two typical types: deductive reasoning and inductive reasoning. Despite extensive research into the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), most studies have failed to rigorously differentiate between inductive and deductive reasoning, leading to a blending of the two. This raises an essential question: In LLM reasoning, which poses a greater challenge - deductive or inductive reasoning? While the deductive reasoning capabilities of LLMs, (i.e. their capacity to follow instructions in reasoning tasks), have received considerable attention, their abilities in true inductive reasoning remain largely unexplored. To delve into the true inductive reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we propose a novel framework, SolverLearner. This framework enables LLMs to learn the underlying function (i.e., $y = f_w(x)$), that maps input data points $(x)$ to their corresponding output values $(y)$, using only in-context examples. By focusing on inductive reasoning and separating it from LLM-based deductive reasoning, we can isolate and investigate inductive reasoning of LLMs in its pure form via SolverLearner. Our observations reveal that LLMs demonstrate remarkable inductive reasoning capabilities through SolverLearner, achieving near-perfect performance with ACC of 1 in most cases. Surprisingly, despite their strong inductive reasoning abilities, LLMs tend to relatively lack deductive reasoning capabilities, particularly in tasks involving ``counterfactual'' reasoning",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Recent progress in the areas of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Language Agents has demonstrated significant promise for various future applications across multiple disciplines. While traditional approaches to language agents often rely on fixed, handcrafted designs, our research aims to develop agents that are both learnable and dynamic. In our method, we use an existing framework that abstracts language agents as graphs. Within this graph framework, we aim to learn a model that can generate edges for every given input to the language agent. This allows us to generate edges that represent the flow of communication within the graph based on the given input, thereby adjusting the internal communication of a language agent. We learn to generate these edges using a pretrained LLM that is fine-tuned with reinforcement learning. This LLM can be fine-tuned on several datasets simultaneously, and we hypothesize that the model learns to adapt to these different domains during training, achieving good overall performance when encountering data from different domains during deployment. We demonstrate that our approach surpasses the previous static approach by nearly 6% accuracy on a combined dataset of MMLU and CMMLU, and by more than 10% when trained with a sparsity-inducing loss. It also shows superior performance in additional experiments conducted with the MMLU and Mini Crossword Puzzles datasets",

    "abstract": "Role-playing is one of the essential capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, existing role-playing models make it challenging to fully immerse oneself in a character. They do not understand the limitations of knowledge expected in their current role, nor do they possess the appropriate mindset, which makes it easily apparent that they are not truly fulfilling their role. To solve this, we propose R&R, a role-playing model enhanced by retrieving and reflecting. Before generating responses, our model first retrieves relevant role knowledge and similar dialogues based on the questions asked. Then, it uses reflections extracted from historical dialogues to understand the context. Finally, by establishing knowledge boundaries and inputs for these reflections, our model can produce replies that accurately represent the current role's perspective. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we build a new dataset and compare our model with other models in \"Values\", \"Personality\", \"Hallucination\", \"Stability\" and \"Mindset\" five dimensions.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized language processing, delivering outstanding results across multiple applications. However, deploying LLMs on edge devices poses several challenges with respect to memory, energy, and compute costs, limiting their widespread use in devices such as mobile phones. A promising solution is to reduce the number of bits used to represent weights and activations. While existing works have found partial success at quantizing LLMs to lower bitwidths, e.g. 4-bit weights, quantizing activations beyond 16 bits often leads to large computational overheads due to poor on-device quantization support, or a considerable accuracy drop. Yet, 8-bit activations are very attractive for on-device deployment as they would enable LLMs to fully exploit mobile-friendly hardware, e.g. Neural Processing Units (NPUs). In this work, we make a first attempt to facilitate the on-device deployment of LLMs using integer-only quantization. We first investigate the limitations of existing quantization methods for on-device deployment, with a special focus on activation quantization. We then address these limitations by introducing a simple post-training quantization method, named MobileQuant, that extends previous weight equivalent transformation works by jointly optimizing the weight transformation and activation range parameters in an end-to-end manner. MobileQuant demonstrates superior capabilities over existing methods by 1) achieving near-lossless quantization on a wide range of LLM benchmarks, 2) reducing latency and energy consumption by 20\\%-50\\% compared to current on-device quantization strategies, 3) requiring limited compute budget, 4) being compatible with mobile-friendly compute units, e.g. NPU",

    "abstract": "Dehumanization, characterized as a subtle yet harmful manifestation of hate speech, involves denying individuals of their human qualities and often results in violence against marginalized groups. Despite significant progress in Natural Language Processing across various domains, its application in detecting dehumanizing language is limited, largely due to the scarcity of publicly available annotated data for this domain. This paper evaluates the performance of cutting-edge NLP models, including GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and LLAMA-2, in identifying dehumanizing language. Our findings reveal that while these models demonstrate potential, achieving a 70% accuracy rate in distinguishing dehumanizing language from broader hate speech, they also display biases. They are over-sensitive in classifying other forms of hate speech as dehumanization for a specific subset of target groups, while more frequently failing to identify clear cases of dehumanization for other target groups. Moreover, leveraging one of the best-performing models, we automatically annotated a larger dataset for training more accessible models. However, our findings indicate that these models currently do not meet the high-quality data generation threshold necessary for this task",

However, LLMs suffer from hallucinations and cannot generate reliable answers making it impossible to detect their true personality through questionnaires. To solve this problem, we propose a new method to detect the personality of LLMs by combining questionnaire and text mining methods in this paper. The text mining method can determine the personality of LLMs based on their generated texts, avoiding the influence of hallucinations. In this paper, we also investigate the source of LLMs' personality by conducting experiments on pre-trained language models (PLMs, such as BERT and GPT) and Chat models (ChatLLMs, such as ChatGPT). The results show that LLMs do contain certain personalities, for example, ChatGPT and ChatGLM exhibit the personality traits of 'Conscientiousness'. Moreover, we find that the personalities of LLMs are derived from their pre-trained data. The instruction data used to train ChatLLMs can enhance the generation of data containing personalities and expose their hidden personality. We compare the results with the human average personality score, and we find that the personality of FLAN-T5 in PLMs and ChatGPT in ChatLLMs is more similar to that of a human, with score differences of 0.34 and 0.22, respectively",

In this work,we investigate the potential of LLMs to conduct meta-evaluation and examine the extent to which the proficiency of the model and the scale of the model impact this meta-evaluation capacity.

When users instruct LLMs to generate texts, the instruction can include different constraints depending on the user's need. However, most recent studies do not cover such diverse instruction patterns when creating datasets for LLM detection. In this paper, we reveal that even task-oriented constraints --- constraints that would naturally be included in an instruction and are not related to detection-evasion --- cause existing powerful detectors to have a large variance in detection performance. We focus on student essay writing as a realistic domain and manually create task-oriented constraints based on several factors for essay quality. Our experiments show that the standard deviation (SD) of current detector performance on texts generated by an instruction with such a constraint is significantly larger (up to an SD of 14.4 F1-score) than that by generating texts multiple times or paraphrasing the instruction. We also observe an overall trend where the constraints can make LLM detection more challenging than without them.

In this work, we propose an inference-time method, Self-Highlighted Hesitation (SH2), to help LLMs decode more truthfully. SH2 is based on a simple fact rooted in information theory that for an LLM, the tokens predicted with lower probabilities are prone to be more informative than others. Our analysis shows that these low-confidence tokens are more likely to be closely related to factual information, such as nouns, proper nouns, and adjectives. Therefore, we propose to ``highlight'' the factual information by selecting key tokens with the lowest probabilities and concatenating them to the original context, thus forcing the model to repeatedly read and hesitate on these tokens before generation. During decoding, we also adopt contrastive decoding to emphasize the difference in output probabilities brought by the hesitation. Experimental results demonstrate that our SH2, requiring no additional data or models, can effectively help LLMs elicit factual knowledge and distinguish hallucinated contexts by themselves. Significant and consistent improvements are achieved by SH2 for LLaMA-7b, LLaMA2-7b and Mistral-7b on various hallucination tasks",

    "title": "How Alignment and Jailbreak Work: Explain LLM Safety through Intermediate Hidden States",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) rely on safety alignment to avoid responding to malicious user inputs. Unfortunately, jailbreak can circumvent safety guardrails, resulting in LLMs generating harmful content and raising concerns about LLM safety. Due to language models with intensive parameters often regarded as black boxes, the mechanisms of alignment and jailbreak are challenging to elucidate. In this paper, we employ weak classifiers to explain LLM safety through the intermediate hidden states. We first confirm that LLMs learn ethical concepts during pre-training rather than alignment and can identify malicious and normal inputs in the early layers. Alignment actually associates the early concepts with emotion guesses in the middle layers and then refines them to the specific reject tokens for safe generations. Jailbreak disturbs the transformation of early unethical classification into negative emotions. We conduct experiments on models from 7B to 70B across various model families to prove our conclusion. Overall, our paper indicates the intrinsical mechanism of LLM safety and how jailbreaks circumvent safety guardrails, offering a new perspective on LLM safety and reducing concerns",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Role-playing is an emerging application of large language models (LLMs), allowing users to be immersed in conversations with virtual characters by mimicking their tones and background knowledge. It can be applied in various scenarios such as gaming and virtual reality systems. However, existing methods ignore two challenges: (1) ignoring the relationship with the role played by the user will diminish the immersive experience of the user; (2) insufficient understanding of the character's background knowledge may lead to inconsistent dialogue. In this paper, we introduce the Duplex Relationship Modeling based Role-play framework(DRMR), a novel role-playing framework designed to enhance the immersion of user when interacting with the role-play model. We first propose a graph-based relationship modeling method, utilizing graph structures to model the duplex relationship between the user and the model's played characters. In order to better extract useful personalized information about roles from historical dialogues, we construct a role memory consisting of the description of the duplex relationship. To avoid generating an inconsistent response, we iteratively verify the generated response by updating the role memory according to the current dialogue context. Extensive experiments on benchmark dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of DRMR in enhancing user immersion in role-playing interactions",

Given various approaches of human value alignment, such as Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF), constitutional learning, safety fine tuning, etc., there is an urgent need to understand the scope and nature of human values injected into these LLMs before their deployment and adoption. We propose UniVaR, a high-dimensional neural representation of symbolic human value distributions in LLMs, orthogonal to model architecture and training data. This is a continuous and scalable representation, self-supervised from the value-relevant output of 8 LLMs and evaluated on 15 open-source and commercial LLMs. Through UniVaR, we visualize and explore how LLMs prioritize different values in 25 languages and cultures, shedding light on the complex interplay between human values and language modeling",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) can now generate texts that are indistinguishable from those written by humans. Such remarkable performance of LLMs increases their risk of being used for malicious purposes. Thus, it is necessary to develop methods for distinguishing texts written by LLMs from those written by humans. Watermarking is one of the most powerful methods for achieving this. Although existing methods have successfully detected texts generated by LLMs, they inevitably degrade the text quality. In this study, we propose the Necessary and Sufficient Watermark (NS-Watermark) for inserting watermarks into generated texts with minimum text quality degradation. More specifically, we derive minimum constraints required to be imposed on the generated texts to distinguish whether LLMs or humans write the texts, and we formulate the NS-Watermark as a constrained optimization problem. Through the experiments, we demonstrate that the NS-Watermark can generate more natural texts than existing watermarking methods and distinguish more accurately between texts written by LLMs and those written by humans. Especially in machine translation tasks, the NS-Watermark can outperform the existing watermarking method by up to $30$ BLEU scores",

Existing techniques face the emerging challenges of re-identification attack ability of Large Language Models (LLMs), which have shown advanced capability in memorizing detailed information and patterns as well as connecting disparate pieces of information. In defending against LLM-based re-identification attacks, anonymization could jeopardize the utility of the resulting anonymized data in downstream tasks---the trade-off between privacy and data utility requires deeper understanding within the context of LLMs. This paper proposes a framework composed of three LLM-based components---a privacy evaluator, a utility evaluator, and an optimization component, which work collaboratively to perform anonymization. To provide a practical model for large-scale and real-time environments, we distill the anonymization capabilities into a lightweight model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).

Few studies have systematically compared LLMs' contextualized word embeddings for languages beyond English. Here, we evaluate multiple bidirectional transformers' (BERTs') semantic representations of Spanish ambiguous nouns in context. We develop a novel dataset of minimal-pair sentences evoking the same or different sense for a target ambiguous noun. In a pre-registered study, we collect contextualized human relatedness judgments for each sentence pair. We find that various BERT-based LLMs' contextualized semantic representations capture some variance in human judgments but fall short of the human benchmark, and for Spanish---unlike English---model scale is uncorrelated with performance. We also identify stereotyped trajectories of target noun disambiguation as a proportion of traversal through a given LLM family's architecture, which we partially replicate in English.

Most existing studies focus on improving the performance of the target domain by fine-tuning domain-specific models (trained on source domains) based on the target domain dataset. Few works propose continual learning tasks for ABSA, which aim to learn the target domain's ability while maintaining the history domains' abilities. In this paper, we propose a Large Language Model-based Continual Learning (LLM-CL) model for ABSA. First, we design a domain knowledge decoupling module to learn a domain-invariant adapter and separate domain-variant adapters dependently with an orthogonal constraint. Then, we introduce a domain knowledge warmup strategy to align the representation between domain-invariant and domain-variant knowledge. In the test phase, we index the corresponding domain-variant knowledge via domain positioning to not require each sample's domain ID.

We expand on these results by examining the effect of distance on the illusive effect, using and modifying stimuli from Parker and Phillips (2016).

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are trained on vast amounts of text from the internet, which contains both factual and misleading information about the world. While unintuitive from a classic view of LMs, recent work has shown that the truth value of a statement can be elicited from the model's representations. This paper presents an explanation for why LMs appear to know the truth despite not being trained with truth labels. We hypothesize that the pretraining data is generated by groups of (un)truthful agents whose outputs share common features, and they form a (un)truthful persona. By training on this data, LMs can infer and represent the persona in its activation space. This allows the model to separate truth from falsehoods and controls the truthfulness of its generation. We show evidence for the persona hypothesis via two observations: (1) we can probe whether a model's answer will be truthful before it is generated; (2) finetuning a model on a set of facts improves its truthfulness on unseen topics. Next, using arithmetics as a synthetic environment, we show that structures of the pretraining data are crucial for the model to infer the truthful persona.

    "abstract": "Argument mining (AM) involves the identification of argument relations (AR) between Argumentative Discourse Units (ADUs). The essence of ARs among ADUs is context-dependent and lies in maintaining a coherent flow of ideas, often centered around the relations between discussed entities, topics, themes or concepts. However, these relations are not always explicitly stated; rather, inferred from implicit chains of reasoning connecting the concepts addressed in the ADUs. While humans can infer such background knowledge, machines face challenges when contextual cues are not explicitly provided. This paper leverages external resources, including WordNet, ConceptNet, and Wikipedia to identify chain of semantic relations (knowledge paths) connecting the concepts discussed in the ADUs to obtain the implicit chains of reasoning. To effectively leverage these paths for AR prediction, we propose attention-based Multi-Network architectures. Various configurations of the architecture are evaluated on the external resources, and the configuration using Wikipedia achieves a new state-of-the-art performance with F-scores of 0.85, 0.84, 0.70, and 87, respectively, on four diverse datasets",

    "abstract": "When large language models are aligned via supervised fine-tuning, they may encounter new factual information that was not acquired through pre-training. It is often conjectured that this can teach the model the behavior of hallucinating factually incorrect responses, as the model is trained to generate facts that are not grounded in its pre-existing knowledge. In this work, we study the impact of such exposure to new knowledge on the capability of the fine-tuned model to utilize its pre-existing knowledge. To this end, we design a controlled setup, focused on closed-book QA, where we vary the proportion of the fine-tuning examples that introduce new knowledge. We demonstrate that large language models struggle to acquire new factual knowledge through fine-tuning, as fine-tuning examples that introduce new knowledge are learned significantly slower than those consistent with the model's knowledge. However, we also find that as the examples with new knowledge are eventually learned, they linearly increase the model's tendency to hallucinate. Taken together, our results highlight the risk in introducing new factual knowledge through fine-tuning, and support the view that large language models mostly acquire factual knowledge through pre-training, whereas fine-tuning teaches them to use it more efficiently",

Through extensive analysis, we identify two primary factors that contribute to the collapse: i) inconsistent handling of prefixed and unprefixed keys in the parameter update equation may result in very small denominators, causing excessively large parameter updates; ii) the subject of collapse cases is usually the first token, whose unprefixed key distribution significantly differs from the prefixed key distribution in autoregressive transformers, causing the aforementioned issue to materialize. To validate our analysis, we propose a simple yet effective approach: uniformly using prefixed keys during editing phase and adding prefixes during the testing phase.

    "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) are applied across diverse domains, the ability to selectively unlearn specific information has become increasingly essential. For instance, LLMs must be capable of providing confidential information to authorized internal users, such as employees or trusted partners, while withholding it from external users, including the general public or unauthorized entities. In response to this challenge, we propose a novel method termed ''in-context knowledge unleaning'', which enables the model to selectively forget information in real-time based on the context of the query. Our method finetunes pre-trained LLMs to enable prompt unlearning of target knowledge within the context, while preserving the other knowledge. We also propose a F1-based evaluation metric to assess the performance of in-context knowledge unlearning, balancing the trade-off between unlearning target knowledge and retaining the other knowledge. Experiments conducted on the TOFU and AGE datasets with the Llama2-7B/13B and Mistral-7B models demonstrated that our method achieves scores of 70-80 points on the proposed metric, significantly outperforming the baseline method. Further investigation into the model's internal behavior revealed that while finetuned LLMs generate correct predictions in the middle layers and maintain them up to the final layer, they make the decision to forget at the last layer, i.e., ''LLMs pretend to forget''. Our findings offer valuable insights into enhancing the robustness of unlearning mechanisms in LLMs, setting a foundation for future research in the field",

Existing methods mainly focus on modeling the question part to capture the language bias, while ignoring the influence of visual content on the model. To address this issue, in this paper, we combine potential causal models with VQA models, using dual-attention as treatment, and treating language bias as a confounding factor in the model.

DetectBench contains 3,928 multiple-choice questions, with an average of 994 tokens per question.

To enhance the performance of LLMs in evidence detection, this paper proposes Detective Reasoning Prompt and Finetune. Experiments demonstrate that the existing LLMs' abilities to detect evidence in long contexts are far inferior to humans. However, the Detective Reasoning Prompt effectively enhances the capability of powerful LLMs in evidence detection, while the Finetuning method shows significant effects in enhancing the performance of weaker LLMs. Moreover, when the abilities of LLMs in evidence detection are improved, their final reasoning performance is also enhanced accordingly",

    "title": "Mitigating Language Biases In Visual Question Answering Through The Forgotten Attention Algorithm",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "At present, in the field of Visual Question Answering (VQA), a model's ability to comprehend various modalities is crucial for accurate answer reasoning. However, recent studies have uncovered prevailing language biases in VQA, where reasoning frequently relies on incorrect associations between questions and answers, rather than genuine multi-modal knowledge-based reasoning. Thus, it is of great challenge to reveal the accurate relationship between image and question. The key idea of this work is inspired by the process of answering questions of human beings, where people always gradually reduce the focus area in the image with the aid of question information until the final related area is retained. More specifically, we introduce a novel attention algorithm, named the Forgotten Attention Algorithm (FAA), where this algorithm gradually \"forgets\" some visual contents after several rounds. This deliberate forgetting process concentrates the model's \"attention\" on the image region that is the most relevant to the question. As a result, it can enhance the integration of image content and thus mitigate language biases. We conducted comprehensive experiments on the VQA-CP v2, VQA v2, and VQA-VS datasets to validate the efficiency and robustness of the algorithm",

This strategy has the advantage of offering an interpretable reasoning path and does not require finetuning a model with task-specific data. We propose PropTest, a general strategy that improves visual programming by further using an LLM to generate code that tests for visual properties in an initial round of proposed solutions. Our method generates tests for data-type consistency, output syntax, and semantic properties. PropTest achieves comparable results to state-of-the-art methods while using publicly available LLMs. This is demonstrated across different benchmarks on visual question answering and referring expression comprehension.

    "abstract": "Mainstream approaches to aligning large language models (LLMs) heavily rely on human preference data, particularly when models require periodic updates. The standard process for iterative alignment of LLMs involves collecting new human feedback for each update. However, the data collection process is costly and challenging to scale. To address this issue, we introduce the \"TS-Align\" framework, which fine-tunes a policy model using pairwise feedback data automatically mined from its outputs. This automatic mining process is efficiently accomplished through the collaboration between a large-scale teacher model and a small-scale student model. The policy fine-tuning process can be iteratively repeated using on-policy generations within our proposed teacher-student collaborative framework. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our final aligned policy outperforms the base policy model with an average win rate of 69.7% across seven conversational or instruction-following datasets. Furthermore, we show that the ranking capability of the teacher is effectively distilled into the student through our pipeline, resulting in a small-scale yet effective reward model for policy model alignment",

    "abstract": "Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated a superior ability to serve as ranking models. However, concerns have arisen as LLMs will exhibit discriminatory ranking behaviors based on users' sensitive attributes (\\eg gender). Worse still, in this paper, we identify a subtler form of discrimination in LLMs, termed \\textit{implicit ranking unfairness}, where LLMs exhibit discriminatory ranking patterns based solely on non-sensitive user profiles, such as user names. Such implicit unfairness is more widespread but less noticeable, threatening the ethical foundation. To comprehensively explore such unfairness, our analysis will focus on three research aspects: (1) We propose an evaluation method to investigate the severity of implicit ranking unfairness. (2) We uncover the reasons for causing such unfairness. (3) To mitigate such unfairness effectively, we utilize a pair-wise regression method to conduct fair-aware data augmentation for LLM fine-tuning. The experiment demonstrates that our method outperforms the existing methods regarding ranking fairness. Lastly, we emphasize the need for the community to identify and mitigate the implicit unfairness, aiming to avert the potential deterioration in the reinforced human-LLMs ecosystem deterioration",

This leaves backward reasoning, the inference that leads to the causal hypothesis, unexplored. In this paper, we take the reverse perspective by analyzing the backward reasoning abilities of LLMs by exploring their ability to seek a hypothesis that best fits or explains a set of observations. In particular, we contextualize the hypothesis and observations in Question-answering (QA) tasks. Therefore, by proposing the Hiding and the Blanking approaches that strategically revise the input-problem instances, we analyze whether the LLMs are able to reason about the conclusions and deliver the original question that leads to the final answers.

This survey bridges that gap and provides a comprehensive overview of the recent progress, limitations and open challenges in keyphrase generation. Our analysis of over 40 research papers reveals interesting new insights, such as that 1) commonly-used datasets are so similar that there is no practical benefit in using them together for evaluation, or that 2) the performance of many models was significantly overestimated due to the application of normalization procedures in ground truth.

This framework is designed to adaptively transfer knowledge from the server's LLM to clients' SLMs while concurrently enriching the LLM with clients' unique domain insights.

    "abstract": "The effectiveness of large-scale language modeling (LLM) in generating data samples has been widely proven, especially in question answering and textual entailment tasks. However, these tasks are primarily concerned with surface semantics and usually require the model to learn only information about lexical and syntactic structures. In contrast, generating metaphorical samples requires LLMs to develop a deeper understanding of the implicit meanings in the text. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to explore the ability of ChatGPT to generate metaphorical samples. First, we propose two prompt enhancement methods based on definitions and multiple word meanings. The former introduces a metaphor definition, and the latter requires LLM to generate the corresponding metaphorical or literal sample content based on each word sense. Experimental results show that the SPE method performs slightly lower than manually labeled samples in terms of fine-tuning performance (3.5\\% lower than the average F1 value for the three metaphorical datasets), but at 1/250th the cost of the latter. Since most of work focuses on zero- or few-shot methods, we use it as a baseline. We provide an in-depth discussion of the differences between the four sample generation methods mentioned above through manual evaluation, automated evaluation, and example analysis. To enhance the reliability of the study, we introduce ChatGPT, LLaMA3, and Mixtral to further explore the differences in generating implicit semantic content across LLMs",

However, current LVLMs suffer from misalignment between text and image modalities which causes three kinds of hallucination problems, i.e., object existence, object attribute, and object relationship. To tackle this issue, existing methods mainly utilize Reinforcement Learning (RL) to align modalities in LVLMs. However, they still suffer from three main limitations: (1) General feedback can not indicate the hallucination type contained in the response; (2) Sparse rewards only give the sequence-level reward for the whole response; and (3)Annotation cost is time-consuming and labor-intensive.

Using fine-tuned language embeddings from transformer models, we leverage the random assignment of individual judges to three-judge panels, and of those panels to cases, to causally estimate how discussion of legal topics on U.S. appellate courts differs across partisan environments. We show that while Democratic judges write more dispersed opinions, judges of both parties agree on average about the important topics in each legal case. Further, we demonstrate that mandatory bipartisanship does not reduce the range of topics considered. Judicial partisanship is thus driven by disagreements within legal issues rather than disputes about which issues apply.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "The considerable size of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents notable deployment challenges, particularly on resource-constrained hardware. Structured pruning, offers an effective means to compress LLMs, thereby reducing storage costs and enhancing inference speed for more efficient utilization. In this work, we study data-efficient and resource-efficient structure pruning methods to obtain smaller yet still powerful models. Knowledge Distillation is well-suited for pruning, as the intact model can serve as an excellent teacher for pruned students. However, it becomes challenging in the context of LLMs due to memory constraints. To address this, we propose an efficient progressive Numerous-teacher pruning method (NutePrune). NutePrune mitigates excessive memory costs by loading only one intact model and integrating it with various masks and LoRA modules, enabling it to seamlessly switch between teacher and student roles. This approach allows us to leverage numerous teachers with varying capacities to progressively guide the pruned model, enhancing overall performance. Extensive experiments across various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of NutePrune. In LLaMA-7B zero-shot experiments, NutePrune retains 97.17% of the performance of the original model at 20% sparsity and 95.07% at 25% sparsity",

    "abstract": "Knowledge Tracing (KT) is a critical task in online learning for modeling student knowledge over time. Despite the success of deep learning-based KT models, which rely on sequences of numbers as data, most existing approaches fail to leverage the rich semantic information in the text of questions and concepts. This paper proposes Language model-based Knowledge Tracing (LKT), a novel framework that integrates pre-trained language models (PLMs) with KT methods. By leveraging the power of language models to capture semantic representations, LKT effectively incorporates textual information and significantly outperforms previous KT models on large benchmark datasets. Moreover, we demonstrate that LKT can effectively address the cold-start problem in KT by leveraging the semantic knowledge captured by PLMs. Interpretability of LKT is enhanced compared to traditional KT models due to its use of text-rich data. We conducted the local interpretable model-agnostic explanation technique and analysis of attention scores to interpret the model performance further. Our work highlights the potential of integrating PLMs with KT and paves the way for future research in KT domain",

    "abstract": "The field of emotion recognition of conversation (ERC) has been focusing on separating sentence feature encoding and context modeling, lacking exploration in generative paradigms based on unified designs. In this study, we propose a novel approach, InstructERC, to reformulate the ERC task from a discriminative framework to a generative framework based on Large Language Models (LLMs). InstructERC makes three significant contributions: (1) it introduces a simple yet effective retrieval template module, which helps the model explicitly integrate multi-granularity dialogue supervision information. (2) We introduce two additional emotion alignment tasks, namely speaker identification and emotion prediction tasks, to implicitly model the dialogue role relationships and future emotional tendencies in conversations. (3) Pioneeringly, we unify emotion labels across benchmarks through the feeling wheel to fit real application scenarios. InstructERC still performs impressively on this unified dataset. Our LLM-based plugin framework significantly outperforms all previous models and achieves comprehensive SOTA on three commonly used ERC datasets.

We curate a dataset referring to the revised Bloom's Taxonomy and conduct thousands of evaluations.

However, there is yet to be a quantitative evaluation of the extent of such adaptation. To bridge this gap, we collect a benchmarking dataset, Situation-Based Explanation. This dataset contains 100 explanandums. Each explanandum is paired with explanations targeted at three distinct audience types-such as educators, students, and professionals-enabling us to assess how well the explanations meet the specific informational needs and contexts of these diverse groups e.g. students, teachers, and parents. For each \"explanandum paired with an audience\" situation, we include a human-written explanation. These allow us to compute scores that quantify how the LLMs adapt the explanations to the situations. On an array of pretrained language models with varying sizes, we examine three categories of prompting methods: rule-based prompting, meta-prompting, and in-context learning prompting. We find that 1) language models can generate prompts that result in explanations more precisely aligned with the target situations, 2) explicitly modeling an \"assistant\" persona by prompting \"You are a helpful assistant...\" is not a necessary prompt technique for situated NLE tasks, and 3) the in-context learning prompts only can help LLMs learn the demonstration template but can't improve their inference performance.

This paper formalize an existing problem in NLP research: benchmarking when some systems scores are missing on the task, and proposes a novel approach to address it. Our method utilizes a compatible partial ranking approach to impute missing data, which is then aggregated using the Borda count method. It includes two refinements designed specifically for scenarios where either task-level or instance-level scores are available. We also introduce an extended benchmark, which contains over 131 million scores, an order of magnitude larger than existing benchmarks.

To give a universal solution, we propose the graph neural network based on pre-trained semantic interaction called PaSIG. Firstly, we construct a text-word heterogeneity graph and design an asymmetric structure to ensure one-way message passing from words to the test texts. Meanwhile, we use the context representation capability of the pre-trained language model to construct node features that contain classification semantic information. Afterward, we explore the adaptation methods of PaSIG with different GNN components.

These constraints pose challenges for researchers engaged in STS tasks that require nuanced similarity levels or those with limited computational resources, compelling them to explore alternatives like Sentence-BERT. Nonetheless, Sentence-BERT tackles STS tasks from a classification perspective, overlooking the progressive nature of semantic relationships, which results in suboptimal performance.

To address this issue, we propose Efficient Mixture of Low-Rank Adaptation (EM-LoRA), a novel LoRA variant. EM-LoRA differs from previous MOE-style LoRA methods by considering each LoRA module as an expert and employing a prompt-aware routing mechanism. This mechanism calculates expert routing results once before generating the first new token and reuses these results for subsequent tokens, reducing latency. Extensive experiments and analysis on commonsense reasoning tasks, math reasoning tasks, and widely used LLM evaluation benchmarks demonstrate that EM-LoRA consistently outperforms strong PEFT baselines with comparable tunable parameter budgets. Additionally, EM-LoRA significantly reduces latency in multi-tenant settings compared to previous LoRA-based methods.\\footnote{Codes and fine-tuned models will be open-sourced to facilitate future research. }",

These systems incorporate 'special tokens' in their vocabulary, such as $\\texttt{<|endoftext|>}$, to guide their language generation process.

We propose a simple yet effective method to learn a universal acoustic realization of Whisper's $\\texttt{<|endoftext|>}$ token, which, when prepended to any speech signal, encourages the model to ignore the speech and only transcribe the special token, effectively 'muting' the model. Our experiments demonstrate that the same, universal 0.64-second adversarial audio segment can successfully mute a target Whisper ASR model for over 97\\% of speech samples. Moreover, we find that this universal adversarial audio segment often transfers to new datasets and tasks. Overall this work demonstrates the vulnerability of Whisper models to `muting' adversarial attacks, where such attacks can pose both risks and potential benefits in real-world settings: for example the attack can be used to bypass speech moderation systems, or conversely the attack can also be used to protect private speech data",

    "abstract": "Speculative decoding (SD) has attracted a significant amount of research attention due to the substantial speedup it can achieve for LLM inference. However, speculative decoding methods often achieve optimal performance on high-end devices or with a substantial GPU memory overhead. Given limited memory and the necessity of quantization, a high-performing SD model on a high-end GPU can slow down by up to 7 times. To this end, we propose Skippy Simultaneous Speculative Decoding (or S3D), a cost-effective self-speculative SD method based on simultaneous multi-token decoding and mid-layer skipping. When compared against recent effective open-source SD systems, our method has achieved one of the top performance-memory ratios while requiring minimal architecture changes and training data. Leveraging our memory efficiency, we created a smaller yet more effective SD model based on Phi-3. It is 1.4 to 2 times faster than the quantized EAGLE model and operates in half-precision while using less VRAM",

    "abstract": "Model editing aims to correct outdated or erroneous knowledge in large language models (LLMs) without the need for costly retraining. Lifelong model editing is the most challenging task that caters to the continuous editing requirements of LLMs. Prior works primarily focus on single or batch editing; nevertheless, these methods fall short in lifelong editing scenarios due to catastrophic knowledge forgetting and the degradation of model performance. Although retrieval-based methods alleviate these issues, they are impeded by slow and cumbersome processes of integrating the retrieved knowledge into the model. In this work, we introduce RECIPE, a RetriEval-augmented ContInuous Prompt lEarning method, to boost editing efficacy and inference efficiency in lifelong learning. RECIPE first converts knowledge statements into short and informative continuous prompts, prefixed to the LLM's input query embedding, to efficiently refine the response grounded on the knowledge. It further integrates the Knowledge Sentinel (KS) that acts as an intermediary to calculate a dynamic threshold, determining whether the retrieval repository contains relevant knowledge. Our retriever and prompt encoder are jointly trained to achieve editing properties, i.e., reliability, generality, and locality. In our experiments, RECIPE is assessed extensively across multiple LLMs and editing datasets, where it achieves superior editing performance. RECIPE also demonstrates its capability to maintain the overall performance of LLMs alongside showcasing fast editing and inference speed",

To address these challenges, we categorize four available fact sources: human-written evidence, reference documents, search engine results, and LLM knowledge, along with five text generation tasks containing six representative datasets. Then, we propose UFO, an LLM-based unified and flexible evaluation framework to verify facts against plug-and-play fact sources. We implement six evaluation scenarios based on this framework. Experimental results show that human-written evidence and reference documents are crucial in most QA tasks, but in the news fact generation tasks, introducing human-written evidence leads to a decline in the discriminative power of evaluation.

    "abstract": "Human conversation is usually conducted with language, speech, and visual information. Each communication medium contains rich information and complementary to others, for example, speech (para-lingual) may contain vibe that is not well represented in language. %response is made from conversational history which contains a vibe there. Multimodal LLM consider multimodal information and aim to generate text responses. However, generating more natural and engaging speech response has received little attention even though response only with text cannot give a rich conversation experience. In this paper, we suggest a more human-like agent that makes a speech response based on the conversation mood and responsive style information. Our model is trained to generate text responses along with voice descriptions from multimodal conversation environment. With the voice description, the model generates speech covering para-lingual information. To achieve this goal, we first build a novel multi-sensory conversation dataset mainly focused on speech to enable conversational agents to generate natural speech communication. Then we propose our multimodal LLM based model for generating both text response and voice description. In experimental results, our model demonstrates the effectiveness of utilizing both visual and audio modalities in conversation and generating lively speech",

    "abstract": "In the era of Large Language Models (LLMs), generative linguistic steganography has become a prevalent technique for hiding information within model-generated texts. However, traditional steganography methods struggle to effectively align steganographic texts with original model-generated texts due to the lower entropy of the predicted probability distribution of LLMs. This results in a decrease in embedding capacity and poses challenges for decoding stegos in real-world communication channels. To address these challenges, we propose a semantic steganography framework based on LLMs, which constructs a semantic space and maps secret messages onto this space using ontology-entity trees. This framework offers robustness and reliability for transmission in complex channels, as well as resistance to text rendering and word blocking. Additionally, the stegos generated by our framework are indistinguishable from the covers and achieve a higher embedding capacity compared to state-of-the-art steganography methods, while producing higher quality stegos",

However, their performance can be inconsistent when tasked with producing text that adheres to specific structured formats, which is crucial in applications like named entity recognition (NER) or relation extraction (RE). To address this issue, this paper introduces an efficient method, G&O, to enhance their structured text generation capabilities. It breaks the generation into a two-step pipeline: initially, LLMs generate answers in natural language as intermediate responses. Subsequently, LLMs are asked to organize the output into the desired structure, using the intermediate responses as context. G&O effectively separates the generation of content from the structuring process, reducing the pressure of completing two orthogonal tasks simultaneously. Tested on zero-shot NER and RE, the results indicate a significant improvement in LLM performance with minimal additional efforts. This straightforward and adaptable prompting technique can also be combined with other strategies, like self-consistency, to further elevate LLM capabilities in various structured text generation tasks",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) fine-tuned with alignment methods, such as reinforcement learning from human feedback, have been used to develop some of the most capable AI systems to date. Despite their success, existing methods typically rely on simple binary labels, such as those indicating preferred outputs in pairwise preferences. This overlooks the varying relative quality between pairs, preventing models from capturing these subtleties. To address this limitation, we consider settings in which this information (i.e., margin) can be derived and propose a straightforward generalization of common optimization objectives used in alignment methods. The approach, which we call Margin Matching Preference Optimization (MMPO), integrates per-feedback margin to enhance optimization, making it more robust to overfitting and resulting in better LLM policies and reward models. Specifically, given quality margins in pairwise preferences, we design soft target probabilities based on the Bradley-Terry model, which are then used to train models with the standard cross-entropy objective. Our experiments with both human and AI feedback data demonstrate that MMPO can outperform baseline methods, often by a substantial margin, on popular benchmarks, including MT-bench and RewardBench. Notably, the 7B model trained with MMPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on RewardBench compared to competing models at the same scale, as of June 2024. Our analysis further demonstrates that MMPO is more robust to overfitting, leading to better-calibrated models",

Given that most KGs reside in graph databases accessible solely through specialized query languages (e.g., Cypher), there exists a critical need to bridge the divide between LLMs and KG databases by automating the translation of natural language into Cypher queries (commonly termed the \"Text2Cypher\" task). Prior efforts tried to bolster LLMs' proficiency in Cypher generation through Supervised Fine-Tuning. However, these explorations are hindered by the lack of annotated datasets of Query-Cypher pairs, resulting from the labor-intensive and domain-specific nature of annotating such datasets.

This data is then used for model training. Experimental results show that our proposed method significantly improves model performance compared to directly using a smaller-scale language model to generate data.

While self-consistency has indeed led to the improvements in LLM inference, the use of multi-path inference also escalates deployment costs. Therefore, maintaining the performance benefits of self-consistency inherited from multi-path inference while reducing the inference costs holds significant value. In this research, we conceptualize language decoding as a preference consensus game, constructing a bi-player gaming system within each local path, and introduce Nash Chain-of-Thought (Nash CoT). Specifically, for a given question, we leverage LLM to autonomously select the contextually relevant template and generate outputs guided by this template, aiming to reach Nash Equilibrium alongside normal generation in each path.

First, using a published corpus of 4,724 English text excerpts, we find that readability estimates produced \"zero-shot\" from GPT-4 Turbo exhibit relatively high correlation with human judgments ($r = 0.76$), out-performing estimates derived from traditional readability formulas. Then, in a pre-registered human experiment ($N = 59$), we ask whether Turbo can reliably make text easier or harder to read. We find evidence to support this hypothesis, though considerable variance in human judgments remains unexplained. We conclude by discussing the limitations of this approach, including concerns about data contamination, as well as the validity of the \"readability\" construct and its dependence on context, audience, and goal",

    "title": "Evaluating Creativity in Large Language Models through Creative Problem-Solving: A New Dataset and Benchmark",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Creative problem-solving, integrating divergent and convergent thinking, is pivotal for leveraging creativity in fields such as AI4Science. As large language models (LLMs) evolve into sophisticated creative assistants, it becomes crucial to effectively assess their problem-solving abilities. Traditional benchmarks, often rooted in cognitive science, focus on a single phase or do not distinguish between the divergent and convergent phases, limiting their ability to fully evaluate LLMs. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark comprising an open-ended question answering (QA) dataset alongside traditional creativity tasks, aimed at evaluating the holistic creative capabilities of LLMs. This benchmark utilizes multi-dimensional evaluation metrics to provide a comprehensive assessment that correlates with model parameters, architectural differences, and domain-specific expertise. The benchmark aims to not only advance understanding in the field but also set a new standard for evaluating the creative problem-solving potential of LLMs. The dataset and code are available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLM-creativity-Benchmark/",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "The great success of large language models has encouraged the development of large multimodal models, with a focus on image-language interaction. Despite promising results in various image-language downstream tasks, it is still challenging and unclear how to extend the capabilities of these models to the more complex video domain, especially when dealing with explicit temporal signals. To address the problem in existing large multimodal models, in this paper we adopt visual instruction tuning to build a unified causal video-oriented language modeling framework, named UNICORN. Specifically, we collect a comprehensive dataset under the instruction-following format, and instruction-tune the model accordingly. Experimental results demonstrate that without customized training objectives and intensive pre-training, UNICORN can achieve comparable or better performance on established temporal video-language tasks including moment retrieval, video paragraph captioning and dense video captioning. Moreover, the instruction-tuned model can be used to automatically annotate internet videos with temporally-aligned captions. Compared to commonly used ASR captions, we show that training on our generated captions improves the performance of video-language models on both zero-shot and fine-tuning settings. Source code can be found at [here](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/UNICORN) and we will release it upon acceptance",

This decomposed reward model is then used as part of the RLHF pipeline to improve an LLM-based dialog agent.

In this era of open-ended language modeling, where task boundaries are gradually fading, an urgent question emerges: have we made significant progress in text classification with the full benefit of LLMs? To answer this question, we propose RGPT, an adaptive boosting framework tailored to produce a specialized text classification LLM by recurrently ensembling a pool of base learners. The base learners are constructed by adaptively adjusting the distribution of training samples and iteratively fine-tuning LLMs with them. Such base learners are then ensembled to be a specialized text classification LLM, by recurrently incorporating the historical predictions from the previous learners. Through a comprehensive empirical comparison, we show that RGPT significantly outperforms 8 SOTA PLMs and 7 SOTA LLMs on four benchmarks by 4.03\\% on average.

To mitigate these problems, we propose ConAgents, a Cooperative and interactive Agents framework, which coordinates three specialized agents for tool selection, tool execution, and action calibration separately. ConAgents introduces two communication protocols to enable the flexible cooperation of agents. To effectively generalize the ConAgents into open-source models, we also propose specialized action distillation, enhancing their ability to perform specialized actions in our framework.

To address these issues, we propose Dynamic Hierarchical Outlining with Memory-Enhancement long-form story generation method, named DOME, to generate the long-form story with coherent content and plot. Specifically, the Dynamic Hierarchical Outline (DHO) mechanism incorporates the novel writing theory into outline planning and fuses the plan and writing stages together, improving the coherence of the plot by ensuring the plot completeness and fluency of story development. Additionally, a Memory-Enhancement Module (MEM) based on temporal knowledge graphs is introduced to store and access generated content, reducing contextual conflicts and improving story coherence. Finally, we propose a Temporal Conflict Analyzer leveraging temporal knowledge graphs to evaluate contextual consistency.

Traditional fine-tuning methods often improve compositional reasoning at the expense of multi-modal capabilities. This drawback stems from the use of global hard negative loss, which contrasts the global representations of images and texts. This can distort multi-modal representations by pushing original texts due to ambiguous global representations. To address this, we propose the Fine-grained Selective Calibrated CLIP (FSC-CLIP). This incorporates local hard negative loss and selective calibrated regularization, designed to provide fine-grained negative supervision while maintaining the integrity of representations. Our extensive evaluation across various benchmarks for compositionality and multi-modal tasks shows that FSC-CLIP not only achieves compositionality on par with state-of-the-art models but also maintains multi-modal capabilities",

In this work, we propose CoT-Influx, a novel approach that pushes the boundary of few-shot Chain-of-Thoughts (CoT) learning to improve LLM mathematical reasoning. Motivated by the observation that adding more concise CoT examples in the prompt can improve LLM reasoning performance, CoT-Influx employs a coarse-to-fine pruner to maximize the input of effective and concise CoT examples. The pruner first selects as many crucial CoT examples as possible and then prunes unimportant tokens to fit the context window. As a result, by enabling more CoT examples with double the context window size in tokens, CoT-Influx significantly outperforms various prompting baselines across various LLMs (LLaMA2-7B, 13B, 70B) and 5 math datasets, achieving up to 4.55% absolute improvements. Remarkably, without any fine-tuning, LLaMA2-70B with CoT-Influx surpasses GPT-3.5 and a wide range of larger LLMs (PaLM, Minerva 540B, etc.) on the GSM8K. CoT-Influx is a plug-and-play module for LLMs, adaptable in various scenarios.

In this paper, we assess the instruction quality from a unique perspective termed Writing Manner, which encompasses the selection of vocabulary, grammar, and sentence structure to convey specific semantics. We argue there exists a substantial writing manner gap between the visual instructions and the inner Large Language Models (LLMs) of LMMs. This gap causes the well-trained inner LLMs to deviate from their original writing styles, leading to capability degradation of both LMMs and inner LLMs. To bridge the writing manner gap while preserving the original semantics, we propose directly leveraging the inner LLM to align the writing manner of soft-format visual instructions with that of the inner LLM itself, resulting in novel LLM-aligned instructions. We develop a novel perplexity-based indicator to quantitatively assess the writing manner gap, and corresponding results show that our approach successfully minimizes this gap.

Furthermore, we observe that the prediction shift from \"foo\" to \"bar\" is due to the respective reduction and increase in these heads' attention scores at \"foo\" and \"bar\" positions. Therefore, we propose a hypothesis for ICL: in in-context heads, the value-output matrices extract label features, while the query-key matrices compute the similarity between the features at the last position and those at each label position. The query and key matrices can be considered as two towers that learn the similarity metric between the last position's features and each demonstration at label positions.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Recent work targeting large language models (LLMs) for code generation demonstrated that increasing the amount of training data through synthetic code generation often leads to exceptional performance. In this paper we explore data pruning methods aimed at enhancing the efficiency of model training specifically for code LLMs. We present techniques that integrate various clustering and pruning metrics to selectively reduce training data without compromising the accuracy and functionality of the generated code. We observe significant redundancies in synthetic training data generation, where our experiments demonstrate that benchmark performance can be largely preserved by training on only 10\\% of the data. Moreover, we observe consistent improvements in benchmark results through moderate pruning of the training data. Our experiments show that these pruning strategies not only reduce the computational resources needed but also enhance the overall quality code generation",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Stickers are increasingly used in social media to express sentiment and intent. When finding typing troublesome, people often use a sticker instead. Despite the significant impact of stickers on sentiment analysis and intent recognition, little research has been conducted. To address this gap, we propose a new task: Multimodal chat Sentiment Analysis and Intent Recognition involving Stickers (MSAIRS). Additionally, we introduce a novel multimodal dataset containing Chinese chat records and stickers excerpted from several mainstream social media platforms. Our dataset includes paired data with the same text but different stickers, and various stickers consisting of the same images with different texts, allowing us to better understand the impact of stickers on chat sentiment and intent. We also propose an effective multimodal joint model, MMSAIR, for our task, which is validated on our datasets and indicates that visual information of stickers counts. Our dataset and code will be publicly available",

    "title": "BMIL: Self and Cooperative Bias Mitigation in-the-loop in Large Language Models",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) has demonstrated their superior abilities in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, they have also revealed a tendency to learn and unintentionally magnify harmful societal biases. Current bias mitigation methods during the pre-processing and training stages still leave considerable methodological challenges. We propose a novel multi-stage bias mitigation approach called 'Bias Mitigation in-the-loop' (BMIL), which consists of two main strategies: self bias mitigation in-the-loop and cooperative bias mitigation in-the-loop. The first strategy enables LLMs to autonomously assess and reduce their biases, while the second involves collaboration among multiple LLMs with varying bias levels to collectively tackle and reduce various biases through a debate process. Furthermore, we apply these strategies in supervised fine-tuning sessions to alleviate inherent biases in LLMs. Our experiments, involving models like ChatGPT, Gemini, Llama2, Llama3, and Mistral, demonstrate that BMIL effectively mitigates a broad spectrum of biases, significantly improving the quality of model outputs",

    "abstract": "Implicit user feedback, user emotions and demographic information have shown to be promising sources for improving the accuracy and user engagement of responses generated by dialogue systems. However, the influence of such information on task completion and factual consistency, which are important criteria for task-oriented and document-grounded dialogues, is not yet known. To address this, we introduce FEDI, the first English task-oriented document-grounded dialogue dataset annotated with this information. Our experiments with Flan-T5, GPT-2 and Llama 2 show a particularly positive impact on task completion and factual consistency. Participants in our human evaluation reported that the responses generated by the feedback-trained models were more informative (Flan-T5 and GPT-2), more relevant and more factual consistent (Llama 2)",

    "abstract": "Our study aims to identify behavior patterns in cultural values exhibited by large language models (LLMs). The studied variants include question ordering, prompting language, and model size. Our experiments reveal that each tested LLM can efficiently behave with different cultural values. More interestingly: (i) LLMs exhibit relatively consistent cultural values when presented with prompts in a single language. (ii) The prompting language e.g., Chinese or English, can influence the expression of cultural values. The same question can elicit divergent cultural values when the same LLM is queried in a different language. (iii) Differences in sizes of the same model (e.g., Llama2-7B vs 13B vs 70B) have a more significant impact on their demonstrated cultural values than model differences (e.g., Llama2 vs Mixtral). Our experiments reveal that query language and model size of LLM are the main factors resulting in cultural value differences",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "In the modern interconnected landscape, the proliferation of smart devices leads to the continuous collection of extensive and varied personal multi-modal data. This situation necessitates the development of sophisticated, personalized, and device-aware services. Traditional AI systems, mainly cloud-based, face considerable hurdles in adapting to the dynamic data flow between cloud services and devices. While HyperNetworks have enhanced performance and real-time processing over conventional fine-tuning approaches, they tend to be over-parameterized due to the underutilization of consistent data types. Our solution, StableSynthNet, is a novel system consisting of three components: Driver Contrastive Training, Template-Driver Extraction, and Offset-Driver Separation. This design uniquely separates the template parameter driver, which houses common data characteristics, from the offset parameter driver, where individual data specifics are stored. The resulting combined driver achieves an optimal mix of consistency and adaptability. Our extensive testing in the fields of video question answering and video retrieval has demonstrated the superior efficiency and effectiveness of StableSynthNet",

    "title": "Efficient LLM Comparative Assessment: A Product of Experts Framework for Pairwise Comparisons",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "LLM-as-a-judge approaches are a practical and effective way of assessing a range of text tasks. However, when using pairwise comparisons to rank a set of candidates, the computational cost scales quadratically with the number of candidates, which has practical limitations. This paper introduces a Product of Expert (PoE) framework for efficient LLM Comparative Assessment. Here individual comparisons are considered experts that provide information on a pair's score difference. The PoE framework combines the information from these experts to yield an expression that can be maximized with respect to the underlying set of candidates, and is highly flexible where any form of expert can be assumed. When Gaussian experts are used one can derive simple closed-form solutions for the optimal candidate ranking, as well as expressions for selecting which comparisons should be made to maximize the probability of this ranking. Our approach enables efficient comparative assessment, where by using only a small subset of the possible comparisons, one can generate score predictions that correlate well with human judgements. We evaluate the approach on multiple NLG tasks and demonstrate that our framework can yield considerable computational savings when performing pairwise comparative assessment. With many candidate texts, using as few as 2% of comparisons the PoE solution can achieve similar performance to when all comparisons are used",
