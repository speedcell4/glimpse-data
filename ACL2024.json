    "title": "Can Large Multimodal Models Uncover Deep Semantics Behind Images?",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Understanding the deep semantics of images is essential in the era dominated by social media. However, current research works primarily on the superficial description of images, revealing a notable deficiency in the systematic investigation of the inherent deep semantics. In this work, we introduce DEEPEVAL, a comprehensive benchmark to assess Large Multimodal Models' (LMMs) capacities of visual deep semantics. DEEPEVAL includes human-annotated dataset and three progressive subtasks: fine-grained description selection, in-depth title matching, and deep semantics understanding. Utilizing DEEPEVAL, we evaluate 9 open-source LMMs and GPT-4V(ision). Our evaluation demonstrates a substantial gap between the deep semantic comprehension capabilities of existing LMMs and humans. For example, GPT-4V is 30% behind humans in understanding deep semantics, even though it achieves human-comparable performance in image description. Further analysis reveals that LMM performance on DEEPEVAL varies according to the specific facets of deep semantics explored, indicating the fundamental challenges remaining in developing LMMs",

    "title": "Expanding Horizons in Short Text Analysis: Integrating LLMs and VAEs for Enhanced Topic Modeling",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Topic models are one of the compelling methods for discovering latent semantics in a document collection. However, it assumes that a document has sufficient co-occurrence information to be effective. However, in short texts, co-occurrence information is minimal, which results in feature sparsity in document representation. Therefore, existing topic models (probabilistic or neural) mostly fail to mine patterns from them to generate coherent topics. In this paper, we take a new approach to short-text topic modeling to address the data-sparsity issue by extending short text into longer sequences using large language models (LLMs) and decoding topics using a variational autoencoder (VAE). We observe that our model can substantially improve the performance of short-text topic modeling. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets under extreme data sparsity scenarios show that our models can generate high-quality topics that outperform state-of-the-art models",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Transformer Architecture Search (TAS) methods aim at automates searching the optimal Transformer architecture configurations for a given task. However, they are impeded by the prohibitive cost of evaluating Transformer architectures. Recently, several Zero-Shot TAS methods have been proposed to mitigate this problem by utilizing zero-cost proxies for evaluating Transformer architectures without training. Unfortunately, they are limited to specific tasks and lack theoretical guarantees. To solve this problem, we develop a new zero-cost proxy called NTSR that combines two theoretically-inspired indicators to measure the trainability and expressivity of Transformer networks separately. We then integrate it into an effective regularized evolution framework called ETAS demonstrate its efficacy on various tasks. The results show that our proposed NTSR proxy can consistently achieve a higher correlation with the true performance of Transformer networks on both computer vision and natural language processing tasks. Further, it can significantly accelerate the search process for finding the best-performing Transformer network architecture configurations",

    "abstract": "Despite the recent successes of large, pretrained neural language models (LLMs), little is known about the representations of linguistic structure they learn during pretraining, leading to unexpected behavior in response to small changes in inputs or application contexts. To better understand these models and behaviors, we propose a general analysis framework to move beyond traditional performance-based evaluation of LLMs and instead analyze them on the basis of their internal representations. Our framework, CALM (Competence-based Analysis of Language Models), is designed to study and measure the linguistic competence of LLMs in the context of specific tasks by intervening on models' internal representations of different linguistic properties using causal probing, and evaluating models' alignment under these interventions with a given ground-truth causal model of the task. We also develop a novel approach for performing causal probing interventions using gradient-based adversarial attacks, which can target a broader range of properties and representations than existing techniques. Finally, we carry out a case study of CALM using these interventions to analyze BERT and RoBERTa's competence across a variety of lexical inference tasks, showing that CALM can be used to explain and predict their behavior across these tasks",

    "abstract": "Interactive fiction games have emerged as an important application to improve the generalization capabilities of language-based reinforcement learning (RL) agents. Existing environments for interactive fiction games are domain-specific or time-consuming to generate and do not train the RL agents to master a specific set of skills. In this work, we introduce an interactive environment for self-supervised RL, \\textit{STARLING}, for text-based games that bootstraps the text-based RL agents with automatically generated games (based on the seed set of game ideas) to boost the performance and generalization capabilities to reach a goal of the target environment. These games let the agent hone their skills on a predefined set of tasks. We create and test an environment with $100$ games, generated using this automated framework that uses large language models (GPT3) and an interactive fiction game engine (based on Inform7) to provide the user with the ability to generate more games under minimal human supervision. Experimental results based on both the human participants and baseline text-based RL agents reveal that current state-of-the-art text-based RL agents cannot use previously learned skills in new situations at the level humans can. These results enforce STARLING's potential to serve as a sandbox environment for further research in self-supervised text-based RL",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Text watermarking has emerged as an important technique for detecting machine-generated text. However, existing methods generally use arbitrary vocabulary partitioning during decoding, which results in the absence of appropriate words during the response generation and disrupts the language model's expressiveness, thus severely degrading the quality of text response. To address these issues, we introduce a novel approach, Watermarking with Mutual Exclusion (WatME). Specifically, by leveraging linguistic prior knowledge of inherent lexical redundancy, WatME can dynamically optimize the use of available vocabulary during the decoding process of language models. It employs a mutually exclusive rule to manage this redundancy, avoiding situations where appropriate words are unavailable and maintaining the expressive power of large language models (LLMs). We present theoretical analysis and empirical evidence demonstrating that WatME substantially preserves the text generation ability of LLMs while maintaining watermark detectability. Specifically, we investigate watermarking's impact on the emergent abilities of LLMs, including knowledge recall and logical reasoning. Our comprehensive experiments confirm that WatME consistently outperforms existing methods in retaining these crucial capabilities of LLMs. Our code will be released to facilitate future research",

We identify the limitations of current methods that prioritize semantic similarity and underscore the importance of syntactic information, which has been underrepresented in sentence-level classification tasks. Through experiments measuring semantic and syntactic similarities, we reveal that ICL methods tend to favor syntactic congruence. Consequently, we propose a novel Semantics and Syntax-based Sentence Selection (SSSS) framework for selecting demonstration examples in ICL, integrating both semantic and syntactic dimensions. This approach addresses the challenges of constructing accurate semantic representations and quantifying syntactic structure similarities. The experimental results on three datasets suggest that the SSSS approach can facilitate more effective ICL by incorporating syntax into the demonstrative example selection, potentially leading to enhanced model performance",

In this paper, we assess the effectiveness of news embeddings from ChatGPT for detecting fake news and showcase that despite their initial performance slightly surpassing the pre-trained BERT model, they still lag behind the state-of-the-arts. This shortfall is attributed to the reliance on tokenized training text, which misses the complex narratives and subtleties that are crucial for identifying fake news. To capture these nuances, we probe the high-level semantic relations among the news pieces, real entities, and topics, which are modeled as a heterogeneous graph with nodes denoting different items and the relations are represented as edges.

Second, our framework can be used as a fast and effective additional tool for robustness evaluation since it (a) saves 30x-193x runtime compared to the traditional technique, (b) is transferable across models, (c) can be used under adversarial training, and (d) robust to statistical randomness.

Our evaluations show that DCD significantly improves LLM performance across various reasoning benchmarks, outperforming existing methods and achieving state-of-the-art results in both GSM8K and StrategyQA",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Due to the continuous emergence of online data, version iteration has become an indispensable requirement for Large Language Models (LLMs), which exacerbates the training cost of LLMs. Hence, one of the pivotal challenges for LLMs is how to reduce the total training cost across different versions. To achieve a better balance between the pre-training performance and training cost, we conduct a systematic investigation into the impact of various learning rate schedules. Extensive experiments on commonly used learning rate schedules show that these approaches primarily focus on the performance of LLMs of the current version, but overlook the mutual influence of training processes of LLMs across different versions. To address the above issue, we design a pre-training strategy called Branches Switching based Pre-Training for the training of LLMs across different versions. Compared with pre-training LLMs of different versions from scratch, our strategy reduces the total training cost to 58\\% while maintaining optimal pre-training performance",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Though advanced in understanding visual information with human languages, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) still suffer from multimodal hallucinations. A natural concern is that during multimodal interaction, the generated hallucinations could influence the LVLMs' subsequent generation. Thus, we raise a question: $\\textit{When presented with a query relevant to the previously generated hallucination, will LVLMs be misled and respond incorrectly, even though the ground visual information exists?}$ To answer this, we propose a framework to evaluate LVLMs' behaviors when encountering generated hallucinations, where LVLMs are required to answer specific visual questions with a curated hallucinatory conversation. Crucially, our experiment shows that the performance of LVLMs drops by $31\\%$ at least, indicating that LVLMs are prone to accept the generated hallucinations and make false claims that they would have not supported without distractions, which we term as $\\textit{Multimodal Hallucination Snowballing}$. To mitigate this issue, we further propose a training-free method called $\\textit{Residual Visual Decoding},$ where we revise the output distribution of LVLMs that are derived from the residual visual input, which provides models with direct access to the visual information. Experiments show that our method can mitigate more than $24%$ of the snowballed multimodal hallucination while maintaining capabilities",

    "abstract": "Language models have become the backbone of today's AI systems. However, their predominant left-to-right (L2R) generation limits the use of bidirectional context, which is essential for tasks that involve filling text in the middle. We propose the Fill-in Language Model (FiLM) that allows for flexible generation at any position without adhering to a specific generation order. Its training extends the masked language modeling objective by adopting varying mask probabilities sampled from the Beta distribution to enhance the generative capabilities.During inference, FiLM can seamlessly insert missing phrases, sentences, or paragraphs, ensuring that the outputs are fluent and are coherent with the surrounding context. In both automatic and human evaluations, FiLM outperforms existing infilling methods that rely on L2R language models trained on rearranged text segments. FiLM is easy to implement and can be either trained from scratchor fine-tuned from a L2R language model. Notably, as the model size grows, FiLM's perplexity approaches that of strong L2R language models of similar sizes, indicating FiLM's scalability and potential as a large language model",

    "abstract": "Although we have witnessed the powerful capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in the past, it is undeniable that in the current timeline, there are still unknown errors or information. %%Additionally, training a new LLM from scratch is a costly option. In response to these challenges, a series of methods injecting new facts into the LLM have been proposed. However, adjusting model weights to accommodate changes in information is likely to trigger a cascade of reactions, including adverse effects on the performance of knowledge outside the scope of editing. In this study, we introduce an \\textbf{RAINPOEM} -- \\textbf{R}etrieval-\\textbf{a}ugmented \\textbf{In}-context knowledge \\textbf{po}st \\textbf{e}diting on massive-editing \\textbf{m}emory -- that is designed for re-evaluating the results of massive-edited models by recalling their editing facts through retrieval and leveraging the in-context reasoning capabilities of LLMs to facilitate more robust responses.

This integration enables more precise and consistent guidance of language models towards desired outcomes, particularly in complex and open text generation tasks. By employing a methodology that filters and combines multiple rewards based on their consistency, the framework provides a robust mechanism for improving model alignment.

Considering the high computing power overhead, data-efficient instruction tuning was proposed to reduce the training data size in this process, aiming at selecting high-quality instructional data. Nevertheless, we argue that most current data-efficient instruction-tuning methods are highly dependent on the quality of the original instruction-tuning dataset. When it comes to datasets synthesized by LLMs, a common scenario in this field, dirty samples will even be selected with a higher probability than other samples. To address these challenges, we utilized external knowledge (relevant examples or paragraphs) to evaluate those samples synthesized by LLMs with an in-context-based relative predictive entropy.

Although word embeddings are usually interpreted as feature vectors for individual words, their roles in language model generation remain underexplored. In this work, we theoretically and empirically revisit output word embeddings and find that their linear transformations are equivalent to steering language model generation styles. We name such steers LM-Steers and find them existing in LMs of all sizes. It requires learning parameters equal to 0.2\\% of the original LMs' size for steering each style. On tasks such as language model detoxification and sentiment control, LM-Steers can achieve comparable or superior performance compared with state-of-the-art controlled generation methods while maintaining a better balance with generation quality. The learned LM-Steer serves as a lens in text styles: it reveals that word embeddings are interpretable when associated with language model generations, and can highlight text spans that most indicate the style differences. A LM-Steer is transferrable between different language models by an explicit-form calculation. One can also continuously steer LMs simply by scaling the LM-Steer, or compose multiple LM-Steers by adding their transformations.

In this paper, we introduce MAVEN-Arg, which augments MAVEN datasets with event argument annotations, making the first all-in-one dataset supporting event detection, event argument extraction (EAE), and event relation extraction. As an EAE benchmark, MAVEN-Arg offers three main advantages: (1) a comprehensive schema covering 162 event types and 612 argument roles, all with expert-written definitions and examples; (2) a large data scale, containing 98,591 events and 290,613 arguments obtained with laborious human annotation; (3) the exhaustive annotation supporting all task variants of EAE, which annotates both entity and non-entity event arguments in document level. Experiments indicate that MAVEN-Arg is quite challenging for both fine-tuned EAE models and proprietary large language models (LLMs). Furthermore, to demonstrate the benefits of an all-in-one dataset, we preliminarily explore a potential application, future event prediction, with LLMs. MAVEN-Arg and our baseline codes will be publicly released",

    "abstract": "This work focuses on a new challenging problem, open-world multi-label text classification under extremely weak supervision, where only raw documents are provided without any labels or ground-truth label space. The multi-label nature makes the existing (hard-)clustering-based methods ineffective. We observe that (1)~most documents have a dominant class covering the majority of content and (2) long-tail labels would appear in some documents as dominant class. Following these observations, we propose a novel method, \\our, to discover a comprehensive label space and construct a multi-label classifier. Specifically, we start with a reasonable subset of all the documents and prompt a large language model (LLM) for their most dominant keyphrases to obtain an initial set of labels. We then leverage a zero-shot multi-label classifier, identifying the documents with lower predicted scores and revisiting the keyphrases in those documents for more long-tail labels. Later, we include these long-tail labels into the label set and reiterate this process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \\our exhibits a remarkable 40\\% increase on the AAPD dataset in ground-truth label space coverage compared to traditional topic modeling methods. Additionally, it achieves higher accuracy in zero-shot multi-label text classification",

    "abstract": "Deepfakes, particularly in the auditory domain, have become a significant threat, necessitating the development of robust countermeasures. This paper addresses the escalating challenges posed by deepfake attacks on Automatic Speaker Verification (ASV) systems. We present a novel Urdu deepfake audio dataset for deepfake detection, focusing on two spoofing attacks – Tacotron and VITS TTS. The dataset construction involves careful consideration of phonemic cover and balance and comparison with existing corpora like PRUS and PronouncUR. Evaluation with AASIST-L model shows EERs of 0.495 and 0.524 for VITS TTS and Tacotron-generated audios, respectively, with variability across speakers Further, this research implements a detailed human evaluation, incorporating a user study to gauge whether people are able to discern deepfake audios from real (bonafide) audios. The ROC curve analysis shows an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.63, indicating that individuals demonstrate a limited ability to detect deepfakes (approximately 1 in 3 fake audio samples are regarded as real). Our work contributes a valuable resource for training deepfake detection models in low-resource languages like Urdu, addressing the critical gap in existing datasets",

Further, we hypothesize that the decomposition should be easier to distill into a smaller model compared to the problem solving because the latter requires large amounts of domain knowledge while the former only requires learning general problem solving strategies.We propose methods to distill these two capabilities and evaluate their impact on reasoning outcomes and inference cost.We find that we can distill the problem decomposition phase and at the same time achieve good generalization across tasks, datasets, and models.However, it is harder to distill the problem solving capability without losing performance and the resulting distilled model struggles with generalization.These results indicate that by using smaller, distilled problem decomposition models in combination with problem solving LLMs we can achieve reasoning with cost-efficient inference and local adaptation",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Despite the impressive performance on information-seeking tasks, large language models (LLMs) still struggle with hallucinations. Attributed LLMs, which augment generated text with in-line citations, demonstrate potential in mitigating hallucinations and improving verifiability. Nonetheless, current attributed LLMs suffer from suboptimal citation quality due to their reliance on in-context learning or post-hoc retrieval, lacking a built-in attribution mechanism. Moreover, the practice of merely citing document identifiers falls short in aiding users to pinpoint specific supporting evidence. To bridge these gaps, this work introduces FRONT, a training framework that advances the verification process in attributed LLMs through Fine-grained grounded citations. It equips LLMs with the ability to first anchor in fine-grained supporting quotes, which then guide the generation of attributed answers. Grounded quotes not only elevate LLM attribution quality but also serve as a mechanism for fine-grained verification, significantly enhancing information traceability. Experiments on the ALCE benchmark demonstrate the efficacy of FRONT in generating superior grounded responses and highly supportive citations. With LLaMA-2-7B, the framework significantly outperforms all the baselines, even surpassing ChatGPT, by achieving an average outperformance of 14.21% across all datasets. Notably, FRONT implements an automated procedure and exhibits generalization across models and data scales, enabling continuous performance improvements",

Recent research LIMA demonstrates that alignment is essentially a process where the model adapts instructions' interaction style or format to solve various tasks, leveraging pre-trained knowledge and skills. Therefore, for instructional data, the most important aspect is the task it represents, rather than the specific semantics and knowledge information. The latent representations of instructions play roles for some instruction-related tasks like data distillation for instruction tuning and prompt retrieval for in-context learning. However, they are always derived from text embeddings, encompass overall semantic information that influences the representation of task categories. In this work, we introduce a new concept, instruction embedding, and construct Instruction Embedding Benchmark (IEB) for its evaluation. Then, we propose baseline method, prompt-based instruction embedding (PIE), to make the instruction embeddings more attention on task rather than whole semantic information. The evaluation of PIE, alongside other embedding methods on IEB, demonstrates its superior performance in accurately identifying task categories. Moreover, the application of PIE in downstream tasks showcases its effectiveness and suitability for instruction-related tasks",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has been a crucial component in the recent success of Large Language Models. However, RLHF is know to exploit biases in human preferences, such as verbosity. A well-formatted and eloquent answer is often more highly rated by users, even when it is less helpful and objective. A number of approaches have been developed to control those biases in the classical RLHF literature, but the problem remains relatively under-explored for Direct Alignment Algorithms such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Unlike classical RLHF, DPO does not train a separate reward model or use reinforcement learning directly, so previous approaches developed to control verbosity cannot be directly applied to this setting. Our work makes several contributions. For the first time, we study the length problem in the DPO setting, showing significant exploitation in DPO and linking it to out-of-distribution bootstrapping. We then develop a principled but simple regularization strategy that prevents length exploitation, while still maintaining improvements in model quality. We demonstrate these affects across datasets on summarization and dialogue, where we achieve up to 20\\% improvement in win rates when controlling for length, despite the GPT4 judge's well-known verbosity bias",

Humans have produced texts in various languages for thousands of years; however, most of the computational literature is focused on contemporary languages and corpora. The emerging field of historical psychology relies on computational techniques to extract aspects of psychology from historical corpora using new methods developed in natural language processing (NLP). The present pipeline, called Contextualized Construct Representations (CCR), combines expert knowledge in psychometrics (i.e., psychological surveys) with text representations generated via transformer-based language models to measure psychological constructs such as traditionalism, norm strength, and collectivism in classical Chinese corpora. Considering the scarcity of available data, we propose an indirect supervised contrastive learning approach and build the first Chinese historical psychological corpus (C-HIS-PSY) to fine-tune pre-trained models.

Despite many models now extending the context window several times beyond the base model, the performance of these models in processing long texts varies across different tasks.

Our method achieves length generalization of LLM by leveraging the large model itself to retrieve the most relevant information for the task when the context window is limited. Moreover, this method is task-agnostic, and different tasks only need different prompts to achieve their retrieval. Results from the LongBench benchmark show that AESS can improve LLM performance by 9-10% compared to other retrieval methods. Furthermore, our method can also be adapted to various models and improve performance. Therefore, AESS is a promising solution for various applications that require LLMs to handle tasks with lengthy inputs effectively",

However, the majority of these architectures have been evaluated predominantly in languages with a fixed word order, such as English.

In this work, we examine the robustness of graph-based parsing architectures on 4 relatively free word order languages. We focus on investigating essential modifications such as data augmentation and the removal of position encoding required to adapt these architectures accordingly. To this end, we propose a contrastive loss objective to make the model robust to word order variations.

In this paper, we use models of this scaling behavior to estimate the scale at which our current methods will yield a SLM with the English proficiency of text-based Large Language Models (LLMs). We establish a strong correlation between pre-training loss and downstream syntactic and semantic performance in SLMs and LLMs, which results in predictable scaling of linguistic performance. We show that the linguistic performance of SLMs scales up to three orders of magnitude more slowly than the performance of text-based LLMs. Additionally, we study the effects of coarser speech tokenization, and the benefits of synthetic data designed to boost semantic understanding",

Thus, researchers proposed a modified CL approach equipped with extra modules such as human-written implications or machine-generated augmented data for better implicit hate speech detection.

In this study, we (1) create a dataset for intrinsic gender bias measurement in Bangla, (2) discuss necessary adaptations for Bangla, and (3) examine the effect of context length variation on bias measurement in established methods within a Bangla-based setup. We observe a definite dependency of bias metrics on context length. We consider our work as a stepping stone for bias measurement in the Bangla Language. All of our resources will be publicly available to support future research on Bangla NLP",

    "abstract": "Time-sensitive question answering is to answer questions with specific timestamps from the given long document. Existing works mostly focus on only one of the high-quality answers, but it is common that multiple answers simultaneously satisfy the constraints of a specific timestamp in the time-sensitive question. For example, an individual may play two different roles during a specific timestamp. In this paper, we construct a Multi-answer Time-sensitive question answering dataset, MulTiple, consisting of 17,580 multi-answer instances. Each contains a question, a corresponding long document and multiple answers. To ensure that the generated questions have multiple answers, we propose a global iteration method to obtain time-evolving events with multiple objects for the same subject and relation. Moreover, the baseline model IterBird is proposed to progressively gain multiple answers by integrating an iterative mechanism with the single-answer model. We construct extensive experiments on MulTiple and results show that IterBird significantly outperforms other baselines with SEM scores of 25.65\\% and 22.69\\%. It demonstrates that existing models struggle to obtain the full answers, even as clue words are provided in the time-sensitive questions.

Additionally, we study effects of inconsistency along with accuracy. We empirically observe that Llama-2-based evaluators are more consistent and accurate in general. Lastly, we present two effective methods: (1) Self-Consistency Evaluation (SCE) and (2) distilled In-Context Learning ($d$ICL) to jointly promote consistency and accuracy without further training.

To enhance both the singability and translation capabilities, we adopt a two-stage training recipe with filtering techniques.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in numerous domains but often struggle to process lengthy inputs effectively and efficiently due to limited length generalization and attention's quadratic computational demands.Many sought to mitigate this by restricting the attention window within the pre-trained length. However, these methods introduce new issues such as ignoring the middle context and requiring additional training.To address these problems, we propose LongHeads, a training-free framework that enhances LLM's long context ability by unlocking multi-head attention's untapped potential.Instead of allowing each head to attend to the full sentence, which struggles with generalizing to longer sequences due to out-of-distribution (OOD) issues, we allow each head to process in-distribution length by selecting and attending to important context chunks.To this end, we propose a chunk selection strategy that relies on the inherent correlation between the query and the key representations, efficiently distributing context chunks to different heads.In this way, each head ensures it can effectively process attended tokens within the trained length, while different heads in different layers can collectively process longer contexts.LongHeads works efficiently in linear time, fits seamlessly with many LLMs that use relative positional encoding.Our extensive empirical analyses verify LongHeads's efficacy in extending the usable context window for existing models, showcasing its promise for enhancing long text understanding",

While effective, these methods have faced challenges due to high costs and unstable training processes. In response, alternative approaches have been proposed to serve as replacements for the PPO process or integrate Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and contrastive learning to directly achieve fine-tuning and value alignment. However, these methods still need voluminous data to learn the preference and sacrifices a portion of generalization ability of LLMs. To further enhance alignment efficiency and performance while mitigating the loss of generalization ability, this paper introduces DEFT, an efficient alignment framework incorporating data filtering and distributional guidance. DEFT comprises two main components: (1) Data Grading, involving the integration of reward model scores to filter data of varying quality from the original dataset and achieve alignment using the best subset; (2) Distribution Reward, which extracts positive and negative discrepancy distributions from the data and guides the language model output distribution accordingly. Experimental results demonstrate that the methods enhanced by DEFT outperform the original methods in both alignment capability and generalization ability.

    "abstract": "Large language models have garnered significant attention due to their demonstrated strong logical reasoning capabilities. However, there is still ample room for improvement in handling complex long-term reasoning problems. Direct fine-tuning LLM on domain-specific data is an effective approach, but it requires substantial financial costs. Another research line aims to efficiently enhance performance by leveraging the model's inherent capabilities without tuning any parameters. They either utilize LLM's fact evaluation ability for self-verification during logical reasoning or employ voting methods to improve the consistency of the model's decisions. However, due to inherent limitations in specific domains, the benefits of self-verification approaches are typically limited.

To overcome the error propagation problem of traditional verification model, we further propose a contrast-enhanced verification model training framework.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "RL-based techniques can be used to search for prompts that when fed into a target language model maximize a set of user-specified reward functions. However, in many target applications, the natural reward functions are in tension with one another -- for example, content preservation vs. style matching in style transfer tasks. Current techniques focus on maximizing the average of reward functions, which does not necessarily lead to prompts that achieve balance across rewards -- an issue that has been well-studied in the multi-objective and robust optimization literature. In this paper, we adapt several techniques for multi-objective optimization to RL-based discrete prompt optimization -- two that consider volume of the Pareto reward surface, and another that chooses an update direction that benefits all rewards simultaneously. We conduct an empirical analysis of these methods on two NLP tasks: style transfer and machine translation, each using three competing reward functions. Our experiments demonstrate that multi-objective methods that directly optimize volume perform better and achieve a better balance of all rewards than those that attempt to find monotonic update directions",

    "abstract": "On social media platforms, users' emotions are triggered when they encounter particular content from other users,where such emotions are different from those that spontaneously emerged, owing to the \"responsive'' nature. Analyzing the aforementioned responsive emotions from user interactions is a task of significant importance for understanding human cognition, the mechanisms of emotion generation, and behavior on the Internet, etc. Performing the task with artificial intelligence generally requires human-annotated data to help train a well-performing system, while existing data resources do not cover this specific area, with none of them focusing on responsive emotion analysis. In this paper, we propose a Chinese dataset named \\textsc{ResEmo} for responsive emotion analysis, including 3813 posts with 68,781 comments collected from Weibo, the largest social media platform in China. ResEmo contains three types of human annotations with respect to responsive emotions, namely, responsive relationship, responsive emotion cause, and responsive emotion category. Moreover, to test this dataset, we build large language model (LLM) baseline methods for responsive relation extraction, responsive emotion cause extraction, and responsive emotion detection, which show the potential of the proposed ResEmo being a benchmark for future studies on responsive emotions",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Recently, the development of open-source large language models (LLMs) has advanced rapidly. Nevertheless, due to data constraints, the capabilities of most open-source LLMs are primarily focused on English. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of $\\textit{chat vector}$ to equip pre-trained language models with instruction following and human value alignment via simple model arithmetic. The chat vector is derived by subtracting the weights of a pre-trained base model (e.g. LLaMA2) from those of its corresponding chat model (e.g. LLaMA2-chat). By simply adding the chat vector to a continual pre-trained model's weights, we can endow the model with chat capabilities in new languages without the need for further training. Our empirical studies demonstrate the superior efficacy of the chat vector from three different aspects: instruction following, toxicity mitigation, and multi-turn dialogue. Moreover, to showcase the adaptability of our approach, we extend our experiments to encompass various languages, base models, and chat vectors. The results underscore the chat vector's simplicity, effectiveness, and wide applicability, making it a compelling solution for efficiently enabling conversational capabilities in pre-trained language models",

While knowledge distillation (KD) is a prominent method for this, research on KD for generative language models like LLMs is relatively sparse, and the approach of distilling student-friendly knowledge, which has shown promising performance in KD for classification models, remains unexplored in generative language models. To explore this approach, we propose PromptKD, a simple yet effective method that utilizes prompt tuning - for the first time in KD - to enable generative language models to transfer student-friendly knowledge. Unlike previous works in classification that require fine-tuning the entire teacher model for extracting student-friendly knowledge, PromptKD achieves similar effects by adding a small number of prompt tokens and tuning only the prompt with student guidance. Extensive experiments on instruction-following datasets using the GPT-2 model family show that PromptKD achieves state-of-the-art performance while adding only 0.0007% of the teacher's parameters as prompts. Further analysis suggests that distilling student-friendly knowledge alleviates exposure bias effectively throughout the entire training process, leading to performance enhancements",

However, such solutions overlook the structural information within user queries and databases, which can be utilized to enhance the generation of structured SQL. This oversight can lead to inaccurate or unexecutable SQL generation. To fully exploit the structure, we propose the structure-to-SQL framework, which leverages the inherent structure information to improve the SQL generation of LLMs. Specifically, we introduce our Structure Guided SQL~(SGU-SQL)} generation model. SGU-SQL links user queries and databases in a structure-enhanced manner. It then decomposes complicated linked structures with grammar trees to guide the LLM to generate the SQL step by step.

Recent abstractive approaches still generate KPs based on sentences, often leading to KPs with overlapping and hallucinated opinions, and inaccurate quantification. In this paper, we propose Prompted Aspect Key Point Analysis (PAKPA) for quantitative review summarization. PAKPA employs aspect sentiment analysis and prompt in-context learning with Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate and quantify KPs grounded in aspects for business entities, which achieves faithful KPs with accurate quantification, and remove the need for large amounts of annotated data for supervised training. Experiments on the popular review dataset Yelp and the aspect-oriented review summarization dataset SPACE show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance.

To systematically investigate definition bias, we conduct three probing experiments to quantitatively analyze it and discover the limitations of unified information extraction and large language models in solving definition bias. To mitigate definition bias in information extraction, we propose a multi-stage framework consisting of definition bias measurement, bias-aware fine-tuning, and task-specific bias mitigation.

To enhance reasoning abilities in non-dominant languages, we propose a Multilingual-Alignment-as-Preference Optimization framework~(MAPO), aiming to align the reasoning processes in other languages with the dominant language. Specifically, we harness an off-the-shelf translation model for the consistency between answers in non-dominant and dominant languages, which we adopt as the preference for optimization, e.g., Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) or Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).

    "abstract": "Recent advances in Automated Theorem Proving have shown the effectiveness of leveraging a (large) language model that generates tactics (i.e. proof steps) to search through proof states. The current model, while trained solely on successful proof paths, faces a discrepancy at the inference stage, as it must sample and try various tactics at each proof state until finding success, unlike its training which does not incorporate learning from failed attempts. Intuitively, a tactic that leads to a failed search path would indicate that similar tactics should receive less attention during the following trials. In this paper, we demonstrate the benefit of training models that additionally learn from failed search paths. Facing the lack of such trial-and-error data in existing open-source theorem-proving datasets, we curate a dataset on intuitionistic propositional logic theorems and formalize it in Lean, such that we can reliably check the correctness of proofs. We compare our model trained on relatively short trial-and-error information (TrialMaster) with models trained only on the correct paths and discover that the former solves more unseen theorems with lower trial searches",

    "abstract": "Many Chinese Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmarks represent a subject by collecting multiple-choice questions and provide a score to reflect a model's ability in that subject. They have emphasized the comprehensiveness of subject variety but overlooked the comprehensiveness of concepts within individual subjects. We introduce the term \\textit{concept bias}, which refers to the bias caused by the collected questions covering only a portion of the concepts that a subject comprises. Our experiments shows that: 1) the final score can significantly vary depending on the sampled concepts, making it difficult to correlate the final score with the model's actual ability in the subject; 2) the reported model ranking can also be affected. To address this issue, we propose PsyBench: a concept-driven psychology benchmark generated by \\texttt{GPT-4}. We generate high-quality questions for each required concept, thereby reducing concept bias. PsyBench not only fills the gap in the Chinese MMLU series benchmarks for the lack of comprehensive undergraduate-level psychology subjects but also reduces concept bias, offering developers scores that more accurately reflect the model's actual abilities across various subjects",

    "abstract": "Current state-of-the-art large language models are effective in generating high-quality text and encapsulating a broad spectrum of world knowledge. These models, however, often hallucinate and lack locally relevant factual data. Retrieval-augmented approaches were introduced to overcome these problems and provide more accurate responses. Typically, the retrieved information is simply appended to the main request, restricting the context window size of the model. We propose a novel approach for the Dynamic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (DRAG), based on the entity-augmented generation, which injects compressed embeddings of the retrieved entities into the generative model. The proposed pipeline was developed for code-generation tasks, yet can be transferred to some domains of natural language processing. To train the model, we collect and publish a new project-level code generation dataset. We use it for the evaluation along with publicly available datasets. Our approach achieves several targets: (1) lifting the length limitations of the context window, saving on the prompt size; (2) allowing huge expansion of the number of retrieval entities available for the context; (3) alleviating the problem of misspelling or failing to find relevant entity names. This allows the model to beat all baselines (except GPT-3.5) with a strong margin",

In this paper, we propose a parameter-efficient dynamic prefix method and formalize INER as a unified seq2seq generation task. By employing the dynamic prefix as a task instructor to guide the generative model, our approach can preserve task-invariant knowledge while adapting to new entities with minimal parameter updates, making it particularly effective in low-resource scenarios.

    "abstract": "To combat the misuse of Large Language Models (LLMs), many recent studies have presented LLM-generated-text detectors with promising performance. When users instruct LLMs to generate texts, the instruction can include different constraints depending on the user's need. However, most recent studies do not cover such diverse instruction patterns when creating datasets for LLM detection. In this paper, we find that even task-oriented constraints --- constraints that would naturally be included in an instruction and are not related to detection-evasion --- cause existing detectors to have a large variance in detection performance. We focus on student essay writing as a realistic domain and manually create task-oriented constraints based on several factors for essay quality. Our experiments show that the standard deviation (SD) of current detector performance on texts generated by an instruction with such a constraint is significantly larger (up to an SD of 14.4 F1-score) than that by generating texts multiple times or paraphrasing the instruction. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that the high instruction-following ability of LLMs fosters the large impact of such constraints on detection performance",

Our multi-faceted analysis of the performance of 15 LLMs, further broken down by sub-domain, source of knowledge and model architecture, uncovers success factors such as instruction tuning that lead to improved recall and comprehension. We further show that while recently proposed domain-adapted models may lack adequate knowledge, directly fine-tuning on our collected medical knowledge datasets shows encouraging results, even generalising to unseen specialist sub-domains.

Experiments across various fine-grained image datasets demonstrate that CascadeVLM significantly outperforms existing models, specifically on the Stanford Cars dataset, achieving an impressive 85.6% zero-shot accuracy.

    "abstract": "We examine the abilities of intrinsic bias metrics of static word embeddings to predict whether Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems exhibit biased behavior. A word embedding is one of the fundamental NLP technologies that represents the meanings of words through real vectors, and problematically, it also learns social biases such as stereotypes. An intrinsic bias metric measures bias by examining a characteristic of vectors, while an extrinsic bias metric checks whether an NLP system trained with a word embedding is biased. A previous study found that a common intrinsic bias metric usually does not correlate with extrinsic bias metrics. However, the intrinsic and extrinsic bias metrics did not measure the same bias in most cases, which makes us question whether the lack of correlation is genuine. In this paper, we extract characteristic words from datasets of extrinsic bias metrics and analyze correlations with intrinsic bias metrics with those words to ensure both metrics measure the same bias. We observed moderate to high correlations with some extrinsic bias metrics but little to no correlations with the others. This result suggests that intrinsic bias metrics can predict biased behavior in particular settings but not in others",

Motivated by recent research on extending the capabilities of LLMs with tools, this paper investigates the intriguing potential of tools to augment LLMs in handling such complexity. To this end, we design customized tools to aid in the proactive exploration within these massive environments.

In the intermediate layers, LLMs engage in problem-solving by thinking in English and incorporating multilingual knowledge to obtain factual content, leveraging the self-attention and feed-forward structures, respectively. In the last several layers, LLMs generate responses that align with the original language of the query. In addition, we investigate the existence of language-specific neurons when processing a certain language. To detect neurons activated by the input language, even without labels, we innovatively design a Parallel Language specific Neuron Detection ($\\texttt{PLND}$) method that effectively measures the significance of neurons when handling multilingual inputs.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on a wide range of tasks, they still face reliability challenges such as hallucination. Previous studies reveal that highly capable LLMs like GPT-4 are effective in judging the reliability of individual responses while less capable ones are often tuned to evaluate the relative reliability of responses to the same query. To enable less capable LLMs to effectively judge the reliability of individual responses, we propose a novel method named $\\textit{Meta}$ $\\textit{Ranking}$ (MR). Unlike previous methods, which assess the response directly, we achieve the judgement by comparing the target query-response pair with reference query-response pairs. We found its remarkable effectiveness in error detection for LLM responses on reasoning tasks, where less capable LLMs could outperform strong baselines, even without fine-tuning. We further demonstrate that MR can be used to enhance the performance of LLMs in two practical applications: query routing and iterative training data filtering. The former achieves GPT-4-turbo comparable performance with less than half the token consumption, while the latter makes the instruction-tuned LLaMA-7B and Phi-2, a 2.7B model, significantly surpasses Alpaca-13B over fewer training samples, underscoring the high potential of our proposed method",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Reconstructing natural language from non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) holds great promise as a language decoding technology for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, EEG-based language decoding is still in its nascent stages, facing several technical issues such as: 1) Absence of a hybrid strategy that can effectively integrate cross-modality (between EEG and text) self-learning with intra-modality self-reconstruction of EEG features or textual sequences; 2) Under-utilization of large language models (LLMs) to enhance EEG-based language decoding. To address above issues, we propose the Contrastive EEG-Text Masked Autoencoder (CET-MAE), a novel model that orchestrates compound self-supervised learning across and within EEG and text through a dedicated multi-stream encoder. Furthermore, we develop a framework called E2T-PTR (EEG-to-Text decoding using Pretrained Transferable Representations), which leverages pre-trained modules alongside the EEG stream from CET-MAE and further enables an LLM (specifically BART) to decode text from EEG sequences. Comprehensive experiments conducted on the popular text-evoked EEG database, ZuCo, demonstrate the superiority of E2T-PTR, which outperforms the state-of-the-art in ROUGE-1 F1 and BLEU-4 scores by 8.34% and 32.21%, respectively.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved promising performance on Math Word Problem (MWP) and Question Answering (QA) tasks. LLM fine-tuning is commonly based on cross-entropy loss minimization to perform accurate predictions. However, the standard cross-entropy function neither considers the underlying token distribution over training data nor weighs differently correct and misclassified samples. To address tasks such as closed-ended QA and step-by-step MWP resolution LLMs require advanced language reasoning capabilities. This prompts the adoption of established computer vision loss functions that optimize LLMs' performance rather than simple accuracy. This paper shows the higher effectiveness of combining cross-entropy with computer vision loss functions across MWPs and closed-ended QA datasets. We show relevant LLMs' performance improvements with equal model complexity and the same number of training samples or even fewer.

    "abstract": "In conversational AI, personalizing dialogues with persona profiles and contextual understanding is essential. Despite large language models' (LLMs) improved response coherence, effective persona integration remains a challenge. In this work, we first study two common approaches for personalizing LLMs: textual prompting and direct fine-tuning. We observed that textual prompting often struggles to yield responses that are similar to the ground truths in datasets, while direct fine-tuning tends to produce repetitive or overly generic replies. To alleviate those issues, we propose $\\textbf{S}$elective $\\textbf{P}r$ompt $\\textbf{T}$uning (SPT), which softly prompts LLMs for personalized conversations in a selective way. Concretely, SPT initializes a set of soft prompts and uses a trainable dense retriever to adaptively select suitable soft prompts for LLMs according to different input contexts, where the prompt retriever is dynamically updated through feedback from the LLMs. Additionally, we propose context-prompt contrastive learning and prompt fusion learning to encourage the SPT to enhance the diversity of personalized conversations. Experiments on the CONVAI2 dataset demonstrate that SPT significantly enhances response diversity by up to $90\\%$, along with improvements in other critical performance indicators. Those results highlight the efficacy of SPT in fostering engaging and personalized dialogue generation",

Diverging from this conventional path, our work introduces a novel strategy that not only reevaluates the digit order by prioritizing output from the least significant digit but also incorporates a step-by-step methodology to substantially reduce complexity.

    "abstract": "It has been widely observed that exact or approximate MAP (mode-seeking) decoding from natural language generation (NLG) models consistently leads to degenerate outputs (Holtzman et al., 2019; Stahlberg and Byrne, 2019). Prior work has attributed this behavior to either a fundamental and unavoidable inadequacy of modes in probabilistic models or weaknesses in language modeling. Contrastingly, we argue that degenerate modes can even occur in the absence of any modeling error, due to contamination of the training data. Specifically, we argue that mixing even a tiny amount of low-entropy noise with a population text distribution can cause the data distribution's mode to become degenerate. We therefore propose to apply MAP decoding to the model's true conditional distribution where the conditioning variable explicitly avoids specific degenerate behavior. Using exact search, we empirically verify that the length-conditional modes of machine translation models and language models are indeed more fluent and topical than their unconditional modes. For the first time, we also share many examples of exact modal sequences from these models, and from several variants of the LLaMA-7B model. Notably, we observethat various kinds of degenerate modes persist, even at the scale of LLaMA-7B. Although we cannot tractably address these degeneracieswith exact search, we perform a classifier-based approximate search on LLaMA-7B, a model which was not trained for instruction following, and find that we are able to elicit reasonable outputs without any finetuning",

Recently, prompt learning methods have demonstrated success in dealing with IDRR. However, prior work primarily transform IDRR into a connective-cloze task based on the masked language model (MLM), which limits the predicted word to one single token. Besides, these methods use hand-crafted verbalizers which are time-consuming and less convincing. In this paper, we propose NCPrompt, an NSP-based prompt learning and Contrastive learning method for IDRR. Specifically, we automatically search the optimal verbalizer for IDRR based on the statistical and expressive features of connectives. Furthermore, we transform the IDRR task into a next sentence prediction (NSP) task and introduce contrastive learning by constructing augmentation views. In this way, the answer words of multiple tokens can convey more precise meaning and contrastive learning can help to generate more informative embeddings, expected to boost the model performance. To our knowledge, we are the first to apply NSP to handle the IDRR task. Experiments on the PDTB 3.0 corpus have demonstrated the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed model",

Therefore, how to directly understand tables using intuitive visual information is a crucial and urgent challenge for more applications. In this paper, we propose a new problem, multimodal table understanding, where the model is required to generate correct responses to various table-related requests (e.g., questions) according to the given table image. To support research on this problem, we construct a large-scale dataset named MMTab, which covers diverse table tasks and can facilitate both the model training and evaluation.

As a result, their generated critiques cannot provide fine-grained distinguishability on generated texts, causing unsatisfactory evaluation performance.

After fine-tuning on these data, the resulting model CritiqueLLM is empirically shown to outperform ChatGPT and all the open-source baselines and even achieve comparable evaluation performance to GPT-4 in system-level correlations of pointwise grading.

    "abstract": "Human preference alignment is essential to improve the interaction quality of large language models (LLMs). Existing aligning methods depend on manually annotated preference data to guide the LLM optimization directions.However, in practice, continuously updating LLMs raises a distribution gap between model-generated samples and human-preferred responses, which hinders model fine-tuning efficiency. To mitigate this issue, previous methods require additional preference annotation on generated samples to adapt the shifted distribution, which consumes a large amount of annotation resources. Targeting more efficient human preference optimization, we propose an adversarial preference optimization (APO) framework, where the LLM agent and the preference model update alternatively via a min-max game. Without additional annotation, our APO method can make a self-adaption to the generation distribution gap through the adversarial learning process. Based on comprehensive experiments, we find APO further enhances the alignment performance of baseline methods in terms of helpfulness and harmlessness",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revealed their potential for achieving autonomous agents possessing human-level intelligence. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating LLM Agents either use static datasets, potentially leading to data leakage or focus only on single-agent scenarios, overlooking the complexities of multi-agent interactions. There is a lack of a benchmark that evaluates the diverse capabilities of LLM agents in multi-agent, dynamic environments. To this end, we introduce LLMArena, a novel and easily extensible framework for evaluating the diverse capabilities of LLM in multi-agent dynamic environments. LLMArena encompasses seven distinct gaming environments, employing Trueskill scoring to assess crucial abilities in LLM agents, including spatial reasoning, strategic planning, numerical reasoning, risk assessment, communication, opponent modeling, and team collaboration. We conduct an extensive experiment and human evaluation among different sizes and types of LLMs, showing that LLMs still have a significant journey ahead in their development towards becoming fully autonomous agents, especially in opponent modeling and team collaboration. We hope LLMArena could guide future research towards enhancing these capabilities in LLMs, ultimately leading to more sophisticated and practical applications in dynamic, multi-agent settings",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks. However, the substantial number of parameters in LLMs contributes to significant latency during model inference. This is particularly evident when utilizing autoregressive decoding methods, which generate one token in a single forward process, thereby not fully capitalizing on the parallel computing capabilities of GPUs. In this paper, we propose a novel parallel decoding approach, namely hidden transfer, which decodes multiple successive tokens simultaneously in a single forward pass. The idea is to transfer the intermediate hidden states of the previous context to the pseudo hidden states of the future tokens to be generated, and then the pseudo hidden states will pass the following transformer layers thereby assimilating more semantic information and achieving superior predictive accuracy of the future tokens. Besides, we use the novel tree attention mechanism to simultaneously generate and verify multiple candidates of output sequences, which ensure the lossless generation and further improves the generation efficiency of our method. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. We conduct a lot of analytic experiments to prove our motivation. In terms of acceleration metrics, we outperform all the single-model acceleration techniques, including Medusa and Self-Speculative decoding",

    "abstract": "The translation of gender-neutral person terms (e.g., the students) is often non-trivial. An interesting case poses the translation from English to German – in German, every noun is gendered, and if the gender of the referent(s) is unknown or diverse, the generic masculine (die Studenten (m.)) is commonly used. This, however, reduces the visibility of other genders, such as women and non-binary people. To counteract gender discrimination, a societal movement towards using gender-fair language exists (e.g., by adopting neosystems). However, gender-fair German is currently barely supported in Machine Translation (MT), requiring costly post-editing or manual translations. We address this research gap by studying gender-fair language in English to German MT. Concretely, we enrich a community-created gender-fair language dictionary, and sample multi-sentence test instances from encyclopedic text and parliamentary speeches. Using these novel resources, we conduct the first benchmark study involving two commercial systems and six neural MT models for translating words in isolation and words in larger contexts across two domains. Our findings show that most systems produce mainly masculine forms, and rarely gender-neutral variants, high- lighting the need for future research",

To mitigate these risks, researchers have adopted safety training techniques to align model outputs with societal values to curb the generation of malicious content. However, the phenomenon of \"jailbreaking\" — where carefully crafted prompts elicit harmful responses from models — persists as a significant challenge. This research conducts a comprehensive analysis of existing studies on jailbreaking LLMs and their defense techniques. We meticulously investigates nine attack techniques and seven defense techniques, applied across three distinct language models: Vicuna, LLama, and GPT-3.5 Turbo. We aim to evaluate the effectiveness of these attack and defense techniques.

Present-day LLMs with ICL have shown exceptional performance on several English NLP tasks, but their utility on other languages is still underexplored. Our work investigates their effectiveness for NLP tasks in low-resource languages (LRLs), especially for cross-lingual transfer, where task-specific training data for one or more related languages is available. We propose Self-Supervised Prompting for Cross-Lingual Transfer (SSP-CLT), a novel approach for zero-shot cross-lingual transfer to LRLs. SSP-CLT works in two stages and has 2 variants. In first variant, in Stage I, for a given target test instance, exemplars are retrieved from source training data and included in the LLM prompt for ICL -- this obtains an initial labeling. Once all test data instances are labeled, Stage II repeats the whole process, but draws exemplars from Stage I labelings of other test datapoints in the target language. The second variant of SSP-CLT uses a fine-tuned model for stage 1 predictions, while stage 2 uses an Integer Linear Programming (ILP)-based exemplar selection that balances similarity, confidence and label coverage.Experiments on 3 tasks and 3 language families demonstrate that SSP-CLT strongly outperforms supervised baselines and also other prompting approaches",

Merging performance degradation is due to parameter conflicts. The prevailing methods address this issue of parameter conflicts during the merging stage, but recently scholars have been paying more attention to resolving this problem during the pruning stage. DARE has demonstrated promising results on a simple fine-tuned model. However, this approach exhibit diminished effectiveness when applied to complex fine-tuned models that has significant parameter bias compared to the baseline model. In this study, we propose a two-stage method called DPPA to address the challenge of fusing complex fine-tuned models. First, we introduce Dynamically Pruning (DP), an improved approach based on magnitude pruning which aim is to enhance performance at higher pruning rates. Subsequently, we propose Dynamically Partition Amplification (DPA), a rescaling technique that aims to dynamically amplify partitions of parameters based on their varying levels of significance.

While LLM data selection methods have evolved, their evaluations often rely on overall metrics that may not capture their impacts on different downstream task performances. Motivated by this gap, our study finds that selecting pretraining data based on loss metrics could result in poor performance on knowledge-intensive benchmarks, such as the MMLU. Addressing this, we focus on filtering out low-information content, specifically ads, and create an effective ad classifier for this purpose. Besides, the most straightforward approach to assess the quality of pretraining datasets is to train a full-scale LLM, but this is prohibitively expensive and impractical for large-scale comparative studies. To overcome this, we use a smaller, 100M parameter LLM as a proxy to predict the downstream performance of larger models. We effectively demonstrate the correlation between the small model's proxy indicators and the large SFT model's downstream task metrics. This smaller model evaluation technique not only greatly shortens the cycle time for refining data selection strategies but also achieves significant budget savings, amounting to 92.7\\%.

However, they fail to fully separate the task ability from the source language or the language ability from the chosen task. In this paper, we acknowledge the mutual reliance between task ability and language ability and direct our attention toward the gap between the target language and the source language on tasks.

Based on this assumption, we propose a new cross-lingual transfer method called $\\texttt{AdaMergeX}$ that utilizes adaptive adapter merging. By introducing a reference task, we can determine that the divergence of adapters fine-tuned on the reference task in both languages follows the same distribution as the divergence of adapters fine-tuned on the target task in both languages.

Furthermore, this method has also shown superiority in multi-task merging scenarios, indicating a promising avenue for future LLM optimizations",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have advanced the development of various AI conversational agents, including role-playing conversational agents that mimic diverse characters and human behaviors. While prior research has predominantly focused on enhancing the conversational capability, role-specific knowledge, and stylistic attributes of these agents, there has been a noticeable gap in assessing their social intelligence. In this paper, we introduce SocialBench, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the sociality of role-playing conversational agents at both individual and group levels. The benchmark is constructed from a variety of sources and covers a wide range of 512 characters and 6,420 question prompts involved in 1,480 diverse conversation scenarios and 30,871 multi-turn role-playing utterances. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on this benchmark using mainstream open-source and closed-source LLMs, confirming its significance as a testbed for assessing the sociality of role-playing conversational agents",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) enable unparalleled few- and zero-shot reasoning capabilities but at a high computational footprint. A growing assortment of methods for compression promises to reduce the computational burden of LLMs in deployment, but so far, only quantization approaches have been demonstrated to be effective for LLM compression while maintaining zero-shot performance. A critical step in the compression process, the pretrain-then-finetune paradigm, has largely been overlooked when adapting existing pruning strategies to LLMs or proposing new ones. In this work, we show that embarrassingly simple layer pruning coupled with an extended language model pretraining as the finetuning phase produces state-of-the-art results against structured and even semi-structured compression of models at a 7B scale while being more inference efficient. We call this method LayerChop, where we deterministically remove layers from a model followed by task-agnostic finetuning of the remaining weights by continued self-supervised pretraining. At this scale, we also show how distillation, which has been super effective in task-agnostic compression of smaller BERT-style models, becomes inefficient against our simple pruning technique. We release our code and evaluation setup to facilitate reproducibility and advancement of task-agnostic compression for LLMs",

    "abstract": "The guidance from capability evaluations has greatly propelled the progress of human society and the development of Artificial Intelligence. However, as LLMs evolve, it becomes challenging to construct evaluation benchmark with accurate labels for SuperLLMs whose capabilities approach or even surpass those of humans. To credibly conduct poor-supervised evaluation without accurate labels, we first prove that the consistency between the model under evaluation and the reference model, when their prediction distributions are independent and the sample size is infinite, can equivalently assess the true capabilities of the model to be evaluated. However, using either humans or LLMs as the reference model cannot sufficiently meet the conditions, for which we propose the PEEM algorithm. By treating all models under evaluation as reference models, PEEM alternately optimizes model weights and filters reference models based on EM algorithm to maximally alleviate the insufficiency of the conditions. Comprehensive experiments across 3 types of tasks with 16 mainstream LLMs validate the efficiency, universality, and effectiveness of PEEM. More generally, PEEM has advanced the evaluation paradigm evolution from human-centric to human\\&model-centric, alleviating the limitations of human capabilities for evaluating SuperLLMs",

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive language comprehension abilities, their application to MHQA tasks is hindered by several challenges, including hallucination, error propagation and attention dispersion. We propose a novel prompt method Finite state automaton (FSM) to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLM for complex task in addition to improved effectiveness and trustworthiness. Unlike traditional end-to-end chain-of-thought (COT) methods, FSM addresses MHQA by iteratively decompose question into multi-turn subquestions, enabling error checks and backtracking when necessary, ensuring the standardization of the process. Extensive experiments on benchmarks show that our proposed FSM not only has a neat format and stable performance, but also nearly doubles the zero-shot performance in hardest dataset Musique. Further analysis reveals the remarkable capability of FSM to elicit direct and concise intermediate reasoning steps.

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown significant performance for various NLP tasks. However, There are very limited labelled dataset and pre-trained models for non-english languages like Spanish, French and German. In this paper, we did extensive study of exploring various open pre-trained transformer based machine translation and sentiment models and evaluating and fine-tuning these models on open datasets. Our approach incorporates two strategies, Firstly we leverage sentiment models trained in non-english languages and improve it further by fine-tuning on domain data. Second, We fine-tuned machine translation models to translate text from non-english languages to english and use state of the art sentiment models in english language. Machine translation model after fine tuning achieves BLEU score between 50 and 60 that is considered as very high quality translation. We find that extracting sentiments by translating to english and then using english model with domain understanding yields better performance, which achieves 61.43 f1-score vs 55.26 with first approach",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently showcased remarkable generalizability in various domains. However, they still encounter challenges in tasks that involve reasoning, especially those requiring multiple-step reasoning. Despite their extensive knowledge, LLMs still face challenges in efficiently utilizing encoded knowledge to develop accurate and logical reasoning processes. Additionally, there is currently limited research in this area. To mitigate this problem, we introduce Hint-before-Solving Prompting (HSP), a method that guides Large Language Models (LLMs) to first generate hints aiding in problem-solving and then produce solutions that include intermediate reasoning steps. The hint can be specific knowledge, pivotal concepts, or analytical insights essential for solving the problem. Since HSP is orthogonal to prompting methods (e.g., Chain-of-Thought (CoT)), we applied HSP to CoT, Least-to-Most, Plan-and-Solve, and Standard promptings. We conducted extensive and comprehensive experiments on six reasoning benchmarks and four open-source models (Llama2 family models and Mixtral). The results show that HSP significantly improves the accuracy. The average across six datasets, Llama2-70B-Chat, improved by 1.5 under HSP-enhanced CoT, and the improvement jumped to 9.7 with high-quality hints. Beyond exploring training-free LLM capabilities, we built the HSPMATH dataset based on HSP and fine-tuned Llemma-7B, reaching 61.7 accuracy, surpassing GPT-3.5.

    "abstract": "Sequential recommendation aims to predict the next item of interest for a user, based on her/his interaction history. In conventional sequential recommenders, a common approach is to model item sequences using discrete IDs, learning behavioral pattern representations. Inspired by recent success in empowering large language models (LLMs) to understand diverse modality data (\\eg image, audio, 3D points), a compelling research question arises: ``Can LLMs understand and utilize behavioral pattern representations from ID-based sequential recommenders?''. To answer this, we propose a simple framework, RecInterpreter, which examines the capacity of open-source LLMs to decipher the representation space of sequential recommenders. Specifically, with the multimodal pairs (\\ie interaction sequence representations and text narrations), RecInterpreter first uses a lightweight projector to map the representations into the token embedding space of the LLM, which encourages the LLM to generate textual narrations for items within the interaction sequence. Moreover, upon successfully interpreting sequential recommenders, the LLM can enhance its recommendation performance by tuning with the projected behavioral patterns. Empirical results showcase that our RecInterpreter enhances LLM to understand hidden representations from ID-based sequential recommenders and boost recommendation performance",

Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning techniques such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) have been proposed to alleviate this problem, but their performance still fails to match full parameter training in most large-scale fine-tuning settings. Attempting to complement this deficiency, we investigate layerwise properties of LoRA on fine-tuning tasks and notice an uncommon skewness of weight norms across different layers.

In this work, we revisit the predictive power of different LMs' predictability effects on data of human processing effort by considering information of language users' cognitive capacities. To do so, we assess the predictive power of predictability effects estimated from generative LMs on reading data from subjects for which we also scores from psychometric tests targeting different cognitive domains.We investigate if allowing the model to modulate predictability effects relative to the cognitive scores increases the prediction of reading times, and we examine whether LMs exhibit systematic biases in the prediction of reading times for cognitively high- or low-performing groups, allowing us to reveal what type of psycholinguistic subjects a given LM emulates.Our results confirm that incorporating cognitive capacities and allowing them to modulate surprisal and entropy effects can increase the predictive power of these predictors.

    "abstract": "While large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have recently demonstrated astonishing zero-shot capabilities in general domain tasks, they often generate content with hallucinations in specific domains such as Chinese law, hindering their application in these areas. This is typically due to the absence of training data that encompasses such a specific domain, preventing GPT-4 from acquiring in-domain knowledge. A pressing challenge is that it's not plausible to continue training LLMs of the GPT-4's scale on in-domain data.This paper introduces a simple yet effective domain adaptation framework for GPT-4 by reformulating generation as an adapt-retrieve-revise process. The initial step is to adapt an affordable 7B LLM to the Chinese legal domain by continuing learning in-domain data. When solving an in-domain task, we leverage the adapted LLM to generate a draft answer given a task query. Then, the draft answer will be used to retrieve supporting evidence candidates from an external in-domain knowledge base. Finally, the draft answer and retrieved evidence are concatenated into a whole prompt to let GPT-4 assess the evidence and revise the draft answer to generate the final answer. Our proposal combines the advantages of the efficiency of adapting a smaller 7B model with the evidence-assessing capability of GPT-4 and effectively prevents GPT-4 from generating hallucinatory content. In the zero-shot setting of four Chinese legal tasks, our method improves the average score by $+33.6$ points, compared to GPT-4 direct generation. When compared to two stronger retrieval-based baselines, our method outperforms them by $+17.0$ and $+23.5$. Our code will be released",

We then develop several methods, from prompting to finetuning, to align LMs to use their most recent knowledge when answering questions, and investigate various factors in this alignment. Our experiments show that aligning LLaMa2 to the year 2022 can boost its performance by up to 62% relatively as measured by that year, even without mentioning time information explicitly, indicating the possibility of aligning models' internal sense of time after pretraining. Finally, we find that alignment to a historical time is also possible, with up to $2.8\\times$ the performance of the unaligned LM in 2010 if finetuning models to that year.

In this paper, we propose, Duwak, to fundamentally enhance the efficiency and quality of watermarking by embedding dual secret patterns in both token probability distribution and sampling schemes.To mitigate expression degradation caused by biasing toward certain tokens, we design a contrastive search to watermark the sampling scheme, which minimizes the token repetition and enhances the diversity.We theoretically explain the interdependency of the two watermarks within Duwak. We evaluate Duwak extensively on Llama2 under various post-editing attacks, against four state-of-the-art watermarking techniques and combinations of them.Our results show that Duwak marked text achieves the highest watermarked text quality at the lowest required token count for detection, up to 70% tokens less than existing approaches, especially under post paraphrasing",

By enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through instruction-tuning over graph structures, we aim to overcome the limitations associated with explicit graph structural information and enhance the reliability of graph structure learning. Our approach not only effectively denoises noisy connections but also identifies node-wise dependencies from a global perspective, providing a comprehensive understanding of the graph structure. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of GraphEdit across various settings",

    "abstract": "Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) provides a powerful approach for adapting large pre-trained language models (PLMs) to specific domains. Among PEFT methods, LoRA-based methods have emerged as a leading approach. However, existing LoRA-based approaches primarily focus on modifying the architecture or the low-rank matrices, overlooking the significant influence of downstream tasks on LoRA effectiveness. In this paper, we first theoretically demonstrate that fine-tuning actually involves two tasks: domain inference fine-tuning and content inference fine-tuning. We also demonstrate that LoRA can be decoupled into two tasks. To overcome the drawbacks of coupled updates in LoRA, we propose Task Decoupled LoRA (TD-LoRA), which divides the LoRA tasks into distinct branches by introducing a new branch. We employ cosine similarity between LoRA updates weights and pre-trained weights to approximate domain inference. Compared with LoRA, TD-LoRA achieves domain-specific fine-tuning. Additionally, TD-LoRA has the same memory requirements and comparable computational costs as LoRA. We conduct extensive experiments on various pre-trained models and demonstrate its effectiveness on the GLUE, E2E and MMLU benchmarks",

    "abstract": "Generative search engines have the potential to transform how people seek information online, but generated responses from existing large language models (LLMs)-backed generative search engines may not always be accurate. Nonetheless, retrieval-augmented generation exacerbates safety concerns, since adversaries may successfully evade the entire system by subtly manipulating the most vulnerable part of a claim. To this end, we propose evaluating the robustness of generative search engines in the realistic and high-risk setting, where adversaries have only black-box system access and seek to deceive the model into returning incorrect responses. Through a comprehensive human evaluation of various generative search engines, such as Bing Chat, PerplexityAI, and YouChat across diverse queries, we demonstrate the effectiveness of adversarial factual questions in inducing incorrect responses. Moreover, retrieval-augmented generation exhibits a higher susceptibility to factual errors compared to LLMs without retrieval. These findings highlight the potential security risks of these systems and emphasize the need for rigorous evaluation before deployment. The dataset and code will be publicly available",

In this paper, we introduce DM-BLI, a Dynamic Multiple subspaces alignment framework for unsupervised BLI. DM-BLI improves language alignment by utilizing multiple subspace alignments instead of a single mapping. We begin via unsupervised clustering to discover these subspaces in source embedding space. Then we identify and align corresponding subspaces in the target space using a rough global alignment. DM-BLI further employs intra-cluster and inter-cluster contrastive learning to refine precise alignment for each subspace pair. Experiments conducted on standard BLI datasets for 12 language pairs (6 rich-resource and 6 low-resource) demonstrate substantial gains achieved by our framework.

    "abstract": "Language models trained on large-scale corpus often generate harmful responses that are harmful and contrary to human values. A prevalent approach for human alignment is reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), utilizing algorithms such as proximal policy optimization (PPO). However, these methods are often characterized by complexity, instability, and substantial resource consumption. Considering that existing large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are already relatively well-aligned and cost-friendly, researchers propose to align the language model with human preference from AI feedback. Nevertheless, the common practices, that unidirectionally distill the responses, are constrained by the inherent capability of LLMs. To address it, we introduce CycleAlign framework to distill alignment capabilities from the parameter-invisible LLM (black-box) to a parameter-visible model (white-box) in an iterative manner. CycleAlign iteratively improves both the while-box and black-box models by integrating static and dynamic in-context learning and a belief alignment method. Empirical results illustrate that the model fine-tuned by CycleAlign remarkably exceeds existing methods, and achieves the state-of-the-art performance in alignment with human value.\\footnote{The code of this work will be available at \\url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CycleAlign-B958/}.}",

However, the current MLLMs trained with visual-question-answering (VQA) datasets could suffer from degradation, as VQA datasets lack the diversity and complexity of the original text instruction datasets which the underlying language model had been trained with. To address this challenging degradation, we first collect a lightweight (6k entries) VQA preference dataset where answers were annotated by Gemini for 5 quality metrics in a granular fashion, and investigate standard Supervised Fine-tuning, rejection sampling, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and SteerLM. Our findings indicate that the with DPO we are able to surpass instruction-following capabilities of the language model, achieving a 6.73 score on MT-Bench, compared to Vicuna's 6.57 and LLaVA's 5.99 despite small data scale. This enhancement in textual instruction proficiency correlates with boosted visual instruction performance (+4.9\\% on MM-Vet, +6\\% on LLaVA-Bench), with minimal alignment tax on visual knowledge benchmarks compared to previous RLHF approach.

To tackle the highlighted issues, we introduce a novel approach by conceptualizing TKG reasoning as a sequence denoising process for future facts, namely DiffuTKG. Concretely, we first encodes the historical events as the conditional sequence. Then we gradually introduce Gaussian noise to corrupt target facts during the forward process and then employ a transformer-based conditional denoiser to restore them in the reverse phase. Moreover, we introduce an uncertainty regularization loss to mitigate the risk of prediction biases by favoring frequent scenarios over rare/unseen facts. Empirical results on four real-world datasets show that DiffuTKG outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics",

    "abstract": "Self-correction techniques have recently emerged as a promising framework to improve the quality of responses generated by large language models (LLMs). LLMs with few-shot prompting act as critics to produce feedback for an input, which is further fed to a refiner (also an LLM) to produce an output. However, these critique-refine steps require multiple expensive LLM calls. To circumvent this large inference cost, we borrow inspiration from prior work on knowledge distillation and propose the use of critique distillation to train critics. These are smaller sequence-to-sequence models that are trained on input-critique pairs generated by an LLM. We focus on the problem of text simplification for three Indian languages, Hindi, Bengali and Marathi. This task is both a good fit for self-correction style techniques and has also not been systematically explored for Indian languages before. We train two separate critics for simplification that focus on lexical and structure complexity, and show that it is surprisingly more effective than using an LLM directly as a critic in both few-shot (for Hindi) and zero-shot (for Bengali and Marathi) settings. We also show the benefits of training multilingual critics, as opposed to monolingual critics, in enabling improved cross-lingual transfer",

Specifically, we assess whether prominent LM-based evaluation metrics (e.g. BARTScore, T5Score, and GPTScore) demonstrate a favorable bias toward their respective underlying LMs in the context of summarization tasks. Our findings unveil a latent bias, particularly pronounced when such evaluation metrics are used in an reference-free manner without leveraging gold summaries.

In this work we address this challenge by introducing a novel approach for predicting `Moments of Change' (MoC) in the mood of online users, by simultaneously considering user linguistic and time-aware context. A Hawkes process-inspired transformation layer is applied over the proposed architecture to model the influence of time on users' posts -- capturing both their immediate and historical dynamics. We perform experiments on the two existing datasets for the MoC task and showcase clear performance gains when leveraging the proposed layer. Our ablation study reveals the importance of considering temporal dynamics in detecting subtle and rare mood changes.

    "abstract": "The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly advanced the capabilities of Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) systems, leading to their extensive research and deployment across various industries for domain-specific knowledge querying. However, evaluating these systems presents unique challenges due to the scarcity of domain-specific queries and corresponding ground truths, as well as a lack of systematic approaches to diagnosing the cause of failure cases—whether they stem from knowledge deficits or issues related to system robustness.To address these challenges, we introduce an evaluation framework comprising two key elements: 1) a data generation process that leverages relational databases and LLMs to efficiently produce scalable query-answer pairs, facilitating the separation of query logic from linguistic variations for enhanced debugging capabilities; and 2) an explainable evaluation protocol equipped with a novel metric that assesses the extent of knowledge comprehension and system robustness in both retrieval and language modeling contexts. Importantly, our empirical findings highlight the shortcomings of prevalent reference-free evaluation methods, positioning our reliable reference-based evaluation protocol as a valuable adjunct",

Hence, we propose a novel fine-tuned detector, PECOLA, bridging metric-based and fine-tuned detectors by contrastive learning on selective perturbation. Selective strategy retains important tokens during perturbation and weights for multi-pair contrastive learning.

In this paper, we mitigate the distribution shift in task adaptation by developing a smooth transfer learning curriculum, which, by fine-tuning the model along a path of intermediate tasks on a graph, progressively bridges the gap between the pretrained model and a target task with limited data. To this end, we formulate the curriculum learning as a graph search problem and address its efficiency by a deep dive into accelerating the transferability estimation between tasks and two classical search algorithm applied to our problem, i.e., greedy best first search and Monte Carlo tree search.

Here, we investigate the hypothesis that efficient lexicon organization also affects valency, or the combinations and orders of additional words and phrases a verb selects for in a sentence.We consider two measures of valency diversity for verbs: valency frame count (vfc), the number of distinct frames associated with a verb, and valency frame entropy (vfe), the average information content of frame selection associated with a verb. Using data from 79 languages, we provide evidence that more frequent verbs are associated with a greater diversity of valency frames, suggesting that the organization of valency helps optimize communicative efficiency.

    "abstract": "Although dominant in natural language processing, transformer-based models remain challenged by the task of long-sequence processing, because the computational cost of self-attention operations in transformers swells quadratically with the input sequence length. To alleviate the complexity of long-sequence processing, we propose a framework to enable the off-the-shelf pre-trained transformers to process much longer sequences, while the computation and memory costs remain growing linearly with the input length. More specifically, our method divides each long-sequence input into a batch of chunks, then aligns the inter-chunk information during the encoding steps, and finally selects the most representative hidden states from the encoder for the decoding process. To extract inter-chunk semantic information, we align the start and end token embeddings among chunks in each encoding transformer block. To learn an effective hidden selection policy, we design a dual updating scheme inspired by reinforcement learning, which regards the transformers as environments, and leverages the attention scores and the downstream performance feedback as the rewards to optimize the hidden selection policy. Our empirical results on real-world long-text abstractive summarization and reading comprehension tasks demonstrate effective improvements compared to prior long-sequence processing baselines",

However, previous works have not studied what code properties are not encoded by code-LLMs. In this paper, we conduct a fine-grained analysis of attention maps and hidden representations of code-LLMs. Our study indicates that code-LLMs only encode relations among specific subsets of input tokens. Specifically, by categorizing input tokens into syntactic tokens and identifiers, we found that models encode relations among syntactic tokens and among identifiers, but they fail to encode relations between syntactic tokens and identifiers. We also found that fine-tuned models encode these relations poorly compared to their pre-trained counterparts.

While many fine-tuning algorithms exist, here we consider a \\emph{data-centric AI} perspective on LLM fine-tuning, studying how to \\emph{systematically} curate the training dataset to improve the LLM produced via \\emph{any} fine-tuning algorithm.We introduce an automated data curation pipeline \\modelnameA{} (\\underline{\\textbf{C}}onfidence-based \\underline{\\textbf{L}}LM \\underline{\\textbf{E}}valuation \\underline{\\textbf{A}}nd \\underline{\\textbf{R}}ectification) for instruction tuning datasets, that can be used with any LLM and fine-tuning procedure. CLEAR estimates which training data is low-quality and either filters or corrects it. Quality scoring and the decision to filter or correct are based on LLM-derived confidence estimates, which ensure algorithmic modifications to the dataset remain suitably conservative. Unlike existing data curation techniques, CLEAR is a comprehensive framework that can improve a dataset (and trained model outputs) without additional fine-tuning computations. Importantly, we don't assume access to a stronger LLM than the model being fine-tuned (e.g.\\ relying on GPT-4 when fine-tuning GPT-3.5), to see whether CLEAR can meaningfully improve the capabilities of any LLM. Our experiments reveal that CLEAR consistently improves the performance of fine-tuned models across many datasets and models (like GPT-3.5 and Llama2)",

In this paper, we present a novel ``story space'' prompting (SSP) solution, which provides a coherent and consistent background to support long-term storytelling. Specifically, we first define the story space intricately connected to the given story premise. Then, Our framework systematically generates the story space by progressively constructing it from an abstract representation to a more informative and detailed one. Empirically, we implement our plug-in method upon an existing advanced story generation framework (Yang et al., 2023) and evaluate its impact on both interestingness and coherence. Our findings emphasize the significance of our SSP in enhancing reader engagement and immersion, contributing to advancements in long-form story generation",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs), despite their remarkable progress across various general domains, encounter significant barriers in medicine and healthcare. This field faces unique challenges such as domain-specific terminologies and reasoning over specialized knowledge. To address these issues, we propose a novel Multi-disciplinary Collaboration (MC) framework for the medical domain that leverages role-playing LLM-based agents who participate in a collaborative multi-round discussion, thereby enhancing LLM proficiency and reasoning capabilities. This training-free and interpretable framework encompasses five critical steps: gathering domain experts, proposing individual analyses, summarising these analyses into a report, iterating over discussions until a consensus is reached, and ultimately making a decision. Our work focuses on the zero-shot setting, which is applicable in real-world scenarios. Experimental results on nine datasets (MedQA, MedMCQA, PubMedQA, and six subtasks from MMLU) establish that our proposed MC framework excels at mining and harnessing the medical expertise within LLMs, as well as extending its reasoning abilities",

    "abstract": "Faithfulness, expressiveness, and elegance is the constant pursuit in machine translation. However, traditional metrics like \\textit{BLEU} do not strictly align with human preference of translation quality. In this paper, we explore leveraging reinforcement learning with human feedback (\\textit{RLHF}) to improve translation quality. It is non-trivial to collect a large high-quality dataset of human comparisons between translations, especially for low-resource languages. To address this issue, we propose a cost-effective preference learning strategy, optimizing reward models by distinguishing between human and machine translations. In this manner, the reward model learns the deficiencies of machine translation compared to human and guides subsequent improvements in machine translation. Experimental results demonstrate that \\textit{RLHF} can effectively enhance translation quality and this improvement benefits other translation directions not trained with \\textit{RLHF}. Further analysis indicates that the model's language capabilities play a crucial role in preference learning. A reward model with strong language capabilities can more sensitively learn the subtle differences in translation quality and align better with real human translation preferences",

This enables us to capture the entities of interest, and the relationship between each action, given the features of Programming Languages. Utilizing linguistic cues identified by frequent patterns, ActionIE provides an improved mechanism to discern entities of interest. While our method is broadly applicable, we exemplify its power in the domain of chemical literature, wherein we focus on extracting experimental procedures for chemical synthesis. The code generated by our method can be easily transformed into robotics language which is in high demand in scientific fields. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method.

Some recent works have initiated a transition to a more practical and unified editing task that takes free-form text as edit requests. However, there is gaps in nuanced benchmark designs and re-evaluation of existing methods. To bridge the gaps, we introduce a multi-level benchmark for free text model editing (\\textsc{Mulfe}). The benchmark categorizes probe queries into three levels of generalization, ranging from basic literal memory to deeper understanding and reasoning. Based on the benchmark, we conduct extensive experiments across various base models, edit sizes, and editing methods, including adaptations of mainstream locate-and-edit and hypernetwork methods. The results highlight the inconsistent behaviors of edited models on different generalization levels. Higher level of generalization is still difficult. Based on the findings, we propose \\textsc{Side}, a simple yet effective method based on in-context distillation to enhance the generalization performance.

On one hand, the data leakage issue cause over-estimation on existing benchmarks. On the other hand, periodically curating datasets manually is costly. In this paper, we propose to automate dataset updates for reliable and timely evaluation. The basic idea is to generate unseen and high-quality testing samples based on existing ones to mitigate leakage issues.In specific, we propose two strategies with systematically verification. First, the mimicking strategy employs LLMs to create new samples resembling existing ones, to the maximum extent preserving the stylistic of the original dataset. Our experiments demonstrate its evaluation stability across multiple instantiations and its effectiveness in dealing with data leakage issues in most cases. Second, for the cases that mimicking dataset works poorly, we design an extending strategy that adjusts the difficulty of the generated samples according to varying cognitive levels. This not only makes our evaluation more systematic, but also, with a balanced difficulty, even discern model capabilities better at fine-grained levels",

To mitigate this issue, we employ contrastive learning to promote global feature alignment in addition to counterfactual clues.

However, most jailbreaking prompts contain harmful questions in the natural language (mainly English), which can be detected by the LLM themselves. In this paper, we present jailbreaking prompts encoded using cryptographic techniques. We first present a pilot study on the state-of-the-art LLM, GPT-4, in decoding several safe sentences that have been encrypted using various cryptographic techniques and find that a straightforward word substitution cipher can be decoded most effectively. Motivated by this result, we use this encoding technique for writing jailbreaking prompts. We present a mapping of unsafe words with safe words and ask the unsafe question using these mapped words. Experimental results show an attack success rate (up to 59.42%) of our proposed jailbreaking approach on state-of-the-art proprietary models including ChatGPT, GPT-4, and Gemini-Pro.

The intuition is that if an LLM forgets the specific knowledge required to answer a harmful question, it will no longer have the ability to answer harmful questions. The training of Erase does not actually require the model's own harmful knowledge, and it can benefit from unlearning general answers related to harmful queries, which means it does not need assistance from the red team.

Prior research has shown that pretrained language models (PLMs) such as SciBERT can achieve state-of-the-art performance on CII benchmarks. PLMs are trained via self-supervision tasks on a large corpus of general text and can quickly adapt to CII tasks via moderate fine-tuning on the corresponding dataset. Despite their advantages, PLMs can easily overfit small datasets during fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose a multi-task learning (MTL) framework that jointly fine-tunes PLMs on a dataset of primary interest together with multiple auxiliary CII datasets to take advantage of additional supervision signals. We develop a data-driven task relation learning method that controls the contribution of auxiliary datasets to avoid negative transfer and expensive hyper-parameter tuning. We conduct experiments on three CII datasets and show that fine-tuning with additional datasets can improve the PLMs' generalization performance on the primary dataset.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "In this work, we introduce a semi-parametric token-sequence co-supervision training method. It trains a language model by simultaneously leveraging supervision from the traditional next token prediction loss which is calculated over the parametric token embedding space and the next sequence prediction loss which is calculated over the nonparametric sequence embedding space. The nonparametric sequence embedding space is constructed by a separate language model tasked to condense an input text into a single representative embedding. Our experiments demonstrate that a model trained via both supervisions consistently surpasses models trained via each supervision independently. Analysis suggests that this dual supervision encourages a broader generalization capability across the model. Especially, the robustness of parametric token space which is established during the pretraining step tends to effectively enhance the stability of nonparametric sequence embedding space, a new space established by another language model. We will publicly release our model and code in URL",

    "title": "When Noises Help: Improve Text-Image Multimodal Contrastive Learning with Stochastic Label Augmentations",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Contrastive learning~(CL) has been widely used for self-supervised representation learning in text-image multimodal representation learning. However, there are two setbacks in the SOTA contrastive learning framework. One lies in the design of contrastive learning, where the model aims to pull together positive pairs and push away negative pairs. For one image, CL only considers one unique text as its positive sample, and treat all remaining text data as negative samples. Such design inevitably brings in learning bias towards overfitting into specific data pairs. Another setback comes from the web-crawled datasets that are commonly used in CL such as Conceptual Caption, YFCC and LAION. These datasets brings benefit due to its large size, yet contain significant noisy or vague labels. In this paper, we examine how augmenting the ground-truth labels with randomness can bring significant improvements in text-image multimodal contrastive learning. Through the simple addition of noise to ground-truth labels, we observe substantial improvements in model performance and robustness, requiring no additional computational overhead. We introduce three distinct stochastic label augmentation strategies and evaluate their effectiveness across various benchmarks, including zero-shot transfer, distribution shift, and linear probing tasks. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive experiments involving different model architectures and noise rates, demonstrating the generalizability and substantial benefits of stochastic label augmentation across diverse tasks and models",

Current research on the alignment and safety of LLMs predominantly targets adult audiences, overlooking the distinct cognitive stages of human development, particularly in youth. Recognizing this gap, we build a pyramidal youth safety benchmark (PYSafety), the largest labeled to date, comprising 275,321 records of data.Based on the benchmark, we introduce a pyramidal-graded response (PGR) strategy designed to tailor safety responses, ensuring that each interaction is aligned with the specific safety needs of the user demographic.In the implementation of the PGR strategy, we propose Safety Preference Optimization (SPO), a novel approach designed to enhance the safety performance of LLMs without additional training.The evaluation of 10 leading LLMs on the PYSafety benchmark revealed that they fall short of the desired standards for youth safety.Our SPO-based PGR strategy demonstrated a significant safety enhancement in performance across a majority of LLMs, achieving an average 20\\% to 30\\% increase in the win rate compared to their original responses.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Large language models are trained on massive scrapes of the web, which are often unstructured, noisy, and poorly phrased. Current scaling laws show that learning from such data requires an abundance of both compute and data, which grows with the size of the model being trained. This is infeasible both because of the large compute costs and duration associated with pre-training, and the impending scarcity of high-quality data on the web. In this work, we propose Web Rephrase Augmented Pre-training (WRAP) that uses an off-the-shelf instruction-tuned model prompted to paraphrase documents on the web in specific styles such as \"like Wikipedia\" or in \"question-answer format\" to jointly pre-train LLMs on real and synthetic rephrases. First, we show that using WRAP on the C4 dataset, which is naturally noisy, speeds up pre-training by ~3x. At the same pre-training compute budget, it improves perplexity by more than 10% on average across different subsets of the Pile, and improves zero-shot question answer accuracy across 13 tasks by more than 2%. Second, we investigate the impact of the re-phrasing style on the performance of the model, offering insights into how the composition of the training data can impact the performance of LLMs in OOD settings. Our gains are attributed to the fact that re-phrased synthetic data has higher utility than just real data because it (i) incorporates style diversity that closely reflects downstream evaluation style, and (ii) has higher `quality' than web-scraped data",

In parallel, a growing body of literature shows that PTLMs fail inconsistently and non-intuitively, showing a lack of reasoning and grounding. To take a first step toward quantifying the effect of grounding (or lack thereof), we curate a novel and comprehensive dataset of object affordances -- GrAFFORD, characterized by 15 affordance classes. Unlike affordance datasets collected in vision and language domains, we annotate in-the-wild sentences with objects and affordances. Experimental results reveal that PTLMs exhibit limited reasoning abilities when it comes to uncommon object affordances. We also observe that pre-trained VLMs do not necessarily capture object affordances effectively. Through few-shot fine-tuning, we demonstrate improvement in affordance knowledge in PTLMs and VLMs. Our research contributes a novel dataset for language grounding tasks, and presents insights into LM capabilities, advancing the understanding of object affordances",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "With the growing popularity of LLMs among the general public users, privacy-preserving and adversarial robustness have become two pressing demands for LLM-based services, which have largely been pursued separately but rarely jointly. In this paper, to the best of our knowledge, we are among the first attempts towards robust and private LLM inference by tightly integrating two disconnected fields: private inference and prompt ensembling. The former protects users' privacy by encrypting inference data transmitted and processed by LLMs, while the latter enhances adversarial robustness by yielding an aggregated output from multiple prompted LLM responses. Although widely recognized as effective individually, private inference for prompt ensembling together entails new challenges that render the naive combination of existing techniques inefficient. To overcome the hurdles, we propose SecPE, which designs efficient fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) counterparts tailor-made for the core building blocks of prompt ensembling. We conduct extensive experiments on 14 tasks to evaluate the accuracy, robustness, and efficiency of SecPE. The results show that SecPE maintains high clean accuracy and offers better robustness at the expense of merely 2.5% efficiency overhead compared to baseline private inference methods, indicating a satisfactory ``accuracy-robustness-efficiency'' tradeoff. For the efficiency of the encrypted Argmax operation that incurs a major slowdown for prompt ensembling, SecPE is 20.8 times faster than the state-of-the-art peers, which can be of independent interest beyond this work",

The model is expected to first verify the correctness of the provided example according to the task description, which is then set as the condition for generating a better response to the task instance. Our extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of PACIT, outperforming ICIT baseline on both in-domain and out-domain tasks up to 9.16 and 3.14 average ROUGE-L scores, respectively.

In this paper, we propose a concise layer-wise pruning method called \\textit{Layer Collapse (LaCo)}, in which rear model layers collapse into a prior layer, enabling a rapid reduction in model size while preserving the model structure. Comprehensive experiments show that our method maintains an average task performance of over 80\\% at pruning ratios of 25-30\\%, significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art structured pruning methods.

This paper conducts a comprehensive survey of different alignment goals, tracing their evolution paths to identify the most appropriate goal for big models. Specifically, we categorize existing alignment goals into four primary levels: human instructions, human preferences, value principles and basic values, revealing a learning process that transforms from basic abilities to higher value concepts.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Efficiently retrieving a concise set of candidates from an extensive document corpus remains a pivotal challenge in Information Retrieval (IR). Dense retrieval models have gained prominence for their superior performance. However, criticisms surrounding their vulnerability to adversarial attacks necessitate further exploration.In response to these challenges, we advocate for enhancing the sensitivity of dense retrieval models to fine-grained relevance matching signals. Motivated by causality and counterfactual analysis, we propose a series of counterfactual regularization methods. These methods aim to improve the robustness and sensitivity of dense retrieval models concerning fine-grained relevance matching. We first introduce a counterfactual passage extraction method, identifying the key passages that can influence relevance.Subsequent unsupervised learning tasks, based on these counterfactual passages, serve to regularize the model's learning process to improve the robustness and sensitivity.Experimental results showcase the efficacy of our approach. Our method demonstrates the ability to learn key passages without reliance on the passage-level relevance annotations. Moreover, the regularized dense retrieval models exhibit heightened robustness against adversarial attacks, surpassing the state-of-the-art anti-attack methods. Our work contributes to bridging the vulnerability gaps in dense retrieval models, paving the way for their improved reliability and applicability in IR systems",

    "abstract": "Long video understanding is a significant and ongoing challenge in the intersection of multimedia and artificial intelligence. Employing large language models (LLMs) for comprehending video becomes an emerging and promising method. However, this approach incurs high computational costs due to the extensive array of video tokens, experiences reduced visual clarity as a consequence of token aggregation, and confronts challenges arising from irrelevant visual tokens while answering video-related questions. To alleviate these issues, we present an Interactive Visual Adapter (IVA) within LLMs, designed to enhance interaction with fine-grained visual elements. Specifically, we first transform long videos into temporal video tokens via leveraging a visual encoder alongside a pretrained causal transformer, then feed them into LLMs with the video instructions. Subsequently, we integrated IVA, which contains a lightweight temporal frame selector and a spatial feature interactor, within the internal blocks of LLMs to capture instruction-aware and fine-grained visual signals. Consequently, the proposed video-LLM facilitates a comprehensive understanding of long video content through appropriate long video modeling and precise visual interactions. We conducted extensive experiments on nine video understanding benchmarks and experimental results show that our interactive visual adapter significantly improves the performance of video LLMs on long video QA tasks. Ablation studies further verify the effectiveness of IVA in long and short video understandings",

To address this challenge, we introduce a novel classifier-LLM approach to DocRE. The proposed method—LMRC—begins with a classifier specifically designed to filter and select entity pair candidates exhibiting potential relations, and thereby feeds them to LLM for the extraction of final relations. This method ensures that during inference, the LLM's focus is directed primarily at entity pairs with relations.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "3D dense captioning is a task to localize objects in a 3D scene and generate descriptive sentences for each object. Recent approaches in 3D dense captioning have adopted transformer encoder-decoder frameworks from object detection to build an end-to-end pipeline without hand-crafted components. However, these approaches struggle with contradicting objectives where a single query attention has to simultaneously view both the tightly localized object regions and contextual environment. To overcome this challenge, we introduce SIA (See-It-All), a transformer pipeline that engages in 3D dense captioning with a novel paradigm called late aggregation. SIA simultaneously decodes two sets of queries—context query and instance query—where the instance query focuses on localization and object attribute descriptions while the context query versatilely captures the region-of-interest of relationships between multiple objects or with the global scene, then aggregated afterwards (i.e., late aggregation) via simple distance-based measures. To further enhance the quality of contextualized caption generation, we design a novel aggregator (i.e., TGI-Aggregator) to generate a fully informed caption based on the surrounding context, the global environment, and object instances. Extensive experiments on two of the most widely-used 3D dense captioning datasets (ScanRefer and Nr3D) demonstrate that our proposed method achieves a significant improvement over prior methods",

Despite this, no existing work has analyzed the vulnerability of judge-LLMs against adversaries attempting to manipulate outputs. This work presents the first study on the adversarial robustness of assessment LLMs, where we search for short universal phrases that when appended to texts can deceive LLMs to provide high assessment scores. Experiments on SummEval and TopicalChat demonstrate that both LLM-scoring and pairwise LLM-comparative assessment are vulnerable to simple concatenation attacks, where in particular LLM-scoring is very susceptible and can yield maximum assessment scores irrespective of the input text quality. Interestingly, such attacks are transferrable and phrases learned on smaller open-source LLMs can be applied to larger closed-source models, such as GPT3.5. This highlights the pervasive nature of the adversarial vulnerabilities across different judge-LLM sizes, families and methods.

For example, homophenes, words that share identical lip movements but produce different sounds, can be distinguished by considering the context. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, namely Visual Speech Processing incorporated with LLMs (VSP-LLM), to maximize the context modeling ability by bringing the overwhelming power of LLMs. Specifically, VSP-LLM is designed to perform multi-tasks of visual speech recognition and translation, where the given instructions control the type of task. The input video is mapped to the input latent space of a LLM by employing a self-supervised visual speech model. Focused on the fact that there is redundant information in input frames, we propose a novel deduplication method that reduces the embedded visual features by employing visual speech units. Through the proposed deduplication and Low Rank Adaptors (LoRA), VSP-LLM can be trained in a computationally efficient manner. In the translation dataset, the MuAViC benchmark, we demonstrate that VSP-LLM can more effectively recognize and translate lip movements with just 15 hours of labeled data, compared to the recent translation model trained with 433 hours of labeld data",

In this study, we systematically analyze LLMs' learning preferences for data with conflicting knowledge. We find that pretrained LLMs establish learning preferences similar to humans, i.e., preferences towards formal texts and texts with fewer spelling errors, resulting in faster learning and more favorable treatment of knowledge in data with such features when facing conflicts. This finding is generalizable across models and languages and is more evident in larger models. An in-depth analysis reveals that LLMs tend to trust data with features that signify consistency with the majority of data, and it is possible to instill new preferences and erase old ones by manipulating the degree of consistency with the majority data",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) excel across various tasks. However, aligning them with human demonstrations proves challenging. Prior approaches relied on Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) using online RL methods like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Recently, RL-free methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have emerged as appealing alternatives, offering improved stability and scalability while retaining competitive performance. However, these methods have a separate supervised fine-tuning (SFT) step for further learning and require sampling from the post-SFT model and ranking them. In this paper, we introduce Triple Preferences Optimization (TPO), a new preference learning method designed to align an LLM with three preferences without requiring a separate supervised fine-tuning step. Our TPO aims to maximize the log probability of preferred to less-preferred responses while simultaneously learning the gold standard response in a single step. To provide a comprehensive evaluation, we use HuggingFace Open LLMs Benchmarks and MT-Bench involving dialogue systems and encompassing various NLP aspects. The results indicate that TPO surpasses other alignment methods, such as DPO and SFT, in average accuracy by 1.8% and 2.5%, respectively. Notably, TPO without the SFT part exhibits superior average accuracy compared to DPO and SFT by 4% and 4.7%, respectively. Overall, TPO resolves sampling challenges and combines the SFT part with the preference optimization part into a single step and provides better performance",

However, it remains an open challenge how to generate effective plans to guide the action prediction. Current studies often confine themselves to static plans or lack specific plans entirely.

Traditional debiasing methods primarily focus on the model training stage, including data augmentation-based and reweight-based approaches, with the limitations of addressing the complex biases of LLMs. To address such limitations, the causal relationship behind the prompting methods is uncovered using a structural causal model, and a novel causal prompting method based on front-door adjustment is proposed to effectively mitigate the bias of LLMs. In specific, causal intervention is implemented by designing the prompts without accessing the parameters and logits of LLMs.The chain-of-thoughts generated by LLMs are employed as the mediator variable and the causal effect between the input prompt and the output answers is calculated through front-door adjustment to mitigate model biases.Moreover, to obtain the representation of the samples precisely and estimate the causal effect more accurately, contrastive learning is used to fine-tune the encoder of the samples by aligning the space of the encoder with the LLM. Experimental results show that the proposed causal prompting approach achieves excellent performance on 3 natural language processing datasets on both open-source and closed-source LLMs",

    "title": "Guardians of the Machine Translation Meta-Evaluation Sentinel Metrics Fall In!",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Annually, the organizers of the Metrics Shared Task at the Conference on Machine Translation (WMT) conduct the meta-evaluation of Machine Translation (MT) metrics, ranking them according to their correlation with human judgments. Their results guide researchers toward enhancing the next generation of metrics and MT systems.With the recent introduction of neural metrics, the field has seen notable advancements. Nevertheless, the inherent opacity of these metrics has posed substantial challenges to the meta-evaluation process.This work highlights two issues with the meta-evaluation framework currently employed in WMT, and assesses their impact on the metrics rankings. We introduce the concept of sentinel metrics, which are designed explicitly to scrutinize the accuracy, robustness, and fairness of the meta-evaluation process. By employing sentinel metrics, we aim to validate our findings, and shed light and monitor the potential biases or inconsistencies in the rankings. We discover that the present meta-evaluation framework favors two categories of metrics: i) those explicitly trained to mimic human quality assessments, and ii) continuous metrics. Ultimately, we raise concerns regarding the evaluation capabilities of state-of-the-art metrics, highlighting that they might be basing their assessments on spurious correlations found in their training data",

    "title": "Advancing Large Language Models to Capture Varied Speaking Styles and Respond Properly in Spoken Conversations",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "In spoken dialogue, even if two current turns are the same sentence, their responses might still differ when they are spoken in different styles. The spoken styles, containing paralinguistic and prosodic information, mark the most significant difference between text and speech modality. When using text-only LLMs to model spoken dialogue, text-only LLMs cannot give different responses based on the speaking style of the current turn. In this paper, we focus on enabling LLMs to \\textit{listen to} the speaking styles and respond properly. Our goal is to teach the LLM that \"\\textit{even if the sentences are identical if they are spoken in different styles, their corresponding responses might be different}\". Since there is no suitable dataset for achieving this goal, we collect a speech-to-speech dataset, \\textbf{StyleTalk}, with the following desired characteristics: when two current speeches have the same content but are spoken in different styles, their responses will be different. To teach LLMs to understand and respond properly to the speaking styles, we propose the \\textbf{Spoken-LLM} framework that can model the linguistic content and the speaking styles. We train Spoken-LLM using the StyleTalk dataset and devise a two-stage training pipeline to help the Spoken-LLM better learn the speaking styles. Based on extensive experiments, we show that Spoken-LLM outperforms text-only baselines and prior speech LLMs methods",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have presented remarkable capabilities in the wide range of natural language understanding and reasoning tasks. Despite their success, a few works indicate that LLMs suffer from the ''reversal curse'', in which LLMs can't employ the inverted structure ''B is A'' when they are trained based on ''A is B''. To explore the effect of the ''reversal curse'' for LLMs on complex mathematical reasoning tasks, we present two reversal datasets upon GSM8K and MathQA and verify that LLMs also struggle to solve reversal mathematical problems. We analyze the potential reason and attribute it to the insufficient modeling of the relationship between reasoning steps caused by the left-to-right objective. Consequently, based on the characteristics of multi-step reasoning, we design a novel training method to improve the general and reversal reasoning abilities. Finally, we conduct experiments on four mathematical datasets, and the results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the general reasoning capacities and alleviates the reversal problem.

    "abstract": "What can large language models learn? By definition, language models (LM) are distributions over strings. Therefore, an intuitive way of addressing the above question is to formalize it as a matter of learnability of classes of distributions over strings. While prior work in this direction focused on assessing the theoretical limits, we seek to understand the empirical learnability. Unlike prior empirical work, we evaluate LMs on their home ground---learning probability distributions over strings---rather than as classifiers of formal languages. In particular, we investigate the learnability of finite-state LMs (FSLMs). We first theoretically quantify the minimal representation size of a neural LM necessary for learning an FSLM in terms of its rank, which corresponds to the size of linear space spanned by the logits of its conditional distributions. We then empirically test the learnability of FSLMs and find that the rank is a strong predictor of learnability for both Transformers and RNNs, but the significance of other properties of the FSLM differs between Transformers and RNNs",

In this survey we show that despite the growing interest to framing in NLP its current approaches do not capture those aspects which allow to frame, rather than simply convey, the message. To this end, we bring together definitions of frames and framing adopted in different disciplines; examine cognitive, linguistic, and communicative aspects a frame contains beyond its topical content. We survey recent work on computational frame detection, and discuss how framing aspects and frame definitions are (or should) be reflected in NLP approaches",

To address this gap, we introduce HaluEval-Wild, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLM hallucinations in the wild. We meticulously collect challenging (adversarially filtered by Alpaca) user queries from existing real-world user-LLM interaction datasets, including ShareGPT, to evaluate the hallucination rates of various LLMs. Upon analyzing the collected queries, we categorize them into five distinct types, which enables a fine-grained analysis of the types of hallucinations LLMs exhibit, and synthesize the reference answers with the powerful GPT-4 model and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) exhibit powerful general intelligence across diverse scenarios, including their integration into chatbots. However, a vital challenge of LLM-based chatbots is that they may produce hallucinated content in responses, which significantly limits their applicability. Various efforts have been made to alleviate hallucination, such as retrieval augmented generation and reinforcement learning with human feedback, but most of them require additional training and data annotation. In this paper, we propose a novel post-hoc Citation-Enhanced Generation (CEG) approach combined with retrieval argumentation. Unlike previous studies that focus on preventing hallucinations during generation, our method addresses this issue in a post-hoc way. It incorporates a retrieval module to search for supporting documents relevant to the generated content, and employs a natural language inference-based citation generation module. Once the statements in the generated content lack of reference, our model can regenerate responses until all statements are supported by citations. Note that our method is a training-free plug-and-play plugin that is capable of various LLMs. Experiments on various hallucination-related datasets show our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both hallucination detection and response regeneration on three benchmarks.

A single event edit leads to updates in multiple entailed knowledge triplets. (2) Completeness. Beyond updating factual knowledge, event-level editing also requires considering the event influences and updating LLMs' knowledge about future trends. We construct a high-quality event-level editing benchmark ELKEN, consisting of $1,515$ event edits, $6,449$ questions about factual knowledge, and $10,150$ questions about future tendencies.

In this work, we challenge this recent trend by introducing Maverick, a carefully designed -- yet simple -- pipeline, which enables running a state-of-the-art Coreference Resolution system within the constraints of an academic budget, outperforming models with up to 13 billion parameters with as few as 500 million parameters.

Seeking information from tables (TIS) is a crucial capability for Large Language Models (LLMs), serving as the foundation of knowledge-based Q&A systems. However, this field presently suffers from an absence of thorough and reliable evaluation. This paper introduces a more reliable benchmark for Table Information Seeking (TabIS). To avoid the unreliable evaluation caused by text similarity-based metrics, TabIS adopts a single-choice question format (with two options per question) instead of a text generation format. We establish an effective pipeline for generating options, ensuring their difficulty and quality. Experiments conducted on 12 LLMs reveal that while the performance of GPT-4-turbo is marginally satisfactory, both other proprietary and open-source models perform inadequately. Further analysis shows that LLMs exhibit a poor understanding of table structures, and struggle to balance between TIS performance and robustness against pseudo-relevant tables (common in retrieval-augmented systems). These findings uncover the limitations and potential challenges of LLMs in seeking information from tables. We release our data and code to facilitate further research in this field",

To address this issue, this paper introduces the Instruction Contrastive Decoding (ICD) method, a novel approach designed to reduce hallucinations during LVLM inference. Our method is inspired by our observation that what we call disturbance instructions significantly exacerbate hallucinations in multimodal fusion modules. ICD contrasts distributions from standard and instruction disturbance, thereby increasing alignment uncertainty and effectively subtracting hallucinated concepts from the original distribution. Through comprehensive experiments on discriminative benchmarks (POPE and MME) and a generative benchmark (LLaVa-Bench), we demonstrate that ICD significantly mitigates both object-level and attribute-level hallucinations. Moreover, our method not only addresses hallucinations but also significantly enhances the general perception and recognition capabilities of LVLMs",

While language choices and paraphrases help models generalise to more complex tasks, embodied domain instructing models through multiple modalities (e.g., visual referents) can further help minimise ambiguities and improve the overall success rate. We investigate the impact of multimodal language instructions on a model's generalisation capacities on VIMA-Bench, an environment designed to evaluate generalisation performance through increasing levels of complexity. We design different perturbations that affect both the language and the visual referents in multimodal instructions. Our findings indicate that a VIMA model trained on multimodal instructions not only shows high performance when provided with gibberish instructions, but can even perform better on unseen tasks, casting doubts as to whether content from text in multimodal instructions is more useful than the necessary visual referents. Our findings suggest that current Transformer-based models for Embodied AI tasks are limited as to how way they integrate multiple modalities. Therefore, future work should focus on improvements in architecture design and training regimes to further facilitate multimodal fusion allowing the model to place more importance on the content of the instructions, thereby improving generalisation capabilities",

Extensive experiments with seven LLMs reveal their varying behaviors. And, with role play intervention, we can change the styles, but different models present distinct adaptivity and upper-bound. One of our key takeaways is to optimize models or the prompts according to the identified style. For instance, RAG models with high role play adaptability may dynamically adjust the interventions according to the quality of retrieval results --- being dependent to better leverage informative context; and, being intuitive when external prompt is noisy",

Traditional approaches often treat frequent-shot (freq-shot; labels with abundant instances), few-shot, and zero-shot learning as distinct challenges, optimizing systems for just one of these scenarios. Yet, in real-world settings, label occurrences vary greatly. Some of them might appear thousands of times, while others might only appear sporadically or not at all. For practical deployment, it is crucial that a system can adapt to any label occurrence. We introduce a novel classification challenge: X-shot, reflecting a real-world context where freq-shot, few-shot, and zero-shot labels co-occur without predefined limits. Here, X can span from 0 to positive infinity. The crux of X-shot centers on open-domain generalization and devising a system versatile enough to manage various label scenarios.

    "abstract": "Conversational search, unlike single-turn retrieval tasks, requires understanding the current question within a dialogue context.The common approach of rewrite-then-retrieve aims to decontextualize questions to be self-sufficient for off-the-shelf retrievers, but most existing methods produce sub-optimal query rewrites due to the limited ability to incorporate signals from the retrieval results.To overcome this limitation, we present a novel framework RetPO (Retriever's Preference Optimization), which is designed to optimize a language model (LM) for reformulating search queries in line with the preferences of the target retrieval systems.The process begins by prompting a large LM to produce various potential rewrites and then collects retrieval performance for these rewrites as the retrievers' preferences. Through the process, we construct a large-scale dataset called RF collection, containing Retrievers' Feedback on over 410K query rewrites across 12K conversations.Furthermore, we fine-tune a smaller LM using this dataset to align it with the retrievers' preferences as feedback.The resulting model achieves state-of-the-art performance on two recent conversational search benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing baselines, including GPT-3.5",

Specifically, for each pre-trained frozen weight tensor, we add a parallel path of trainable low-rank matrices, namely a down-projection and an up-projection matrix, each of which is followed by a feature transformation vector. Based on a novel \\textit{freezing score}, we the incrementally freeze these projection matrices during fine-tuning to reduce the computation and alleviate over-fitting. Our experimental results demonstrate that we can achieve state-of-the-art performance with an average improvement of up to $0.85\\%$ as evaluated on GLUE benchmark while yeilding up to $9.5\\times$ fewer average trainable parameters. While compared in terms of runtime, AFLoRA can yield up to $1.86\\times$ improvement as opposed to similar PEFT alternatives. Besides the practical utility of our approach, we provide insights on the trainability requirements of LoRA paths at different modules and the freezing schedule for the different projection matrices",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has emerged as the predominant technique for fine-tuning in the era of large language models. However, existing PEFT methods still have inadequate training efficiency. Firstly, the utilization of large-scale foundation models during the training process is excessively redundant for certain fine-tuning tasks. Secondly, as the model size increases, the growth in trainable parameters of empirically added PEFT modules becomes non-negligible and redundant, leading to inefficiency. To achieve task-specific efficient fine-tuning, we propose the Light-PEFT framework, which includes two methods: Masked Early Pruning of the Foundation Model and Multi-Granularity Early Pruning of PEFT. The Light-PEFT framework allows for the simultaneous estimation of redundant parameters in both the foundation model and PEFT modules during the early stage of training. These parameters can then be pruned for more efficient training. We validate our approach on GLUE, SuperGLUE, QA tasks, and various models. With Light-PEFT, parameters of the foundation model can be pruned by over 40%, while still controlling trainable parameters to be only 25% of the original PEFT method. Compared to utilizing the PEFT method directly, Light-PEFT achieves training and inference speedup, reduces memory usage, and maintains comparable performance and the plug-and-play feature of PEFT",

To address these challenges, researchers have proposed methods to incorporate additional knowledge into NMT, including the integration of translation memories (TMs). However, finding TMs that closely match the input sentence remains difficult, particularly for specific domains. In contrast, monolingual data is widely available in most languages and back-translation is believed as a promising method to utilize target language data. But, it still needs additional training. In this paper, we propose Pseudo-kNN-MT, a method that exploit target language data during the inference phase, without training the NMT model. Also, we further investigate the assistance of large language model (LLM) in NMT. Experimental results show that our method can improve translation quality by a great margin.

Current single-prompt methods have led the model to explicitly generate the reasoning for the provided query. However, these methods do not control the generated reasoning output, including approach, solution path, or structure, making them unreliable for use. Consequently, we propose to control the structure of the reasoning. Thus, we design Check-All, a framework for 0-shot prompting, which requires the model to reason on all potential outcomes. With this framework, we demonstrate improved LLM performance compared to other 0-shot prompting reasoning methods in classification tasks. Furthermore, we leverage Check-All to potentially identify mislabeled data in existing datasets. To enhance the overall quality of research in the field, we advocate for improved dataset quality for evaluation purposes.

However, for one thing, the affective computing community normally focused on predicting personality traits but overlooks their application in behavior prediction. For another, the multimodal reasoning task although emphasized on the prediction of future states and behaviors, often neglect incorporating individual personality traits. In this work, we introduce a new task called Personality-aware Human-centric Multimodal Reasoning (PHMR) (T1), with the goal to forecast the future behavior of a particular individual by leveraging multimodal information from past instances, while integrating personality factors. We accordingly construct a new dataset based on six television shows, encompassing 225 characters and 12k samples. To establish a benchmark for the task, we propose seven baseline methods: three adapted from related tasks, two pre-trained model, and two video large models.

    "abstract": "Dependency-based Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) is bound to Dependency Parsing, as the arguments of a predicate are identified through the token that heads the dependency relation subtree of the argument span. However, most dependency-based SRL corpora are susceptible to the dissociated nucleus problem: when a subclause's semantic and structural cores are two separate words, the dependency tree chooses the structural token as the head of the subtree, coercing the SRL annotation to make the same choice. This leads to undesirable consequences: when directly using the output of a dependency-based SRL method in downstream tasks it is useful to work with the token representing the semantic core of a subclause, not the structural core.In this paper, we carry out a linguistically-driven investigation on the dissociated nuclei problem in dependency-based SRL and propose a novel algorithm which aligns predicate-argument structures to the syntactic structures from Universal Dependencies to select the semantic core of an argument. Our analysis shows that dissociated nuclei appear more often than one could expect, and that our novel algorithm greatly enhances the richness of the semantic information in dependency-based SRL.We release the software to reproduce our experiments at (http://omitted.link)",

To address these limitations, we introduce a method, DataTune, to make better use of existing, publicly available datasets to improve automatic dataset generation. DataTune performs dataset transformation, enabling the repurposing of publicly available datasets into a format that is directly aligned with the specific requirements of target tasks. On a diverse set of language-based tasks from the BIG-Bench benchmark, we find that finetuning language models via DataTune improves over a few-shot prompting baseline by 49% and improves over existing methods that use synthetic or retrieved training data by 34%. We find that dataset transformation significantly increases the diversity and difficulty of generated data on many tasks.

Constructed dataset is a benchmark for cross-lingual language-transfer capabilities of multilingual LMs, and experimental results showed high language-transfer capabilities for questions that LMs could easily solve, but lower transfer capabilities for questions requiring deep knowledge or commonsense. This highlights the necessity of language-specific datasets for evaluation and training.

We find that parameter efficient finetuning of smaller open-source models sometimes bridges the gap between the performance of these models and the larger ones, however, English performance can take a hit.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "With the development of instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs), improving the safety of LLMs has become more critical. However, the current approaches for aligning the LLMs output with expected safety usually require substantial training efforts, e.g., high-quality safety data and expensive computational resources, which are costly and inefficient. To this end, we present reverse prompt contrastive decoding (ROSE), a simple-yet-effective method to directly boost the safety of existing instruction-tuned LLMs without any additional training. The principle of ROSE is to improve the probability of desired safe output via suppressing the undesired output induced by the carefully-designed reverse prompts. Experiments on 6 safety and 2 general-purpose tasks show that, our ROSE not only brings consistent and significant safety improvements (up to +13.8% safety score) upon 5 types of instruction-tuned LLMs, but also benefits the general-purpose ability of LLMs. In-depth analyses explore the underlying mechanism of ROSE, and reveal when and where to use it",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Given the rise of multimedia content, human translators increasingly focus on culturally adapting not only words but also other modalities such as images to convey the same meaning. While several applications stand to benefit from this, machine translation systems remain confined to language in speech and text. In this work, we take a first step towards translating images to make them culturally relevant. First, we build three pipelines comprising state-of-the-art generative models to do the task. Next, we build a two-part evaluation dataset -- (i) concept: comprising 600 images that are cross-culturally coherent, focusing on a single concept per image; and (ii) application: comprising 100 images curated from real-world applications. We conduct a multi-faceted human evaluation of translated images to assess for cultural relevance and meaning preservation. We find that as of today, image-editing models fail at this task, but can be improved by leveraging LLMs and retrievers in the loop. Best models can only translate 6% of images for some countries in the easier concept dataset and no translation is successful for some countries in the application dataset, highlighting the challenging nature of the task.

We discovered that such a contrary is due to LLM's bias towards their own output. In this paper, we formally define LLM's self-bias -- the tendency to favor its own generation -- using two statistics. We analyze six LLMs on translation, constrained text generation, and mathematical reasoning tasks. We find that self-bias is prevalent in all examined LLMs across multiple languages and tasks. Our analysis reveals that while the self-refine pipeline improves the fluency and understandability of model outputs, it further amplifies self-bias. To mitigate such biases, we discover that larger model size and external feedback with accurate assessment can significantly reduce bias in the self-refine pipeline, leading to actual performance improvement in downstream tasks",

    "abstract": "The Clinical Terminology Normalization aims at finding standard terms from a given termbase for mentions extracted from clinical texts. However, we found that extracted mentions suffer from the multi-implication problem, especially disease diagnoses. The reason for this is that physicians often use abbreviations, conjunctions, and juxtapositions when writing diagnoses, and it is difficult to manually decompose. To address this problem, we propose a Terminology Component Recognition and Reconstruction strategy that leverages the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) to recognize the components of terms, enabling automated decomposition and transforming original mentions into multiple atomic mentions. Furthermore, we adopt the mainstream ``Recall and Rank'' framework to apply the benefits of the above strategy to the task flow. By leveraging the LLM incorporating the advanced sampling strategies, we design a sampling algorithm for atomic mentions and train the recall model using contrastive learning. Besides the information about the components is also used as knowledge to guide the final term ranking and selection. The experimental results show that our proposed strategy effectively improves the performance of the terminology normalization task and our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art on the experimental dataset",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Though Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the powerful capabilities of few-shot learning through prompting methods, supervised training is still necessary for complex reasoning tasks. Because of their extensive parameters and memory consumption, both Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods and Memory-Efficient Fine-Tuning methods have been proposed for LLMs. Nevertheless, the issue of large annotated data consumption, the aim of Data-Efficient Fine-Tuning, remains unexplored. One obvious way is to combine the PEFT method with active learning. However, the experimental results show that such a combination is not trivial and yields inferior results. Through probe experiments, such observation might be explained by two main reasons: uncertainty gap and poor model calibration. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel approach to effectively integrate uncertainty-based active learning and LoRA. Specifically, for the uncertainty gap, we introduce a dynamic uncertainty measurement that combines the uncertainty of the base model and the uncertainty of the full model during the iteration of active learning. For poor model calibration, we incorporate the regularization method during LoRA training to keep the model from being over-confident, and the Monte-Carlo dropout mechanism is employed to enhance the uncertainty estimation. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms existing baseline models on three complex reasoning tasks",

Existing non-parametric approaches like nearest neighbor machine translation have made small Autoregressive Translation (AT) models achieve efficient domain generalization and adaptation without updating parameters, but leaving the Non-Autoregressive Translation (NAT) counterparts under-explored. To fill this blank, we introduce $Bi$-$k$NN, an innovative and efficient domain adaptation approach for NAT models that tailors a k-nearest-neighbor algorithm for NAT. Specifically, we introduce an effective datastore construction and correlated updating strategies to conform the parallel nature of NAT. Additionally, we train a meta-network that seamlessly integrates the $k$NN distribution with the NMT distribution robustly during the iterative decoding process of NAT. Our experimental results across four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our $Bi$-$k$NN not only achieves significant improvements over the Base-NAT model (7.8 BLEU on average) but also exhibits enhanced efficiency.

To systematically evaluate the cultural dominance issue, we build a benchmark of concrete (e.g., holidays and songs) and abstract (e.g., values and opinions) cultural objects. Empirical results show that the representative GPT models suffer from the culture dominance problem, where GPT-4 is the most affected while text-davinci-003 suffers the least from this problem. Our study emphasizes the need to critically examine cultural dominance and ethical considerations in their development and deployment.

However, the energy and time required to fully fine-tune all parameters can become prohibitively large for many applications as the size of the model increases.

In this paper, we propose a time-efficient fine-tuning method based on feature-extraction in which we treat off-the-shelf language models as fixed sources of embeddings and train small feed-forward networks on top for each downstream task. Averaging across the GLUE NLI benchmark, our method trains $124$ times faster than full fine-tuning and $101$ times faster than parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods using distilRoBERTa, while achieving 81.9% and 85.0% performance respectively",

This causes difficulties in generating a complete logic flow, significantly reducing the persuasiveness of argumentative texts. To solve this problem, we designed a hierarchical text-planning method: Hi-Plan, introducing the structural and logical information of argumentative texts into text-planning explicitly. To be more specific, it allows this method to control the logical relevance in a high-level, fine-grained way simultaneously. Since Hi-Plan requires a fine-grained article outline, we propose an automated data augmentation method to extend existing AEG datasets.

However, although it is validated that LLMs are capable of solving some KBQA problems, there has been little discussion on the differences in LLMs' proficiency in formal languages used in semantic parsing. In this work, we propose to evaluate the understanding and generation ability of LLMs to deal with differently structured logical forms by examining the inter-conversion of natural and formal language through in-context learning of LLMs. Extensive experiments with models of different sizes show that state-of-the-art LLMs can understand formal languages as well as humans, but generating correct logical forms given a few examples remains a challenge.

    "abstract": "Psychosocial stressors and the symptomatology of mental disorders are known to vary with socio-cultural environment. Mental health expressions on social media, however, are primarily informed by studies in the WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrial, Rich, and Democratic) contexts. In this paper, we analyze mental health posts made on Reddit by individuals in India, the most populous country in the World, to identify psycho-social categories and themes specific to the Indian context compared to Reddit users located in the Rest of the World (ROW), predominantly the United States. Contrary to findings in Western samples, mental health discussions in India are present-focused and are about work and achievement-related topics. Psycho-social category, \\textit{illness} is exclusively correlated with mental health posts originating from India, reaffirming the link between somatic symptoms and mental disorders in Indian patients. Two clinical psychologists practicing in India labeled 95\\% of the top-20 topics associated with mental health discussions as \\textit{prevalent} in Indians. Significant linguistic variations in online mental health-related language originating from India vs. ROW, highlight the need for precision culturally-aware machine learning models. These findings have important implications for designing culturally appropriate interventions to reduce the growing diagnosis and treatment gap for mental disorders in India",

    "abstract": "Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) involves extracting opinions from textual data about specific entities and their corresponding aspects through various complementary subtasks. Several prior research has focused on developing ad hoc designs of varying complexities for these subtasks. In this paper, we build upon the instruction tuned model proposed by Scaria et al. (2023), who present an instruction-based model with task descriptions followed by in-context examples on ABSA subtasks. We propose PFInstruct, an extension to this instruction learning paradigm by appending an NLP-related task prefix to the task description. This simple approach leads to improved performance across all tested SemEval subtasks, surpassing previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) on the ATE subtask (Rest14) by +3.28 F1-score, and on the AOOE subtask by an average of +5.43 F1-score across SemEval datasets. Furthermore, we explore the impact of the prefix-enhanced prompt quality on the ABSA subtasks and find that even a noisy prefix enhances model performance compared to the baseline.

However, in the context of autoregressive language models (LMs), we empirically find that larger teacher LMs might dramatically result in a poorer student. In response to this problem, we conduct a series of analyses and reveal that different tokens have different teaching modes, neglecting which will lead to performance degradation. Motivated by this, we propose a simple yet effective adaptive teaching approach (ATKD) to improve the KD. The core of ATKD is to reduce rote learning and make teaching more diverse and flexible. Extensive experiments on 8 LM tasks show that, with the help of ATKD, various baseline KD methods can achieve consistent and significant performance gains (up to +3.04% average score) across all model types and sizes.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Discrete prompt search (DPS) aims to automatically find high-performing prompts that yield top accuracy in interactions with a pretrained language model. In the context of few-shot learning, evaluations of candidate prompts can only be done via a limited number of labelled examples. The search is often formulated as an optimization problem where prediction accuracy, F1 score, or cross-entropy loss is used as the objective function. While resulting prompts achieve top performance, they are mostly unreadable and uninterpretable, i.e., unlike natural languages. In this paper, we formulate DPS as a true multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem considering simultaneously both prompt performance and readability as separate objectives. We show that there exist certain degrees of conflict between the objectives, making the search for human-readable and highly-accurate prompts a challenging problem. We then propose the Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm for Predictive Probability guided Prompting (MoEAP3) to address the problem. Our MoEAP3 returns not a single final prompt as in conventional methods but a whole front of multiple candidate prompts, each representing an efficient trade-off between the objectives. Decision makers can straightforwardly investigate this front and intuitively select the prompt that yields the desired trade-off. Experimental results exhibit the superiority of MoEAP3 over state-of-the-art baselines",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) reflect societal norms and biases, especially about gender. While societal biases and stereotypes have been extensively researched in various NLP applications, there is a surprising gap for emotion analysis. However, emotion and gender are closely linked in societal discourse. E.g., women are often thought of as more empathetic, while men's anger is more socially accepted. To fill this gap, we present the first comprehensive study of gendered emotion attribution in five state-of-the-art LLMs (open- and closed-source). We investigate whether emotions are gendered, and whether these variations are based on societal stereotypes. We prompt the models to adopt a gendered persona and attribute emotions to an event like ‘When I had a serious argument with a dear person'. We then analyze the emotions generated by the models in relation to the gender-event pairs. We find that all models consistently exhibit gendered emotions, influenced by gender stereotypes. These findings are in line with established research in psychology and gender studies. Our study sheds light on the complex societal interplay between language, gender, and emotion. The reproduction of emotion stereotypes in LLMs allows us to use those models to study the topic in detail, but raises questions about the predictive use of those same LLMs for emotion applications",

To tackle these challenges, we introduce Relation-Semantics Consistent Filter (RSCF), characterized by three features: 1) shared affine transformation of relation embeddings across all relations, 2) change-based entity-transformation that adds an entity embedding to its change represented by the transformed vector, and 3) normalization of the change to prevent scale reduction.

As a result, various training approaches, such as auxiliary loss functions and leveraging human feedback, are being adopted to enrich open-domain dialogue systems. One such auxiliary loss function is Bag-of-Words (BoW) loss, defined as the cross-entropy loss for predicting all the words/tokens of the next utterance. This work aims to enhance the BoW loss by introducing the Bag-of-Keywords (BoK) loss. BoK computes the loss for predicting keywords or critical words/tokens in the next utterance, intending to estimate the core idea rather than the entire response. We incorporate BoK loss in both encoder-decoder (T5) and decoder-only (DialoGPT) architecture and train the models to minimize the weighted sum of BoK and LM (BoK-LM) loss. We perform our experiments on two popular open-domain dialog datasets, DailyDialog and Persona-Chat. We show that the inclusion of BoK loss improves the dialogue generation of backbone models, exhibiting improvement in the specificity of the generated responses. We also discuss interpretability as a by-product of using BoK loss.

This is in contrast to models with discriminative objectives, such as mask language modeling, where the higher layers obtain better lexical semantics.

    "abstract": "Memory Editing (ME) has emerged as an efficient method to modify erroneous facts or inject new facts into Large Language Models (LLMs). Two mainstream ME methods exist: parameter-modifying ME and parameter-preserving ME (integrating extra modules while preserving original parameters). Regrettably, previous studies on ME evaluation have two critical limitations: (i) evaluating LLMs with single edit only, neglecting the need for continuous editing, and (ii) evaluations focusing solely on basic factual triples, overlooking broader LLM capabilities like logical reasoning and reading understanding. This study addresses these limitations with contributions threefold: (i) We explore how ME affects a wide range of fundamental capabilities of LLMs under sequential editing. Experimental results reveal an intriguing phenomenon: Most parameter-modifying ME consistently degrade performance across all tasks after a few sequential edits. In contrast, parameter-preserving ME effectively maintains LLMs' fundamental capabilities but struggles to accurately recall edited knowledge presented in a different format. (ii) We extend our evaluation to different editing settings, such as layers to edit, model size, instruction tuning, etc. Experimental findings indicate several strategies that can potentially mitigate the adverse effects of ME. (iii) We further explain why parameter-modifying damages LLMs from three dimensions: parameter changes after editing, language modeling capability, and the in-context learning capability. Our in-depth study advocates more careful use of ME in real-world scenarios",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized zero-shot task performance, mitigating the need for task-specific annotations while enhancing task generalizability. Despite its advancements, current methods using trigger phrases such as ``Let's think step by step'' remain limited. This study introduces PROMPTED, an approach that optimizes the zero-shot prompts for individual task instances following an innovative manner of ``LLMs in the loop''. Our comprehensive evaluation across 13 datasets and 10 task types based on GPT-4 reveals that PROMPTED significantly outperforms both the naive zero-shot approaches and a strong baseline (i.e., ``Output Refinement'') which refines the task output instead of the input prompt. Our experimental results also confirmed the generalization of this advantage to the relatively weaker GPT-3.5. Even more intriguingly, we found that leveraging GPT-3.5 to rewrite prompts for the stronger GPT-4 not only matches but occasionally exceeds the efficacy of using GPT-4 as the prompt rewriter. Our research thus presents a huge value in not only enhancing zero-shot LLM performance but also potentially enabling supervising LLMs with their weaker counterparts, a capability attracting much interest recently",

However, previous safety benchmarks only concern the safety in one language, e.g. the majority language in the pretraining data such as English. In this work, we build the first multilingual safety benchmark for LLMs, XSafety, in response to the global deployment of LLMs in practice. XSafety covers 14 kinds of commonly used safety issues across 10 languages that span several language families. We utilize XSafety to empirically study the multilingual safety for 4 widely-used LLMs, including both close-API and open-source models. Experimental results show that all LLMs produce significantly more unsafe responses for non-English queries than English ones, indicating the necessity of developing safety alignment for non-English languages. In addition, we propose a simple and effective prompting method to improve the multilingual safety of ChatGPT by enhancing cross-lingual generalization of safety alignment. Our prompting method can significantly reduce the ratio of unsafe responses by 42\\% for non-English queries. We will release all the data and results to facilitate future research on LLMs' safety",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Though notable progress has been made, neural-based aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) models are prone to learn spurious correlations from annotation biases, resulting in poor robustness on adversarial data transformations. Among the debiasing solutions, causal inference-based methods have attracted much research attention, which can be mainly categorized into causal intervention methods and counterfactual reasoning methods. However, most of the present debiasing methods focus on single-variable causal inference, which is not suitable for ABSA with two input variables (the target aspect and the review). In this paper, we propose a novel framework based on multi-variable causal inference for debiasing ABSA. In this framework, different types of biases are tackled based on different causal intervention methods. For the review branch, the bias is modeled as indirect confounding from context, where backdoor adjustment intervention is employed for debiasing. For the aspect branch, the bias is described as a direct correlation with labels, where counterfactual reasoning is adopted for debiasing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to various baselines on the two widely used real-world aspect robustness test set datasets",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have been rapidly developed and widely used in various fields, but the (potential) stereotypical bias in the model has not been studied. In this study, we present pioneering research aimed at understanding the presence and implications of stereotypical bias in three widely-used open-source MLLMs: LLaVA-v1.5, MiniGPT-v2, and CogVLM. Specifically, we explore stereotypical bias in MLLMs from two modalities (vision and language), considering three scenarios (occupation, descriptor, and persona), and two attributes (gender and race). We find that 1) MLLMs demonstrate notable stereotypical biases across various scenarios, with LLaVA-v1.5 and CogVLM emerging as the most biased models; 2) these stereotypical biases can be rooted in both the training datasets and pre-trained models' inherent biases; and 3) leveraging specific prompt prefixes demonstrates considerable performance in reducing stereotypical bias, though their effectiveness is inconsistent. Overall, our work serves as a crucial step toward understanding and addressing stereotypical bias in MLLMs. We appeal to the community's attention to the stereotypical bias inherent in the rapidly-evolving MLLMs and to actively contribute to the development of unbiased and responsible multi-modal AI systems",

    "abstract": "As instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) evolve, aligning pretrained foundation models presents increasing challenges. Existing alignment strategies, which typically leverage diverse and high-quality data sources, often overlook the intrinsic uncertainty of tasks, learning all data samples equally. This may lead to suboptimal data efficiency and model performance. In response, we propose uncertainty-aware learning (UAL) to improve the model alignment of different task scenarios, by introducing the sample uncertainty (elicited from more capable LLMs). We implement UAL by a simple fashion -- adaptively setting the label smoothing value of training according to the uncertainty of individual samples. Analysis shows that our UAL indeed facilitates better token clustering in the feature space, validating our hypothesis. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our UAL significantly and consistently outperforms standard supervised fine-tuning. Notably, LLMs aligned in a mixed scenario have achieved an average improvement of 10.62\\% on high-entropy tasks (i.e., AlpacaEval leaderboard), and 1.81\\% on complex low-entropy tasks (i.e., MetaMath and GSM8K)",

This framework effectively aligns the task and sentence context information with the target aspect, leveraging the power of LLM. Specifically, we employ the LoRA training strategy to enable LLM to learn the context information of ABSA and enhance its understanding of the connection between sentence context and aspects through IDE.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Structured pruning offers a viable approach to the local deployment of large language models (LLMs) by reducing computational and memory overheads. Compared to unstructured pruning and quantization, structured pruning has the advantage of being recoverable, since the pruned model remains dense and high-precision rather than sparse or low-precision. However, achieving a high compression ratio for scaled-up LLMs remains a challenge, as the coarse-grained structured pruning poses large damage to the highly interconnected model. In this paper, we introduce TransAct, a task-agnostic structured pruning approach coupled with a compact architecture design. TransAct reduces transitional activations inside multi-head attention (MHA) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) modules, while preserving the inter-module activations that are sensitive to perturbations. Hence, the LLM is compressed into an intra-module low-rank architecture, significantly reducing weights and KV Cache. TransAct is implemented on the Llama2 model and evaluated on downstream benchmarks. Results verify the optimality of our approach at high compression with respect to both speed and performance. Furthermore, ablation studies revealed the strength of iterative pruning and provides insights on the redundancy of MHA and MLP modules",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Recently developed large language models (LLMs) have been shown to perform remarkably well on a wide range of language understanding tasks. But, can they really \"reason\" over the natural language? This question has been receiving significant research attention and many reasoning skills such as commonsense, numerical, and qualitative have been studied. However, the crucial skill pertaining to 'logical reasoning' has remained underexplored. Existing work investigating this reasoning ability of LLMs has focused only on a couple of inference rules (such as modus ponens and modus tollens) of propositional and first-order logic. Addressing the above limitation, we comprehensively evaluate the logical reasoning ability of LLMs on 25 different reasoning patterns spanning over propositional, first-order, and non-monotonic logics. To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce LogicBench, a natural language question-answering dataset focusing on the use of a single inference rule. We conduct detailed analysis with a range of LLMs such as GPT-4, ChatGPT, Gemini, Llama-2, and Mistral using chain-of-thought prompting. Experimental results show that existing LLMs do not fare well on LogicBench; especially, they struggle with instances involving complex reasoning and negations. Furthermore, they sometimes tend to prioritize parametric knowledge over contextual information and overlook the correct reasoning chain. We believe that our work and findings facilitate future research for evaluating and enhancing the logical reasoning ability of LLMs",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often make errors when performing numerical calculations. In contrast to traditional chain-of-thought reasoning, the program-of-thoughts approach involves generating executable code to solve problems. By executing this code, it achieves more precise results. Using generated executable code instead of natural language can reduce computational errors. However, we observe that when LLMs solve mathematical problems using code, they tend to generate more incorrect reasoning than when using natural language. To address this issue, we propose Human-Think Language (HTL), a straightforward yet highly efficient approach inspired by human coding practices. The approach first generates problem-solving methods described in the natural language by the model, then converts them into code, mirroring the process where people think through the logic in natural language before writing it as code. Additionally, it utilizes the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, enabling it to provide feedback to itself based on the correctness of mathematical answers, much like humans do. Finally, we introduce a focus-attention mechanism that masks the question segment, enhancing its reliance on natural language inference solutions during code generation.

These challenges have been addressed in other areas of machine learning, such as Bayesian Optimal Experimental Design (BOED), which focuses on designing informative queries within a well-defined feature space. But these methods, in turn, have historically been difficult to scale and apply to real-world problems (e.g. involving text and images), in which simply identifying the relevant features can be challenging.

We propose a PEFT method, called Stratified Progressive Adaptation Fine-tuning (SPAFIT), based on the localization of different types of linguistic knowledge to specific layers of the model. Our experiments, conducted on nine tasks from the GLUE benchmark, show that our proposed SPAFIT method outperforms other PEFT methods while fine-tuning only a fraction of the parameters adjusted by other methods",

    "title": "Decoding Susceptibility: Modeling Misbelief to Misinformation Through a Computational Approach",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Susceptibility to misinformation describes the degree of belief in unverifiable claims, a latent aspect of individuals' mental processes that is not observable. Existing susceptibility studies heavily rely on self-reported beliefs, which can be subject to bias, expensive to collect, and challenging to scale for downstream applications. To address these limitations, in this work, we propose a computational approach to model users' latent susceptibility levels. As shown in previous research, susceptibility is influenced by various factors (e.g., demographic factors, political ideology), and directly influences people's reposting behavior on social media. To represent the underlying mental process, our susceptibility modeling incorporates these factors as inputs, guided by the supervision of people's sharing behavior. Using COVID-19 as a testbed domain, our experiments demonstrate a significant alignment between the susceptibility scores estimated by our computational modeling and human judgments, confirming the effectiveness of this latent modeling approach. Furthermore, we apply our model to annotate susceptibility scores on a large-scale dataset and analyze the relationships between susceptibility with various factors. Our analysis reveals that political leanings and psychological factors exhibit varying degrees of association with susceptibility to COVID-19 misinformation",

    "title": "Does Object Grounding Really Reduce Hallucination of Large Vision-Language Models?",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have recently dramatically pushed the state of the art in image captioning and many image understanding tasks (e.g., visual question answering). Nonetheless, LVLMs still often \\textit{hallucinate} and produce captions mentioning concepts that cannot be found in the input image. These hallucinations erode the trustworthiness of LVLMs and are one of the main obstacles to their ubiquitous adoption. Recent work suggests that addition of grounding objectives such as those based on \\textit{referring expressions}---explicit alignment between image regions or objects and text descriptions--- reduces the amount of LVLM hallucination. Although intuitive, this claim is not empirically justified as the reduction effects have been established, we argue, with flawed evaluation protocols that (i) rely on data (i.e., MSCOCO) that has been extensively used in LVLM training and (ii) measure hallucination via question answering rather than open-ended caption generation. In this work, in contrast, we offer the first systematic analysis of the effect of fine-grained object grounding on LVLM hallucination under an evaluation protocol that more realistically captures LVLM hallucination in open generation. Our extensive experiments reveal that, while grounding leads to more informative captions, it generally does not reduce the proportion of hallucinated content",

Visual knowledge plays a significant role in analyzing, inferring, and interpreting information from visuals, helping improve the accuracy of answers to knowledge-based visual questions. In this paper, we mainly explore improving LMMs with visual-language knowledge alignment, especially aimed at challenging knowledge-based visual question answering (VQA). To this end, we present a Cognitive Visual-Language Mapper (CVLM), which contains a pretrained Visual Knowledge Aligner (VKA) and a Fine-grained Knowledge Adapter (FKA) used in the multimodal instruction tuning stage. Specifically, we design the VKA based on the interaction between a small language model and a visual encoder, training it on collected image-knowledge pairs to achieve visual knowledge acquisition and projection. FKA is employed to distill the fine-grained visual knowledge of an image and inject it into Large Language Models (LLMs). We conduct extensive experiments on knowledge-based VQA benchmarks and experimental results show that CVLM significantly improves the performance of LMMs on knowledge-based VQA (average gain by 5.0%).

Our uncertainty quantification technique works for any LLM accessible only via a black-box API, whose training data remains unknown. By expending a bit of extra computation, users of any LLM API can now get the same response as they would ordinarily, as well as a confidence estimate that cautions when not to trust this response. Experiments on both closed and open-form Question-Answer benchmarks reveal that BSDetector more accurately identifies incorrect LLM responses than alternative uncertainty estimation procedures (for both GPT-3 and ChatGPT). By sampling multiple responses from the LLM and considering the one with the highest confidence score, we can additionally obtain more accurate responses from the same LLM, without any extra training steps. In applications involving automated evaluation with LLMs, accounting for our confidence scores leads to more reliable evaluation in both human-in-the-loop and fully-automated settings (across both GPT 3.5 and 4)",

To further understand the mechanisms that influence social biases in MLMs, we analyse the corpora used to train the MLMs.Our findings show that some demographic groups, such as \\textit{male}, obtain higher preference over the other, such as \\textit{female} on the training corpora constantly",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "It is imperative to ensure the stability of every prediction made by a language model; that is, a language's prediction should remain consistent despite minor input variations, like word substitutions. In this paper, we investigate the problem of certifying a language model's robustness against Universal Text Perturbations (UTPs), which have been widely used in universal adversarial attacks and backdoor attacks. Existing certified robustness based on random smoothing has shown considerable promise in certifying the input-specific text perturbations (ISTPs), operating under the assumption that any random alteration of a sample's clean or adversarial words would negate the impact of sample-wise perturbations. However, with UTPs, masking only the adversarial words can eliminate the attack. A naive method is to simply increase the masking ratio and the likelihood of masking attack tokens, but it leads to a significant reduction in both certified accuracy and the certified radius, due to input corruption by extensive masking. To solve this challenge, we introduce a novel approach, the \\textit{superior prompt search} method, designed to identify a \\textit{superior prompt} that maintains higher certified accuracy under extensive masking. Additionally, we theoretically motivate why ensembles are a particularly suitable choice as base prompts for random smoothing. The method is denoted by \\textit{superior prompt ensembling} technique. We also empirically confirm this technique, obtaining state-of-the-art results in multiple settings. These methodologies, for the first time, enable high certified accuracy against both UTPs and ISTPs",

This skepticism arises from two observations: 1) smaller models can also exhibit high performance on emergent abilities and 2) there is doubt on the discontinuous metrics used to measure these abilities. In this paper, we propose to study emergent abilities in the lens of pre-training loss, instead of model size or training compute. We demonstrate that the models with the same pre-training loss, but different model and data sizes, generate the same performance on various downstream tasks. We also discover that a model exhibits emergent abilities on certain tasks---regardless of the continuity of metrics---when its pre-training loss falls below a specific threshold. Before reaching this threshold, its performance remains at the level of random guessing. This inspires us to redefine emergent abilities as those that manifest in models with lower pre-training losses, highlighting that these abilities cannot be predicted by merely extrapolating the performance trends of models with higher pre-training losses",

ChatCoach differentiates itself from conventional dialogue systems by offering a simulated environment where medical learners can practice dialogues with a patient agent, while a coach agent provides immediate, structured feedback.This is facilitated by our proposed Generalized Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) approach, which fosters the generation of structured feedback and enhances the utilization of external knowledge sources.

Current approaches mainly focus on embedding logical queries as well as KG entities into the same vector space and retrieving answers based on similarity matching.

To tackle the challenging knowledge deficiency problem, we propose to leverage language models as the additional knowledge reasoner and design a unified framework to integrate knowledge graph reasoning and natural language reasoning by harnessing box embeddings of reasoning trajectory as the chain-of-box and fusing it into the language model to empower the capability of logical reasoning.

    "abstract": "Confidence estimation aiming to evaluate output trustability is crucial for the application of large language models (LLM), especially the black-box ones. Existing confidence estimation of LLM is typically not calibrated due to the overconfidence of LLM on its generated incorrect answers. Existing approaches addressing the overconfidence issue are hindered by a significant limitation that they merely consider the confidence of one answer generated by LLM. To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel paradigm that thoroughly evaluates the trustability of multiple candidate answers to mitigate the overconfidence on incorrect answers. Building upon this paradigm, we introduce a two-step framework, which firstly instructs LLM to reflect and provide justifications for each answer, and then aggregates the justifications for comprehensive confidence estimation. This framework can be integrated with existing confidence estimation approaches for superior calibration.

We leverage LLMs as knowledgeable context augmenters, generating mention-centered descriptions as additional input, while preserving traditional EL models for task specific processing.

    "abstract": "The significant breakthroughs of Medical Multi-Modal Large Language Models (Med-MLLMs) renovate modern healthcare with robust information synthesis and medical decision support. However, these models are often validated using benchmarks unsuitable for the Med-MLLMs due to the intricate nature of the real-world diagnostic frameworks, which encompass diverse medical specialties and involve complex clinical decisions. Moreover, these benchmarks are susceptible to data leakage, since Med-MLLMs are trained on large assemblies of publicly available data. Thus, an isolated and clinically representative benchmark is highly desirable for credible Med-MLLMs evaluation. To this end, we introduce Asclepius, a novel Med-MLLM benchmark that rigorously and comprehensively assesses model capability in terms of: distinct medical specialties (cardiovascular, gastroenterology, etc.) and different diagnostic capacities (perception, disease analysis, etc.). Grounded in 3 proposed core principles, Asclepius ensures a comprehensive evaluation by encompassing 15 medical specialties, stratifying into 3 main categories and 8 sub-categories of clinical tasks, and exempting from train-validate contamination. We further provide an in-depth analysis of 6 Med-MLLMs and compare them with 5 human specialists, providing insights into their competencies and limitations in various medical contexts. Our work not only advances the understanding of Med-MLLMs' capabilities but also sets a precedent for future evaluations and the safe deployment of these models in clinical environments.

Our findings demonstrate that continual pre-training of an other-language model on an English base effectively maintains English proficiency while improving other-language performance, challenging traditional notions of cross-lingual transfer, which is commonly equated with fine-tuning.

Existing approaches primarily transform this problem into column-based classification tasks and utilize self-training methods to leverage unlabeled texts with pseudo-labels. The critical challenge, however, lies in selecting high-quality pseudo-labels and incorporating them effectively into model training. Past self-training techniques selected pseudo SQL predictions based on the probabilities yielded by column-specific classifiers. This approach may not align well with the original queries, especially given the limited performance of the few-shot classifier. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel approach DeLVe-SQL: a latent variable model specifically designed for few-shot text-to-sql tasks. This model effectively decouples textual and SQL semantics via distinct latent variables, enhancing the classifier's performance. Moreover, we apply an additional GPT2 decoder to take into account the reconstruction probabilities of the original query given pseudo SQL predictions, providing a more refined weighting of pseudo-labels.

    "abstract": "Conceptual spaces represent entities in terms of their primitive semantic features. Such representations are highly valuable but they are notoriously difficult to learn, especially when it comes to modelling perceptual and subjective features. Distilling conceptual spaces from Large Language Models (LLMs) has recently emerged as a promising strategy. However, existing work has been limited to probing pre-trained LLMs using relatively simple zero-shot strategies. We focus in particular on the task of ranking entities according to a given conceptual space dimension. Unfortunately, we cannot directly fine-tune LLMs on this task, because ground truth rankings for conceptual space dimensions are rare. We therefore use more readily available features as training data and analyse whether the ranking capabilities of the resulting models transfer to perceptual and subjective features. We find that this is indeed the case, to some extent, but having perceptual and subjective features in the training data seems essential for achieving the best results. We furthermore find that pointwise ranking strategies are competitive against pairwise approaches, in defiance of common wisdom",

Our work proposes an approach to enable a large-scale study on homelessness via two major contributions. First, with the help of domain experts in social work, we characterize Online Attitudes towards Homelessness in nine hierarchical frames (OATH-Frames) on a collection of 4K social media posts. Further, in an effort to ease the annotation, we employ GPT-4 as an LLM assistant to the experts; GPT-4 + Expert annotation presents an attractive trade off owing to a 6.5× speedup in annotation time despite only incurring a 2 point F1 difference in annotation performance.

    "title": "Distilling Instruction-following Abilities of Large Language Models with Task-aware Curriculum Planning",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "The process of instruction tuning aligns pre-trained large language models (LLMs) with open-domain instructions and human-preferred responses. While several studies have explored autonomous approaches to distilling and annotating instructions from more powerful proprietary LLMs, such as ChatGPT, they often neglect the impact of task distributions and the varying difficulty of instructions of the training sets. This oversight can lead to imbalanced knowledge capabilities and poor generalization powers of small student LLMs.To address this challenge, we introduce Task-Aware Curriculum Planning for Instruction Refinement (TAPIR), a multi-round distillation framework with balanced task distributions and dynamic difficulty adjustment. This approach utilizes an oracle LLM to select instructions that are difficult for a student LLM to follow and distill instructions with balanced task distributions. By incorporating curriculum planning, our approach systematically escalates the difficulty levels, progressively enhancing the student LLM's capabilities.We rigorously evaluate TAPIR using two widely recognized benchmarks, including AlpacaEval 2.0 and MT-Bench. The empirical results demonstrate that the student LLMs, trained with our method and less training data, outperform larger instruction-tuned models and strong distillation baselines. The improvement is particularly notable in complex tasks, such as logical reasoning and code generation",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Pretrained large language models have revolutionized many applications but still face challenges related to cultural bias and a lack of cultural commonsense knowledge crucial for guiding cross-culture communication and interactions. Recognizing the shortcomings of existing methods in capturing the diverse and rich cultures across the world, this paper introduces a novel approach for massively multicultural knowledge acquisition. Specifically, our method strategically navigates from densely informative Wikipedia documents on cultural topics to an extensive network of linked pages. Leveraging this valuable source of data collection, we construct the CulturalAtlas dataset, which covers a wide range of sub-country level geographical regions and ethnolinguistic groups, with data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure textual assertion sentence self-containment, as well as fine-grained cultural profile information extraction. Our dataset not only facilitates the evaluation of language model performance in culturally diverse contexts but also serves as a foundational tool for the development of culturally sensitive and aware language models. Our work marks an important step towards deeper understanding and bridging the gaps of cultural disparities in AI, to promote a more inclusive and balanced representation of global cultures in the digital domain",

    "abstract": "With the swift progress in tool-based learning, the number of tools available has also increased significantly. In comparison to the correct utilization of tools, the significance of precisely choosing the appropriate tool from an increasingly large selection is crucial. At present, depending solely on retrieval methods that use keywords and embeddings faces new challenges in the realm of tool selection. On one hand, it becomes difficult to distinguish between tools with similar functionalities. On the other hand, some queries require further reasoning to uncover the true tool needs, where direct matching with keywords or semantic embeddings does not yield the correct result. To address this issue, we introduce the Self-Assist method, which fully leverages the inherent knowledge and reasoning capabilities of large language models. Through a series of systematic steps, large language models actively engage in deliberate thought and select the most appropriate tool for a given query. In essence, our work champions a blend of LLMs and retrieval tools in a flexible, efficient, and universally compatible design, significantly bolstering retrieval outcomes.

    "title": "When Contrastive Learning Meets Bayesian Modeling: Learning Multi-Modal Representation Alignments with Noisy Data-Pairs",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Contrastive learning (CL) stands as a leading paradigm for self-supervised representation learning, achieving state-of-the-art results in multi-modal learning. However, a notable drawback of standard CL is its lack of robustness in the face of noisy (misaligned) data pairs. For instance, not all negative samples are truly negative; within a mini-batch, there can be negative samples that are semantically similar to positive samples. This issue is prevalent in many web-sourced multimodal datasets like CC3M and YFCC, commonly used for CL, due to their inherently noisy nature during dataset crawling. Consequently, dataset noise could significantly undermine the efficacy of CL. On the other hand, Bayesian modeling is renowned for its inherent capability to handle data noise and uncertainty. Is it possible to merge the strengths of both approaches by incorporating Bayesian modeling into CL for noise-robust representation learning? In this paper, we propose a novel solution by reimagining standard CL within a probability framework and introducing learnable random weights to associate with data pairs. Our framework enables automatic inference of the level of noisiness for each data pair through efficient Bayesian sampling, based on a technique borrowed from Bayesian data augmentation. Importantly, our model can be effectively optimized using a novel learning algorithm based on stochastic expectation maximization. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on various standard multi-modal CL benchmarks, showcasing significant performance improvements over standard CL methods",

    "abstract": "Visualization recommendations, which aim to automatically match proper visual charts for specific data tables, can significantly simplify the data analysis process. Traditional approaches in this domain have primarily relied on rule-based or machine learning-based methodologies. These methods often demand extensive manual maintenance and yet fail to fully comprehend the tabular data, leading to unsatisfactory performance. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools, exhibiting strong reasoning capabilities. This advancement suggests their substantial promise in addressing visualization recommendation challenges. However, effectively harnessing LLMs to discern and rationalize patterns in tabular data, and consequently deduce the essential information for chart generation, remains an unresolved challenge. To this end, we introduce a novel Hierarchical Table Prompt-based reprogramming framework, named HTP. This framework aims to integrate multi-dimensional tabular data into LLMs through a strategically crafted prompt learning method while keeping the LLMs' backbone and weights unaltered. The HTP framework uniquely incorporates a four-level prompt structure, encompassing general, instance, cluster, and column levels. This multi-level approach is engineered to provide a comprehensive understanding of both general distribution and multifaceted fine-grained features of tabular data, before inputting the tabular data into the frozen LLM. Our empirical studies confirm that the HTP framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, marking an advancement in the field of data visualization and analysis",

Current research primarily focuses on improving LLMs' cross-lingual generalization capabilities. However, there is still lacks of research on the intrinsic mechanisms of how LLMs achieve cross-lingual alignment. From the perspective of region partitioning, this paper conducts several investigations on the linguistic competence of LLMs.We discover a core region in LLMs that corresponds to linguistic competence, accounting for approximately 1% of the total model parameters. Removing this core region by setting parameters to zero results in a significant performance decrease across 30 different languages. Furthermore, this core region exhibits significant dimensional dependency, perturbations to even a single parameter on specific dimensions leading to a loss of linguistic competence. Moreover, we discover that distinct regions exist for different monolingual families, and disruption to these specific regions substantially reduces the LLMs' proficiency in those corresponding languages. Our research also indicates that freezing the core linguistic region during further pre-training can mitigate the issue of catastrophic forgetting (CF), a common occurrence observed during further pre-training of LLMs. Overall, exploring the LLMs' functional regions provides insights into the foundation of their intelligence",

When such potentially noisy setups lead to high accuracy rates (e.g., 90%+), it produces concerns about the authenticity of the results, raising questions about potential spurious correlations -- a phenomenon often referred to as \"Clever Hans\". We explore this phenomenon in the context of translationese classification, where previous work has found indirect and episodic evidence that a high-performance BERT classifier learns to use spurious topic information rather than just translationese signals. In this paper, we first use probing to provide direct evidence that high-performance translationese classifiers pick up unknown potentially spurious topic correlations. We then introduce adversarial training as a strategy to mitigate any such potentially spurious topic correlations, where previous work was only able to mitigate specific known (episodic) Clever Hans.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become a dominating strategy in steering Language Models (LMs) towards human values/goals. The key to the strategy is employing a reward model (ψ) which can reflect a latent reward model with humans. While this strategy has proven to be effective, the training methodology requires a lot of human preference annotation (usually of the order of tens of thousands) to train ψ. Such large-scale preference annotations can be achievable if the reward model can be ubiquitously used. However, human values/goals are subjective and depend on the nature of the task. This poses a challenge in collecting diverse preferences for downstream applications. To address this, we propose a novel methodology to infuse domain knowledge into ψ which reduces the size of preference annotation required. We validate our approach in E-Commerce Opinion Summarization, with a significant reduction in dataset size (just $940$ samples) while advancing the state-of-the-art.

    "abstract": "Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is extensively researched in the NLP community, yet related models face challenges due to data sparsity when shifting to a new domain. Hence, data augmentation for cross-domain ABSA has attracted increasing attention in recent years. However, two key points have been neglected in prior studies: First, target domain unlabeled data are labeled with pseudo labels by the model trained in the source domain with little quality control, leading to inaccuracy and error propagation. Second, the label and text patterns of generated labeled data are monotonous, thus limiting the robustness and generalization ability of trained ABSA models. In this paper, we aim to design a simple yet effective framework to address the above shortages in ABSA data augmentation, called Refining and Synthesis Data Augmentation (RSDA).

Second, it synthesizes diverse labeled data via novel label composition and paraphrase approaches.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Utilizing large language models to generate codes has shown promising meaning in software development revolution. Despite the intelligence shown by the general large language models, their specificity in code generation can still be improved due to the syntactic gap and mismatched vocabulary existing among natural language and different programming languages. In addition, programming languages are inherently logical and complex, making them hard to be correctly generated. Existing methods rely on multiple prompts to the large language model to explore better solutions, which is expensive.In this paper, we propose Syntax Graph Retrieval Augmented Code Generation (CodeGARG) to enhance the performance of LLMs in single-round code generation tasks. CodeGARG extracts and summarizes the control flow and data flow of code blocks to fill the gap between programming languages and natural language. The extracted external structural knowledge models the inherent flows of code blocks, which can facilitate LLMs for better understanding of code syntax and serve as a bridge among different programming languages. CodeGARG significantly improves the code generation ability of LLMs and can even offer performance gain for cross-lingual code generation, e.g., C++ for Python",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in Machine Translation (MT). However, careful evaluations by human reveal that the translations produced by LLMs still contain multiple errors. Importantly, feeding back such error information into the LLMs can lead to self-correction and result in improved translation performance. Motivated by these insights, we introduce a systematic LLM-based self-correcting translation framework, named TER, which stands for Translate, Estimate, and Refine, marking a significant step forward in this direction. Our findings demonstrate that 1) our self-correction framework successfully assists LLMs in improving their translation quality across a wide range of languages, whether it's from high-resource languages to low-resource ones or whether it's English-centric or centered around other languages; 2) TER exhibits superior systematicity and interpretability compared to previous methods; 3) different estimation strategies yield varied impacts on AI feedback, directly affecting the effectiveness of the final corrections. We further compare different LLMs and conduct various experiments involving self-correction and cross-model correction to investigate the potential relationship between the translation and evaluation capabilities of LLMs. The code will be made available upon publication",

    "title": "Efficient Detection of LLM-generated Texts with a Bayesian Surrogate Model",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "The detection of machine-generated text, especially from large language models (LLMs), is crucial in preventing serious social problems resulting from their misuse. Some methods train dedicated detectors on specific datasets but fall short in generalizing to unseen test data, while other zero-shot ones often yield suboptimal performance. Although the recent DetectGPT has shown promising detection performance, it suffers from significant inefficiency issues, as detecting a single candidate requires querying the source LLM with hundreds of its perturbations. This paper aims to bridge this gap. Concretely, we propose to incorporate a Bayesian surrogate model, which allows us to select typical samples based on Bayesian uncertainty and interpolate scores from typical samples to other samples, to improve query efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches under a low query budget. Notably, when detecting the text generated by LLaMA family models, our method with just 2 or 3 queries can outperform DetectGPT with 200 queries",

Recent studies have discovered that LLMs can achieve desirable performance with only a small amount of high-quality data, suggesting that a large amount of the data in these extensive datasets is redundant or even harmful. Identifying high-quality data from vast datasets to curate small yet effective datasets has emerged as a critical challenge. In this paper, we introduce SHED, an automated dataset refinement framework based on Shapley value for instruction fine-tuning. SHED eliminates the need for human intervention or the use of commercial LLMs. Moreover, the datasets curated through SHED exhibit transferability, indicating they can be reused across different models with consistently high performance. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the datasets curated by SHED. The results demonstrate the superiority of SHED compared to state-of-the-art methods across various tasks and models, i.e. only 10% of the original dataset selected by SHED achieves performance comparable to or even better than the original datasets",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Tools are essential for large language models (LLMs) to acquire up-to-date information and take consequential actions in external environments. Existing work on tool-augmented LLMs primarily focuses on the broad coverage of tools and the flexibility of adding new tools. However, a critical aspect that has surprisingly been understudied is simply how accurately an LLM uses tools for which it has been trained. We find that existing LLMs, including GPT-4 and open-source LLMs specifically fine-tuned for tool use, only reach a correctness rate in the range of 30% to 60%, far from reliable use in practice. We propose a biologically inspired method for tool-augmented LLMs, simulated trial and error (STE), that orchestrates three key mechanisms for successful tool use behaviors in the biological system: trial and error, imagination, and memory. Specifically, STE leverages an LLM's 'imagination' to simulate plausible scenarios for using a tool, after which the LLM interacts with the tool to learn from its execution feedback. Both short-term and long-term memory are employed to improve the depth and breadth of the exploration, respectively. Comprehensive experiments on ToolBench show that STE substantially improves tool learning for LLMs under both in-context learning and fine-tuning settings, bringing a boost of 46.7% to Mistral-Instruct-7B and enabling it to outperform GPT-4. We also show effective continual learning of tools via a simple experience replay strategy",

Our experiments reveal that almost none of the existing detectors remain robust under all the attacks, and all detectors exhibit different loopholes.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in automated code generation. Yet, incorporating LLM-based code generation into real-life software projects poses challenges, as the generated code may contain errors in API usage, class, data structure, or missing project-specific information. As much of this project-specific context cannot fit into the prompts of LLMs, we must find ways to allow the model to explore the project-level code context. To this end, this paper puts forward a novel approach, termed CoCoGen, which iteratively refines the project-level code context for precise code generation, guided by the compiler feedback. In particular, CoCoGen first leverages compiler techniques to identify a mismatch between the generated code and the project's context. It then iteratively aligns and fixes the identified errors using information extracted from the code repository. We integrate CoCoGen with two representative LLMs, i.e., GPT-3.5-Turbo and Code Llama (13B), and apply it to Python code generation. Experimental results show that CoCoGen significantly improves the vanilla LLMs by over 80% in generating code dependent on project context, and consistently outperforms the existing retrieval-based code generation baselines",

    "abstract": "The rise of multimodal misinformation on social platforms poses significant challenges for individuals and societies. Its increased credibility and broader impact compared to textual misinformation make detection complex, requiring robust reasoning across diverse media types and profound knowledge for accurate verification. The emergence of Large Vision Language Model (LVLM) offers a potential solution to this problem. Leveraging their proficiency in processing visual and textual information, LVLM demonstrates promising capabilities in recognizing complex information and exhibiting strong reasoning skills. In this paper, we first investigate the potential of LVLM on multimodal misinformation detection. We find that even though LVLM has a superior performance compared to LLMs, its profound reasoning may present limited power with a lack of evidence. Based on these observations, we propose LEMMA: LVLM-Enhanced Multimodal Misinformation Detection with External Knowledge Augmentation. LEMMA leverages LVLM intuition and reasoning capabilities while augmenting them with external knowledge to enhance the accuracy of misinformation detection.

    "abstract": "Discourse parsing, the task of analyzing the internal rhetorical structure of texts, is a challenging problem in natural language processing due to the complex linguistic structure and lack of large-scale and high-quality corpora, especially at the macro level. Recent studies have attempted to overcome this limitation by utilizing results from other NLP tasks (source task) to distantly supervise the discourse parsing (target task). However, most of them only consider shallow connections across tasks using result-converting methods. It brings more cascading errors and makes it difficult to continue training due to the heterogeneity of the source and target task. To address these issues, we propose a topic-driven distant supervision framework via transferring models. The key recipe of this framework is to transfer the topic segmentation model into a discourse parser by additionally considering the global structural correlation instead of a simple converting result algorithm for transferring knowledge. The experimental results on two RST-style datasets, in both Chinese (MCDTB) and English (RST-DT), demonstrate that our method outperforms strong baselines not only in distant-supervised scenarios but also in fully supervised settings",

To enhance the efficiency of the search process, we introduce a Predictive-Pruning Strategy (PPS). This strategy is designed to preemptively eliminate unpromising proxies, thereby mitigating the risk of proxy degradation.

It may benefit from the using of large language models (LLMs), given LLMs' strong capability on semantic understanding. However, the LLMs are learned by auto-regression, whose working mechanism is completely different from representing whole text as one discriminative embedding. Thus, it is imperative to study how to adapt LLMs properly so that they can be effectively initialized as the backbone encoder for dense retrieval. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, called \\textbf{LLaRA} (\\underline{LL}M \\underline{a}datpeted for dense \\underline{R}etriv\\underline{A}l), which performs unsupervised adaptation of LLM for its dense retrieval application.

With a moderate steps of adaptation, it substantially improves the model's fine-tuned performances on on a variety of dense retrieval benchmarks.

These agent tasks employ LLMs as the central controller responsible for planning, memorization, and tool utilization, necessitating both fine-grained prompting methods and robust LLMs to achieve satisfactory performance. Though many prompting methods have been proposed to complete particular agent tasks, there is lack of research focusing on improving the agent capabilities of LLMs themselves without compromising their general abilities. In this work, we present AgentTuning, a simple and general method to enhance the agent abilities of LLMs while maintaining their general LLM capabilities. We construct AgentInstruct, a lightweight instruction-tuning dataset containing high-quality interaction trajectories. We employ a hybrid instruction-tuning strategy by combining AgentInstruct with open-source instructions from general domains.

    "title": "Efficient $k$-Nearest-Neighbor Machine Translation with Dynamic Retrieval",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "To achieve non-parametric NMT domain adaptation, $k$-Nearest-Neighbor Machine Translation ($k$NN-MT) constructs an external datastore to store domain-specific translation knowledge, which derives a $k$NN distribution to interpolate the prediction distribution of the NMT model via a linear interpolation coefficient $\\lambda$. Despite its success, $k$NN retrieval at each timestep leads to substantial time overhead. To address this issue, dominant studies resort to $k$NN-MT with adaptive retrieval ($k$NN-MT-AR), which dynamically estimates $\\lambda$ and skips $k$NN retrieval if $\\lambda$ is less than a fixed threshold. Unfortunately, $k$NN-MT-AR does not yield satisfactory results. In this paper, we first conduct a preliminary study to reveal two key limitations of $k$NN-MT-AR: 1) the optimization gap leads to inaccurate estimation of $\\lambda$ for determining $k$NN retrieval skipping, and 2) using a fixed threshold fails to accommodate the dynamic demands for $k$NN retrieval at different timesteps. To mitigate these limitations, we then propose $k$NN-MT with dynamic retrieval ($k$NN-MT-DR) that significantly extends vanilla $k$NN-MT in two aspects. Firstly, we equip $k$NN-MT with a MLP-based classifier for determining whether to skip $k$NN retrieval at each timestep. Particularly, we explore several carefully-designed scalar features to fully exert the potential of the classifier. Secondly, we propose a timestep-aware threshold adjustment method to dynamically generate the threshold, which further improves the efficiency of our model. Experimental results on the widely-used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our model",

However, creating a benchmark involves many design decisions (e.g.,which datasets to include, which metrics to use) that often rely on tacit, untested assumptions about what the benchmark is actually measuring. There is currently no principled way of analyzing these decisions and how they impact the validity of the benchmark's measurements. To address this gap, we draw on evidence-centered design in educational assessments to propose ECBD (Evidence-Centered Benchmark Design). Our framework formalizes the benchmark design process into five modules and specifies the roles of each module and their interplay in collecting the evidence necessary to support the benchmark's measurement. We demonstrate the use of ECBD by conducting case studies with three benchmarks: BoolQ, SuperGLUE, and HELM. Our analysis reveals common trends in benchmark design and documentation that could threaten the validity of benchmarks' measurements",

We investigate the practical utility of two advanced planning methods, iterative correction and tree search. We present a comprehensive analysis of how discrimination accuracy affects the overall performance of agents when using these two methods or a simpler method, re-ranking. Experiments on two tasks, text-to-SQL parsing and mathematical reasoning, show that: (1) advanced planning methods demand discriminators with at least 90% accuracy to achieve significant improvements over re-ranking; (2) current LLMs' discrimination abilities have not met the needs of advanced planning methods to achieve such improvements; (3) with LLM-based discriminators, advanced planning methods may not adequately balance accuracy and efficiency. For example, compared to the other two methods, tree search is at least 10--20 times slower but leads to negligible performance gains, which hinders its real-world applications",

Moreover, we establish a new benchmark by compiling real-world tasks from 15 popular websites and introduce an automatic evaluation protocol leveraging multimodal understanding abilities of GPT-4V to evaluate open-ended web agents. We show that WebVoyager achieves a 59.1% task success rate on our benchmark, significantly surpassing the performance of both GPT-4 (All Tools) and the WebVoyager (text-only) setups, underscoring the exceptional capability of WebVoyager.

Previous work has shown success with a community-sourced, rather than crowd-sourced, approach to benchmark development. However, this work still required considerable effort from annotators with relevant lived experience. This paper explores whether an LLM (specifically, GPT-3.5-Turbo) can assist with the task of developing a bias benchmark dataset from responses to an open-ended community survey. We also extend the previous work to a new community and set of biases: the Jewish community and antisemitism. Our analysis shows that GPT-3.5-Turbo has poor performance on this annotation task and produces unacceptable quality issues in its output. Thus, we conclude that GPT-3.5-Turbo is not an appropriate substitute for human annotation in sensitive tasks related to social biases, and that its use actually negates many of the benefits of community-sourcing bias benchmarks",

Implicit hate speech, which employs indirect language to convey hateful intentions, occupies a significant portion of practice.

This paper delves into the capability of LLMs to detect implicit hate speech and express confidence in their responses. Our evaluation meticulously considers various prompt patterns and mainstream uncertainty estimation methods. Our findings highlight that LLMs exhibit two extremes: (1) LLMs display excessive sensitivity towards groups or topics that may cause fairness issues, resulting in misclassifying benign statements as hate speech. (2) LLMs' confidence scores for each method excessively concentrate on a fixed range, remaining unchanged regardless of the dataset's complexity. Consequently, the calibration performance is heavily reliant on primary classification accuracy. These discoveries unveil new limitations of LLMs, underscoring the need for caution when optimizing models to ensure they do not veer towards extremes.

Our findings reveal that (1) humans can consistently judge psychological depth despite its abstract nature; (2) despite being perceived as less \"human\", GPT-4 stories surpassed advanced human authors in 4 out of 5 dimensions of psychological depth, often by sizable margins; and (3) GPT-4 combined with a novel Mixture of Personas prompting strategy can moderately correlate (0.44) with human judgments of psychological depth.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Recent large-scale Text-To-Image (T2I) models such as DALLE-3 demonstrate great potential in new applications, but also face unprecedented fairness challenges. Prior studies revealed gender biases in single-person image generation, but T2I model applications might require portraying two or more people simultaneously. Potential biases in this setting remain unexplored, leading to fairness-related risks in usage. To study these underlying facets of gender biases in T2I models, we propose a novel Paired Stereotype Test (PST) bias evaluation framework. PST prompts the model to generate two individuals in the same image. They are described with two social identities that are stereotypically associated with the opposite gender. Biases can then be measured by the level of conformation to gender stereotypes in generated images. Using PST, we evaluate DALLE-3 from 2 perspectives: biases in gendered occupation and biases in organizational power. Despite seemingly fair or even anti-stereotype single-person generations, PST still unveils gendered occupational and power associations.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success across a wide range of natural language generation tasks, where proper prompt designs make great impacts. While existing prompting methods are normally restricted to providing correct information, in this paper, we encourage the model to deliberate by proposing a novel Deliberate then Generate (DTG) prompting framework, which consists of error detection instructions and candidates that may contain errors. DTG is a simple yet effective technique that can be applied to various text generation tasks with minimal modifications. We conduct extensive experiments on 20+ datasets across 7 text generation tasks, including summarization, translation, dialogue, and more. We show that DTG consistently outperforms existing prompting methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple text generation tasks. We also provide in-depth analyses to reveal the underlying mechanisms of DTG, which may inspire future research on prompting for LLMs",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Instruction tuning benefits from large and diverse datasets, however creating such datasets involves a high cost of human labeling. While synthetic datasets generated by large language models (LLMs) have partly solved this issue, they often contain low-quality data. One effective solution is selectively annotating unlabelled instructions, especially given the relative ease of acquiring unlabeled instructions or texts from diverse sources. However, how to select unlabelled instructions is not well-explored, especially in the context of LLMs. Further, traditional data selection methods, relying on input embedding space density, tend to underestimate instruction sample complexity, whereas those based on model prediction uncertainty often struggle with synthetic label quality. Therefore, we introduce SelectLLM, an alternative framework that leverages the capabilities of LLMs to more effectively select unlabeled instructions. SelectLLM consists of two key steps: Coreset-based clustering of unlabelled instructions for diversity and then prompting LLM to identify the most beneficial instructions within each cluster. Our experiments demonstrate that SelectLLM matches or outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in instruction tuning benchmarks. It exhibits remarkable consistency across human and synthetic datasets, along with better cross-dataset generalization, as evidenced by a 10\\% performance improvement on the Cleaned Alpaca test set when trained on Dolly data",

By integrating interactive coding and execution feedback, EHRAgent learns from error messages and improves the originally generated code through iterations. Furthermore, we enhance the LLM agent by incorporating long-term memory, which allows EHRAgent to effectively select and build upon the most relevant successful cases from past experiences. Experiments on three real-world multi-tabular EHR datasets show that EHRAgent outperforms the strongest baseline by up to 29.6% in success rate.

Research has indicated that excessive diacritic marks can hinder skilled readers---reducing reading speed and accuracy. We conduct a behavioral experiment and show that partially marked text is often easier to read than fully marked text, and sometimes easier than plain text. In this light, we introduce Context-Contrastive Partial Diacritization (CCPD)---a novel approach to PD which integrates seamlessly with existing Arabic diacritization systems. CCPD processes each word twice, once with context and once without, and diacritizes only the characters with disparities between the two inferences. Further, we introduce novel indicators for measuring partial diacritization quality to help establish this as a machine learning task.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are known to effectively perform tasks by simply observing few exemplars. However, in low-resource languages, obtaining such hand-picked exemplars can still be challenging, where unsupervised techniques may be necessary. Moreover, competent generative capabilities of LLMs are observed only in high-resource languages, while their performances among under-represented languages fall behind due to pre-training data imbalance. To elicit LLMs' ability onto low-resource languages without any supervised data, we propose to assemble synthetic exemplars from a diverse set of high-resource languages to prompt the LLMs to translate from any language into English. These prompts are then used to create intra-lingual exemplars to perform tasks in the target languages. Our unsupervised prompting method performs on par with supervised few-shot learning in LLMs of different sizes for translations between English and 13 Indic and 21 African low-resource languages. We also show that fine-tuning a 7B model on data generated from our method helps it perform competitively with a 175B model. In non-English translation tasks, our method even outperforms supervised prompting by up to 3 chrF++ in many low-resource languages.

Importantly, our method requires a smaller memory with only $256$ bytes of vocabulary while keeping efficiency with the same input length as usual. Thus, our solution outperforms conventional approaches by preserving privacy without sacrificing efficiency or accuracy. Our experiments show SEB can effectively protect against embedding-based attacks from recovering original sentences in federated learning. Meanwhile, we verify that SEB obtains comparable and even more accurate prediction results over standard subword embedding methods in machine translation, sentiment analysis, and language modeling with even lower time and space complexity",

However, it can fall short in specific scenarios where simple customized methods excel. In this paper, we delve into the patent approval prediction task and unveil that simple domain-specific graph methods outperform enlarging the model, using the intrinsic dependencies within the patent data. Specifically, we first extend the embedding-based state-of-the-art (SOTA) by scaling up its backbone model with various sizes of open-source LLMs, then explore prompt-based methods to harness proprietary LLMs' potential, but find the best results close to random guessing, underlining the ineffectiveness of model scaling-up. Hence, we propose a novel Fine-grained cLAim depeNdency (FLAN) Graph through meticulous patent data analyses, capturing the inherent dependencies across segments of the patent text. As it is model-agnostic, we apply cost-effective graph models to our FLAN Graph to obtain representations for approval prediction.

We introduce the adversarial grade school math (GSM-Plus) dataset, an extension of GSM8K augmented with various mathematical perturbations. Our experiments on 25 LLMs and 4 prompting techniques show that while LLMs exhibit different levels of math reasoning abilities, their performances are far from robust. In particular, even for problems that have been solved in GSM8K, LLMs can make mistakes when new statements are added or the question targets are altered.

Moreover, since PLMs are not trained on KGs, directly using PLMs to encode triples is inappropriate. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel model called Bridge, which jointly encodes structural and semantic information of KGs. Specifically, we strategically encode entities and relations separately by PLMs to better utilize the semantic knowledge of PLMs and enable structured representation learning via a structural learning principle. Furthermore, to bridge the gap between KGs and PLMs, we employ a self-supervised representation learning method called BYOL to fine-tune PLMs with two different views of a triple.

The impact on language modeling ability can be alleviated given a high-quality and long-contextualized debiasing corpus, but there remains a deficiency in understanding the specifics of relearning biases. We empirically ascertain that the effectiveness of task-agnostic debiasing hinges on the quantitative bias level of both the task-specific data used for downstream applications and the debiased model. We empirically show that the lower bound of the bias level of the downstream fine-tuned model is the bias level of the debiased model, in most practical cases. To gain more in-depth understanding about how the parameters of PLMs change during fine-tuning due to the forgetting issue of PLMs, we propose a novel framework which can Propagate Socially-fair Debiasing to Downstream Fine-tuning, ProSocialTuning. Our proposed framework can push the fine-tuned model to approach the bias lower bound during downstream fine-tuning, indicating that the ineffectiveness of debiasing can be alleviated by overcoming the forgetting issue through regularizing successfully debiased attention heads based on the PLMs' bias levels from stages of pretraining and debiasing",

This limitation hampers our understanding of how LLMs utilize context in complex problem-solving. In this study, we introduce the ICLEval benchmark to assess the ICL abilities of LLMs systematically. We evaluate two fundamental abilities: copying and learning. We also investigate the impact of model size, pretraining stage, and other factors on ICL abilities.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Generative models, widely utilized in various applications, can often struggle with prompts corresponding to partial tokens. This struggle stems from tokenization, where partial tokens fall out of distribution during inference, leading to incorrect or nonsensical outputs. This paper examines a technique to alleviate the tokenization artifact on text completion in generative models, maintaining performance even in regular non-subword cases. The method, termed token alignment, involves backtracking to the last complete tokens and ensuring the model's generation aligns with the prompt. This approach showcases marked improvement across many partial token scenarios, including nuanced cases like space-prefix and partial indentation, with only a minor time increase. The technique and analysis detailed in this paper contribute to the continuous advancement of generative models in handling partial inputs, bearing relevance for applications like code completion and text autocompletion",

    "title": "Multistage Collaborative Knowledge Distillation from a Large Language Model for Semi-Supervised Sequence Generation",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "We study semi-supervised sequence generation tasks, where the few labeled examples are too scarce to finetune a model, and meanwhile, few-shot prompted large language models (LLMs) exhibit room for improvement. These tasks, such as parsing, are both expensive to annotate and under-represented in the LLM pretraining. In this paper, we present the discovery that the student model distilled from a few-shot prompted LLM can commonly generalize better than its teacher to unseen examples on such a task. Our analysis indicates that this happens because the student can learn a general pattern from the high-quality pseudolabels produced by the teacher, while helpfully not learning a pattern for the low-quality ones.Leveraging this discovery, we propose a new method, Multistage Collaborative Knowledge Distillation from an LLM (MCKD), for these tasks. MCKD first few-shot prompts an LLM to produce pseudolabels for unlabeled data. Then at each stage of an iterative KD process, a new pair of students is trained on disjoint partitions of the pseudolabeled data, and produces new and improved pseudolabels for their unseen partitions. We show the effectiveness of MCKD on four syntactic and semantic parsing datasets. On CRAFT biomedical parsing, for example, 3-stage MCKD with 50 labeled examples outperforms an LLM teacher and vanilla KD by 7.5% and 3.7% parsing F1, respectively, and matches the performance of supervised finetuning with 500 examples",

    "title": "The Counterfeit Conundrum: Can Code Models Grasp the Nuances of Their Incorrect Generations?",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "While language models are increasingly more proficient at code generation, they still frequently generate incorrect programs. Many of these programs are obviously wrong, but others are more subtle and pass weaker correctness checks such as being able to compile. In this work, we focus on these counterfeit samples: programs sampled from a language model that 1) have a high enough log-probability to be generated at a moderate temperature and 2) pass weak correctness checks. Overall, we discover that most models have a very shallow understanding of counterfeits through three clear failure modes. First, models mistakenly classify them as correct. Second, models are worse at reasoning about the execution behaviour of counterfeits and often predict their execution results as if they were correct. Third, when asking models to fix counterfeits, the likelihood of a model successfully repairing a counterfeit is often even lower than that of sampling a correct program from scratch. Counterfeits also have very unexpected properties: first, counterfeit programs for problems that are easier for a model to solve are not necessarily easier to detect and only slightly easier to execute and repair. Second, counterfeits from a given model are just as confusing to the model itself as they are to other models. Finally, both strong and weak models are able to generate counterfeit samples that equally challenge all models. In light of our findings, we recommend that care and caution be taken when relying on models to understand their own samples, especially when no external feedback is incorporated",

    "abstract": "The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought to light promising language generation capabilities, particularly in performing tasks like complex reasoning and creative writing. Consequently, distillation through imitation of teacher responses has emerged as a popular technique to transfer knowledge from LLMs to more accessible, Small Language Models (SLMs). While this works well for simpler tasks, there is a substantial performance gap on tasks requiring intricate language comprehension and creativity, such as humor generation. We hypothesize that this gap may stem from the fact that creative tasks might be hard to learn by imitation alone and explore whether an approach, involving supplementary guidance from the teacher, could yield higher performance. To address this, we study the effect of assigning a dual role to the LLM - as a \"teacher\" generating data, as well as a \"critic\" evaluating the student's performance. Our experiments on humor generation reveal that the incorporation of feedback significantly narrows the performance gap between SLMs and their larger counterparts compared to merely relying on imitation. As a result, our research highlights the potential of using feedback as an additional dimension to data when transferring complex language abilities via distillation",

However, the lack of objective measures to evaluate editorial choices makes research in this area particularly difficult. In this paper, we argue that there are newsworthy topics where objective measures exist in the form of supporting data and propose a computational framework to analyze editorial choices in this setup. We focus on the economy because the reporting of economic indicators presents us with a relatively easy way to determine both the selection and framing of various publications. Their values provide a ground truth of how the economy is doing relative to how the publications choose to cover it. To do this, we define frame prediction as a set of interdependent tasks. At the article level, we learn to identify the reported stance towards the general state of the economy. Then, for every numerical quantity reported in the article, we learn to identify whether it corresponds to an economic indicator and whether it is being reported in a positive or negative way. To perform our analysis, we track six American publishers and each article that appeared in the top 10 slots of their landing page between 2015 and 2023",

By compiling a benchmark, UnknownBench, which consists of both unanswerable and answerable questions, we quantitatively evaluate the LLMs' performance in maintaining honesty while being helpful. Using a model-agnostic unified confidence elicitation approach, we observe that most LLMs fail to consistently refuse or express high uncertainty towards questions outside their parametric knowledge, although instruction fine-tuning and alignment techniques can provide marginal enhancements. Moreover, LLMs' uncertainty expression does not always stay consistent with the perceived confidence of their direct responses. We will release our data and code",

Thus, the resulting model can judge preferences of on-the-fly responses from current policy initialized from itself.

ChOiRe consists of (i) an LM analyzing the user's explicit personae to filter out irrelevant attributes; (ii) the LM ranking the implicit persona opinions into a preferential list; (iii) Chain-of-Opinion (CoO) reasoning, where the LM sequentially analyzes the explicit personae and the most relevant implicit personae to perform opinion prediction; (iv) and where ChOiRe executes Step (iii)'s CoO multiple times with increasingly larger lists of implicit personae to overcome insufficient personae information to infer a final result.

When choosing a binomial ordering (radios and televisions vs televisions and radios), humans rely on more than simply the observed frequency of each option. Humans also rely on abstract preferences beyond the specific binomials themselves (e.g., preferences for short words before long words). We investigate whether large language models simply rely on the observed preference in their training data, or whether they are capable of learning the generative preferences (i.e., abstract representations) that humans rely on. Our results suggest that smaller models are simply copying their training data, but larger models are capable of learning generative preferences. Further, similar to humans, the larger models rely more on generative preferences for low frequency items than high frequency items. Our study provides further insight into large language models' abilities to learn abstract representations of language structure and use",

    "title": "Efficient Tool Use with Chain-of-Abstraction Reasoning",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "To achieve faithful reasoning that aligns with human expectations, large language models (LLMs) need to ground their reasoning to real-world knowledge (e.g., web facts, math and physical rules). Tools help LLMs access this external knowledge, but there remains challenges for fine-tuning LLM agents (e.g., Toolformer) to invoke tools in multi-step reasoning problems, where inter-connected tool calls require holistic and efficient tool usage planning.In this work, we propose a new method for LLMs to better leverage tools in multi-step reasoning. Our method, Chain-of-Abstraction (CoA), trains LLMs to first decode reasoning chains with abstract placeholders, and then call domain tools to reify each reasoning chain by filling in specific knowledge. This planning with abstract chains enables LLMs to learn more general reasoning strategies, which are robust to shifts of domain knowledge (e.g., math results) relevant to different reasoning questions. It also allows LLMs to perform decoding and calling of external tools in parallel, which avoids the inference delay caused by waiting for tool responses. In mathematical reasoning and Wiki QA domains, we show that our method consistently outperforms previous chain-of-thought and tool-augmented baselines on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution test sets, with an average ~6% absolute QA accuracy improvement. LLM agents trained with our method also show more efficient tool use, with inference speed being on average ~1.4x faster than baseline tool-augmented LLMs",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to expensive human evaluations. However, the alignment and coverage of LLM-based evaluations are often limited by the scope and potential bias of the evaluation prompts and criteria. To address this challenge, we propose HD-Eval, a novel framework that iteratively aligns LLM-based evaluators with human preference via Hierarchical Criteria Decomposition. HD-Eval inherits the essence from the evaluation mindset of human experts and enhances the alignment of LLM-based evaluators by decomposing a given evaluation task into finer-grained criteria, aggregating them according to estimated human preferences, pruning insignificant criteria with attribution, and further decomposing significant criteria. By integrating these steps within an iterative alignment training process, we obtain a hierarchical decomposition of criteria that comprehensively captures aspects of natural language at multiple levels of granularity. Implemented as a white box, the human preference-guided aggregator is efficient to train and more explainable than relying solely on prompting, and its independence from model parameters makes it applicable to closed-source LLMs. Extensive experiments on three evaluation domains demonstrate the superiority of HD-Eval in further aligning state-of-the-art evaluators and providing deeper insights into the explanation of evaluation results and the task itself",

The benchmark has demonstrated preliminary success in using pre-trained speech foundation models (SFM) for these SLU tasks. However, the community still lacks a fine-grained understanding of the comparative utility of different SFMs. Inspired by this, we ask: which SFMs offer the most benefits for these complex SLU tasks, and what is the most effective approach for incorporating these SFMs? To answer this, we perform an extensive evaluation of multiple supervised and self-supervised SFMs using several evaluation protocols: (i) frozen SFMs with a lightweight prediction head, (ii) frozen SFMs with a complex prediction head, and (iii) fine-tuned SFMs with a lightweight prediction head. Although the supervised SFMs are pre-trained on much more data and with labels, they do not always outperform self-supervised SFMs; the latter tend to perform at least as well as, and sometimes better than, supervised SFMs on the sequence generation tasks in SLUE. While there is no universally optimal way of incorporating SFMs, the complex prediction head gives the best performance for most tasks, although it increases the inference time. We also introduce an open-source toolkit and performance leaderboard, SLUE-PERB, for these tasks and modeling strategies",

In this study, we propose GradSafe, which effectively detects unsafe prompts by scrutinizing the gradients of safety-critical parameters in LLMs. Our methodology is grounded in a pivotal observation: the gradients of an LLM's loss for unsafe prompts paired with compliance response on certain safety-critical parameters exhibit consistent patterns. In contrast, safe prompts lead to markedly different gradient patterns. Building on this observation, GradSafe analyzes the gradients from prompts (paired with compliance responses) to accurately detect unsafe prompts. We show that GradSafe, applied to Llama-2 without further training, outperforms Llama Guard—despite its extensive finetuning with a large dataset—in detecting unsafe prompts.

    "abstract": "Hallucination is a common problem for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) with long generations which is difficult to eradicate. The generation with hallucinations is partially inconsistent with the image content. To mitigate hallucination, current studies either focus on the process of model inference or the results of model generation, but the solutions they design sometimes do not deal appropriately with various types of queries and the hallucinations of the generations about these queries. To accurately deal with various hallucinations, we present a zero-shot unified framework, Dentist, for hallucination mitigation. The core step is to first classify the queries, then perform different processes of hallucination mitigation based on the classification result, just like a dentist first observes the teeth and then makes a plan. In a simple deployment, Dentist can classify queries as perception or reasoning and easily mitigate hallucinations in answers which has been demonstrated in our experiments. On MMbench, we achieved a 13.44%/10.2%/15.8% improvement on Image Quality, a Coarse Perception visual question answering (VQA) task, over the baseline InstructBLIP/LLaVA/VisualGLM.

Prior works utilize verification properties in software engineering to verify and re-rank solutions in a majority voting manner. But the assumption behind them that generated verification properties have better qualities than solutions may not always hold. In this paper, we treat them equally as different perspectives of LLMs' reasoning processes. We propose the Multi-Perspective Self-Consistency (MPSC) framework incorporating both inter- and intra-consistency across outputs from multiple perspectives. Specifically, we prompt LLMs to generate diverse outputs from three perspectives, Solution, Specification and Test case, constructing a 3-partite graph. With two measure functions of consistency, we embed both inter- and intra-consistency information into the graph. The optimal choice of solutions is then determined based on analysis in the graph.

    "abstract": "With the growing use of Transformer models hosted on cloud platforms to offer inference services, privacy concerns are escalating, especially concerning sensitive data like investment plans and bank account details. Secure Multi-Party Computing (SMPC) emerges as a promising solution to protect the privacy of inference data and model parameters. However, the application of SMPC in Privacy-Preserving Inference (PPI) for Transformer models, often leads to considerable slowdowns or declines in performance. This is largely due to the multitude of nonlinear operations in the Transformer architecture, which are not well-suited to SMPC and difficult to circumvent or optimize effectively. To address this concern, we introduce a comprehensive PPI framework called SecFormer to achieve fast and accurate PPI for Transformer models. We successfully eliminate the high-cost exponential and maximum operations in PPI without sacrificing model performance and developed a suite of efficient SMPC protocols by employing suitable numerical computation methods to boost other complex nonlinear functions in PPI, including GeLU, LayerNorm, and a redesigned Softmax. Our extensive experiments reveal that SecFormer outperforms MPCFormer in performance, showing improvements of $3.4\\%$ and $24.7\\%$ for BERT$_{\\text{BASE}}$ and BERT$_{\\text{LARGE}}$, respectively. In terms of efficiency, SecFormer is 3.57 and 3.58 times faster than PUMA for BERT$_{\\text{BASE}}$ and BERT$_{\\text{LARGE}}$, demonstrating its effectiveness and speed",

However, conventional MoE architectures like GShard, which activate the top-$K$ out of $N$ experts, face challenges in ensuring expert specialization, i.e. each expert acquires non-overlapping and focused knowledge. In response, we propose the DS-MoE architecture towards ultimate expert specialization. It involves two principal strategies: (1) finely segmenting the experts into $mN$ ones and activating $mK$ from them, allowing for a more flexible combination of activated experts; (2) isolating $K_s$ experts as shared ones, aiming at capturing common knowledge and mitigating redundancy in routed experts. Starting from a modest scale with 2B parameters, we demonstrate that DS-MoE 2B achieves comparable performance with GShard 2.9B, which has 1.5$\\times$ expert parameters and computation. In addition, DS-MoE 2B nearly approaches the performance of its dense counterpart with the same number of total parameters, which sets the upper bound of MoE models. Subsequently, we scale up DS-MoE to 16B parameters and show that it achieves comparable performance with DeepSeek 7B and LLaMA2 7B, with only about 40% of computations",

Several methods have been developed to detect such text by semantically comparing it with the multiple versions probabilistically regenerated. However, a significant issue is that if the storyline of each regenerated text changes, the generated texts become incomparable, which worsen detection accuracy.In this paper, we propose a hallucination detection method that incorporates a multiple-fill-in-the-blank exam approach to address this storyline-changing issue. First, our method creates a multiple-fill-in-the-blank exam by masking multiple objects from the original text. Second, prompts an LLM to repeatedly answer this exam. This approach ensures that the storylines of the exam answers align with the original ones. Finally, quantifies the degree of hallucination for each original sentence by scoring the exam answers, considering the potential for hallucination snowballing within the original text itself.

I.e., prompt loss can be safely ignored for many datasets. For short-completion data, small values (0.01-0.1) of PLW were optimal for multiple-choice and short-generation tasks while large values (≈ 1.0) of PLW were optimal for long-generation tasks.

To address this challenge, we introduce a novel dataset selection method, Self-Filter, that utilizes the VLM itself as a filter. This approach is inspired by the observation that VLMs benefit from training with the most challenging instructions. Self-Filter operates in two stages. In the first stage, we devise a scoring network to evaluate the difficulty of training instructions, which is co-trained with the VLM. In the second stage, we use the trained score net to measure the difficulty of each instruction, select the most challenging samples, and penalize similar samples to encourage diversity. Comprehensive experiments on LLaVA and MiniGPT-4 show that Self-Filter can reach better results compared to full data settings with merely about 15% samples, and can achieve superior performance against competitive baselines",

In this paper, we investigate this problem by identifying and analyzing task-encoding tokens on whose representations the task performance depends. Using experiments that ablate the representations of different token types, we find that template and stopword tokens are the most prone to be task-encoding. In addition, we demonstrate experimentally that lexical meaning, repetition, and text formatting are the main distinguishing characteristics of these tokens.

    "abstract": "Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has emerged as an effective method for adapting pre-trained language models to various tasks efficiently. Recently, there has been a growing interest in transferring knowledge from one or multiple tasks to the downstream target task to achieve performance improvements. However, current approaches typically either train adapters on individual tasks or distill shared knowledge from source tasks, failing to fully exploit task-specific knowledge and the correlation between source and target tasks. To overcome these limitations, we propose PEMT, a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework based on multi-task transfer learning. PEMT extends the mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework to capture the transferable knowledge as a weighted combination of adapters trained on source tasks. These weights are determined by a gated unit, measuring the correlation between the target and each source task using task description prompt vectors. To fully exploit the task-specific knowledge, we also propose the Task Sparsity Loss to improve the sparsity of the gated unit. We conduct experiments on a broad range of tasks over 17 datasets. The experimental results demonstrate our PEMT yields stable improvements over full fine-tuning, and state-of-the-art PEFT and knowledge transferring methods on various tasks. The results highlight the effectiveness of our method which is capable of sufficiently exploiting the knowledge and correlation features across multiple tasks",

    "abstract": "Large-scale vision language models (LVLMs) are language models that are capable of processing images and text inputs by a single model. This paper explores the use of LVLMs to generate review texts for images. The ability of LVLMs to review images is not fully understood, highlighting the need for a methodical evaluation of their review abilities. Unlike image captions, review texts can be written from various perspectives such as image composition and exposure. This diversity of review perspectives makes it difficult to uniquely determine a single correct review for an image. To address this challenge, we introduce an evaluation method based on rank correlation analysis, in which review texts are ranked by humans and LVLMs, then measures the correlation between these rankings. We further validate this approach by creating a benchmark dataset aimed at assessing the image review ability of recent LVLMs. Our experiments with the dataset reveal that LVLMs, particularly those with proven superiority in other evaluative contexts, excel at distinguishing between high-quality and substandard image reviews",

Yet, only a few studies focus on fair text embeddings, which are crucial yet challenging for real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a novel method for learning fair text embeddings. We achieve fairness while maintaining utility trade-off by ensuring conditional independence between sensitive attributes and text embeddings conditioned on the content. Specifically, we enforce that embeddings of texts with different sensitive attributes but identical content maintain the same distance toward the embedding of their corresponding neutral text. Furthermore, we address the issue of lacking proper training data by using Large Language Models (LLMs) to augment texts into different sensitive groups.

However, they usually encounter linguistic noises, such as errors in synthetic data and biases in auxiliary language pairs.We argue that large language models (LLMs) mitigate UNMT's linguistic noises by dynamically organizing auxiliary languages in prompts to improve LRL translations. In this paper, we propose PrObability-driven Meta-graph Prompter (POMP), an approach employing a dynamic graph to organize multiple auxiliary languages, to prompt LLMs in LRL translations. POMP proposes a language-specific meta-graph that dynamically samples multiple translation paths to organize auxiliary languages in constructing prompts. Following the path, POMP prompts LLMs with a mixture of auxiliary languages to translate. We achieve the meta-graph's evolution by back-propagating evaluation scores to update probabilities on the graph.Our experimental improvements show POMP's effectiveness on LRLs' translation",

As such, they are inadequate to demonstrate the fine-grained ability of models, particularly the robustness to varying readability degrees.

OR-CodeSum innovatively introduces the construction rules of obfuscation code into the testing process, considering semantic, syntactic, and cross-obfuscation robustness of code summarization tasks. Our robustness evaluation reveals that the current code summarization models rely heavily on the readability of the code while not paying enough attention to the syntactic information.

In the scenario of LLMs, problems like poor attack effectiveness and slow attack speed become more pronounced in traditional adversarial attack methods.

In this work, we investigate the potential of LLMs for producing hierarchical organizations of scientific studies to assist researchers with literature review. We define hierarchical organizations as tree structures where nodes refer to topical categories and every node is linked to the studies assigned to that category. Our naive LLM-based pipeline for hierarchy generation from a set of studies produces promising yet imperfect hierarchies, motivating us to collect CHIME, an expert-curated dataset for this task focused on biomedicine. Given the challenging and time-consuming nature of building hierarchies from scratch, we use a human-in-the-loop process in which experts correct errors (both links between categories and study assignment) in LLM-generated hierarchies. CHIME contains 2,174 LLM-generated hierarchies covering 472 topics, and expert-corrected hierarchies for a subset of 100 topics. Expert corrections allow us to quantify LLM performance, and we find that while they are quite good at generating and organizing categories, their assignment of studies to categories could be improved. We attempt to train a corrector model with human feedback which improves study assignment by 12.6 F1 points.

Various efforts have been proposed to enhance the capability of LLMs to process and comprehend long-context textual information, expanding the context window to accommodate even up to 200K input tokens. Meanwhile, building high-quality benchmarks with much longer text lengths and more demanding tasks to provide comprehensive evaluations is of immense practical interest to facilitate long context understanding research of LLMs. However, prior benchmarks create datasets that ostensibly cater to long-text comprehension by expanding the input of traditional tasks, which falls short to exhibit the unique characteristics of long-text understanding, including long dependency tasks and longer text length compatible with modern LLMs' context window length. In this paper, we introduce a benchmark for eXtremely Long context understanding with Long-range dependencies, XL$^2$Bench, which includes three scenarios—Fiction Reading, Paper Reading, and Law Reading—and four tasks of increasing complexity: Memory Retrieval, Detailed Understanding, Overall Understanding, and Open-ended Generation, covering 27 subtasks in English and Chinese.

Our investigation has multiple key findings: First, we show that LoRA exhibits robustness to random noise similar to full fine-tuning on balanced data, but unlike full fine-tuning, LoRA does not overfit the noisy data. Second, we observe that compared to full fine-tuning, LoRA forgets significantly fewer data points as noise increases. Third, studying how these robustness patterns change as training data becomes imbalanced, we observe that Transformers struggle with imbalanced data, with robustness declining as imbalance worsens. This study highlights LoRA's promise in real-world settings with noise and data imbalance. Overall, our findings reveal LoRA as a robust and efficient alternative for fine-tuning, shedding light on its distinctive characteristics",

Our experiments on different MuST-C and CoVoST ST benchmarks demonstrate that AmbigST sets new performance standards.

This leads to poor performance in real-world atypical scenarios where such features are absent. This paper presents ASPIRE (Language-guided Data Augmentation for SPurIous correlation REmoval), a simple yet effective solution for supplementing the training dataset with images without spurious features, for robust learning against spurious correlations via better generalization. ASPIRE, guided by language at various steps, can generate non-spurious images without requiring any group labeling or existing non-spurious images in the training set. Precisely, we employ LLMs to first extract foreground and background features from textual descriptions of an image, followed by advanced language-guided image editing to discover the features that are spuriously correlated with the class label. Finally, we personalize a text-to-image generation model using the edited images to generate diverse in-domain images without spurious features. ASPIRE is complementary to all prior robust training methods in literature, and we demonstrate its effectiveness across 4 datasets and 9 baselines and show that ASPIRE improves the worst-group classification accuracy of prior methods by 1% - 38%.

    "title": "Retrieval-Augmented Data Augmentation for Low-Resource Domain Tasks",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Despite large successes of recent language models on diverse tasks, they suffer from severe performance degeneration in low-resource settings with limited training data available. Many existing works tackle this problem by generating synthetic data from the training data and then training models on them, recently using Large Language Models (LLMs). However, in low-resource settings, the amount of seed data samples to use for data augmentation is very small, which makes generated samples suboptimal and less diverse. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel method that augments training data by incorporating a wealth of examples from other datasets, along with the given training data. Specifically, we first retrieve the relevant instances from other datasets, such as their input-output pairs or contexts, based on their similarities with the given seed data, and then prompt LLMs to generate new samples with the contextual information within and across the original and retrieved samples. This approach can ensure that the generated data is not only relevant but also more diverse than what could be achieved using the limited seed data alone. We validate our proposed Retrieval-Augmented Data Augmentation (RADA) framework on multiple datasets under low-resource settings of training and test-time data augmentation scenarios, on which it outperforms existing LLM-powered data augmentation baselines",

    "abstract": "Enhancing the attribution in large language models (LLMs) is a crucial task. One feasible approach is to enable LLMs to cite external sources that support their generations. However, existing datasets and evaluation methods in this domain still exhibit notable limitations. In this work, we formulate the task of attributed query-focused summarization (AQFS) and present WebCiteS, a Chinese dataset featuring 7k human-annotated summaries with citations. WebCiteS derives from real-world user queries and web search results, offering a valuable resource for model training and evaluation. Prior works in attribution evaluation do not differentiate between groundedness errors and citation errors. They also fall short in automatically verifying sentences that draw partial support from multiple sources. We tackle these issues by developing detailed metrics and enabling the automatic evaluator to decompose the sentences into sub-claims for fine-grained verification. Our comprehensive evaluation of both open-source and proprietary models on WebCiteS highlights the challenge LLMs face in correctly citing sources, underscoring the necessity for further improvement. The dataset and code will be open-sourced to facilitate further research in this crucial field",

    "title": "Multimodal Instruction Tuning with Conditional Mixture of LoRA",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in diverse tasks across different domains, with an increasing focus on improving their zero-shot generalization capabilities for unseen multimodal tasks. Multimodal instruction tuning has emerged as a successful strategy for achieving zero-shot generalization by fine-tuning pre-trained models on diverse multimodal tasks through instructions. As MLLMs grow in complexity and size, the need for parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like Low-Rank Adaption (LoRA), which fine-tunes with a minimal set of parameters, becomes essential. However, applying LoRA in multimodal instruction tuning presents the challenge of task interference, which leads to performance degradation, especially when dealing with a broad array of multimodal tasks. To address this, this paper introduces a novel approach that integrates multimodal instruction tuning with Conditional Mixture-of-LoRA (MixLoRA). It innovates upon LoRA by dynamically constructing low-rank adaptation matrices tailored to the unique demands of each input instance, aiming to mitigate task interference. Experimental results on various multimodal evaluation datasets indicate that MixLoRA not only outperforms the conventional LoRA with the same or even higher ranks, demonstrating its efficacy and adaptability in diverse multimodal tasks",

    "abstract": "Red teaming is an effective approach for identifying misaligned behaviors in large language models (LLMs). Existing red teaming typically involves the manual creation of test cases by organized human teams, but the prohibitive costs significantly constrain the scalability of these tests.

However, most of them are limited to single-turn red teaming and only generate test cases with a limited coverage.

We develop a two-mode human evaluation procedure to measure both correctness and hallucination, which we use to benchmark both closed and open-source LLMs by collecting >50K human judgments.

Since it has been verified that LLMs can be induced to generate harmful or inaccurate content through specific test cases (termed as Red Teaming), how VLMs perform in similar scenarios, especially with their combination of textual and visual inputs, remains a question. To explore this problem, we present a novel red teaming dataset RTVLM, which encompasses 12 subtasks (e.g., image misleading, multi-modal jailbreaking, face fairness, etc) under 4 primary aspects (faithfulness, privacy, safety, fairness). Our RTVLM is the first red teaming dataset to benchmark current VLMs in terms of these 4 different aspects. Detailed analysis shows that 10 prominent open-sourced VLMs struggle with the red teaming in different degrees and have up to 31% performance gap with GPT-4V. Additionally, we simply apply red teaming alignment to LLaVA-v1.5 with Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) using RTVLM, and this bolsters the models' performance with 10% in RTVLM test set, 13% in MM-hallu, and without noticeable decline in MM-Bench, overpassing other LLaVA-based models in similar size with regular alignment data. This reveals that current open-sourced VLMs still lack red teaming alignment. Our code and datasets will be open-sourced",

Existing studies find VH instances only in existing image datasets, which results in biased understanding of MLLMs' performance under VH due to limited diversity of such VH instances. In this work, we propose a tool called VHTest to generate a diverse set of VH instances. Specifically, VHTest finds some initial VH instances in existing image datasets (e.g., COCO), generates a text description for each VH mode, and uses a text-to-image model (e.g., DALL-E-3) to generate VH images based on the text descriptions. We collect a benchmark dataset with 1,200 VH instances in 8 VH modes using VHTest. We find that existing MLLMs such as GPT-4, LLaVA-1.5, and MiniGPT-v2 hallucinate for a large fraction of the instances in our benchmark.

To address this, we propose a soft deduplication method that maintains dataset integrity while selectively reducing the sampling weight of data with high commonness. Central to our approach is the concept of \"data commonness\", a metric we introduce to quantify the degree of duplication by measuring the occurrence probabilities of samples using an n-gram model. Empirical analysis shows that this method significantly improves training efficiency, achieving comparable perplexity scores with at least a 26\\% reduction in required training steps. Additionally, it enhances average few-shot downstream accuracy by 1.77\\% when trained for an equivalent duration.

Moreover, we find modern LLMs possess strong cross-lingual transfer capabilities, thus repeatedly learning identical content in various languages is not necessary. Consequently, we can substantially prune the language-agnostic supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data without any performance degradation, making multilingual SFT more efficient.

However, modality alignment between speech and text remains an open problem. Current solutions can be categorized into cascaded approaches, which limit the interaction between speech and LLMs, and end-to-end approaches that rely on scarce speech instruction data. In this paper, we propose the BLSP approach that Bootstraps Language-Speech Pre-training via behavior alignment, leveraging existing ASR training data. We achieve this by developing a lightweight modality adapter between a frozen speech encoder and an LLM, optimized to ensure that the LLM exhibits the same generation behavior irrespective of the modality of input: a speech segment or its transcript. We primarily focus on the continuation writing behavior as it closely resembles next-token prediction in a broad sense but also found that introducing other behaviors could lead to improved performance. We demonstrate that this simple process can extend the capabilities of LLMs to speech and achieve competitive performance compared to cascaded systems, enabling speech recognition, speech translation, spoken language understanding, and speech conversation, even in zero-shot cross-lingual scenarios",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Integrated Speech and Large Language Models (SLMs) that can follow speech instructions and generate relevant text responses have gained popularity lately. However, the safety and robustness of these models remains largely unclear. In this work, we investigate the potential vulnerabilities of such instruction-following speech-language models to adversarial attacks and jailbreaking. Specifically, we design algorithms that can generate adversarial examples to jailbreak SLMs in both white-box and black-box attack settings without human involvement. Additionally, we propose countermeasures to thwart such jailbreaking attacks. Our models, trained on dialog data with speech instructions, achieve state-of-the-art performance on spoken question-answering task, scoring over 80% on both safety and helpfulness metrics. Despite safety guardrails, experiments on jailbreaking demonstrate the vulnerability of SLMs to adversarial perturbations and transfer attacks, with average attack success rates of 90% and 10% respectively when evaluated on a dataset of carefully designed harmful questions spanning 12 different toxic categories. However, we demonstrate that our proposed countermeasures reduce the attack success significantly",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "This study explores the mechanism of factual knowledge storage in pre-trained language models (PLMs). Previous research suggests that factual knowledge is stored within multi-layer perceptron weights, and some storage units exhibit degeneracy, referred to as Degenerate Knowledge Neurons (DKNs). This paper provides a comprehensive definition of DKNs that covers both structural and functional aspects, pioneering the study of structures in PLMs' factual knowledge storage units. Based on this, we introduce the \\textit{Neurological Topology Clustering} method, which allows the formation of DKNs in any numbers and structures, leading to a more accurate DKN acquisition. Furthermore, we introduce the \\textit{Neuro-Degeneracy Analytic Analysis Framework}, which uniquely integrates model robustness, evolvability, and complexity for a holistic assessment of PLMs. Within this framework, our execution of 34 experiments across 2 PLMs, 4 datasets, and 6 settings highlights the critical role of DKNs.

    "abstract": "Motivated by the recent success of text-only modeling in certain vision-language tasks, this paper proposes that sign language processing can also use (large) text-only language models for inference, freeing sign language models from the necessity of low-resource multimodal learning from scratch. To compare the performance of pre-trained text-only models against multimodal ones, we introduce the first text-only and multimodal large (7B) language models to be pre-trained and then fine-tuned on a sign language recognition task. We propose new prompting strategies and fine-tuning strategies for text-only signed language processing, incorporating both linguistics of signed languages and theoretically motivated strategies to mitigate catastrophic forgetting (of spoken language). We test the generalization of these models to other sign language recognition and generation tasks, showing text-only models are capable sign language models that are still adept at spoken language tasks and, by changing the prompt, can even generalize to new prosodic and iconic sign recognition tasks. Finally, we analyze trade-offs between our text-only and multimodal models. Our code and model checkpoints will be open-source",

Pre-training LLMs from scratch for domains like medicine is resource-heavy and often unfeasible.

In addition, we publish a 3Gb Chinese Medicine (ChiMed) dataset, encompassing medical question answering, plain texts, knowledge graphs, and dialogues, segmented into three training stages. The medical LLM trained with our pipeline, Qilin-Med, shows substantial performance improvement.

Solely relying on semantic analysis proves insufficient for assessing source credibility, underscoring the necessity for advanced information extraction techniques and cross-validation across diverse sources. In this study, we present an elegant yet efficient model to analyze the intricate network of source relationships and key information attributes. Utilizing advanced named entity recognition specialized in key information extraction, we methodically distill critical data to assemble a multidimensional tensor. This tensor comprehensively represents the intricate web of interactions among sources and the essential informational elements they convey. Application of Higher-Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD) on this tensor enables us to distill eigen tensors, representing the principal components of information. These components are then weighted according to their corresponding eigenvalues, facilitating a nuanced quantification of each source's contribution to the collective information structure. Our theoretical analysis, complemented by empirical experiments on datasets from Twitter and various news categories, demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.

Specifically, COKE formalizes ToM as a collection of 45k+ manually verified cognitive chains that characterize human mental activities and subsequent behavioral/affective responses when facing specific social circumstances. In addition, we further generalize COKE using LLMs and build a powerful generation model COLM tailored for cognitive reasoning.

Recent advancements have seen multilingual pre-trained language models (mPLMs) significantly enhance the performance of these tasks.

Existing model cascade methods seek to enhance inference efficiency by greedily selecting the lightest model capable of processing the current input from a variety of models, based on model confidence scores. Nonetheless, deep models tend to exhibit overconfidence, and confidence distributions vary across languages. This leads to the emission of confident but incorrect predictions by smaller models, hindering their ability to generalize effectively across test languages.

    "abstract": "Model editing has emerged as a cost-effective strategy to update knowledge stored in language models. However, model editing can have unintended consequences after edits are applied: information unrelated to the edits can also be changed, and other general behaviors of the model can be wrongly altered. In this work, we investigate how model editing methods unexpectedly amplify model biases post-edit. We introduce a novel benchmark dataset, Seesaw-CF, for measuring bias-related harms of model editing and conduct the first in-depth investigation of how different weight-editing methods impact model bias. Specifically, we focus on biases with respect to demographic attributes such as race, geographic origin, and gender, as well as qualitative flaws in long-form texts generated by edited language models. We find that edited models exhibit, to various degrees, more biased behavior as they become less confident in attributes for Asian, African, and South American subjects. Furthermore, edited models amplify sexism and xenophobia in text generations while remaining seemingly coherent and logical. Finally, editing facts about place of birth, country of citizenship, or gender have particularly negative effects on the model's knowledge about unrelated features like field of work",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been shown to be effective as automatic evaluators with simple prompting and in-context learning. In this work, we assemble 16 LLMs encompassing four different size ranges and evaluate their output responses by preference ranking from the other LLMs as evaluators, such as System Star is better than System Square. We then evaluate the quality of ranking outputs introducing the Cognitive Bias Benchmark for LLMs as Evaluators (CoBBLer), a benchmark to measure six different cognitive biases in LLM evaluation outputs, such as the Egocentric bias where a model prefers to rank its own outputs highly in evaluation. We find that LLMs are biased text quality evaluators, exhibiting strong indications on our bias benchmark (average of 40% of comparisons across all models) within each of their evaluations that question their robustness as evaluators. Furthermore, we examine the correlation between human and machine preferences and calculate the average Rank-Biased Overlap (RBO) score to be 44%, indicating that machine preferences are misaligned with humans. According to our findings, LLMs may still be unable to be utilized for automatic annotation aligned with human preferences",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in generating fluent text. However, they often encounter the challenge of generating inaccurate or hallucinated content. This issue is common in both non-retrieval-based generation and retrieval-augmented generation approaches, and existing post-hoc rectification methods may not address the accumulated hallucination errors that may be caused by the \"snowballing\" issue, especially in reasoning tasks. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a novel approach called Real-time Verification and Rectification (EVER). Instead of waiting until the end of the generation process to rectify hallucinations, EVER employs a real-time, step-wise generation and hallucination rectification strategy. Apart from directly mitigating hallucination, we further demonstrate that both the EVER-rectified response and the original one can serve as preference data to enhance the factuality of the model through preference tuning. When compared to both retrieval-based and non-retrieval-based baselines, EVER demonstrates a significant improvement in generating trustworthy and factually accurate text across a diverse range of tasks, including biography generation and multi-hop reasoning",

    "abstract": "In our work, we explore the synergistic capabilities of pre-trained vision-and-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs) on visual commonsense reasoning (VCR) problems. We find that VLMs and LLMs-based decision pipelines are good at different kinds of VCR problems. Pre-trained VLMs exhibit strong performance for problems involving understanding the literal visual content, which we noted as visual commonsense understanding (VCU). For problems where the goal is to infer conclusions beyond image content, which we noted as visual commonsense inference (VCI), VLMs face difficulties, while LLMs, given sufficient visual evidence, can use commonsense to infer the answer well. We empirically validate this by letting LLMs classify VCR problems into these two categories and show the significant difference between VLM and LLM with image caption decision pipelines on two subproblems. Moreover, we identify a challenge with VLMs' \\textit{passive} perception, which may miss crucial context information, leading to incorrect reasoning by LLMs. Based on these, we suggest a collaborative approach, named \\textbf{ViCor}, where pre-trained LLMs serve as problem classifiers to analyze the problem category, then either use VLMs to answer the question directly or \\textit{actively} instruct VLMs to concentrate on and gather relevant visual elements to support potential commonsense inferences. We evaluate our framework on two VCR benchmark datasets and outperform all other methods that do not require in-domain fine-tuning",

    "abstract": "The impressive performances of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their immense potential for commercialization have given rise to serious concerns over the Intellectual Property (IP) of their training data. In particular, the synthetic texts generated by LLMs may infringe the IP of the data being used to train the LLMs. To this end, it is imperative to be able to (a) identify the data provider who contributed to the generation of a synthetic text by an LLM (source attribution) and (b) verify whether the text data from a data provider has been used to train an LLM (data provenance). In this paper, we show that both problems can be solved by watermarking, i.e., by enabling an LLM to generate synthetic texts with embedded watermarks that contain information about their source(s). We identify the key properties of such watermarking frameworks (e.g., source attribution accuracy, robustness against adversaries), and propose a WAtermarking for Source Attribution (WASA) framework that satisfies these key properties due to our algorithmic designs. Our WASA framework enables an LLM to learn an accurate mapping from the texts of different data providers to their corresponding unique watermarks, which sets the foundation for effective source attribution (and hence data provenance). Extensive empirical evaluations show that our WASA framework achieves effective source attribution and data provenance",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive zero-shot capabilities and versatility in NLP tasks, however they sometimes fail to maintain crucial invariances for specific tasks. One example is permutation sensitivity, where LLMs' outputs may significantly vary depending on the order of the input options. While debiasing techniques can mitigate these issues, and yield better performance and reliability, they often come with a high computational cost at inference. This paper addresses this inefficiency at inference time. The aim is to distill the capabilities of a computationally intensive, debiased, teacher model into a more compact student model. We explore two variants of student models: one based on pure distillation, and the other on an error-correction approach for more complex tasks, where the student corrects a single biased decision from the teacher to achieve a debiased output. Our approach is general and can be applied to both black-box and white-box LLMs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our compact, encoder-only student models can outperform their larger, biased teacher counterparts, achieving better results with significantly fewer parameters",

However, most previous works relied on superficial information, neglecting the incorporation of contextual world knowledge (e.g., background information derived from but beyond the given image and text pairs) and thereby restricting their ability to achieve better multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA). In this paper, we proposed a plug-in framework named WisdoM, to leverage the contextual world knowledge induced from the large vision-language models (LVLMs) for enhanced MSA. WisdoM utilizes LVLMs to comprehensively analyze both images and corresponding texts, simultaneously generating pertinent context. To reduce the noise in the context, we also introduce a training-free contextual fusion mechanism. Experiments across diverse granularities of MSA tasks consistently demonstrate that our approach has substantial improvements (brings an average +1.96% F1 score among five advanced methods) over several state-of-the-art methods.

DPR fine-tunes pre-trained networks to enhance the alignment of the embeddings between queries and relevant textual data. A deeper understanding of DPR fine-tuning will be required to fundamentally unlock the full potential of this approach. In this work, we explore DPR-trained models mechanistically by using a combination of probing, layer activation analysis, and model editing. Our experiments show that DPR training decentralizes how knowledge is stored in the network, creating multiple access pathways to the same information. We also uncover a limitation in this training style: the internal knowledge of the pre-trained model bounds what the retrieval model can retrieve. These findings suggest a few possible directions for dense retrieval: (1) expose the DPR training process to more knowledge so more can be decentralized, (2) inject facts as decentralized representations, (3) model and incorporate knowledge uncertainty in the retrieval process, and (4) directly map internal model knowledge to a knowledge base",

    "abstract": "Empathetic response generation is increasingly significant in AI, necessitating nuanced emotional and cognitive understanding coupled with articulate response expression. Current large language models (LLMs) excel in response expression; however, they lack the ability to deeply understand emotional and cognitive nuances, particularly in pinpointing fine-grained emotions and their triggers. Conversely, small-scale empathetic models (SEMs) offer strength in fine-grained emotion detection and detailed emotion cause identification.To harness the complementary strengths of both LLMs and SEMs, we introduce a Hybrid Empathetic Framework (HEF). HEF regards SEMs as flexible plugins to improve LLM's nuanced emotional and cognitive understanding. Regarding emotional understanding, HEF implements a two-stage emotion prediction strategy, encouraging LLMs to prioritize primary emotions emphasized by SEMs, followed by other categories, substantially alleviates the difficulties for LLMs in fine-grained emotion detection. Regarding cognitive understanding, HEF employs an emotion cause perception strategy, prompting LLMs to focus on crucial emotion-eliciting words identified by SEMs, thus boosting LLMs' capabilities in identifying emotion causes. This collaborative approach enables LLMs to discern emotions more precisely and formulate empathetic responses. We validate HEF on the Empathetic-Dialogue dataset, and the findings indicate that our framework enhances the refined understanding of LLMs and their ability to convey empathetic responses",

However, current KE approaches, which typically operate on (subject, relation, object) triples, ignore the contextual information and the relation among different knowledge. Such editing methods could thus encounter an uncertain editing boundary, leaving a lot of relevant knowledge in ambiguity: Queries that could be answered pre-edit cannot be reliably answered afterward. In this work, we analyze this issue by introducing a theoretical framework for KE that highlights an overlooked set of knowledge that remains unchanged and aids in knowledge deduction during editing, which we name the deduction anchor. We further address this issue by proposing a novel task of event-based knowledge editing that pairs facts with event descriptions, implicitly determining the deduction anchor and providing a clear editing boundary deducted from the anchor. We empirically demonstrate the superiority of event-based editing over the existing setting on resolving uncertainty in edited models, and curate a new benchmark dataset EvEdit derived from the CounterFact dataset. Moreover, while we observe that event-based editing is significantly challenging for existing approaches, we propose a novel approach Self-Edit that showcases stronger performance, achieving 55.6\\% consistency improvement while maintaining the naturalness of generation",

Beyond single molecules, studying reaction-text modeling holds promise for helping the synthesis of new materials and drugs. However, previous works mostly neglect reaction-text modeling: they primarily focus on modeling individual molecule-text pairs or learning chemical reactions without texts in context. Additionally, one key task of reaction-text modeling -- experimental procedure prediction -- is less explored due to the absence of an open-source dataset. The task is to predict step-by-step actions of conducting chemical experiments and is crucial to automating chemical synthesis. To resolve the challenges above, we propose a new pretraining method, ReactXT, for reaction-text modeling, and a new dataset, OpenExp, for experimental procedure prediction. Specifically, ReactXT features three types of input contexts to incrementally pretrain LMs. Each of the three input contexts corresponds to a pretraining task to improve the text-based understanding of either reactions or single molecules.

    "abstract": "In order for large language model (LLM)-based assistants to effectively adapt to evolving information needs, it must be possible to update their factual knowledge through continued training on new data. The standard recipe for doing so involves continued pre-training on new documents followed by instruction-tuning on question-answer (QA) pairs. However, we find that LLMs trained with this recipe struggle to answer questions, even though the perplexity of documents is minimized. We found that QA pairs are generally straightforward, while documents are more complex, weaving many factual statements together in an intricate manner. Therefore, we hypothesize that it is beneficial to expose LLMs to QA pairs before continued pre-training on documents so that the process of encoding knowledge from complex documents takes into account how this knowledge is accessed through questions. Based on this, we propose pre-instruction-tuning (PIT), a method that instruction-tunes on questions prior to training on documents. This contrasts with standard instruction-tuning, which learns how to extract knowledge after training on documents. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that PIT significantly enhances the ability of LLMs to absorb knowledge from new documents, outperforming standard instruction-tuning by 17.8%",

Previous methods employed low-rank adaptation (LoRA) for efficient federated fine-tuning but utilized traditional FL aggregation strategies on LoRA adapters. This approach led to mathematically inaccurate aggregation noise, reducing fine-tuning effectiveness and failing to address heterogeneous LoRAs. In this work, we first highlight the mathematical incorrectness of LoRA aggregation in existing federated fine-tuning methods. We introduce a new approach called FLoRA that enables federated fine-tuning on heterogeneous LoRA adapters across clients through a novel stacking-based aggregation method. Our approach is noise-free and seamlessly supports heterogeneous LoRAs. Extensive experiments demonstrate FLoRA's superior performance in both homogeneous and heterogeneous settings, surpassing state-of-the-art methods. We envision this work as a milestone for efficient, privacy-preserving, and accurate federated fine-tuning of LLMs",

    "abstract": "AbstractArtificial Intelligence (AI) has witnessed significant advancements in recent years, particularly in the field of Large Language Models (LLMs). While there has been a surge in the application of AI in consumer-oriented chat dialogue systems, it is crucial to address the challenges associated with implementing large models in enterprise applications, such as data management and cost optimization. Therefore, we present a study across concept and method of large model operation, showing that the principle and technology of revolves around the continuous updating of training data, including both pre-training data and fine-tuning data, and showed that the final goal of domain model training could be achieved through continuous operation of the model. Moreover, the optimization process focuses on calculating and comparing the total cost during the operation of a large model, additionally a time distribution calculation method is employed to reduce the initial input cost of computing power. This optimization approach is particularly suitable for the long-term operation of large models. As a by-product of the validation process, we also obtained preliminary data on how often large models forget (both natural forgetting and forced updating) what they learned, which has implications for knowledge updating and error correction. Overall, our consistent findings indicate that the industry's ability to operate large models continues to improve, leading to a reduction in the cost of their use",

    "abstract": "In the field of natural language processing (NLP), prompt-based learning is widely used for efficient parameter learning. However, this method has the drawback of shortening the input length by the extent of the attached prompt, leading to an inefficiency in utilizing the input space. In this study, we propose P-Distill, a novel prompt compression method that mitigates the aforementioned limitation of prompt-based learning while maintaining performance via knowledge distillation. The knowledge distillation process of P-Distill consists of two methods, namely prompt initialization and prompt distillation. Experiments on various NLP tasks demonstrate that P-Distill exhibits comparable or superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art prompt-based learning methods, even with significantly shorter prompts. Specifically, We achieve a peak improvement of 1.90% even with the prompt lengths compressed to one-eighth. An additional study further provides insights into the distinct impact of each method on the overall performance of P-Distill. Our code will be released upon acceptance",

However, cross-domain, fine-grained topic classification with few-shot prompts remain largely unexplored, particularly due to the difficulty of manually selecting class label terms without domain expertise. We introduce SciPrompt, a framework designed to automatically retrieve topic-related terms and phrases as supplementary knowledge and then select semantically correlated domain-specific label terms within scientific contexts for topic classification. Furthermore, we propose a new verbalization strategy that leverages the correlation scores to enhance signal provision during model tuning. We expand our investigation to include multi-class classification across up to 53 sub-domain publication types.

This framework establishes a flexible non-autoregressive LM capable of handling potentially noisy data by leveraging robust instruction embeddings from encoders, enabling instruction tuning.

    "abstract": "The increasing scale of large language models (LLMs) brings emergent abilities to various complex tasks requiring reasoning, such as arithmetic and commonsense reasoning. It is known that the effective design of task-specific prompts is critical for LLMs' ability to produce high-quality answers. In particular, an effective approach for complex question-and-answering tasks is example-based prompting with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, which significantly improves the performance of LLMs. However, current CoT methods rely on a fixed set of human-annotated exemplars, which are not necessarily the most effective examples for different tasks. This paper proposes a new method, Active-Prompt, to adapt LLMs to different tasks with task-specific example prompts (annotated with human-designed CoT reasoning). For this purpose, we propose a solution to the key problem of determining which questions are the most important and helpful to annotate from a pool of task-specific queries. By borrowing ideas from the related problem of uncertainty-based active learning, we introduce several metrics to characterize the uncertainty so as to select the most uncertain questions for annotation. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, achieving superior performance on eight complex reasoning tasks. Further analyses of different uncertainty metrics, pool sizes, zero-shot learning, and accuracy-uncertainty relationships demonstrate the effectiveness of our method",

    "abstract": "In the realm of Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs), the ultimate modality alignment is constrained by the quality of instructions in Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) phase. In this paper, we assess the instruction quality from a unique perspective termed Writing Manner, which encompasses the selection of vocabulary, grammar, and sentence structure to convey specific semantics. We argue that there exists severe writing manner gap between the visual instructions and the inner Large Language Models (LLMs) of LMMs. During the SFT phase, the more pronounced the writing manner gap, the more the inner LLM is disturbed, leading to capability degradation of both inner LLM and LMM. To bridge the writing manner gap, under the promise of keeping original semantics intact, we propose to directly exploit the inner LLM for aligning the writing manner of soft-format visual instructions with that of the inner LLM itself, which yields novel LLM-aligned instructions. We develop a novel perplexity-based indicator to quantitatively assess the writing manner gap, with results showing that our approach successfully minimizes this gap. By utilizing LLM-aligned instructions, the baseline models LLaVA-7B and QwenVL have enhanced their resistance to hallucinations and achieved performance improvements across all 15 visual and language benchmarks",

    "abstract": "Private data, being larger and quality-higher than public data, can greatly improve large language models (LLM). However, due to privacy concerns, this data is often dispersed in multiple silos, making its secure utilization for LLM training a challenge. Federated learning (FL) is an ideal solution for training models with distributed private data, but traditional frameworks like FedAvg are unsuitable for LLM due to their high computational demands on clients. An alternative, split learning, offloads most training parameters to the server while training embedding and output layers locally, making it more suitable for LLM. Nonetheless, it faces significant challenges in security and efficiency. Firstly, the gradients of embeddings are prone to attacks, leading to potential reverse engineering of private data. Furthermore, the server's limitation to handle only one client's training request at a time hinders parallel training, severely impacting training efficiency.In this paper, we propose a Federated Learning framework for LLM, named FL-GLM, which prevents data leakage caused by both server-side and peer-client attacks while improve the training efficiency. Specifically, we first place the input block and output block on local client to prevent embedding gradient attacks from server. Secondly, we employ key-encryption during client-server communication to prevent reverse engineering attacks from peer-clients. Lastly, we employ optimization methods like client-batching or server-hierarchical, adopting different acceleration methods based on the actual computational capabilities of the server.Experimental results on NLU and generation tasks demonstrate that FL-GLM achieves comparable metrics to centralized chatGLM model, validating the effectiveness of our federated learning framework",

An optimal opportunity to enhance diversity is to make word substitutions during rephrasing based on syntactic control. Existing unsupervised methods have made great progress in syntactic control, but the generated paraphrases rarely have substitutions due to the limitation of training data. In this paper, we propose a Diversity syntactically controlled Paraphrase generation framework (DiPara), in which a novel training strategy is designed to obtain semantic sentences while using the given sentence as training objects. As diverse words vary the syntactic structure around them, we propose a phrase-aware attention mechanism to capture the syntactic structure associated with the current word. To achieve it, the linearized triple sequence is introduced to represent structure singly.

One understudied avenue of language change causing data drift is the emergence of neologisms -- new word forms -- over time. We create a diverse resource of recent English neologisms by using several popular collection methods. We analyze temporal drift using neologisms by comparing sentences containing new words with near-identical sentences that replace neologisms with existing substitute words. Model performance is nearly halved in machine translation when a single neologism is introduced in a sentence. Motivated by these results, we construct a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' ability to generalize to neologisms with various natural language understanding tasks and model perplexity. Models with later knowledge cutoff dates yield lower perplexities and perform better in downstream tasks. LLMs are also affected differently based on the linguistic origins of words, indicating that neologisms are complex for static LLMs to address.

    "abstract": "A single language model (LM), despite aligning well with an average labeler through reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), may not universally suit diverse human preferences. Recent approaches therefore opt for customization by collecting multi-dimensional feedback and creating distinct reward models (RMs) for each dimension (e.g., helpfulness, harmlessness, or honesty). Different LMs can then be optimized for different preferences using multi-objective RLHF (MORLHF) with different reward weightings.Yet, RL fine-tuning is unstable and resource-heavy, especially for MORLHF with diverse and usually conflicting objectives. In this paper, we present Multi-Objective Direct Preference Optimization (MODPO), an RL-free algorithm that extends Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for multiple alignment objectives with minimal overheads. Essentially, MODPO folds language modeling directly into reward modeling, training LMs as implicit collective reward models (cRMs) that combine all objectives with specific weightings. While theoretically guaranteed to produce the same optimal solutions as MORLHF, MODPO is practically more stable and computationally efficient. Empirical results from safety alignment and long-form question answering confirm that MODPO matches or outperforms existing methods, consistently producing a Pareto front of LMs that cater to diverse preferences with 3 times less computational resources compared to MORLHF",

However, these methods often require a long time to select instances due to their complexity, hindering their practical viability. To address this limitation, we propose a graph-based selection method, FastGAS, designed to efficiently identify high-quality instances while minimizing computational overhead. Initially, we construct a data similarity graph based on instance similarities. Subsequently, employing a graph partitioning algorithm, we partition the graph into pieces. Within each piece (i.e., subgraph), we adopt a greedy approach to pick the most representative nodes. By aggregating nodes from diverse pieces and annotating the corresponding instances, we identify a set of diverse and representative instances for ICL.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Empathetic response generation is to comprehend the cognitive and emotional states in dialogue utterances and generate proper responses. Psychological theories posit that comprehending emotional and cognitive states necessitates iteratively capturing and understanding associated words across dialogue utterances. However, existing approaches regard dialogue utterances as either a long sequence or independent utterances for comprehension, which are prone to overlook the associated words between them.To address this issue, we propose an Iterative Associative Memory Model (IAMM) for empathetic response generation. Specifically, we employ a novel second-order interaction attention mechanism to iteratively capture vital associated words between dialogue utterances and situations, dialogue history, and a memory module (for storing associated words), thereby accurately and nuancedly comprehending the utterances. We conduct experiments on the Empathetic-Dialogue dataset. Both automatic and human evaluations validate the efficacy of the model. Meanwhile, variant experiments on LLMs also demonstrate that attending to associated words improves empathetic comprehension and expression",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "In-context learning, a paradigm bridging the gap between pre-training and fine-tuning, has demonstrated high efficacy in several NLP tasks, especially in few-shot settings. Despite being widely applied, in-context learning is vulnerable to malicious attacks. In this work, we raise security concerns regarding this paradigm. Our studies demonstrate that an attacker can manipulate the behavior of large language models by poisoning the demonstration context, without the need for fine-tuning the model. Specifically, we design a new backdoor attack method, named ICLAttack, to target large language models based on in-context learning. Our method encompasses two types of attacks: poisoning demonstration examples and poisoning demonstration prompts, which can make models behave in accordance with predefined intentions. ICLAttack does not require additional fine-tuning to implant a backdoor, thus preserving the model's generality. Furthermore, the poisoned examples are correctly labeled, enhancing the natural stealth of our attack method. Extensive experimental results across several language models, ranging in size from 1.3B to 180B parameters, demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack method, exemplified by a high average attack success rate of 95.0% across the three datasets on OPT models",

    "abstract": "As one of the most popular parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is commonly applied to fine-tune large language models (LLMs). However, updating the weights of LoRA blocks effectively and expeditiously is challenging due to the long calculation path in the original model. To address this, we propose ResLoRA, an improved framework of LoRA. By adding residual paths during training and using merging approaches to eliminate these extra paths during inference, our method can achieve better results in fewer training steps without any extra trainable parameters or inference cost compared to LoRA. The experiments on NLG, NLU, and text-to-image tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. To the best of our knowledge, ResLoRA is the first work that combines the residual path with LoRA.

    "abstract": "Data scarcity and the modality gap between the speech and text modalities are two major obstacles of end-to-end Speech Translation (ST) systems, thus hindering their performance. Prior work has attempted to mitigate these challenges by leveraging external MT data and optimizing distance metrics that bring closer the speech-text representations. However, achieving competitive results typically requires some ST data. For this reason, we introduce ZeroSwot, a method for zero-shot ST that bridges the modality gap without any paired ST data. Leveraging a novel CTC compression and Optimal Transport, we train a speech encoder using only ASR data, to align with the representation space of a massively multilingual MT model. The speech encoder seamlessly integrates with the MT model at inference, enabling direct translation from speech to text, across all languages supported by the MT model. Our experiments show that we can effectively close the modality gap without ST data, while our results on MuST-C and CoVoST demonstrate our method's superiority over not only previous zero-shot models, but also supervised ones, achieving state-of-the-art results",

We frame the simplification problem as a textual style transfer task and learn a style representation using the sentences around the target sentence in the document and its linguistic attributes. Moreover, unlike most unsupervised approaches that require style-labeled training data, we fine-tune strong pre-trained models using sentence-level paraphrases instead of annotated data.

BinLLM converts collaborative embeddings from external models into binary sequences --- a specific text format that LLMs can understand and operate on directly, facilitating the direct usage of collaborative information in text-like format by LLMs. Additionally, BinLLM provides options to compress the binary sequence using dot-decimal notation to avoid excessively long lengths.

In order to reduce the inherent ambiguity posed from the sentences, a recent work called Conditional STS (C-STS) has been proposed to measure the sentences' similarity conditioned on a certain aspect. Despite the popularity of C-STS, we find that the current C-STS dataset suffers from various issues that could impede proper evaluation on this task. In this paper, we reannotate the C-STS validation set and observe an annotator discrepancy on 55% of the instances resulting from the annotation errors in the original label, ill-defined conditions, and the lack of clarity in the task definition. After a thorough dataset analysis, we improve the C-STS task by leveraging the models' capability to understand the conditions under a QA task setting. With the generated answers, we present an automatic error identification pipeline that is able to identify annotation errors from the C-STS data with over 80% F1 score. We also propose a new method that largely improves the performance over baselines on the C-STS data by training the models with the answers. Finally we show the conditionality annotation can benefit from the typed-feature structure (TFS) of entity types.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities, augmented by recent advances in prompting techniques and reasoning frameworks. Many popular frameworks \\cite{du_improving_2023, yao_tree_2023, shinn_reflexion_2023} rely on the assumption that models are able to give effective feedback on their own generations. This feedback is partly predicated on being able to correctly validate, or classify, the generated prediction as either correctly or incorrectly solving the given problem. While in traditional computer science settings validation has been shown to be as difficult as correct generation, we find empirically that language models may be better discriminators than generators. Our work studies whether leading language models are better at solving problems or validating solutions, and we attempt to gain a better understanding of why this happens. We quantify this by measuring the understanding gap --- the difference between generative and discriminative accuracy. First, we further corroborate recent work \\cite{west_generative_2024} showing surprisingly that models are better generators than discriminators on some datasets. Second, we discover that understanding gaps can be closed or significantly narrowed through prompting and provide an estimate of the upper bound $\\epsilon$ on the understanding gap across datasets. Third, we apply our findings to predict the settings where self-correction is most effective. This continues the conversation started by \\cite{huang_large_2023}, where we instead show that LLMs can self-correct reasoning, and establish a link between a feature of the dataset and the language model's ability to self-correct",

Our frameworkis designed for contrastive text pairs, and it has two schemes: one is based on (log-)likelihood and another is based on preference. To this end, two public dataset CrowS-Pairs and its French version are utilized, both including nine categories of bias. Although frequentist methods such as Student's $t$ and Wilcoxon test can be employed in our framework, Bayesian test (Bayes factors) is preferred for bias detection as it allows practitioners to quantify the evidence for both two competing hypotheses. Our framework is suitable for a wide range of large language models, and we demonstrate its application to the popular GPT-3 (text-davinci-003) and ChatGPT (GPT-3.5-Turbo) in the experiments. From our experiments, the bias behavior of ChatGPT is mostly consistent on both the English and French CrowS-pairs datasets, but still exhibits some differences due to different social norms",

We connect these efforts with NLP interpretability techniques and present a method for flexibly discovering clusters of similar text phrases that are predictive of human reactions to texts using convolutional neural networks. When used in an experimental setting, this method can identify text treatments and their effects under certain assumptions. We apply the method to two data sets. The first enables direct validation of the model's ability to detect phrases known to cause the outcome. The second demonstrates its ability to flexibly discover text treatments with varying textual structures. In both cases, the model learns a greater variety of text treatments compared to benchmark methods, and these text features quantitatively meet or exceed the ability of benchmark methods to predict the outcome",

    "abstract": "This work focuses on the task of query-based meeting summarization in which the summary of a context (meeting transcript) is generated in response to a specific query. When using Large Language Models (LLMs) for this task, a new call to the LLM inference endpoint/API is required for each new query even if the context stays the same. However, repeated calls to the LLM inference endpoints would significantly increase the costs of using them in production, making LLMs impractical for many real-world use cases. To address this problem, in this paper, we investigate whether combining the queries for the same input context in a single prompt to minimize repeated calls can be successfully used in meeting summarization. In this regard, we conduct extensive experiments by comparing the performance of various popular LLMs: GPT-4, PaLM-2, LLaMA-2, Mistral, and FLAN-T5 in single-query and multi-query settings. We observe that while most LLMs tend to respond to the multi-query instructions, almost all of them (except GPT-4), even after fine-tuning, could not properly generate the response in the required output format. We conclude that while multi-query prompting could be useful to optimize the inference costs by reducing calls to the inference APIs/endpoints for the task of meeting summarization, this capability to reliably generate the response in the expected format is only limited to certain LLMs",

In this paper, we propose the Gist COnditioned deCOding (Gist-COCO) model, introducing a novel method for compressing prompts which also can assist the prompt interpretation and engineering. Gist-COCO employs an encoder-decoder based language model and then incorporates an additional encoder as a plugin module to compress prompts with inputs using gist tokens. It finetunes the compression plugin module and uses the representations of gist tokens to emulate the raw prompts in the vanilla language model. By verbalizing the representations of gist tokens into gist prompts, the compression ability of Gist-COCO can be generalized to different LLMs with high compression rates. Our experiments demonstrate that Gist-COCO outperforms previous prompt compression models in both passage and instruction compression tasks. Further analysis on gist verbalization results suggests that our gist prompts serve different functions in aiding language models.

    "abstract": "Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant advancements and are now widely used across various domains. Unfortunately, there has been a rising concern that LLMs can be misused to generate harmful or malicious content. Though a line of research has focused on aligning LLMs with human values and preventing them from producing inappropriate content, such alignments are usually vulnerable and can be bypassed by alignment-breaking attacks via adversarially optimized or handcrafted jailbreaking prompts. In this work, we introduce a Robustly Aligned LLM (RA-LLM) to defend against potential alignment-breaking attacks. RA-LLM can be directly constructed upon an existing aligned LLM with a robust alignment checking function, without requiring any expensive retraining or fine-tuning process of the original LLM. Furthermore, we also provide a theoretical analysis for RA-LLM to verify its effectiveness in defending against alignment-breaking attacks. Through real-world experiments on open-source large language models, we demonstrate that RA-LLM can successfully defend against both state-of-the-art adversarial prompts and popular handcrafted jailbreaking prompts by reducing their attack success rates from nearly 100% to around 10% or less",

    "title": "MARS: Meaning-Aware Response Scoring for Uncertainty Estimation in Generative LLMs",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely utilized for their excellence in various tasks. However, their tendency to produce inaccurate or misleading outputs poses a potential risk, particularly in high-stakes environments. Therefore, estimating the correctness of generative LLM outputs is an important task for enhanced reliability. Uncertainty Estimation (UE) in generative LLMs is an evolving domain, where SOTA probability-based methods commonly employ length-normalized scoring. In this work, we propose Meaning-Aware Response Scoring (MARS) as an alternative to length-normalized scoring for UE methods. MARS is a novel scoring function that considers the semantic contribution of each token in the generated sequence in the context of the question. We demonstrate that integrating MARS into UE methods results in a universal and significant improvement in UE performance. We conduct experiments using three distinct closed-book question-answering datasets across five popular pre-trained LLMs. Lastly, we validate the efficacy of MARS on a Medical QA dataset.

An ideal inferenceLLM should utilize fewer computational resources while still maintaining its capabilities in generalization and in-context learning ability. In this paper, we try to answer the question, \"During LLM inference, can we use shallow layers for easy input; deep layers for hard ones?\" To answer this question, we first indicate that Not all Layers are Necessary at inference time by statistically analyzing the activated layers across tasks. Then, we propose a simple algorithm named AdaInfer for instance-aware adaptive inference, which determines the inference termination time based on the input instance itself. More importantly, AdaInfer does not alter LLM parameters and maintains generalizability across tasks. Experiments on well-known LLMs (i.e., Llama2-7B/13B and OPT-13B ) show that AdaInfer can save 10% to 50% of computational resources on mainstream tasks (e.g., knowledge-based/common-sense QA, text classification). Meanwhile, maintaining accuracy with average minimal (<1%) loss.

To mitigate these hallucinations, current approaches typically necessitate high-quality human factuality annotations. In this work, we explore Self-Alignment for Factuality, where we leverage the self-evaluation capability of an LLM to provide training signals that steer the model towards factuality. Specifically, we incorporate Self-Eval, a self-evaluation component, to prompt an LLM to validate the factuality of its own generated responses solely based on its internal knowledge. Additionally, we design Self-Knowledge Tuning (SK-Tuning) to augment the LLM's self-evaluation ability by improving the model's confidence estimation and calibration. We then utilize these self-annotated responses to fine-tune the model via Direct Preference Optimization algorithm. We show that the proposed self-alignment approach substantially enhances factual accuracy over Llama family models across three key knowledge-intensive tasks on TruthfulQA and BioGEN.

Addressing these limitations, this paper introduces the Logic Agent (LA), an agent-based framework aimed at enhancing the validity of reasoning processes in Large Language Models (LLMs) through strategic logic rule invocation. Unlike conventional approaches, LA transforms LLMs into logic agents that dynamically apply propositional logic rules, initiating the reasoning process by converting natural language inputs into structured logic forms. The logic agent leverages a comprehensive set of predefined functions to systematically navigate the reasoning process.This methodology not only promotes the structured and coherent generation of reasoning constructs but also significantly improves their interpretability and logical coherence.

Our analysis has two folds, one based on designing neural architectures and training them from scratch, and another based on large pre-trained language models (LLMs). Our research questions are: 1) Can we effectively augment models by explicit supervised retrieval of the relevant KB information to solve the KB-VQA problem? 2) How do task-specific and LLM-based models perform in the integration of visual and external knowledge, and multi-hop reasoning over both sources of information? 3) Is the implicit knowledge of LLMs sufficient for KB-VQA and to what extent it can replace the explicit KB? Our results demonstrate the positive impact of empowering task-specific and LLM models with supervised external and visual knowledge retrieval models. Our findings show that though LLMs are stronger in 1-hop reasoning, they suffer in 2-hop reasoning in comparison with our fine-tuned NN model even if the relevant information from both modalities is available to the model. Moreover, we observed that LLM models outperform the NN model for KB-related questions which confirms the effectiveness of implicit knowledge in LLMs however, they do not alleviate the need for external KB",

In this work, we show that, even within a single model, we can find multiple subnetworks that perform similarly in-domain, but generalize vastly differently. To better understand these phenomena, we investigate if they can be understood in terms of \"competing subnetworks\": the model initially represents a variety of distinct algorithms, corresponding to different subnetworks, and generalization occurs when it ultimately converges to one. This explanation has been used to account for generalization in simple algorithmic tasks. Instead of finding competing subnetworks, we find that all subnetworks---whether they generalize or not---share a set of attention heads, which we refer to as the _heuristic core_. Further analysis suggests that these attention heads emerge early in training and compute shallow, non-generalizing features. The model learns to generalize by incorporating additional attention heads, which depend on the outputs of the \"heuristic\" heads to compute higher-level features.

By analyzing conversations within the Emotional Support Conversations dataset (ESConv) using LLaMA models, we demonstrate that SRA is significantly correlated with a model's ability to sustain the outlined strategy throughout the interactions.

    "title": "Large Language Models are Few-Shot Training Example Generators: A Case Study in Fallacy Recognition",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Recognizing fallacies is crucial for ensuring the quality and validity of arguments across various domains. However, computational fallacy recognition faces challenges due to the diverse genres, domains, and types of fallacies found in datasets. This leads to a highly multi-class, and even multi-label, setup with substantial class imbalance. In this study, we aim to enhance existing models for fallacy recognition by incorporating additional context and by leveraging large language models to generate synthetic data, thus increasing the representation of the infrequent classes. We experiment with GPT3.5 to generate synthetic examples and we examine the impact of prompt settings for this. Moreover, we explore zero-shot and few-shot scenarios to evaluate the effectiveness of using the generated examples for training smaller models within a unified fallacy recognition framework. Furthermore, we analyze the overlap between the synthetic data and existing fallacy datasets. Finally, we investigate the usefulness of providing supplementary context for detecting fallacy types that need such context, e.g., diversion fallacies. Our evaluation results demonstrate consistent improvements across fallacy types, datasets, and generators. We will release the code and synthetic dataset upon the acceptance of the paper",

This paper introduces a novel decomposed prompting approach to probe the linguistic structure understanding of these LLMs within sequence labeling tasks. Diverging from the single text-to-text prompt, our method breaks down the input sentence into individual prompts for each token, seeking its linguistic label. We assess our method on the Universal Dependencies part-of-speech tagging dataset for 38 languages, utilizing both English-centric and multilingual LLMs. Our findings show that decomposed prompting surpasses the iterative prompting baseline in efficacy and efficiency under zero- and few-shot settings. Further analysis reveals the influence of evaluation methods and instructional prompt use. Our study offers insights into the multilingual transferability of English-centric LLMs, contributing to the understanding of their multilingual linguistic knowledge",

    "abstract": "Recent studies demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) can excel in many tasks via in-context learning (ICL). However, recent works show that ICL-trained models tend to produce inaccurate results when presented with adversarial inputs. In this work, we investigate whether augmenting ICL with natural language explanations (NLEs) improves the robustness of LLMs on adversarial datasets covering natural language inference and paraphrasing identification. We prompt LLMs with a small set of human-generated NLEs to produce further NLEs, yielding more accurate results than both a zero-shot-ICL setting and using only human-generated NLEs. Our results on five popular LLMs (GPT3.5-turbo, LLaMA2, Vicuna, Zephyr, and Mistral) show that our approach yields over 6% improvement over base-line approaches for eight adversarial datasets: HANS, ISCS, NaN, ST, PICD, PISP, ANLI, and PAWS. Furthermore, previous studies have demonstrated that prompt selection strategies significantly enhance ICL on in-distribution test sets.

    "abstract": "The intricate relationship between language and culture has long been a subject of exploration within the realm of linguistic anthropology. Large Language Models (LLMs), promoted as repositories of collective human knowledge, raise a pivotal question: do these models genuinely encapsulate the diverse knowledge adopted by different cultures? Our study reveals that these models demonstrate greater cultural alignment along two dimensions—firstly, when prompted with the dominant language of a specific culture, and secondly, when pretrained with a refined mixture of languages employed by that culture. We quantify cultural alignment by simulating sociological surveys, comparing model responses to those of actual survey participants as references. Specifically, we replicate a survey conducted in various regions of Egypt and the United States through prompting LLMs with different pretraining data mixtures in both Arabic and English with the personas of the real respondents and the survey questions. Further analysis reveals that misalignment becomes more pronounced for underrepresented personas and for culturally sensitive topics, such as those probing social values. Finally, we introduce Anthropological Prompting, a novel method leveraging anthropological reasoning to enhance cultural alignment. Our study emphasizes the necessity for a more balanced multilingual pretraining dataset to better represent the diversity of human experience and the plurality of different cultures with many implications on the topic of cross-lingual transfer",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into real-world applications such as code generation and chatbot assistance, extensive efforts have been made to align LLM behavior with human values, including safety. Jailbreak attacks, which aim to provoke unintended and unsafe behaviors from LLMs, remain a significant LLM safety threat. We analyze tokens, which are the smallest unit of text that can be processed by LLMs and make the following observations: (1) probabilities of tokens representing harmful responses are higher than those of harmless responses, and (2) responses containing safety disclaimers appear among the top tokens when token probabilities are sorted in descending order. In this paper, we leverage (1) and (2) to develop SafeDecoding, a safety-aware decoding strategy for LLMs, to defend against jailbreak attacks. We perform extensive experiments to evaluate SafeDecoding against six SOTA jailbreak attacks (GCG, AutoDAN, PAIR, DeepInception, SAP30, and template based attack) on five LLMs (Vicuna, Llama2, Guanaco, falcon, and Dolphin) using four benchmark datasets (AdvBench, HEx-PHI, MT-Bench, and Just-Eval). Our results show that SafeDecoding significantly reduces attack success rate and harmfulness of jailbreak attacks without compromising the helpfulness of responses to benign user queries while outperforming six defense methods (Perpelexity, Paraphrase, Retokenization, Self-Reminder, ICD, and Self-Examination)",

Classical probabilistic and anchor-based topic models offer interactive versions that allow users to guide the models towards better topics. However, such interactive features have been lacking in neural topic models. To correct this lacuna, we introduce a user-friendly interaction for neural topic models. This interaction permits users to assign a word label to a topic, leading to an update in the topic model where the words in the topic become closely aligned with the given label. Our approach encompasses two distinct kinds of neural topic models. The first includes models where topic embeddings are trainable and evolve during the training process. The second involves models where topic embeddings are integrated post-training. To facilitate user interaction with these neural topic models, we have developed an interactive interface that enables users to engage with and re-label topics. We evaluate our method through a human study, where users can relabel topics to find relevant documents. Using our method, user labeling improves document rank scores, helping to find more relevant documents to a given query when compared to no user labeling",

This work provides an information-theoretic framework to analyse the influence of inputs for text classification tasks.

Each text element has two components: the semantic meaning and a linguistic realization. Multiple-choice reading comprehension (MCRC) and sentiment classification (SC) are selected to showcase the framework. For MCRC, it is found that the relative context influence on the output reduces on more challenging datasets. In particular, more challenging contexts allows greater variation in the question complexity. Hence, test creators need to carefully consider the choice of the context when designing multiple-choice questions for assessment. For SC, it is found the semantic meaning of the input dominates compared to its linguistic realization when determining the sentiment",

    "abstract": "There's currently a lot of interest in evaluating the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLM) using benchmarks designed to evaluate them on different kinds of reasoning capacity. In this paper, we begin with scepticism about whether model performance on a reasoning benchmark is a real index of the model's capacity to reason. To study this, we first use two prototypical LLMs, LLaMA 2 & Flan-T5, to establish baselines within the QASC and Bamboogle benchmarks: instances of Compositional Question Answering. We then design and carry out a series of novel, diagnostic experiments using automatic and manual re-annotations of the datasets to control for the different sources of information the LLMs might be exploiting in answering compositional questions. Specifically, our experiments control for: (a) word/phrase associations or overlaps across sections of the model's input prompt; (b) the model's inherent knowledge acquired during (pre)training and/or fine-tuning; and (c) semantic type dependencies in QA pairs. Our experiments show that LLaMA 2 excels at exploiting (a-c). On the other hand, Flan-T5 exhibits a lot more robustness to our interference with them, despite relying on answer keywords in some experiments; indicating that Flan-T5 is indeed doing something akin to reasoning. We hypothesise that this is due to Flan-T5's direct fine-tuning on reasoning datasets, but leave the testing of this hypothesis to future work",

Currently, many domain-specific benchmarks have been proposed to verify the performance of (M)LLMs in specific fields. Among various domains, transportation plays a crucial role in modern society as it impacts the economy, the environment, and the quality of life for billions of people. However, it is unclear how much traffic knowledge (M)LLMs possess and whether they can reliably perform transportation-related tasks. To address this gap, we propose TransportationGames, a carefully designed and thorough evaluation benchmark for assessing (M)LLMs in the transportation domain. By comprehensively considering the applications in real-world scenarios and referring to the first three levels in Bloom's Taxonomy, we test the performance of various (M)LLMs in memorizing, understanding, and applying transportation knowledge by the selected tasks. The experimental results show that although some models perform well in some tasks, there is still much room for improvement overall. We hope the release of TransportationGames can serve as a foundation for future research, thereby accelerating the implementation and application of (M)LLMs in the transportation domain",

INTERVENOR prompts Large Language Models (LLMs) to play distinct roles during the code repair process, functioning as both a Code Learner and a Code Teacher. Specifically, the Code Learner is tasked with adhering to instructions to generate or repair code, while the Code Teacher is responsible for crafting a Chain-of-Repair (CoR) to serve as guidance for the Code Learner. During generating the CoR, the Code Learner needs to check the generated codes from Code Learner and reassess how to address code bugs based on error feedback received from compilers. Experimental results demonstrate that INTERVENOR surpasses baseline models, exhibiting improvements of approximately 18% and 4.3% over GPT-3.5 in code generation and code translation tasks, respectively. Our further analyses show that CoR is effective to illuminate the reasons behind bugs and outline solution plans in natural language. With the feedback of code compilers, INTERVENOR can accurately identify syntax errors and assertion errors and provide precise instructions to repair codes.

While existing methods have achieved commendable results in modeling entity-level inconsistency, addressing event-level inconsistency following the inherent subject-predicate logic of news and robustly learning news representations from poor-quality news samples remain two challenges. In this paper, we propose an Event-diven fake news detection framework (Event-Radar) based on multi-view learning, which integrates visual manipulation, textual emotion and multimodal inconsistency at event-level for fake news detection. Specifically, leveraging the capability of graph structures to capture interactions between events and parameters, Event-Radar captures event-level multimodal inconsistency by constructing an event graph that includes multimodal entity subject-predicate logic. Additionally, to mitigate the interference of poor-quality news, Event-Radar introduces a multi-view fusion mechanism, learning comprehensive and robust representations by computing the credibility of each view as a clue, thereby detecting fake news. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Event-Radar achieves outstanding performance on three large-scale fake news detection benchmarks. Our studies also confirm that Event-Radar exhibits strong robustness, providing a paradigm for detecting fake news from noisy news samples",

Here we aim to bridge this gap.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Transformer architecture has significantly advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) by delivering outstanding performance. However, it faces challenges with efficiency and processing long sequences, attributed to its quadratic time complexity. Linear attention offers a more efficient linear time solution but falls short in language modelling and length extrapolation compared with traditional Transformer. To enhance the performance of linear attention and fully leverage its capability in modelling long sequences, we begin with positional encoding, specifying the constraints required for positional encoding by linear attention. Building upon these constraints, we design a positional encoding for linear attention, named Disentangle to Decay (D2D), which allows for a seamless conversion between absolute positional encoding (APE) and relative positional encoding (RPE). To alleviate the instability of directly training D2D, we disentangle D2D into the combination of RPE and APE, which greatly improves the stability while ensuring the efficiency of model training. Experiments result shows that, application of D2D in linear attention significantly improves performance in language modelling and length extrapolation, demonstrating strong competitiveness with vanilla Transformer and outperforming other positional encodings",

The solved steps inform the subsequent steps, facilitating progressive reasoning. This explicit structure not only amplifies reasoning performance but also fosters enhanced interpretability and transparency.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "In the realm of Large Language Models (LLMs), users commonly employ diverse decoding strategies and adjust hyperparameters to control the generated text. However, a critical question emerges: Are LLMs conscious of the existence of these decoding strategies and capable of regulating themselves? The current decoding generation process often relies on empirical and heuristic manual adjustments to hyperparameters based on types of tasks and demands. However, this process is typically cumbersome, and the decoding hyperparameters may not always be optimal for each sample. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose a novel text generation paradigm termed Hyperparameter Aware Generation (HAG). By leveraging hyperparameter-aware instruction tuning, the LLM autonomously determines the optimal decoding strategy and configs based on the input samples, enabling self-regulation. Our approach eliminates the need for extensive manual tuning, offering a more autonomous, self-regulate model behavior. Experimental results spanning six datasets across reasoning, creativity, translation, and mathematics tasks demonstrate that hyperparameter-aware instruction tuning empowers the LLMs to self-regulate the decoding strategy and hyperparameter. HAG extends the current paradigm in the text generation process, highlighting the feasibility of endowing the LLMs with self-regulate decoding strategies",

Recent prompting techniques, such as chain of thought, have consistently improved LLMs' performance on various reasoning tasks. Nevertheless, there is still little understanding of what triggers reasoning abilities in LLMs in the inference stage. In this paper, we introduce code prompting, a chain of prompts that transforms a natural language problem into code and directly prompts the LLM using the generated code without resorting to external code execution. We hypothesize that code prompts can elicit certain reasoning capabilities of LLMs trained on text and code and utilize the proposed method to improve conditional reasoning, the ability to infer different conclusions depending on the fulfillment of certain conditions. We find that code prompting exhibits a high-performance boost for multiple LLMs (up to 22.52 percentage points on GPT 3.5, 7.75 on Mixtral, and 16.78 on Mistral) across multiple conditional reasoning datasets. We then conduct comprehensive experiments to understand how code prompts trigger reasoning abilities and which capabilities are elicited in the underlying models. Our analysis of GPT 3.5 reveals that the code formatting of the input problem is essential for performance improvement. Furthermore, code prompts improve sample efficiency of in-context learning and facilitate state tracking of variables or entities",

In addition, inspired by the wisdom of \"When unable to attack, defend\" from Sun Tzu's Art of War, we adopt a defensive stance to gather clues about the original malicious query through LLMs. The experimental results indicate that the Query Success Rate of the Puzzler is 14.0%-82.7% higher than baselines on the most prominent LLMs. Furthermore, when tested against the state-of-the-art jailbreak detection approaches, Puzzler proves to be more effective at evading detection compared to baselines",

A typical speech LM takes discrete semantic units as content and a short utterance as prompt, and synthesizes speech which preserves the content's semantics but mimics the prompt's style. However, there is no systematic understanding on how the synthesized audio is controlled by the prompt and content. In this work, we conduct an empirical study of the widely used autoregressive (AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) speech LMs and provide insights into the prompt design and content semantic units. Our analysis reveals that heterogeneous and nonstationary prompts hurt the audio quality in contrast to the previous finding that longer prompts always lead to better synthesis. Moreover, we find that the speaker style of the synthesized audio is also affected by the content in addition to the prompt. We further show that semantic units carry rich acoustic information such as pitch, tempo, volume and speech emphasis, which might be leaked from the content to the synthesized audio",

RLHF uses human preferences based on the guideline of being helpful and safe as a single reward signal to fine-tune language models. However, the trade-offs between helpfulness and safety are often found to be a problem, which makes it difficult for a model trained toward one objective to perform well on both. In this paper, we propose a new alignment technique, named multi-objective language model alignment (MOLMA). The framework is based on multi-objective deep reinforcement learning to fine-tune language models. MOLMA can efficiently address the conflicting or the dominating learning signal issue, which is caused by the the trade-offs of inherent, often conflicting, multi-objectives underlying the language model alignment task. From the overall objective of achieving both helpfulness and safety, our results show that MOLMA outperforms the other alignment techniques that rely on single-objective deep reinforcement learning",

    "abstract": "A multitude of industries depend on accurate and reasonable tabular data augmentation for their business processes. Contemporary methodologies in generating tabular data revolve around utilizing Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) or fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLM). However, GAN-based approaches are documented to produce samples with common-sense errors attributed to the absence of external knowledge. On the other hand, LLM-based methods exhibit a limited capacity to capture the disparities between synthesized and actual data distribution due to the absence of feedback from a discriminator during training. Furthermore, the decoding of LLM-based generation introduces gradient breakpoints, impeding the backpropagation of loss from a discriminator, thereby complicating the integration of these two approaches. To solve this challenge, we propose using proximal policy optimization (PPO) to apply GANs, guiding LLMs to enhance the probability distribution of tabular features. This approach enables the utilization of LLMs as generators for GANs in synthesizing tabular data. Our experiments demonstrate that PPO leads to an approximately 4% improvement in the accuracy of models trained on synthetically generated data over state-of-the-art across three real-world datasets",

    "abstract": "Incrementally expanding the capability of an existing translation model to solve new domain tasks over time is a fundamental and practical problem, which usually suffers from catastrophic forgetting. Generally, multi-domain learning can be seen as a good solution. However, there are two drawbacks: 1) it requires having the training data for all domains available at the same time, which may be unrealistic due to storage or privacy concerns; 2) it requires re-training the model on the data of all domains from scratch when adding a new domain and this is time-consuming and computationally expensive. To address these issues, we present a semi-supervised contrastive distillation framework for incremental neural machine translation. Specifically, to avoid catastrophic forgetting, we propose to exploit unlabeled data from the same distributions of the older domains through knowledge distillation. Further, to ensure the distinct domain characteristics in the model as the number of domains increases, we devise a cross-domain contrastive objective to enhance the distilled knowledge. Extensive experiments on domain translation benchmarks show that our approach, without accessing any previous training data or re-training on all domains from scratch, can significantly prevent the model from forgetting previously learned knowledge while obtaining good performance on the incrementally added domains",

If the join plan is not considered in the retrieval stage, the subsequent steps of reasoning and answering based on those retrieved tables are likely to be incorrect. To address this problem, we introduce a method that uncovers useful join relations for any query and database during table retrieval. We use a novel re-ranking method formulated as a mixed-integer program that considers not only table-query relevance but also table-table relevance that requires inferring join relationships.

Existing datasets fail to train models for this task, so we introduce ShortDiff, a new dataset with 890 short text passages in English together with their level of text difficulty. We experiment with a variety of models on ShortDiff, including finetuning Transformer-based models and prompting LLMs. Our best model achieves accuracy surpassing human experts and has latency appropriate to production environments.

    "abstract": "Considerable effort has been dedicated to detecting machine-generated texts to prevent a situation where the widespread generation of text---with minimal cost and effort--- reduces trust in human interaction and factual information online. Our study takes a more refined approach by analysing different Conversational AI Agents (CAA). By constructing linguistic profiles for each AI agent, the aim is to identify the Uniquely Identifiable Linguistic Patterns (UILPs) for each model and to demonstrate the effectiveness of these UILPs in identifying their respective AI agents using authorship attribution techniques. Promisingly, we are able to classify AI agents based on their original texts with a weighted F1-score of 96.94%. Further, we can attribute AI agents according to their writing style (as specified by prompts), yielding a weighted F1-score of 95.84%, which sets the baseline for this task. By employing principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, we achieve a weighted F1-score ranging from 89.25% to 97.83%, and an overall weighted F1-score of 96.93%",

This is partly because these expressions do not derive their meanings solely from their constituent words, but also due to the scarcity of relevant data resources, and their impact on the performance of downstream tasks such as machine translation and simplification. In this paper we propose an approach to model idiomaticity effectively using a triplet loss that incorporates the asymmetric contribution of components words to an idiomatic meaning for training language models by using adaptive contrastive learning and resampling miners to build an idiomatic-aware learning objective.

To this end, we propose a framework for addressing hallucinations in image captioning in the open-vocabulary setting, including quantifying their presence and optimizing to mitigate such hallucinations. Our OpenCHAIR benchmark leverages generative foundation models to evaluate open-vocabulary caption hallucinations, surpassing the popular CHAIR benchmark in both diversity and accuracy. To mitigate open-vocabulary hallucinations on the sequence level, we propose MOCHa, an approach harnessing advancements in reinforcement learning. Our multi-objective reward function explicitly targets the trade-off between fidelity and adequacy in generations without requiring any strong supervision.

To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel mono/dual-step prompting framework built upon two unique strategies \\textbf{Chain of Evidences (CoE)} and \\textbf{Evidence to Generate (E2G)}. Instead of unverified reasoning claims, our innovative approaches leverage the power of \"evidence for decision making\" by first focusing exclusively on the thought sequences explicitly mentioned in the context which then serve as extracted evidence, guiding the LLM's output generation process with greater precision and efficiency. This simple yet potent approach unlocks the full potential of chain-of-thoughts prompting, facilitating faster, more reliable, and contextually aware reasoning in LLMs. Our framework consistently achieves remarkable results across various knowledge-intensive reasoning and generation tasks, surpassing baseline approaches with state-of-the-art LLMs. For instance, (i) on the LogiQA benchmark using GPT-4, CoE achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 53.8\\%, surpassing CoT by 18\\%, ToT by 11\\%, and CR by 9\\%; (ii) CoE with PaLM-2 outperforms the variable-shot performance of Gemini Ultra by 0.9 F1 points, achieving an F1 score of 83.3 on DROP",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are effective at answering questions that are clearly asked. However, when faced with ambiguous queries they can act unpredictably and produce incorrect outputs. This underscores the need for the development of intelligent agents capable of asking clarification questions to resolve ambiguities effectively. This capability requires complex understanding, state tracking, reasoning and planning over multiple conversational turns. However, directly measuring this can be challenging.In this paper, we offer a surrogate problem which assesses an LLMs's capability to deduce an entity unknown to itself, but revealed to a judge, by asking the judge a series of queries. This entity-deducing game can serve as an evaluation framework to probe the conversational reasoning and planning capabilities of language models.We systematically evaluate various LLMs and discover significant differences in their performance on this task. We find that strong LLMs like GPT-4 outperform human players by a large margin. We further employ Behavior Cloning (BC) to examine whether a weaker model is capable of imitating a stronger model and generalizing to data or domains, using only the demonstrations from a stronger model. We finally propose to use Reinforcement Learning to enhance reasoning and planning capacity of Vicuna models through episodes of game playing, which lead to significant performance improvement. We hope that this problem offers insights into how autonomous agents could be trained to behave more intelligently in ambiguous circumstances",

FactPICO consists of 345 plain language summaries of RCT abstracts generated from three LLMs, with fine-grained evaluation and natural language rationales from experts. We assess the factuality of critical elements of RCTs in those summaries: Populations, Interventions, Comparators, Outcomes (PICO), as well as the reported findings concerning these. We also evaluate the correctness of the extra information (e.g., explanations) added by LLMs. Using FactPICO, we benchmark a range of existing factuality metrics, including the newly devised ones based on LLMs. We find that plain language summarization of medical evidence is still challenging, especially when balancing between simplicity and factuality, and that existing metrics correlate poorly with expert judgments on the instance level.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Human-AI Value Alignment has emerged as a central challenge in the rapid deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI). In many applications like Large Language Models (LLMs), the goals and constraints for the AI model's desired behavior are known only to a (potentially very small) group of humans. The objective then is to develop mechanisms that allow humans to communicate these goals both efficiently and reliably to AI models like LLMs prior to their deployment. This requires explicitly reasoning about human strategies for shaping the behavior of AI agents, and how these strategies are derived from the humans' prior beliefs about the AI's own learning process. In this position paper, we argue that it is natural to view the alignment problem from the perspective of multiagent systems (MAS). We briefly survey open alignment challenges in the finetuning of large language models and in zero-shot learning with LLMs. We then connect these open questions to concepts developed for multiagent problems (particularly for ad hoc coordination), and discuss how these ideas may be applied to address mis-alignment in LLMs",

While achieving decent performance, previous methods implicitly assume a forward-only execution mode for the model, where they only provide oracle trajectories as in-context examples to guide the model on how to reason in the environment. Consequently, the model could not handle more challenging scenarios not covered in the in-context examples, e.g., mistakes, leading to sub-optimal performance. To address this issue, we propose to model the interactive task as state space exploration, where the LLM agent transitions among a pre-defined set of states by performing actions to complete the task. This formulation enables flexible backtracking, allowing the model to recover from errors easily. We evaluate our proposed LLM Agent with State-Space ExploRation (LASER) on both the WebShop task and amazon.com.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs), even when specifically trained to process long input contexts, struggle to capture relevant information located in the middle of their input. This phenomenon has been known as the lost-in-the-middle problem. In this work, we make three contributions. First, we set out to understand the factors that cause this phenomenon. In doing so, we establish a connection between lost-in-the-middle to LLMs' intrinsic attention bias: LLMs exhibit an U-shaped attention bias where the tokens at the beginning and at the end of its input receive higher attention, regardless of their relevance. Second, we mitigate this positional bias through a calibration mechanism, found-in-the-middle, that allows the model to attend to contexts faithfully according to their relevance, even though when they are in the middle. Third, we show found-in-the-middle not only achieves better performance in locating relevant information within a long context, but also eventually leads to improved retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) performance across various tasks, outperforming existing methods by up to 10 percentage point. These findings open up future directions in understanding LLM attention bias and its potential consequences",

Yet the mechanisms underlying this contextual grounding remain unknown, especially in situations where contextual information contradicts factual knowledge stored in the parameters, which LLMs also excel at recalling. Favoring the contextual information is critical for retrieval-augmented generation methods, which enrich the context with up-to-date information, hoping that grounding can rectify outdated or noisy stored knowledge. We present a novel method to study grounding abilities using Fakepedia, a dataset of counterfactual texts constructed to clash with a model's internal parametric knowledge. We benchmark various LLMs with Fakepedia and then we conduct a causal mediation analysis, based on our Masked Grouped Causal Tracing (MGCT), on LLM components when answering Fakepedia queries. Within this analysis, we identify distinct computational patterns between grounded and ungrounded responses. We finally demonstrate that distinguishing grounded from ungrounded responses is achievable through computational analysis alone.

In this paper, we present a novel method to optimize LLMs using ranking metrics. This method trains the model to prioritize the best responses from a pool of candidates created for a particular task. Rather than a traditional full ordering, we advocate for a partial ordering, as achieving consensus on the perfect order of candidate responses can be challenging. Our partial ordering is more robust, less sensitive to noise, and can be achieved with limited human annotations or through heuristic methods. We test our system's improved response generation ability using benchmark datasets, including the latest multi-document question answering task. We conduct ablation studies to understand crucial factors, such as how to gather candidate responses for specific tasks, determine their most suitable order, and balance supervised fine-tuning with ranking metrics.

Understanding how LLMs interpret generic statements serves not only as a measure of their ability to abstract but also arguably plays a role in their encoding of stereotypes. Given that generics interpretation necessitates a comparison with explicitly quantified sentences, we explored i.) whether LLMs can correctly associate a quantifier with the generic structure, and ii.) whether the presence of a generic sentence as context influences the outcomes of quantifiers. We evaluated LLMs using both Surprisal distributions and prompting techniques.The findings indicate that models do not exhibit a strong sensitivity to quantification. Nevertheless, they seem to encode a meaning linked with the generic structure, which leads them to adjust their answers accordingly when a generalization is provided as context",

Our method decomposes short and long-range modeling aspects of LVQA into two stages. First, we use a short-term visual captioner to generate textual descriptions of short video clips (0.5-8s in length) densely sampled from a long input video. Afterward, an LLM aggregates the densely extracted short-term captions to answer a given question. Furthermore, we propose a novel multi-round summarization prompt that asks the LLM first to summarize the noisy short-term visual captions and then answer a given input question. To analyze what makes our simple framework so effective, we thoroughly evaluate various components of our framework. Our empirical analysis reveals that the choice of the visual captioner and LLM is critical for good LVQA performance.

While humans can indeed imitate correct examples, learning from our mistakes is another vital aspect of human cognition. Hence, a question naturally arises: \\textit{can LLMs learn and benefit from their mistakes, especially for their reasoning? }This study investigates this problem from both the prompting and model-tuning perspectives. We begin by introducing \\textsc{CoTErrorSet}, a new benchmark with 609,432 questions, each designed with both correct and error references, and demonstrating the types and reasons for making such mistakes. To explore the effectiveness of those mistakes, we design two methods: (1) \\textbf{Self-rethinking} prompting guides LLMs to rethink whether they have made similar previous mistakes; and (2) \\textbf{Mistake tuning} involves finetuning models in both correct and incorrect reasoning domains, rather than only tuning models to learn ground truth in traditional methodology. We conduct a series of experiments to prove LLMs can obtain benefits from mistakes in both directions. Our two methods offer potentially cost-effective strategies by leveraging errors to enhance reasoning capabilities, which costs significantly less than creating meticulously hand-crafted golden references. We ultimately make a thorough analysis of the reasons behind LLMs' errors, which provides directions that future research needs to overcome. \\textsc{CoTErrorSet} will be published soon on \\texttt{Anonymity Link}",

This multi-type, schema-integrated, context-dependent Text2SQL dataset comprises nearly 800 dialogue groups and over 9,000 interaction turns across 166 complex databases, offering a better benchmark for interactive user-database dialogue.Addressing MultiSQL's challenges, we refined evaluation metrics to better capture diverse SQL types and schema dependencies. We designed a prompt framework that leverages historical data and self-refinement to accurately capture the dependency between text queries and database structures.

    "title": "VariErr NLI: Separating Annotation Error from Human Label Variation",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Human label variation arises when annotators assign different labels to the same item for valid reasons, while annotation errors occur when labels are assigned for invalid reasons. These two issues are prevalent in NLP benchmarks, yet existing research has studied them in isolation. To the best of our knowledge, there exists no prior work that focuses on teasing apart error from signal, especially in cases where signal is beyond black-and-white.To fill this gap, we introduce a systematic methodology and a new dataset, VariErr (variation versus error), focusing on the NLI task in English. We propose a 2-round annotation scheme with annotators explaining each label and subsequently judging the validity of label-explanation pairs.VariErr contains 7,574 validity judgments on 1,933 explanations for 500 re-annotated NLI items. We assess the effectiveness of various automatic error detection (AED) methods and GPTs in uncovering errors versus human label variation. We find that state-of-the-art AED methods significantly underperform compared to GPTs and humans. While GPT-4 is the best system, it still falls short of human performance by 15.2 on average precision. Our methodology is applicable beyond NLI, offering fertile ground for future research on true error versus plausible variation, which in turn can yield better and more trustworthy NLP systems",

In this study, we delve into the intersection of persona variables and the capability of LLMs to simulate different perspectives. We find that persona variables can explain <10\\% variance in annotations in existing NLP datasets. Nonetheless, incorporating them via prompting in LLMs provides modest improvement. Persona prompting is most effective on data samples where disagreements among annotators are frequent yet confined to a limited range. A linear correlation exists: the more persona variables influence human response, the better LLMs predictions are using persona prompting. However, when the utility of persona variables is low (i.e., explaining <10\\% of human responses), persona prompting has little effect. Most subjective NLP datasets fall into this category, casting doubt on simulating diverse perspectives in the current NLP landscape",

    "abstract": "Theory of Mind (ToM), the ability to understand people's minds, is an essential ingredient for developing machines with human-level social intelligence. Recent machine learning models, particularly large language models, seem to show some aspects of ToM understanding. However, existing ToM benchmarks use unimodal datasets – either video or text. Human ToM, on the other hand, is more than video or text understanding. People can flexibly reason about another person's mind based on conceptual representations (e.g., goals, beliefs, plans) extracted from any available data. To address this, we introduce a multimodal Theory of Mind question answering (MMToM-QA) benchmark. MMToM-QA comprehensively evaluates machine ToM both on multimodal data and on different kinds of unimodal data about a person's activity in a household environment. To engineer multimodal ToM capacity, we propose a novel method, BIP-ALM (Bayesian Inverse Planning Accelerated by Language Models). BIP-ALM extracts unified representations from multimodal data and utilizes language models for scalable Bayesian inverse planning. We conducted a systematic comparison of human performance, BIP-ALM, and state-of-the-art models, including GPT-4. The experiments demonstrate that large language models and large multimodal models still lack robust ToM capacity. BIP-ALM, on the other hand, shows promising results, by leveraging the power of both model-based mental inference and language models",

    "abstract": "Zero-shot translation aims to translate between language pairs not seen during training in Multilingual Machine Translation (MMT) and is largely considered an open problem. A common, albeit resource-consuming, solution is to add as many related translation directions as possible to the training corpus. In this paper, we show that the zero-shot capability of an English-centric model can be easily improved by fine-tuning with a very small amount of multi-parallel data. For example, on the EC30 dataset, we show that up to +21.7 ChrF non-English overall improvements (870 directions) can be achieved by using only 100 multi-parallel samples while preserving English-centric translation quality. When investigating the size effect of fine-tuning data and its transfer capabilities, we found to our surprise that already a small, randomly sampled set of fine-tuning directions is sufficient to achieve comparable improvements. The resulting non-English performance is close to the complete translation upper bound. We show that even in a minimal setting---fine-tuning with only one single sample---the well-known off-target issue is almost completely resolved, explaining parts--but not all---of the observed gains in translation quality",

In this work, we solve this problem by calibrating the likelihood of model generated sequences to better align with a consistency metric measured by natural language inference (NLI) models. The human evaluation study and LLM-based evaluation show that the calibrated models generate more consistent and higher-quality summaries.We also show that the models trained using our method return probabilities that are better aligned with the NLI scores, which improves reliability of summarization models",

Generating these high-quality annotated training sets from unlabelled data is both expensive and unreliable.

Consequently, researchers are shifting focus towards text data augmentation strategies to overcome these restrictions. In this work, we present an innovative data augmentation method, PromptAug, focusing on the design of distinct prompt engineering techniques for Large Language Models (LLMs).

Furthermore, we evaluate PromptAug over a variety of dataset sizes, proving it's effectiveness even in extreme data scarcity scenarios.

Specifically, we study how to persuade LLMs to jailbreak them. First, we propose a persuasion taxonomy derived from decades of social science research. Then, we apply the taxonomy to automatically generate persuasive adversarial prompts (PAP) to jailbreak LLMs. Results show that persuasion significantly increases the jailbreak risk across all risk categories: PAP consistently achieves an attack success rate of over 92\\% on Llama-2-7b-Chat, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 in 10 trials, surpassing recent algorithm-focused attacks.

    "abstract": "In order to oversee advanced AI systems, it is important to understand their reasons for generating a given output. When prompted, large language models (LLMs) can provide natural language explanations or reasoning traces that sound plausible and receive high ratings from human annotators. However, it is unclear to what extent these explanations are truly capturing the factors responsible for the model's predictions: the most ``human-like'' explanation may be different from the one that is most faithful to the model's true decision making process. In this work, we introduce the correlational counterfactual test (CCT), a faithfulness metric based on counterfactual input edits that takes into account not just the binary label change, but the total shift in the model's predicted label distribution. We evaluate the faithfulness of free-text explanations generated by few-shot-prompted LLMs from the Llama-2 family on three NLP tasks. We find that these explanations are indeed more likely to mention factors when they are impactful to the model's prediction, with the degree of association increasing with model size but varying significantly by task",

The resulting semantic clusters, that describe properties of the language of the participants, are evaluated for their use in a predictive model to identify speakers with PPA. Because language is relatively easy to acquire, its quantification may provide a low cost instrument that augments other spontaneous speech analyses in clinical practice.Materials and methodsSpeech was recorded from 15 control, 8 nonfluent variant (nfvPPA) and 8 semantic variant (svPPA) speakers, each describing the actions and figures on a given picture. Transcriptions of the recordings of controls were used to compute a prototypical description. Clustering was used to identify topics. The semantic distance between the prototype and the participant's language was used to quantify the degree to which the language of persons with PPA deviates from normal language. A classifier was used to classify individual fragments.ResultsThe vocabulary of speakers with PPA was found to be less diverse in speakers with PPA. Different clusters were identified automatically that correspond with categories of objects and actions in the image. In several clusters, speakers with PPA showed significant deviations in word usage from the prototype derived from control speakers.Group level differences were found. Compared to control speakers, nfvPPA speakers use fewer auxiliary verbs and verbs that describe figure actions, and fewer nouns that describe non-human figures. SvPPA speakers use more auxiliary verbs and fewer words that describe figures and actions. Both use more words that are semantically remote.A Random Forest classifier out-performed baseline with F1 scores of 0.80 (classes: control vs. PPA) and 0.71 (classes: control vs. nfvPPA vs. svPPA).DiscussionParticipants in both PPA groups show a profile that is distinct from that of control speakers.

A key insight from our evaluation is the notable efficacy of explainable prompting in enhancing the reliability of these models, highlighting the importance of explainable settings for social science research on framing bias. GPT-4, in particular, demonstrated enhanced performance in few-shot scenarios when presented with a range of relevant, in-domain examples. FLAN-T5's poor performance indicates that smaller models may require additional task-specific fine-tuning for identifying framing bias detection. Our study also found that models, particularly GPT-4, often misinterpret emotional language as an indicator of framing bias, underscoring the challenge of distinguishing between reporting genuine emotional expression and intentionally use framing bias in news headlines. We further evaluated the models on two subsets of headlines where the presence or absence of framing bias was either clear-cut or more contested, with the results suggesting that these models' can be useful in flagging potential annotation inaccuracies within existing or new datasets.

Prior XMC research has typically concentrated on supervised learning methods. However, real-world scenarios frequently present situations where complete supervision signals, in the form of labeled and balanced datasets, are not available, highlighting the importance and relevance of zero-shot learning settings in XMC. In this paper, we study the XMC task on biomedical documents under the zero-shot setting which does not require any annotated documents in the training phase. We propose a novel label-centric curriculum contrastive learning framework for the training phase, which effectively utilizes hierarchical label information and label-metadata co-occurrence. For the inference phase, we employ a multi-stage retrieve and re-rank framework to make more accurate predictions by ruling out the irrelevant labels before ranking, rather than making direct predictions on the entire large label set. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving the performance of XMC",

Yet, RPA struggles with tasks needing human-like intelligence, especially in elaborate design of workflow construction and dynamic decision-making in workflow execution. As Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged human-like intelligence, this paper introduces Agentic Process Automation (APA), a groundbreaking automation paradigm using LLM-based agents for advanced automation by offloading the human labor to agents associated with construction and execution. We then instantiate ProAgent, an LLM-based agent designed to craft workflows from human instructions and make intricate decisions by coordinating specialized agents. Empirical experiments are conducted to detail its construction and execution procedure of workflow, showcasing the feasibility of APA, unveiling the possibility of a new paradigm of automation driven by agents",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Open domain question answering (ODQA) aims to answer questions with knowledge from an external corpus. Fusion-in-Decoder (FiD) is an effective retrieval-augmented reader model to address this task. Given that FiD independently encodes passages, which overlooks the semantic relationships between passages, some studies use knowledge graphs (KGs) to establish dependencies among passages. However, they only leverage knowledge triples from existing KGs, which suffer from incompleteness and may lack certain information critical for answering given questions. To this end, in order to capture the dependencies between passages while tacking the issue of incompleteness in existing KGs, we propose to enhance the retrieval-augmented reader model with a knowledge graph generation module (REANO). Specifically, REANO consists of a KG generator and an answer predictor. The KG generator aims to generate KGs from the passages and the answer predictor then generates answers based on the passages and the generated KGs. Experimental results on five ODQA datasets indicate that compared with baselines, REANO can improve the exact match score by up to 2.7% on the EntityQuestion dataset, with an average improvement of 1.8% across all the datasets",

This sparsity of rewards can lead to inefficient and unstable learning.To address this challenge, our paper introduces an novel framework that utilizes the critique capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce intermediate-step rewards during RL training.Our method involves coupling a policy model with a critic language model, which is responsible for providing comprehensive feedback of each part of the output. This feedback is then translated into token or span-level rewards that can be used to guide the RL training process.We investigate this approach under two different settings: one where the policy model is smaller and is paired with a more powerful critic model, and another where a single language model fulfills both roles.We assess our approach on three text generation tasks: sentiment control, language model detoxification, and summarization.

    "abstract": "Editing knowledge in large language models is an attractive capability that allows us to correct incorrectly learned facts during pre-training, as well as update the model with an ever-growing list of new facts. While existing model editing techniques have shown promise, they are usually evaluated using metrics for reliability, specificity and generalization over one or few edits. We argue that for model editing to have practical utility, we must be able to make multiple edits to the same model. With this in mind, we evaluate current model editing methods at scale, focusing on two state of the art methods - ROME and MEMIT. With the lens of scalability, we evaluate model editing methods for three crucial properties - editing proficiency, fact forgetting and downstream performance. We find that as a model is edited sequentially with multiple facts, it continually becomes less editable, forgets previously edited facts and loses the ability to perform downstream tasks. For ROME and MEMIT, this \"forgetting\" happens in two phases - an initial gradual but progressive forgetting phase followed by an abrupt or catastrophic forgetting. Both gradual and catastrophic forgetting limit the usefulness of model editing methods at scale - the former makes model editing less effective as multiple edits are made to the model while the latter caps the scalability of such model editing methods. Our analysis also highlights other key limitations of ROME and MEMIT at scale. With our work, we push for better evaluation of model editing and development of model editing methods keeping scalability in mind",

    "abstract": "Recently, advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown an unprecedented ability across various language tasks. This paper investigates the potential application of LLMs to slot filling with noisy ASR transcriptions, via both in-context learning and task-specific fine-tuning. Dedicated prompt designs and noise-robust LoRA fine-tuning are proposed to improve the robustness of LLMs for slot filling with noisy ASR transcriptions. Moreover, a linearised knowledge injection (LKI) scheme is also proposed to integrate dynamic external knowledge into LLMs. Experiments were performed on SLURP to quantify the performance of LLMs, including GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, LLaMA-13B, LLaMA-2-13B and Vicuna-13B (v1.1 and v1.5) with different ASR error rates. The use of the noise-robust fine-tuning together with LKI for Vicuna-13B-v1.5 achieved 6.7% and 17.6% absolute SLU-F1 improvements compared to a fully fine-tuned Flan-T5-XL model on the limited data setup and the zero-shot setup respectively",

This paper introduces RoleEval, a bilingual benchmark designed to assess the memorization, utilization, and reasoning capabilities of role knowledge. RoleEval comprises RoleEval-Global (including internationally recognized characters) and RoleEval-Chinese (including characters popular in China), with 6,000 Chinese-English parallel multiple-choice questions focusing on 300 influential people and fictional characters drawn from a variety of domains including celebrities, anime, comics, movies, TV series, games, and fictions. These questions cover basic knowledge and multi-hop reasoning abilities, aiming to systematically probe various aspects such as personal information, relationships, abilities, and experiences of the characters. To maintain high standards, we perform a hybrid quality check process combining both automatic and human verification, ensuring that the questions are diverse, challenging, and discriminative.Our extensive evaluations with RoleEval across various open-source and proprietary large language models, under both the zero- and few-shot settings, reveal insightful findings. Notably, while GPT-4 outperforms other models on RoleEval-Global, Chinese large language models excel on RoleEval-Chinese, highlighting significant knowledge distribution differences.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Compactness in deep learning can be critical to a model's viability in low-resource applications, and a common approach to extreme model compression is quantization. We consider Iterative Product Quantization (iPQ) with Quant-Noise to be state-of-the-art in Quantization Aware Training (QAT), but this quantization framework suffers from preventable inference quality degradation due to prevalent empty clusters in bi-directional language modeling tasks. In this paper, we propose several novel enhancements aiming to improve the accuracy of iPQ with Quant-Noise by focusing on resolving empty clusters. Our contribution, which we call Partitioning-Guided k-means (PG k-means), is a heavily augmented k-means implementation composed of three main components. First, we propose a partitioning-based pre-assignment strategy that minimizes initial empty clusters and encourages an even weight-to-cluster distribution. Second, we propose an empirically superior empty cluster resolution heuristic executed via partitioning of large clusters. Finally, we construct an optional optimization step that consolidates intuitively dense clusters of weights to ensure shared representation. The proposed approach consistently reduces the number of empty clusters in iPQ with Quant-Noise by 100x on average and improves overall model accuracy by up to 12%, when applied to RoBERTa on a variety of tasks in the GLUE benchmark",

Our work highlights the importance of explainability in medical LLMs, proposes an effective methodology for evaluating models beyond classification accuracy, and sheds light on one specific domain, speech language pathology, where current LLMs including GPT4 lack good understanding. Our results show generation evaluation with multiple explanations aligns better with human assessment, highlighting an opportunity for a more robust automated comprehension assessment for LLMs. To diversify open-source medical LLMs (currently mostly based on Llama2), this work also proposes a new medical model, MedPhi-2, based on Phi-2 (2.7B).

However, their ability to generate rationales for knowledge-intensive tasks (KITs) remains under-explored.

In this work, we consider the task of generating retrieval-augmented rationalization of KIT model predictions via external knowledge-guidance within a few-shot setting. Surprisingly, crowd-workers preferred LLM-generated rationales over existing crowd-sourced rationales, generated in a similar knowledge-guided setting, on aspects such as factuality, sufficiency, and convincingness. However, follow-up fine-grained evaluation of such rationales highlight the need for further improvements in conciseness, novelty, and domain invariance. Additionally, through an expert-sourced study evaluating the reliability of the rationales, we demonstrate that humans' trust in LLM-generated rationales erode when communicated faithfully, i.e., without taking model prediction accuracy into account.

Specifically, we leverage a diverse set of auto-selected null-meaning inputs generated from GPT-4 to prompt pre-trained LMs for intrinsic bias probing. Utilizing the bias-reflected probability distribution, we formulate a distribution disparity loss for bias calibration, where we exclusively update bias parameters ($0.1\\%$ of total parameters) of LMs towards equal probability distribution. Experimental results show that the calibration promotes an equitable starting point for LMs while preserving language modeling abilities.

As a result, in addition to benchmarking the capabilities of LVLMs in understanding multipanel images, we analyze the potential causes for LVLMs' performance and offer insights for enhancement with the synthetic data.

    "abstract": "Tables in scientific papers contain crucial information, such as experimental results.Entity Linking (EL) is a promising technology that analyses tables and associates them with a knowledge base.EL for table cells requires identifying the referent concept of each cell while understanding the context relevant to each cell in the paper. However, extracting the relevant context from the paper is challenging because the relevant parts are scattered in the main text and captions.This study defines a rule-based method for extracting broad context from the main text, including table captions and sentences that mention the table.Furthermore, we propose synthetic context as a more refined context generated by large language models (LLMs).In a synthetic context, contexts from the entire paper are refined by summarizing, injecting supplemental knowledge, and clarifying the referent concept.We observe this approach improves accuracy for EL by more than 10 points on the S2abEL dataset, and our qualitative analysis suggests potential future works",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "With the explosion of multimedia content in recent years, Video Corpus Moment Retrieval (VCMR), which aims to detect a video moment that matches a given natural language query from multiple videos, has become a critical problem.However, existing VCMR studies have a significant limitation since they have regarded all videos not paired with a specific query as negative, neglecting the possibility of including false negatives when constructing the negative video set.In this paper, we propose an MVMR (Massive Videos Moment Retrieval) task that aims to localize video frames within a massive video set, mitigating the possibility of falsely distinguishing positive and negative videos.For this task, we suggest an automatic dataset construction framework by employing textual and visual semantic matching evaluation methods on the existing video moment search datasets and introduce three MVMR datasets.To solve MVMR task, we further propose a strong method, CroCs, which employs cross-directional contrastive learning that selectively identifies the reliable and informative negatives, enhancing the robustness of a model on MVMR task. Experimental results on the introduced datasets reveal that existing video moment search models are easily distracted by negative video frames, whereas our model shows significant performance",

The dataset is comprised of 2,000 unique image-caption pairs, grouped into 1,000 examples. Each example includes a caption-image pair, along with a \"color-swapped\" pair. We follow the Winoground schema: the two captions in an example have the same words, but the color words have been rearranged to modify different objects. The dataset was created through a novel blend of automated caption and image generation with humans in the loop. We evaluate image-text matching (ITM) and visual language models (VLMs) and find that even the latest ones are still not robust at this task. GPT-4V and LLaVA score 72% and 42% on our main VLM metric, although they may improve with more advanced prompting techniques. On the main ITM metric, contrastive models such as CLIP and SigLIP perform close to chance (at 12% and 30%, respectively), although the non-contrastive BLIP ITM model is stronger (87%).

Instead of general alignment, in this work, we focus on self-alignment for expert domain specialization (e.g., biomedicine, finance). As a preliminary, we quantitively show the marginal effect that generic instruction-following training has on downstream expert domains' performance. To remedy this, we propose self-specialization - allowing for effective model specialization while achieving cross-task generalization by leveraging only a few labeled seeds. Self-specialization offers a data- and parameter-efficient way of \"carving out\" an expert model out of a generalist pre-trained LLM. Exploring a variety of popular open large models as a base for specialization, our experimental results in both biomedical and financial domains show that our self-specialized models outperform their base models by a large margin, and even larger models that are generally instruction-tuned or that have been adapted to the target domain by other means",

We evaluate such learnt tokenizers on the task of machine translation across six language pairs and find that while they do not outperform subwords in general, they are more robust to misspellings and better on very short and very long sentences (by as much as 70\\%).

MLEMs are capable to detect both local and distributed representations.As a proof-of-concept, we apply MLEMs to neural representations extracted from BERT, and find that: (1)~there exists an order among linguistic features, which separate representations of sentences to different degrees in different layers; (2)~for some layers, neural representations are organized in a \\emph{hierarchical} way, with clusters nested within larger clusters, separated by linguistic features at different scales;(3)~in some layers (most strikingly the middle layer five of BERT), linguistic features are strongly disentangled, that is, represented within distinct clusters of selective units;(4)~MLEMs are more robust to type-I errors compared to multivariate decoding methods and are superior to univariate encoding methods in predicting neural activity.Together, this demonstrates the utility of Metric-Learning Encoding Methods for studying how linguistic features are neurally encoded in language models and the advantage of MLEMs over traditional methods. MLEMs can be extended to other domains (e.g., vision) and to other neural systems, such as the human brain",

As a consequence, current LMs also generate incorrect or nonsensical content, and are difficult to edit and bring up to date. We present a method called Deductive Closure Training (DCT) that uses LMs themselves to identify implications of (and contradictions within) the text that they generate, yielding an efficient self-supervised procedure for improving LM factuality. Given a collection of seed documents, DCT prompts LMs to generate additional text implied by these documents, reason globally about the correctness of this generated text, and finally fine-tune on text inferred to be correct. Given seed documents from a trusted source, DCT provides a tool for supervised model updating; if seed documents are sampled from the LM itself, DCT enables fully unsupervised fine-tuning for improved coherence and accuracy. Across the CREAK, MQuAKE, and Reversal Curse datasets, supervised DCT improves LM fact verification and text generation accuracy by 3-26%; on CREAK, fully unsupervised DCT improves verification accuracy by 12%. These results show that LMs' reasoning capabilities during inference can be leveraged during training to improve their reliability",

Despite the impressive capability of code LLMs in general code completion tasks, they often exhibit less satisfactory performance on repository-level completion due to the lack of repository-specific knowledge in these LLMs. To address this problem, we propose GraphCoder, a retrieval-augmented code completion framework that leverages LLMs' general code knowledge and the repository-specific knowledge via a graph-based retrieval-generation process. In particular, GraphCoder captures the context of completion target through code context graph (CCG) that consists of control-flow and data/control-dependence between code statements, a more structured way to capture the completion target context than the sequence-based context used in existing retrieval-augmented approaches; based on CCG, GraphCoder further employs a coarse-to-fine retrieval process to locate context-similar code snippets with the completion target from the current repository. Experimental results show that: compared with the state-of-the-art method RepoCoder, GraphCoder improves the exact match metric by 5.93% on average",

Importantly, our graph is instantiated through our designed two-stage LLM prompting, thereby without reliance on human annotations. We present three unique studies on its practical utility, examining the edge efficacy via recap identification, local context augmentation via plot retrieval, and broader applications exemplified by long document QA.

The inherent heterogeneity of content within multimodal inputs and outputs presents a significant challenge to the execution of MSMO. Traditional approaches typically adopt a holistic perspective on coarse image-text data or individual visual objects, overlooking the essential connections between objects and the entities they represent. To integrate the fine-grained entity knowledge, we propose an Entity-Guided Multimodal Summarization model (EGMS). Our model, building on BART, utilizes dual multimodal encoders with shared weights to process text-image and entity-image information concurrently. A gating mechanism then combines visual data for enhanced textual summary generation, while image selection is refined through knowledge distillation from a pre-trained vision-language model.

However, the substantial size and parameter volume of these LLMs require massive GPU memory.

This study introduces Anchor-based LLMs (AnLLMs), which utilize an innovative anchor-based self-attention network (AnSAN) and also an anchor-based inference strategy. This approach enables LLMs to compress sequence information into an anchor token, reducing the keys/values cache and enhancing inference efficiency. Experiments on question-answering benchmarks reveal that AnLLMs maintain similar accuracy levels while achieving up to 99% keys/values cache reduction and up to 3.5 times faster inference. Despite a minor compromise in accuracy, the substantial enhancements of AnLLMs employing the AnSAN technique in resource utilization and computational efficiency underscore their potential for practical LLM applications",

However, fine-tuning still remains crucial to further enhance their adaptability.

We address this issue by introducing a prompt-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) approach. GNNavi leverages insights into ICL's information flow dynamics, which indicates that label words act in prompts as anchors for information propagation. GNNavi employs a Graph Neural Network (GNN) layer to precisely guide the aggregation and distribution of information flow during the processing of prompts by hardwiring the desired information flow into the GNN. Our experiments on text classification tasks with GPT-2 and Llama2 shows GNNavi surpasses standard prompt-based fine-tuning methods in few-shot settings by updating just 0.2% to 0.5% of parameters. We compare GNNavi with prevalent PEFT approaches, such as prefix tuning, LoRA and Adapter in terms of performance and efficiency.

    "abstract": "Sequence models, particularly those leveraging transformer architectures, have dominated the Automatic Text Classification (ATC) field in the last years. These models represent words as dense contextual vectors that will compose the document (dense) representations. Though effective these models are expensive for training (fine-tuning) and at inference (prediction) time. Traditional bag-of-words approaches that directly represent a document as a single sparse vector are usually much more efficient, but are not as effective as sequence models. Both types of model commonly involve constructing a representation of the entire document before predicting its class, overlooking the importance of some individual word (co-)occurrences for the target task. This paper takes a completely different approach to the ATC task by promoting words as ``first-class'' citizens for ATC. In other words, our method called ETC$^2$, directly classifies each term of a document -- using an intricate combination of: (i) frequentist information; (ii) explicit co-occurrence and context modeling; and (iii) (near-)attention layering. It then uses these predictions to estimate the document class. The proposed approach eliminates the need for a single representation of the document, thus enormously improving model efficiency. In our experimental evaluation, ETC$^2$ was as effective as (if not better) than the best Transformer baselines in the tested datasets, being up to 17x faster at inference (prediction) time than modern Transformer-based classifiers",

To support our study, we curate a diverse dataset that includes transcripts from real-world scenarios, movie or TV show transcripts, and dialogues generated by a Large Language Model. We then perform a pre-training, which encompasses the detection of speaker changes, and masked utterance generation. Experimental results of fine-tuned models demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on downstream benchmarks with long context, surpassing baseline models and highlighting the effectiveness of our approach. Our findings highlight the importance of curating pre-training datasets that exhibit diversity and variations in length distribution to ensure effective alignment with downstream datasets",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional proficiency in natural language processing, their efficacy in addressing complex, multifaceted tasks remains limited. A growing area of research focuses on LLM-based agents equipped with external tools capable of performing diverse tasks. However, existing LLM-based agents only support a limited set of tools which is unable to cover a diverse range of user queries, especially for those involving expertise domains. It remains a challenge for LLM-based agents to extend their tools autonomously when confronted with various user queries. As GitHub has hosted a multitude of repositories which can be seen as a good resource for tools, a promising solution is that LLM-based agents can autonomously integrate the repositories in GitHub according to the user queries to extend their tool set. In this paper, we introduce GitAgent, an agent capable of achieving the autonomous tool extension from GitHub. GitAgent follows a four-phase procedure to incorporate repositories and it can learn human experience by resorting to GitHub Issues/PRs to solve problems encountered during the procedure. Experimental evaluation on our constructed GitBench demonstrates GitAgent's effectiveness",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "One of the central skills that language learners need to practice is speaking the language. Currently, students in school do not get enough speaking opportunities and lack conversational practice. The recent advances in speech technology and natural language processing allow the creation of novel tools to practice their speaking skills. In this work, we tackle the first component of such a pipeline, namely, the automated speech recognition module (ASR). State-of-the-art models are often trained on adult read-aloud data by native speakers and do not transfer well to young language learners' speech. Second, most ASR systems contain a powerful language model, which smooths out mistakes made by the speakers. To give corrective feedback, which is a crucial part of language learning, the ASR systems in our setting need to preserve the mistakes made by the language learners. In this work, we build an ASR system that satisfies these requirements: it works on spontaneous speech by young language learners and preserves their mistakes. For this, we collected a corpus containing around 85 hours of English audio spoken by Swiss learners from grades 4 to 6 on different language learning tasks, which we used to train an ASR model. Our experiments show that our model benefits from direct fine-tuning of children's voices and has a much higher error preservation rate",

In this way, the most helpful data cannot be effectively distinguished, leading to suboptimal model performance.To reduce the potential redundancies of datasets, we make the first attempt and propose a novel dynamic data mixture for MoE instruction tuning.Specifically, inspired by MoE's token routing preference, we build dataset-level representations and then capture the subtle differences among datasets.Finally, we propose to dynamically adjust the sampling weight of datasets by their inter-redundancies, thus maximizing global performance under a limited training budget.The experimental results on two MoE models demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on both downstream knowledge \\& reasoning tasks and open-ended queries",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Argument mining involves the identification of the argument relations (AR) between pair of propositions. Often, the AR between propositions depends on contextual factors, although this context is not always overtly stated within the propositions. While humans possess the ability to infer the requisite background context for linking propositions, machines encounter challenges in doing so when such contextual cues are not explicitly provided. Establishing connections between propositions relies on maintaining a coherent flow of interconnected ideas, often centered around discussed entities, topics, or themes. This study aims to leverage external resources, including WordNet, ConceptNet, and Wikipedia, by aligning the entities within propositions with these external resources to identify the interconnected flow of ideas by analysing the chain of semantic relations linking these entities. To effectively extract relevant information from these chains, we propose integrating attention mechanisms into Multi-Network architectures. This integration allows the model to focus not only on the information presented in the propositions but also on the chain of entities, thereby enhancing the AR identification process. We evaluate various configurations of the architecture on two ontological resources (WordNet, ConceptNet) and Wikipedia, achieving a new state of the art performance with F-measure scores of 0.85, 0.84, and 0.71 respectively on three diverse datasets",

Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a promising solution to address these challenges, yet struggle with accurately interpreting human emotions and complex contents like misinformation. This paper introduces MM-Soc, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' understanding of multimodal social media content. MM-Soc compiles prominent multimodal datasets and incorporates a novel large-scale YouTube tagging dataset, targeting a range of tasks from misinformation detection, hate speech detection, and social context generation. Through our exhaustive evaluation on ten size-variants of four open-source MLLMs, we have identified significant performance disparities, highlighting the need for advancements in models' social understanding capabilities. Our analysis reveals that, in a zero-shot setting, various types of MLLMs generally exhibit difficulties in handling social media tasks.

Special prompts, such as Chain-of-Thought, have even revealed previously unknown reasoning capabilities within these models. However, the progress of discovering effective prompts has been slow, driving a desire for general prompt optimization methods. Unfortunately, few existing prompt learning methods satisfy the criteria of being truly \"general\", i.e., automatic, discrete, black-box, gradient-free, and interpretable all at once. In this paper, we introduce metaheuristics, a branch of discrete non-convex optimization methods with over 100 options, as a promising approach to prompt learning. Within our paradigm, we test six typical methods: hill climbing, simulated annealing, genetic algorithms with/without crossover, tabu search, and harmony search, demonstrating their effectiveness in white-box and black-box prompt learning. Furthermore, we show that these methods can be used to discover more human-understandable prompts that were previously unknown in both reasoning and image generation tasks, opening the door to a cornucopia of possibilities in prompt optimization",

Although N-gram-based metrics like BLEU and ROUGE are prevalent, they often do not align well with human evaluations. While model-based alternatives such as BERTScore improve, they typically require extensive labelled data. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents a promising avenue for evaluation. To this end, we introduce SummEQuAL, a novel content-based framework using LLMs for unified, reproducible summarization evaluation. SummEQuAL evaluates summaries by comparing their content with the source document, employing a question-answering approach to gauge both recall and precision. To validate SummEQuAL's effectiveness, we develop a dataset based on MultiWOZ. We conduct experiments on SummEval and our MultiWOZ-based dataset, showing that SummEQuAL largely improves the quality of summarization evaluation. Notably, SummEQuAL demonstrates a 19.7% improvement over QuestEval in terms of sample-level Pearson correlation with human assessments of consistency on the SummEval dataset. Furthermore, it exceeds the performance of the BERTScore baseline by achieving a 17.3% increase in Spearman correlation on our MultiWOZ-based dataset.

    "abstract": "Activation sparsity refers to the existence of considerable weakly-contributed elements among activation outputs. As a prevalent property of the models using the ReLU activation function, it has been proven a promising paradigm to boost model inference efficiency. Nevertheless, most large language models (LLMs) adopt activation functions without intrinsic activation sparsity (e.g., GELU and Swish). Some recent efforts have explored introducing ReLU or its variants as the substitutive activation function to help LLMs achieve activation sparsity and inference acceleration, but few can simultaneously obtain high sparsity and comparable model performance. This paper introduces a lossless sparsification method named \"ProSparse\" to push LLMs for higher activation sparsity without decreasing model performance. Specifically, after substituting the activation function of LLMs with ReLU, ProSparse adopts progressive sparsity regularization with a factor smoothly increasing along sine curves in multiple stages. This can enhance activation sparsity and alleviate performance degradation by avoiding radical shifts in activation distribution. With ProSparse, we obtain high sparsity of 89.32% and 88.80% for LLaMA2-7B and LLaMA2-13B, respectively, achieving comparable performance to their original Swish-activated versions. Our inference acceleration experiments further demonstrate the practical acceleration brought by higher activation sparsity",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "API call generation is the cornerstone of large language models' tool-using ability that provides access to the larger world. However, existing supervised and in-context learning approaches suffer from high training costs, poor data efficiency, and generated API calls that can be unfaithful to the API documentation and the user's request. To address these limitations, we propose an output-side optimization approach called FANTASE. Two of the unique contributions of FANTASE are its State-Tracked Constrained Decoding (SCD) and Reranking components. SCD dynamically incorporates appropriate API constraints in the form of Token Search Trie for efficient and guaranteed generation faithfulness with respect to the API documentation. The Reranking component efficiently brings in the supervised signal by leveraging a lightweight model as the discriminator to rerank the beam-searched candidate generations of the large language model. We demonstrate the superior performance of FANTASE in API call generation accuracy, inference efficiency, and context efficiency with DSTC8 and API Bank datasets",

    "title": "ILogicEval: A Counterintuitive Logical Reasoning Evaluation Dataset",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention worldwide due to their increasing size and improving capabilities. However, as LLMs continue to expand, traditional benchmark datasets are becoming less effective in evaluating their reasoning skills. This is primarily due to the difficulty of the tasks and issues with data contamination. Meanwhile, in the domain of logical reasoning, existing benchmarks often lack the ability to isolate specific reasoning abilities and fail to provide sufficient evidence for answer derivation. To address these issues, a novel dataset ILogicEval is proposed, which consists of sentences composed of unrelated statements, challenging LLMs to answer questions that cannot be solved based on their learned knowledge. ILogicEval is carefully designed to incorporate rich language diversity and assess the logical reasoning ability of LLMs independently of other reasoning skills, such as commonsense reasoning. To ensure a more reliable evaluation, we also introduce a new evaluation metric that mitigates the influence of bias and randomness inherent in LLMs. Through experiments, we demonstrate the extent to which logical reasoning is required to answer the questions in ILogicEval and compare the performance of different popular LLMs in conducting logical reasoning. This dataset and evaluation metric address the limitations of existing benchmarks, providing a comprehensive assessment of the logical reasoning capabilities of LLMs",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Recently, enhancing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) through interaction with external tools has gathered widespread interest, where tool retrieval emerges as a crucial step. Existing tool retrieval approaches only focus on semantic matching. However, effective tool retrieval requires consideration of collaborative invocation among multiple tools rather than solely evaluating the utility of individual tools, which presents a challenge to existing tool retrieval methods. To address this, we propose a novel COllaborative Learning-based Tool Retrieval approach, COLT, which manages not only the semantic matching between user queries and tool descriptions but also takes into account the collaborative information of tools. Extensive experiments on both the open benchmark and the introduced ToolLens dataset show that COLT achieves superior performance. Notably, the performance of BERT-mini (11M) with our COLT framework outperforms BERT-large (340M), which has 30 times more parameters.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Pre-trained language models (LMs) are capable of in-context learning (ICL): they can adapt to a task with only a few examples given in the prompt without any parameter update. However, it is unclear where this capability comes from as there is a stark distribution shift between pre-training text and ICL prompts. In this work, we study what patterns of the pre-training data contribute to ICL. We find that LMs' ICL ability depends on $\\textit{parallel structures}$ in the pre-training data---pairs of phrases following similar templates in the same context window. Specifically, we detect parallel structures by checking whether training on one phrase improves prediction of the other, and conduct ablation experiments to study their effect on ICL. We show that removing parallel structures in the pre-training data reduces LMs' ICL accuracy by 51% (vs 2% from random ablation). This drop persists even when excluding common patterns such as n-gram repetitions and long-range dependency, showing the diversity and generality of parallel structures. A closer look at the detected parallel structures indicates that they cover diverse linguistic tasks and span long distances in the data",

We test both Surprisal metrics and prompt-based methods to see whether i.) they can correctly predict the relation between constituents, and ii.) the semantic representation of the relation is robust to paraphrasing.Using a dataset of lexicalized and annotated noun-noun compounds, we find that LLMs can infer some semantic relations better than others (with a preference for compounds involving concrete concepts).

    "abstract": "Factual faithfulness is a crucial requirement in information-seeking dialogue: the system should respond to the user queries so that the responses are meaningful and aligned with the knowledge provided to the system. However, most modern large language models (LLMs) suffer from hallucinations, that is, they generate responses not supported by or even contradicting the knowledge source. To mitigate the issue and increase faithfulness of information-seeking dialogue systems supported by the LLMs, we introduce BEINFO, a simple yet effective method that applies ‘behavioural tuning' on the LLMs to aid information-seeking dialogue. Relying on three standard information seeking dialogue datasets, we show that models tuned with BEINFO become considerably more faithful to the knowledge source both for datasets and domains seen during BEINFO-tuning, as well as on unseen domains, when applied in a zero-shot manner. In addition, we present a ‘real-life' case study on conversations with real users, showcasing that the models with 3B parameters (e.g., Flan-T5) tuned with BEINFO demonstrate strong performance on data from real ‘production' conversations: when tuned on a limited amount of such realistic in-domain dialogues, they surpass much larger LLMs used ‘off-the-shelf', both on automatic and human evaluation metrics",

    "abstract": "The paper introduces SceMQA, a novel benchmark for scientific multimodal question answering at the college entrance level. It addresses a critical educational phase often overlooked in existing benchmarks, spanning high school to pre-college levels. SceMQA focuses on core science subjects including Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. It features a blend of multiple-choice and free-response formats, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of AI models' abilities. Additionally, our benchmark provides specific knowledge points for each problem and detailed explanations for each answer. SceMQA also uniquely presents problems with identical contexts but varied questions to facilitate a more thorough and accurate assessment of reasoning capabilities. In the experiment, we evaluate both open-source and close-source state-of-the-art Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), across various experimental settings. The results show that further research and development are needed in developing more capable MLLM, as highlighted by only 50% to 60% accuracy achieved by the strongest models",

Traditional distillation methods, which transfer the capabilities of LLMs to smaller models, often fail to determine whether the knowledge has been sufficiently transferred, potentially resulting in high costs or incomplete distillation. In this paper, we propose an Explanation-Guided LLMs Active Distillation (ELAD) framework that employs an active learning strategy to optimize the balance between annotation costs and model performance. To improve efficient sample selection, we introduce an explanation-guided sample selection method that identifies samples challenging its reasoning by exploiting uncertainties in explanation steps. Additionally, we present a customized LLM-annotated explanation revision technique where the teacher model detects and corrects flaws in the student model's reasoning. Our experiments across various reasoning datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances the efficiency of LLM knowledge distillation",

    "abstract": "The abundance of vision-language (VL) understanding benchmark datasets for English, such as MS-COCO and Flickr30K, has largely facilitated the evaluation of new vision-language models (VLMs) across diverse tasks. However, despite the rapid development of Chinese VLMs, most existing Chinese VL datasets are constructed by re-annotating the images from English VL datasets, limiting the source of images to English-speaking cultures only. Some others are limited to a few fundamental tasks, like image-text retrieval. Such cultural bias and limitation of task types make these datasets unsuitable and inadequate for evaluating VLMs in Chinese culture. To remedy this issue, we present a new Chinese Vision-Language Understanding Evaluation (CVLUE) benchmark dataset, where the selection of object categories and images is entirely driven by Chinese native speakers, ensuring that the source images are representative of Chinese culture. The benchmark contains four distinct VL tasks ranging from image-text retrieval to visual question answering, visual grounding and visual dialogue, which evaluates a model's VL capability from multiple aspects.

To mitigate this, various quantization methods have been explored, yet they compromise LLM performance. This paper unveils a previously overlooked type of outlier in LLMs. Such outliers are found to allocate most of the attention scores on initial tokens of input, termed as pivot tokens, which is crucial to the performance of quantized LLMs. Given that, we propose IntactKV to generate the KV cache of pivot tokens losslessly from the full-precision model. The approach is simple and easy to combine with existing quantization solutions. Besides, IntactKV can be calibrated as additional LLM parameters to boost the quantized LLMs further. Mathematical analysis also proves that IntactKV effectively reduces the upper bound of quantization error. Empirical results show that IntactKV brings consistent improvement and achieves lossless weight-only INT4 quantization on various downstream tasks, leading the new state-of-the-art for LLM quantization",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Explainable AI methods facilitate the understanding of model behaviour, yet, small, imperceptible perturbations to inputs can vastly distort explanations. As these explanations are typically evaluated holistically, before model deployment, it is difficult to assess when a particular explanation is trustworthy. Some studies have tried to create confidence estimators for explanations, but none have investigated an existing link between uncertainty and explanation quality. We artificially simulate epistemic uncertainty in text input by introducing noise at inference time. In this large-scale empirical study, we insert different levels of noise perturbations and measure the effect on the output of pre-trained language models and different uncertainty metrics. Realistic perturbations have minimal effect on performance and explanations, yet masking has a drastic effect. We find that high uncertainty doesn't necessarily imply low explanation plausibility; the correlation between the two metrics can be moderately positive when noise is exposed during the training process. This suggests that noise-augmented models may be better at identifying salient tokens when uncertain. Furthermore, when predictive and epistemic uncertainty measures are over-confident, the robustness of a saliency map to perturbation can indicate model stability issues. Integrated Gradients shows the overall greatest robustness to perturbation, while still showing model-specific patterns in performance; however, this phenomenon is limited to smaller Transformer-based language models",

Limited work is devoted to detecting (partially) AI-paraphrased texts. However, AI paraphrasing is commonly employed in various application scenarios for text refinement and diversity. To this end, we propose a novel detection framework, paraphrased text span detection (PTD), aiming to identify paraphrased text spans within a text. Different from text-level detection, PTD takes in the full text and assigns each of the sentences with a score indicating the paraphrasing degree. We construct a dedicated dataset, PASTED, for paraphrased text span detection. Both in-distribution and out-of-distribution results demonstrate the effectiveness of PTD models in identifying AI-paraphrased text spans.

    "abstract": "We evaluate LLMs' language understanding capacities on simple inference tasks that most humans find trivial. Specifically, we target (i) grammatically-specified entailments, (ii) premises with evidential adverbs of uncertainty, and (iii) monotonicity entailments. We design evaluation sets for these tasks and conduct experiments in both zero-shot and chain-of-thought setups, and with multiple prompts and LLMs. The models exhibit moderate to low performance on these evaluation sets. Subsequent experiments show that embedding the premise in syntactic constructions that should preserve the entailment relations (presupposition triggers) or change them (non-factives), further confuses the models, causing them to either under-predict or over-predict certain entailment labels regardless of the true relation, and often disregarding the nature of the embedding context. Overall these results suggest that, despite LLMs' celebrated language understanding capacity, even the strongest models have blindspots with respect to certain types of entailments, and certain information-packaging structures act as ``blinds'' overshadowing the semantics of the embedded premise",

From our experiments, we show that GeNeRTe can effectively synthesize EEG features for unseen test sentences with just 236 sentence-EEG training pairs. Furthermore, using synthetic EEG features significantly improves text classification performance and reduces computation time.

    "abstract": "Quantitative information plays a crucial role in understanding and interpreting content of documents. Many user queries contain quantities and cannot be resolved without understanding their semantics, e.g., ``car that costs less than $\\$10$k''. Yet, modern search engines apply the same ranking mechanisms for both words and quantities, overlooking magnitude and unit information. In this paper, we introduce two quantity-aware ranking techniques designed to rank both the quantity and textual content either jointly or independently. These techniques incorporate quantity information in available retrieval systems and can address queries with numerical conditions equal, greater than, and less than. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed models, we introduce two novel quantity-aware benchmark datasets in the domains of finance and medicine and compare our method against various lexical and neural models.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Watermarking approaches are proposed to identify if the text being circulated is human or large language model (LLM) generated. The state-of-the-art strategy of Kirchenbauer et al. (2023a) biases the LLM to generate specific \"green\" tokens. However, determining the robustness of this watermarking method is an open problem. Existing attack methods do not incorporate color information (if a token is green/not) and may fail to evade longer text watermark detection. We propose Self Color Testing-based Substitution (SCTS), the first \"color-aware\" attack. SCTS gets color information by strategically prompting the watermarked LLM and comparing output frequencies, using which it can determine token colors. It then substitutes green tokens with red ones. In our experiments, SCTS successfully evades watermark detection using fewer edits than related work. Additionally, we show both theoretically and empirically that SCTS can remove the watermark for arbitrarily long watermarked text",

    "abstract": "Benchmarks have emerged as the central approach for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs). The research community often relies on a model's average performance across the test prompts of a benchmark to evaluate the model's performance. This is consistent with the assumption that the test prompts within a benchmark represent a random sample from some real-world distribution of interest. We note that this is generally not the case; instead, we hold that the distribution of interest varies according to the specific use case. Hence, we analyze the robustness of LLM benchmarks to their underlying distributional assumptions. We find that (1) the correlation in model performance across test prompts is non-random, (2) accounting for correlations across test prompts can change model rankings on major benchmarks, (3) explanatory factors for these correlations include semantic similarity and common LLM failure points",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Large Language Model (LLM) agents significantly extend the capabilities of standalone LLMs, empowering them to interact with external tools (e.g., APIs, functions) and complete various tasks in a self-directed fashion. The challenge of tool use demands that LLMs not only understand user queries and generate answers accurately but also excel in task planning, tool invocation, and result summarization. While traditional works focus on training a single LLM with all these capabilities, performance limitations become apparent, particularly with smaller models. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel approach that decomposes the aforementioned capabilities into a planner, caller, and summarizer. Each component is implemented by a single LLM that focuses on a specific capability and collaborates with others to accomplish the task. This modular framework facilitates individual updates and the potential use of smaller LLMs for building each capability.To effectively train this framework, we introduce a two-stage training paradigm. First, we fine-tune a backbone LLM on the entire dataset without discriminating sub-tasks, providing the model with a comprehensive understanding of the task. Second, the fine-tuned LLM is used to instantiate the planner, caller, and summarizer respectively, which are continually fine-tuned on respective sub-tasks. Evaluation across various tool-use benchmarks illustrates that our proposed multi-LLM framework surpasses the traditional single-LLM approach, highlighting its efficacy and advantages in tool learning",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "A wide body of evidence shows that human language processing difficulty is predicted by the information-theoretic measure surprisal, a word's negative log probability in context. However, it is still unclear how to best estimate these probabilities needed for predicting human processing difficulty -- while a long-standing belief held that models with lower perplexity would provide more accurate estimates of word predictability, and therefore lead to better reading time predictions, recent work has shown that for very large models, psycholinguistic predictive power decreases. One reason could be that language models might be more confident of their predictions than humans, because they have had exposure to several magnitudes more data. In this paper, we test what effect temperature-scaling of large language model (LLM) predictions has on surprisal estimates and their predictive power of reading times of English texts. Firstly, we show that calibration of large language models typically improves with model size, i.e.~poorer calibration cannot account for poorer fit to reading times. Secondly, we find that temperature-scaling probabilities lead to a systematically better fit to reading times (up to 89\\% improvement in delta log likelihood), across several reading time corpora. Finally, we show that this improvement in fit is chiefly driven by words that are composed of multiple subword tokens",

This setting is a pivotal issue that has received broad attention in the community. Our intuition is that humans are naturally good correctors with exposure to monolingual sentences, which contrasts with current unsupervised methods that strongly rely on the usage of confusion sets to produce parallel sentences. In this paper, we demonstrate that learning a spelling correction model is identical to learning a language model from monolingual data alone, with decoding it in a greater search space.We propose \\emph{Denoising Decoding Correction (D\\textsuperscript{2}C)}, which selectively imposes noise upon the source sentence to solve out the underlying correct characters. Our method largely inspires the ability of language models to perform correction, including both BERT-based models and large language models (LLMs). We show that the self-supervised learning manner generally outstrips using confusion sets in specific domains because it bypasses the need to introduce error characters to the training data which can impair the patterns in the target domains.

    "abstract": "The impressive performance of large language models (LLMs) has attracted considerable attention from the academic and industrial communities. Besides how to construct and train LLMs, how to effectively evaluate and compare the capacity of LLMs has also been well recognized as an important yet difficult problem. Existing paradigms rely on either human annotators or model-based evaluators to evaluate the performance of LLMs on different tasks. However, these paradigms often suffer from high cost, low generalizability, and inherited biases in practice, which make them incapable of supporting the sustainable development of LLMs in long term. In order to address these issues, inspired by the peer review systems widely used in academic publication process, we propose a novel framework that can automatically evaluate LLMs through a peer-review process. Specifically, for the evaluation of a specific task, we first construct a small qualification exam to select \"reviewers\" from a couple of powerful LLMs. Then, to actually evaluate the \"submissions\" written by different candidate LLMs, i.e., the evaluatees, we use the reviewer LLMs to rate or compare the submissions. The final ranking of evaluatee LLMs is generated based on the results provided by all reviewers. We conducted extensive experiments on both text summarization and non-factoid question answering tasks with eleven LLMs including GPT-4. The results demonstrate the existence of biasness when evaluating using a single LLM. Also, our PRE model outperforms all the baselines, illustrating the effectiveness of the peer review mechanism",

Inspired by recent impressive achievements of Large Language Models (LLMs) in different fields, this paper delves into the question: can LLMs efficiently improve an ML's performance at a minimal cost? We show that, through our proposed training-free framework LlmCorr, an LLM can work as a post-hoc corrector to propose corrections for the predictions of an arbitrary ML model. In particular, we form a contextual knowledge database by incorporating the dataset's label information and the ML model's predictions on the validation dataset. Leveraging the in-context learning capability of LLMs, we ask the LLM to summarise the instances in which the ML model makes mistakes and the correlation between primary predictions and true labels. Following this, the LLM can transfer its acquired knowledge to suggest corrections for the ML model's predictions. Our experimental results on the challenging molecular predictions show that LlmCorr improves the performance of a number of models by up to 39%",

To address this limitation, we introduce enhancing numerical reasoning with reliable processes (Encore), which derives the reliable reasoning process by decomposing the answer formula, ensuring which fully supports the answer. Nevertheless, models could lack enough data to learn the reasoning process generation adequately, since our method generates only one single reasoning process for one formula.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "A Large Language Model (LLM) tends to generate inconsistent and sometimes contradictory outputs when presented with a prompt that has equivalent semantics but is expressed differently from the original prompt. To achieve semantic consistency of an LLM, one of the key approaches is to finetune the model with prompt-output pairs with semantically equivalent meanings. Despite its effectiveness, a data-driven finetuning method incurs substantial computation costs in data preparation and model optimization. In this regime, an LLM is treated as a ``black box'', restricting our ability to gain deeper insights into its internal mechanism. In this paper, we are motivated to enhance the semantic consistency of LLMs through a more interpretable method (i.e., model editing) to this end. We first identify the model components (i.e., attention heads) that have a key impact on the semantic consistency of an LLM. We subsequently inject biases into the output of these model components along the semantic-consistency activation direction. It is noteworthy that these modifications are cost-effective, without reliance on mass manipulations of the original model parameters. Through comprehensive experiments on the constructed NLU and open-source NLG datasets, our method demonstrates significant improvements in the semantic consistency and task performance of LLMs. Additionally, our method exhibits promising generalization capabilities by performing well on tasks beyond the primary tasks",

    "abstract": "The deployment of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has brought forth a unique vulnerability: susceptibility to malicious attacks through visual inputs. This paper systematically investigates the novel challenge of defending MLLMs against such attacks. We discovered that images act as a \"foreign language\" that is not considered during alignment, which can make MLLMs prone to producing harmful responses. Unfortunately, unlike the discrete tokens considered in text-based LLMs, the continuous nature of image signals presents significant alignment challenges, which poses difficulty to thoroughly cover the possible scenarios. This vulnerability is exacerbated by the fact that open-source MLLMs are predominantly fine-tuned on limited image-text pairs that is much less than the extensive text-based pretraining corpus, which makes the MLLMs more prone to catastrophic forgetting of their original abilities during explicit alignment tuning. To tackle these challenges, we introduce MLLM-Protector, a plug-and-play strategy combining a lightweight harm detector and a response detoxifier. The harm detector's role is to identify potentially harmful outputs from the MLLM, while the detoxifier corrects these outputs to ensure the response stipulates to the safety standards. This approach effectively mitigates the risks posed by malicious visual inputs without compromising the model's overall performance. Our results demonstrate that MLLM-Protector offers a robust solution to a previously unaddressed aspect of MLLM security",

To address this problem, we introduce Self-Distillation Fine-Tuning (SDFT), a novel approach that bridges the distribution gap by guiding fine-tuning with a distilled dataset generated by the model itself to match its original distribution. Experimental results on the Llama-2-chat model across various benchmarks demonstrate that SDFT effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting while achieving comparable or superior performance on downstream tasks compared to the vanilla fine-tuning. Moreover, SDFT demonstrates the potential to maintain the helpfulness and safety alignment of LLMs",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress in natural language processing tasks and have shown considerable potential in the legal domain. However, the legal applications often have high requirements on accuracy, reliability and fairness. Applying existing LLMs to legal systems without careful evaluation of their potentials and limitations could lead to significant risks in legal practice.Therefore, to facilitate the healthy development and application of LLMs in the legal domain, we propose a comprehensive benchmark CoLLaM for evaluating LLMs in legal domain.Specifically, CoLLaM is developed based on the language abilities of LLMs and the practical requirements of the legal domain. It introduces a new legal cognitive ability taxonomy (LCAT) featuring six distinctive levels: Memorization, Understanding, Logic Inference, Discrimination, Generation, and Ethic. Leveraging this taxonomy, we collected 13,650 questions across 23 tasks and evaluated them against 38 open-source and commercial LLMs. Our experimental results led to interesting findings and indicate that applying LLMs in the legal domain still has a long way to go.

    "abstract": "Retrieval augmentation is a promising approach to handle long-context language modeling. However, the existing retrieval methods usually work with the chunked context, which is prone to inferior quality of semantic representation and incomplete retrieval of useful information. In this work, we propose a new method for the retrieval augmentation of long-context language modeling, called \\textbf{Landmark Embedding}. Our method is characterized by threefold technical contributions. Firstly, we introduce a \\textit{chunking-free architecture}, which keeps the long context coherent such that high-quality embeddings can be generated for the fine-grained units within the context. Secondly, we present a \\textit{position-aware objective function}, which prioritizes the ultimate boundary for a consecutive span of information. By learning to discriminate such a special position, the useful information can be comprehensively retrieved for the query. Thirdly, we design a novel \\textit{multi-stage learning algorithm}, which makes the best use of readily available data and synthetic data for cost-effective training of the landmark embedding. In our experimental study, landmark embedding is able to substantially improve the performance for both LLaMA-2 and ChatGPT in a variety of long-context tasks; meanwhile, it also outperforms the existing retrieval methods with a notable advantage.

Specifically, we focus on the OPT family of models ranging from 125m to 66b parameters and rely only on whether an FFN neuron is activated or not. First, we find that the early part of the network is sparse and represents many discrete features. Here, many neurons (more than in some layers of the 66b model) are \"dead\", i.e. they never activate on a large collection of diverse data. At the same time, many of the alive neurons are reserved for discrete features and act as token and n-gram detectors. Interestingly, their corresponding FFN updates not only promote next token candidates as could be expected, but also explicitly focus on removing the information about triggering them tokens, i.e., current input. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of mechanisms specialized at removing (rather than adding) information from the residual stream. With scale, models become more sparse in a sense that they have more dead neurons and token detectors. Finally, some neurons are positional: them being activated or not depends largely (or solely) on position and less so (or not at all) on textual data. We find that smaller models have sets of neurons acting as position range indicators while larger models operate in a less explicit manner",

To address it, we propose a new RL method named RLMEC that incorporates a generative model as the reward model, which is trained by the erroneous solution rewriting task under the minimum editing constraint, which can produce token-level supervision for RL training. Based 0on the generative reward model, we design the token-level RL objective for training and an imitation-based regularization for stabilizing RL process.

To bridge these gaps, we introduce a novel, modularized and open-source pipeline for concept map extraction, using semantic and sub-symbolic techniques.

In response, backdoor sample purification has emerged as a promising defense mechanism, aiming to eliminate backdoor triggers while preserving the integrity of the clean content in the samples. However, existing approaches have been predominantly focused on the word space, which are ineffective against feature-space triggers and significantly impair performance on clean data. To address this, we introduce a universal backdoor defense that purifies backdoor samples in the activation space by drawing abnormal activations towards optimized minimum clean activation distribution intervals. The advantages of our approach are twofold: (1) By operating in the activation space, our method captures from surface-level information like words to higher-level semantic concepts such as syntax, thus counteracting diverse triggers; (2) the fine-grained continuous nature of the activation space allows for more precise preservation of clean content while removing triggers. Furthermore, we propose a detection module based on statistical information of abnormal activations, to achieve a better trade-off between clean accuracy and defending performance. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets and against diverse attacks (including syntax and style attacks) demonstrate that our defense achieves state-of-the-art performance",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to have limited extrapolation ability beyond their pre-trained context window, constraining their application in downstream tasks with lengthy inputs. Recent studies have sought to extend LLMs' context window by modifying rotary position embedding (RoPE), a popular position encoding method adopted by well-known LLMs such as LLaMA, PaLM, and GPT-NeoX. However, prior works like Position Interpolation (PI) and YaRN are resource-intensive and lack comprehensive experiments to assess their applicability. In this work, we identify the inherent need for LLMs' attention entropy (i.e. the information entropy of attention scores) to maintain stability and introduce a novel extension to RoPE which combines adjusting RoPE's base frequency and scaling the attention logits to help LLMs efficiently adapt to a larger context window. We validate the superiority of our method in both fine-tuning performance and robustness across different context window sizes on various context-demanding tasks. Notably, our method extends the context window of LLaMA-2-7B-Chat to 16,384 with only 100 samples and 6 training steps, showcasing extraordinary efficiency. Finally, we also explore how data compositions and training curricula affect context window extension for specific downstream tasks, suggesting fine-tuning LLMs with lengthy conversations as a good starting point.

Therefore, We propose Mirror, a Multiple-perspective self-reflection method for knowledge-rich reasoning, to avoid getting stuck at a particular reflection iteration. Mirror enables LLMs to reflect from multiple-perspective clues, achieved through a heuristic interaction between a Navigator and a Reasoner. It guides agents toward diverse yet plausibly reliable reasoning trajectory without access to ground truth by encouraging (1) diversity of directions generated by Navigator and (2) agreement among strategically induced perturbations in responses generated by the Reasoner.

However, the one-off input of overly long texts is limited, as studies have shown that when input lengths exceed the LLMs' pre-trained text length, there is a dramatic decline in text generation capabilities. Moreover, simply extending the length of pre-training texts is impractical due to the difficulty in obtaining long text data and the substantial memory consumption costs this would entail for LLMs. Recent efforts have employed streaming inputs to alleviate the pressure of excessively long text inputs, but this approach can significantly impair the model's long-term memory capabilities.Motivated by this challenge, we introduce Streaming Infinite Retentive LLM (SirLLM), which allows LLMs to maintain longer memory during infinite-length dialogues without the need for fine-tuning. SirLLM utilizes the Token Entropy metric and a memory decay mechanism to filter key phrases, endowing LLMs with both long-lasting and flexible memory. We designed three distinct tasks and constructed three datasets to measure the effectiveness of SirLLM from various angles: (1) DailyDialog; (2) Grocery Shopping; (3) Rock-Paper-Scissors.

Thus, given these complementary advantages of LLMs and SLMs, it is necessary to develop an architecture that integrates the scalability of LLMs with the training efficiency of SLMs, namely Syntactic Large Language Models (SLLM). In this paper, we propose a novel method dubbed tree-planting: implicitly \"plant\" trees into attention weights of Transformer LMs to reflect syntactic structures of natural language. Specifically, Transformer LMs trained with tree-planting will be called Tree-Planted Transformers (TPT), which learn syntax on small treebanks via tree-planting and then scale on large text corpora via continual learning with syntactic scaffolding. Targeted syntactic evaluations on the SyntaxGym benchmark demonstrated that TPTs, despite the lack of explicit syntactic supervision, significantly outperformed various SLMs with explicit syntactic supervision that generate hundreds of syntactic structures in parallel, suggesting that tree-planting and TPTs are the promising foundation for SLLMs",

Existing approaches to tool learning have either primarily relied on extremely large language models, such as GPT-4, to attain generalized tool-use abilities in a zero-shot manner, or utilized supervised learning to train limited scopes of tools on compact models. However, it remains uncertain whether smaller language models can achieve generalized tool-use abilities without tool-specific training. To address this question, this paper introduces ToolAlpaca, a novel framework designed to automatically generate a diverse tool-use corpus and learn generalized tool-use abilities on compact language models with minimal human intervention. Specifically, ToolAlpaca first automatically creates a highly diversified tool-use corpus by building a multi-agent simulation environment. The corpus contains 3.9k tool-use instances from more than 400 real-world tool APIs spanning 50 distinct categories. Subsequently, the constructed corpus is employed to fine-tune compact language models, resulting in two models, namely ToolAlpaca-7B and ToolAlpaca-13B, respectively. Finally, we evaluate the ability of these models to utilize previously unseen tools without specific training.

High-resource languages have the advantage of extensive data and advanced models, whereas low-resource languages often lack the data necessary for effective training. Our research aims to bridge this gap by utilizing the task-specific knowledge from multilingual models trained on high-resource languages and efficiently transferring it to lower-resource languages. Our focus is on task-specific fine-tuning, the stage where acquiring labeled data is costly and where methods that optimize data use are most valuable. The primary advantage of our approach is its data efficiency, enabling rapid adaptation to new languages in a task-specific few-shot setting and reducing the need for large labeled datasets. Our Contrastive Language Alignment with Prompting (CoLAP) method integrates contrastive learning with cross-lingual representations, facilitating knowledge transfer from high-resource to lower-resource languages.

    "abstract": "Humans are thought to predict the next words during sentence comprehension, but under unique circumstances, they demonstrate an ability for longer coherent word sequence prediction. This study investigates whether language models can model such hyperprediction observed in humans during sentence processing, specifically in the context of buzzer quizzes. We conducted eye-tracking experiments where participants read the first half of buzzer quiz questions and predicted the second half, while we modeled their reading time using language models. The results showed that the pre-trained language model can partially capture human hyperprediction. When the language model was fine-tuned with quiz questions, the perplexity value decreased. Lower perplexity corresponded to higher psychometric predictive power; however, excessive data for fine-tuning led to a decrease in perplexity and the fine-tuned model exhibited a low psychometric predictive power",

However, existing approaches face two primary challenges: knowledge mismatch between public available knowledge graphs and the specific domain of the task at hand, and poor information compliance of LLM with knowledge graphs. In this paper, we leverage a small set of labeled samples and a large-scale corpus to efficiently construct domain-specific knowledge graphs by LLM, addressing the issue of knowledge mismatch. Additionally, we propose a three-stage KG-LLM alignment strategy to enhance the LLM's capability to utilize information from knowledge graphs.

    "abstract": "Spurred by advancements in scale, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong few-shot learning ability via in-context learning (ICL). However, the performance of ICL has been shown to be highly sensitive to the selection of few-shot demonstrations. Selecting the most suitable examples as context remains an ongoing challenge and an open problem. Existing literature has highlighted the importance of selecting examples that are diverse or semantically similar to the test sample while ignoring the fact that the optimal selection dimension, i.e., diversity or similarity, is task-specific. Leveraging the merits of both dimensions, we propose Iterative Demonstration Selection (IDS). Using zero-shot chain-of-thought reasoning (Zero-shot-CoT), IDS iteratively selects examples that are diverse but still strongly correlated with the test sample as ICL demonstrations. Specifically, IDS applies Zero-shot-CoT to the test sample before demonstration selection. The output reasoning path is then used to choose demonstrations that are prepended to the test sample for inference. The generated answer is followed by its corresponding reasoning path for extracting a new set of demonstrations in the next iteration. After several iterations, IDS adopts majority voting to obtain the final result. Through extensive experiments on tasks including reasoning, question answering, topic classification, and sentiment analysis, we demonstrate that IDS can consistently outperform existing ICL demonstration selection methods",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Relational Triple Extraction (RTE), one of the crucial components of information extraction, has experienced rapid development in recent years. However, due to the triple duplication problem in existing datasets, previous methods often yield highly competitive results by simply memorizing the duplicated triples rather than discovering the new triples from raw text. Specifically, In the two most widely-used datasets (NYT and WebNLG), more than 80% of the triples from the test set are direct duplicates of triples already present in their training set. In response to this, we propose a new dataset, named ENT, to evaluate the model's ability to Extract New Triples, which aligns more coherently with the objectives of the RTE task. Specifically, based on the Wikidata knowledge graph slices and Large Language Model Prompting, we design an RTE dataset construction pipeline. It consists of four steps, including: 1) Preprocess, 2) Paragraph Generation, 3) Rule-based Check and 4) Semantic Check. ENT comprises 300k+ unique triples with all the test set samples containing at least one new triple. We conduct a re-evaluation of nine existing state-of-the-art methods and observe a generalized 10%+ and 7.5%+ decrease in extraction accuracy on ENT compared to NYT and WebNLG respectively. This demonstrates that ENT is a more challenging and meaningful benchmark, and we hope it will lead to new directions in the study of the RTE task",

Specifically, we append discrete personalized suffixes, automatically generated through an aggregated gradient-based search method, to the user query or dialog histories and induce LLMs to respond with target personalities. In addition, due to the high redundancy of the search space, we adopt a reward-based strategy to prune the vocabulary and focus exclusively on influential tokens. Experiment results on four models ranging from $1.1$B to $13$B show that our method achieves $79.9$\\% accuracy in customizing LLMs' personalities, significantly outperforming other prompting methods ($65.5\\%$) and model editing methods.

While previous work has focused on predicting a veracity label, here we reformulate the task to generate model-centric free-text explanations of a rumour's veracity. The approach is model agnostic in that it generalises to any model. Here we propose a novel GNN-based rumour verification model. We follow a zero-shot approach by first applying post-hoc explainability methods to score the most important posts within a thread and then we use these posts to generate informative explanations using opinion-guided summarisation. To evaluate the informativeness of the explanatory summaries, we exploit the few-shot learning capabilities of a large language model (LLM). Our experiments show that LLMs can have similar agreement to humans in evaluating summaries.

Although some recent works have made strides in this, they have primarily focused on single-modality inputs. Therefore, we propose GroundingGPT, an end-to-end language enhanced multi-modal grounding model. It is designed to perform fine-grained grounding tasks for three modalities: image, video and audio. To enhance the model's performance, we adopt a coarse-to-fine training strategy, utilizing a three-stage training approach to progressively enhance the model's semantic awareness and fine-grained understanding capabilities. Additionally, we employ a diversified stage-specific dataset construction pipeline, developing a multi-modal, multi-granularity dataset tailored for training the model in different stages. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple multi-modal benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves an impressive fine-grained understanding of multi-modal inputs on grounding tasks while maintaining or improving its global comprehension capabilities.

We propose a sliding window method to address the issues of aligning variable-length text with video sequences.To our knowledge, USLNet is the first unsupervised sign language translation and generation model capable of generating both natural language text and sign language video in a unified manner.

To study this empirically, we prompt multiple LLMs to make presupposition judgments for texts of varying domains from three different human-labeled datasets. We calculate the agreement between LLMs and human raters, and find that variations in text domain, verb factivity, context window size, and the type of presupposition trigger result in changes to human-model agreement scores. We also observe discrepancies in agreement scores that indicate potential biases from LLMs. The gender of the subject appears to impact agreement, as female pronouns are associated with lower agreement than male pronouns.

    "abstract": "The burgeoning size of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to enhanced capabilities in generating responses, albeit at the expense of increased inference times and elevated resource demands. Existing methods of acceleration, predominantly hinged on knowledge distillation, generally necessitate fine-tuning of considerably large models, such as Llama-7B, posing a challenge for average users. Furthermore, present techniques for expediting inference and reducing costs operate independently. To address these issues, we introduce a novel and intuitive Guidance-based Knowledge Transfer (GKT) framework. This approach leverages a larger LLM as a ``teacher'' to create guidance prompts, paired with a smaller ``student'' model to finalize responses. Remarkably, GKT requires no fine-tuning and doesn't necessitate the teacher and student models to have the same vocabulary, allowing for extensive batch generation to accelerate the process while ensuring user customization. GKT can be seamlessly integrated into cloud-edge collaboration architectures, and is versatile enough for plug-and-play application across various models. It excels in both efficiency and affordability, epitomizing a ``cheap and cheerful'' solution. GKT achieves a maximum accuracy improvement of 14.18%, along with a 10.72 times speed-up on GSM8K and an accuracy improvement of 14.00 % along with a 7.73 times speed-up in CSQA. When utilizing ChatGPT as teacher model and Llama2-70B as the student model, we can achieve 95.00% of ChatGPT's performance at 52% of the cost.

    "title": "Improving Machine Translation with Large Language Models: A Preliminary Study with Cooperative Decoding",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Contemporary translation engines based on the encoder-decoder framework have made significant strides in development. However, the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has disrupted their position by presenting the potential for achieving superior translation quality. To uncover the circumstances in which LLMs excel and explore how their strengths can be harnessed to enhance translation quality, we first conduct a comprehensive analysis to assess the strengths and limitations of various commercial NMT systems and MT-oriented LLMs. Our findings indicate that neither NMT nor MT-oriented LLMs alone can effectively address all the translation issues, but MT-oriented LLMs show promise as a complementary solution to NMT systems. Building upon these insights, we propose Cooperative Decoding (CoDec), which treats NMT systems as a pretranslation model and MT-oriented LLMs as a supplemental solution to handle complex scenarios beyond the capability of NMT alone. Experimental results on the WMT22 test sets and a newly collected test set WebCrawl demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of CoDec, highlighting its potential as a robust solution for combining NMT systems with MT-oriented LLMs in the field of machine translation",

    "title": "DeMPT: Decoding-enhanced Multi-phase Prompt Tuning for Making LLMs Be Better Context-aware Translators",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Generally, the decoder-only large language models (LLMs) are adapted to context-aware neural machine translation (NMT) in a concatenating way, where LLMs take the concatenation of the source sentence (i.e., intra-sentence context) and the inter-sentence context as the input, and then to generate the target tokens sequentially. This adaptation strategy, i.e., concatenation mode, considers intra-sentence and inter-sentence contexts with the same priority, despite an apparent difference between the two kinds of contexts. In this paper, we propose an alternative adaptation approach, named Decoding-enhanced Multi-phase Prompt Tuning (DeMPT), to make LLMs discriminately model and utilize the inter- and intra-sentence context and more effectively adapt LLMs to context-aware NMT. First, DeMPT divides the context-aware NMT process into three separate phases. During each phase, different continuous prompts are introduced to make LLMs discriminately model various information. Second, DeMPT employs a heuristic way to further discriminately enhance the utilization of the source-side inter- and intra-sentence information at the final decoding phase. Experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms the concatenation method, and further improves the performance of LLMs in discourse modeling",

    "title": "Retrieval-Augmented Multilingual Knowledge Editing",

    "abstract": "Knowledge represented in Large Language Models (LLMs) is quite often incorrect and can also become obsolete over time. Updating knowledge via fine-tuning is computationally resource-hungry and not reliable, and so knowledge editing (KE) has developed as an effective and economical alternative to inject new knowledge or to fix factual errors in LLMs. Although there has been considerable interest in this area, current KE research exclusively focuses on monolingual settings, typically in English. However, what happens if the new knowledge is supplied in one language, but we would like to query an LLM in a different language? To address the problem of multilingual knowledge editing, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Multilingual Knowledge Editor (ReMaKE) to update knowledge in LLMs. ReMaKE can be used to perform model-agnostic knowledge editing in a multilingual setting. ReMaKE concatenates the new knowledge retrieved from a multilingual knowledge base with users' prompts before querying an LLM. Our experimental results show that ReMaKE outperforms baseline knowledge editing methods by a significant margin and is scalable to real-word application scenarios.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Abstract meaning representation (AMR) is a special semantic representation language that captures sentences' meaning with syntax-irrelevant graphs. AMR-to-text generation aims to generate text according to a given AMR graph and is helpful in various downstream NLP tasks. Existing AMR-to-text generation methods roughly fall into two categories, each with pros and cons. The sequence-to-sequence models, especially pretrained language models (PLMs), have good text generation ability but cannot cope well with the structural information of AMR graphs. The graph-to-sequence models utilize graph neural networks (GNNs), showcasing complementary strengths and limitations. Combining both methods could harness their strengths; yet, merging a GNN with a PLM is non-trivial. In this paper, we propose DualGen, a dual encoder-decoder model that integrates a specially designed GNN into a sequence-to-sequence PLM. We conduct extensive experiments, human evaluation, and a case study, finding that DualGen achieves the desired effect and yields state-of-the-art performance in the AMR-to-text generation task. We also show it outperforms the most potent general-purpose PLMs, LLaMA and GPT-4",

Different from them, we propose a prompt-based method to achieve length controlled generation under different control types with high accuracy. In particular, we adopt reinforcement learning (RL) and sample filtering with the reward signal given by rule-based reward models, which enhances the length control ability of models by rewarding outputs that follow certain control instructions. In addition, we introduce a standard prompt extractor to parse arbitrary users' input into standard control instructions. Experiments show that our method significantly improves the accuracy of prompt-based length control on popular summarization datasets like CNNDM and NYT under multiple control types.

    "abstract": "The development of state-of-the-art generative large language models (LLMs) disproportionately relies on English-centric tokenizers, vocabulary and pre-training data. Despite the fact that some LLMs have multilingual capabilities, recent studies have shown that their inference efficiency deteriorates when generating text in languages other than English. This results in increased inference time and costs. Cross-lingual vocabulary adaptation methods have been proposed for adapting models to a target language aiming to improve downstream performance. However, the effectiveness of these methods on increasing inference efficiency of generative LLMs has yet to be explored. In this paper, we perform an empirical study of various cross-lingual vocabulary adaptation methods on five generative LLMs (including monolingual and multilingual models) across four typologically-diverse languages and four natural language understanding tasks. We find that cross-lingual vocabulary adaptation substantially contributes to LLM inference speedups of up to 271.5%. We also show that adapting LLMs that have been pre-trained on more balanced multilingual data results in downstream performance comparable to the original models",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Using large language models (LLMs) to solve problems in professional fields (e.g., medicine) is emerging as a research hotspot, requiring LLMs to master sufficient domain-specific factual knowledge. Recently, several LLMs achieved notable performance on multiple professional-field evaluation benchmarks. However, current benchmarks generally leverage common and fixed question formulations, allowing LLMs to provide correct answers based on surface-level patterns in questions without mastering the underlying knowledge. In this paper, we focus on this problem. We propose a general \\textbf{t}ruth-\\textbf{p}reserving \\textbf{eval}uation framework (\\textbf{TPEval}) to precisely probe LLMs' mastery of factual knowledge in professional fields through distinct representations of the same knowledge. Specifically, for each piece of knowledge, we convert its original expression into multiple truth-preserving statements with logical transformations, presenting the knowledge in diverse ways. By leveraging these statements, the proposed framework can more precisely estimate LLMs' mastery of the specified knowledge. Given the wealth of factual knowledge in medicine, we validate the effectiveness of our framework in the medical domain. We curate 6,000+ clinical facts and generate eight statements for each fact using the proposed method, evaluating the mastery of LLMs. Experimental results indicate a notable decline in LLMs' performance as the number of statements per fact increases, suggesting insufficient knowledge mastery of LLMs. Our method can serve as an effective solution for probing LLMs' knowledge mastery in professional fields",

Despite their ability to recognize and avoid harmful queries, LLMs are vulnerable to \"jailbreaking\" attacks, where carefully crafted prompts elicit them to produce toxic content. One category of jailbreak attacks is reformulating the task as adversarial attacks by eliciting the LLM to generate an affirmative response. However, the typical attack in this category GCG has very limited attack success rate. In this study, to better study the jailbreak attack, we introduce the \\textit{DSN} (Don't Say No) attack, which prompts LLMs to not only generate affirmative responses but also novelly enhance the objective to suppress refusals. In addition, another challenge lies in jailbreak attacks is the evaluation, as it is difficult to directly and accurately assess the harmfulness of the attack. The existing evaluation such as refusal keyword matching has its own limitation as it reveals numerous false positive and false negative instances. To overcome this challenge, we propose an ensemble evaluation pipeline incorporating Natural Language Inference (NLI) contradiction assessment, external LLM evaluation, as well as refusal matching. Extensive experiments demonstrate the potency of the \\textit{DSN} and the effectiveness of ensemble evaluation compared to baseline methods",

    "title": "Does Mapo Tofu Contain Coffee? Probing LLMs for Food-related Cultural Knowledge",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Recent studies have highlighted the presence of cultural biases in Large Language Models (LLMs), yet often lack a robust methodology to dissect these phenomena comprehensively. Our work aims to bridge this gap by delving into the \\textsc{Food} domain—a universally relevant yet culturally diverse aspect of human life. We introduce \\textsc{FmLAMA}, a multilingual dataset centered on food-related cultural facts and variations in food practices. We analyze LLMs across various architectures and configurations, evaluating their performance in both monolingual and multilingual settings. By leveraging templates in six different languages, we investigate how LLMs interact with language-specific and cultural knowledge. Our findings reveal that (1) LLMs demonstrate a pronounced bias towards food knowledge prevalent in the United States; (2) Incorporating relevant cultural context significantly improves LLMs' ability to access cultural knowledge; (3) The efficacy of LLMs in capturing cultural nuances is highly dependent on the interplay between the probing language, the specific model architecture, and the cultural context in question. This research underscores the complexity of integrating cultural understanding into LLMs and emphasizes the importance of culturally diverse datasets to mitigate biases and enhance model performance across different cultural domains",

    "title": "Speaking in Wavelet Domain: A Simple and Efficient Approach to Speed up Speech Diffusion Model",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Recently, Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have attained leading performances across a diverse range of generative tasks. However, in the field of speech synthesis, although DDPMs exhibit impressive performance, their prolonged training duration and substantial inference costs hinder practical deployment. Existing approaches primarily focus on enhancing inference speed, while approaches to accelerate training—a key factor in the costs associated with adding or customizing voices—often necessitate complex modifications to the model, compromising their universal applicability. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose an inquiry: is it possible to enhance the training/inference speed and performance of DDPMs by modifying the speech signal itself? In this paper, we double the training and inference speed of Speech DDPMs by simply redirecting the generative target to the wavelet domain. This method not only achieves comparable or superior performance to the original model in speech synthesis tasks but also demonstrates its versatility. By investigating and utilizing different wavelet bases, our approach proves effective not just in speech synthesis, but also in speech enhancement",

    "title": "Counter-intuitive: Large Language Models Can Better Understand Knowledge Graphs Than We Thought",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Although the method of enhancing large language models' (LLMs') reasoning ability and reducing their hallucinations through the use of knowledge graphs (KGs) has received widespread attention, the exploration of how to enable LLMs to integrate the structured knowledge in KGs on-the-fly remains inadequate. Researchers often co-train KG embeddings and LLM parameters to equip LLMs with the ability of comprehending KG knowledge. However, this resource-hungry training paradigm significantly increases the model learning cost and is also unsuitable for non-open-source, black-box LLMs. In this paper, we employ complex question answering (CQA) as a task to assess the LLM's ability of comprehending KG knowledge. We conducted a comprehensive comparison of KG knowledge injection methods (from triples to natural language text), aiming to explore the optimal prompting method for supplying KG knowledge to LLMs, thereby enhancing their comprehension of KG. Contrary to our initial expectations, our analysis revealed that LLMs effectively handle messy, noisy, and linearized KG knowledge, outperforming methods that employ well-designed natural language (NL) textual prompts. This counter-intuitive finding provides substantial insights for future research on LLMs' comprehension of structured knowledge",

    "abstract": "Given the growing concerns over data privacy and security, fine-tuning pre-trained language models (PLMs) in federated learning (FL) has become the standard practice. However, this process faces two primary challenges. Firstly, the utilization of large-scale PLMs introduces excessive communication overheads. Secondly, the data heterogeneity across FL clients presents a major obstacle in achieving the desired fine-tuning performance. To address these challenges, we present a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method with Model-Contrastive Personalization (FedMCP). This approach introduces two adapter modules to the frozen PLM and only aggregates the global adapter in the federated aggregate phase while the private adapter stays in clients. The model-contrastive regularization term and aggregation strategy encourage the global adapter to learn universal knowledge from all clients and the private adapter to capture idiosyncratic knowledge for each individual client. Verified across a highly heterogeneous cross-silo dataset, the empirical evaluation shows considerable performance improvement achieved by FedMCP over state-of-the-art approaches",

    "abstract": "Automated audio captioning (AAC) aims to generate descriptions based on audio input, attracting exploration of emerging audio language models (ALMs). However, current evaluation metrics only provide a single score to assess the overall quality of captions without characterizing the nuanced difference by systematically going through an evaluation checklist. To this end, we propose the explainable and multi-factor audio captioning evaluation (X-ACE) paradigm. X-ACE identifies four main factors that constitute the majority of audio features, specifically sound event, source, attribute and relation. To assess a given caption from an ALM, it is firstly transformed into an audio graph, where each node denotes an entity in the caption and corresponds to a factor. On the one hand, graph matching is conducted from part to whole for a holistic assessment. On the other hand, the nodes contained within each factor are aggregated to measure the factor-level performance. The pros and cons of an ALM can be explicitly and clearly demonstrated through X-ACE, pointing out the direction for further improvements. Experiments show that X-ACE exhibits better correlation with human perception and can detect mismatches sensitively",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Document-level relation extraction (DocRE) aims to extract relations between entities in a whole document. One of the pivotal challenges of DocRE is to capture the intricate interdependencies between relations of entity pairs. Previous methods have shown that logical rules are able to explicitly help capture such interdependencies. These methods either learn logical rules to refine the output of a trained DocRE model, or first learn logical rules from annotated data and then inject the learnt rules to a DocRE model using auxiliary training objective. In this paper, we argue that these learning pipelines may suffer from the issue of error propagation. To mitigate this issue, we propose \\emph{Joint Modeling Relation extraction and Logical rules} or \\emph{JMRL} for short, a novel rule-based framework that jointly learns both a DocRE model and logical rules in an end-to-end fashion. Specifically, we parameterize a rule reasoning module in JMRL to simulate the inference of logical rules, thereby explicitly modeling the reasoning process. We also introduce an auxiliary loss and a residual connection mechanism in JMRL to better reconcile the DocRE model and the rule reasoning module. Experimental results on \\textcolor{red}{four} benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed JMRL framework is consistently superior to existing rule-based frameworks on all datasets, improving five baseline models for DocRE by a significant margin",

    "abstract": "Although chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting combined with language models has achieved encouraging results on complex reasoning tasks, the naive greedy decoding used in CoT prompting usually causes the repetitiveness and local optimality. To address this shortcoming, ensemble-optimization tries to obtain multiple reasoning paths to get the final answer assembly. However, current ensemble-optimization methods either simply employ rule-based post-processing such as self-consistency, or train an additional model based on several task-related human annotations to select the best one among multiple reasoning paths, yet fail to generalize to realistic settings where the type of input questions is unknown or the answer format of reasoning paths is unknown. To avoid their limitations, we propose Self-Agreement, a generalizable ensemble-optimization method applying in almost all scenarios where the type of input questions and the answer format of reasoning paths may be known or unknown. Self-agreement firstly samples from language model's decoder to generate a diverse set of reasoning paths, and subsequently prompts the language model one more time to determine the optimal answer by selecting the most agreed answer among the sampled reasoning paths. Self-agreement simultaneously achieves remarkable performance on six public reasoning benchmarks and superior generalization capabilities",

To address this challenge, we propose a novel Data Pyramid Pre-trained Model (DPPM) for few-shot text summarization.

For instance, this may involve employing directed hallucination induction or deliberately modifying authentic text to generate hallucinations.

Consequently, we have developed an Unconstrained Hallucination Generation Evaluation (UHGEval) benchmark, containing hallucinations generated by LLMs with minimal restrictions.

These methods not only fail to precisely optimize the policy due to the inability to accurately assess the individual impact of each decision on SiMT performance, but also cannot sufficiently explore all potential paths because of their vast number.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "This paper investigates the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to augment lexical knowledge bases (KBs) and to address their common limitations, such as static nature, limited coverage, and labor-intensive creation and maintenance. We propose a methodology that leverages LLMs to accurately reconstruct information from a source KB and generate new knowledge. Then, we evaluate this methodology using various LLMs and prompting techniques across three separate KBs. The results suggest that LLMs can accurately provide information when given ample contextual cues and when dealing with high-specificity concepts. However, they are prone to errors and inconsistencies when asked for rare or generic knowledge. The findings also indicate that LLMs can contribute to KB management by reducing the need for manual intervention. This study highlights the potential and limitations of LLMs in lexical semantics and emphasizes the importance of novel approaches to KB creation, maintenance, and integration",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Extracting semantic topics from short texts presents a significant challenge in the field of data mining. While efforts have been made to mitigate data sparsity issue, the limited length of short documents also results in the absence of semantically relevant words, causing biased evidence lower bound and incomplete labels for likelihood maximization. We refer to this issue as the label sparsity problem. To combat this problem, we propose kNNTM, a neural short text topic model that incorporates a $k$-Nearest-Neighbor-based label completion algorithm by augmenting the reconstruction label with $k$ nearest documents to complement these relevant but unobserved words. Furthermore, seeking a precise reflection of distances between documents, we propose a fused multi-view distances metric that takes both local word similarities and global topic semantics into consideration. Extensive experiments on multiple public short-text datasets show that kNNTM model outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline models and can derive both high-quality topics and document representations",

Our experiments across several GLUE and SuperGLUE benchmarks consistently highlight \\textsc{SuperPos-Prompt}'s superiority over \\textit{Residual Prompt} tuning, exhibiting an average score increase of $+6.4$ in \\textit{T5-Small} and $+5.0$ in \\textit{T5-Base} along with a faster convergence.

    "title": "When Do LLMs Need Retrieval Augmentation? Mitigating LLMs' Overconfidence Helps Retrieval Augmentation",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have been found to have difficulty knowing they do not possess certain knowledge and tend to provide specious answers in such cases. Retrieval Augmentation (RA) has been extensively studied to mitigate LLMs' hallucinations. However, due to the extra overhead and unassured quality of retrieval, it may not be optimal to conduct RA all the time. A straightforward idea is to only conduct retrieval when LLMs are uncertain about a question. This motivates us to enhance the LLMs' ability to perceive their knowledge boundaries to help RA. In this paper, we first quantitatively measure LLMs' such ability and confirm their overconfidence. Then, we study how LLMs' certainty about a question correlates with their dependence on external retrieved information. We propose several methods to enhance LLMs' perception of knowledge boundaries and show that they are effective in reducing overconfidence. Additionally, equipped with these methods, LLMs can achieve comparable or even better performance of RA with much fewer retrieval calls",

However, recent evaluation frameworks often rely on the output probabilities of LLMs for predictions, primarily due to computational constraints, diverging from real-world LLM usage scenarios. While widely employed, the efficacy of these probability-based evaluation strategies remains an open research question. This study aims to scrutinize the validity of such probability-based evaluation methods within the context of using LLMs for Multiple Choice Questions~(MCQs), highlighting their inherent limitations. Our empirical investigation reveals that the prevalent probability-based evaluation method inadequately aligns with generation-based prediction. Furthermore, current evaluation frameworks typically assess LLMs through predictive tasks based on output probabilities rather than directly generating responses, owing to computational limitations. We illustrate that these probability-based approaches do not effectively correspond with generative predictions.

However, as another critical component of programming proficiency, the debugging capability of LLMs remains relatively unexplored. Previous evaluations of LLMs' debugging ability are significantly limited by the risk of data leakage, the scale of the dataset, and the variety of tested bugs. To overcome these deficiencies, we introduce `DebugBench', an LLM debugging benchmark consisting of 4,253 instances. It covers four major bug categories and 18 minor types in C++, Java, and Python. To construct DebugBench, we collect code snippets from the LeetCode community, implant bugs into source data with GPT-4, and assure rigorous quality checks. We evaluate two commercial and three open-source models in a zero-shot scenario. We find that (1) while closed-source models like GPT-4 exhibit inferior debugging performance compared to humans, open-source models such as Code Llama fail to attain any pass rate scores; (2) the complexity of debugging notably fluctuates depending on the bug category; (3) incorporating runtime feedback has a clear impact on debugging performance which is not always helpful. As an extension, we also compare LLM debugging and code generation, revealing a strong correlation between them for closed-source models. These findings will benefit the development of LLMs in debugging",

To examine the combined effects of textual and visual inputs, we propose a novel visual dialogue hallucination evaluation benchmark VisDiaHalBench. The benchmark consists of samples with five-turn questions about an edited image and its original version. VisDiaHalBench differs from previous hallucination benchmarks in the following three points: 1) The questions and answers are unambiguously grounded by annotated scene graphs. 2) The images are uncommonly edited to inspect the visual model and common-object hallucination in LLMs. 3) The carefully designed dialogue refers a same object in different turns to assess the image consistency and influence of history for LVLMs. The detailed analysis of several state-of-the-art LVLMs across image consistency, visual understanding, history influence, and other dimensions reveals their substantial performance gap with single-turn VQA tasks",

However, recent research indicates without external feedback, LLM's intrinsic reflection is unstable. Our investigation unveils that the key bottleneck is the quality of the self-evaluated feedback. We find LLMs often exhibit overconfidence or high randomness when self-evaluate, offering stubborn or inconsistent feedback, which causes poor reflection. To remedy this, we advocate Self-Contrast: It adaptively explores diverse solving perspectives tailored to the request, contrasts the differences, and summarizes these discrepancies into a checklist which could be used to re-examine and eliminate discrepancies. Our method endows LLM with diverse perspectives to alleviate stubborn biases. Moreover, their discrepancies indicate potential errors or inherent uncertainties that LLM often overlooks. Reflecting upon these can catalyze more accurate and stable reflection.

Conformal Prediction (CP), known for its model-agnostic and distribution-free features, is a desired approach for various LLMs and data distributions. However, existing CP methods for LLMs typically assume access to the logits, which are unavailable for some API-only LLMs. In addition, logits are known to be miscalibrated, potentially leading to degraded CP performance. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a novel CP method that (1) is tailored for API-only LLMs without logit-access; (2) minimizes the size of prediction sets; and (3) ensures a statistical guarantee of the user-defined coverage. The core idea of this approach is to formulate nonconformity measures using both coarse-grained (i.e., sample frequency) and fine-grained uncertainty notions (e.g., semantic similarity).

Object hallucination refers to the phenomenon that the LVLMs claim non-existent objects in the image. To mitigate the object hallucinations, instruction tuning and external model-based detection methods have been proposed, which either require large-scare computational resources or depend on the detection result of external models. However, there remains an under-explored field to utilize the LVLM itself to alleviate object hallucinations. In this work, we adopt the intuition that the LVLM tends to respond logically consistently for existent objects but inconsistently for hallucinated objects. Therefore, we propose a Logical Closed Loop-based framework for Object Hallucination Detection and Mitigation, namely \\textbf{LogicCheckGPT}. In specific, we devise logical consistency probing to raise questions with logical correlations, inquiring about attributes from objects and vice versa. Whether their responses can form a logical closed loop serves as an indicator of object hallucination.

However, most existing approaches focus only on shortcut learning in fine-tuned lightweight PLMs and cannot bridge the gap with Large Language Models (LLMs). In addition, how to evaluate LLMs dependence on shortcuts and how to alleviate the dependence on shortcuts still need extensive and in-depth research. Therefore, motivated by the above challenges, this paper proposes a benchmark containing two common text classification tasks to analyze and quantify the impact of shortcuts on LLMs in In-Context Learning (ICL). Then, we explain the shortcut learning of LLMs from the perspective of information flow: LLMs tend to make one-sided inferences by using the association between repeated shortcuts and labels in context. Finally, we evaluate several prompt-based shortcut mitigation strategies that lead to more robust predictions from the LLMs. Our work establishes a set of LLMs' shortcut research processes from assessment to analysis to mitigation, and provides new insights into LLMs shortcut learning",

However, existing methods still have some limitations: 1) repetitions, transpositions, and omissions in the output synthesized speech due to limited alignment constraints between audio and phoneme tokens; 2) challenges of fine-grained control over the synthesized speech with autoregressive (AR) language model; 3) infinite silence generation due to the nature of AR-based decoding, especially under the greedy strategy. To alleviate these issues, we propose ELLA-V, a simple but efficient LM-based zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) framework, which enables fine-grained control over synthesized audio at the phoneme level. The key to ELLA-V is interleaving sequences of acoustic and phoneme tokens, where phoneme tokens appear ahead of the corresponding acoustic tokens.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "The summarization capabilities of pretrained and large language models (LLMs) have been widely validated in general areas, but their use in scientific corpus, which involves complex sentences and specialized knowledge, has been less assessed. This paper presents conceptual and experimental analyses of scientific summarization, highlighting the inadequacies of traditional evaluation methods, such as $n$-gram, embedding comparison, and QA, particularly in providing explanations, grasping scientific concepts, or identifying key content. Subsequently, we introduce the Facet-aware Metric (FM), employing LLMs for advanced semantic matching to evaluate summaries based on different aspects. This facet-aware approach offers a thorough evaluation of abstracts by decomposing the evaluation task into simpler subtasks. Recognizing the absence of an evaluation benchmark in this domain, we curate a Facet-based scientific summarization Dataset (FD) with facet-level annotations. Our findings confirm that FM offers a more logical approach to evaluating scientific summaries. In addition, fine-tuned smaller models can compete with LLMs in scientific contexts, while LLMs have limitations in learning from in-context information in scientific domains. This suggests an area for future enhancement of LLM",

Hoping to address the costs of re-training due to discrepancies of both standard termbases and annotation protocols. Another major obstacle in this task is that both mentions and terms are short texts.

To address these challenges, we introduce \\textsc{MAC-SQL}, a novel LLM-based multi-agent collaborative framework. Our framework comprises a core decomposer agent for Text-to-SQL generation with few-shot chain-of-thought reasoning, accompanied by two auxiliary agents that utilize external tools or models to acquire smaller sub-databases and refine erroneous SQL queries. The decomposer agent collaborates with auxiliary agents, which are activated as needed and can be expanded to accommodate new features or tools for effective Text-to-SQL parsing. In our framework, We initially leverage GPT-4 as the strong backbone LLM for all agent tasks to determine the upper bound of our framework. We then fine-tune an open-sourced instruction-followed model, SQL-Llama, by leveraging Code Llama 7B, to accomplish all tasks as GPT-4 does. Experiments show that SQL-Llama achieves a comparable execution accuracy of 43.94, compared to the baseline accuracy of 46.35 for vanilla GPT-4.

Two data augmentation methods are widely adopted: (1) \\textit{Random Replacement} with the guidance of confusion sets and (2) \\textit{OCR/ASR-based Generation} that simulates character misusing. However, both methods inevitably introduce noisy data (e.g., false spelling errors), potentially leading to over-correction. By carefully analyzing the two types of corpora, we find that though the latter achieves more robust generalization performance, the former yields better-calibrated CSC models. We then provide a theoretical analysis of this empirical observation, based on which a corpus refining strategy is proposed. Specifically, OCR/ASR-based data samples are fed into a well-calibrated CSC model trained on random replacement-based corpora and then filtered based on prediction confidence. By learning a simple BERT-based model on the refined OCR/ASR-based corpus, we set up impressive state-of-the-art performance on three widely-used benchmarks, while significantly alleviating over-correction (e.g., lowering false positive predictions)",

Taking inspiration from Langedijk et al. (2022), who apply meta-learning to tackle cross-lingual syntactic parsing, we investigate the use of meta-learning for cross-lingual AMR parsing. We evaluate our models in both zero-shot and few-shot scenarios and assess their effectiveness in Croatian, Farsi, Korean, Chinese, and French. Notably, Korean and Croatian test sets are developed as part of our work, based on the existing The Little Prince English AMR corpus, and made publicly available.

However, existing research primarily focuses on point-wise and pair-wise recommendation paradigms. These approaches prove inefficient in LLM-based recommenders due to the high computational cost of utilizing Large Language Models. While some studies have delved into list-wise approaches, they fall short in ranking tasks. This shortfall is attributed to the misalignment between the objectives of ranking and language generation. To this end, this paper introduces the Language Model Framework with Aligned Listwise Ranking Objectives (ALRO). ALRO is designed to bridge the gap between the capabilities of LLMs and the nuanced requirements of ranking tasks within recommender systems. A key feature of ALRO is the introduction of soft lambda loss, an adaptation of lambda loss tailored to suit language generation tasks. Additionally, ALRO incorporates a permutation-sensitive learning mechanism that addresses position bias, a prevalent issue in generative models, without imposing additional computational burdens during inference. Our evaluative studies reveal that ALRO outperforms existing embedding-based recommendation methods and the existing LLM-based recommendation baselines, highlighting its efficacy",

Additionally, many fine-tuning methods often rely on approximations or heuristic optimization strategies, which may lead to suboptimal solutions. To address these issues, we propose an efficient and fast framework for fine-tuning sparse LLMs based on minimizing reconstruction error. Our approach involves sampling a small dataset for calibration and utilizing backpropagation to iteratively optimize block-wise reconstruction error, on a block-by-block basis, aiming for optimal solutions. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks consistently demonstrate the superiority of our method over other baselines. For instance, on the Wikitext2 dataset with LlamaV1-7B at 70% sparsity, our proposed EBFT achieves a perplexity of 16.88, surpassing the state-of-the-art DSnoT with a perplexity of 75.14. Moreover, with a structured sparsity ratio of 26\\%, EBFT achieves a perplexity of 16.27, outperforming LoRA (perplexity 16.44). Furthermore, the fine-tuning process of EBFT for LlamaV1-7B only takes approximately 30 minutes, and the entire framework can be executed on a single 16GB GPU.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Metaphors are a common communication tool used in our day-to-day life. The detection and generation of metaphors in textual form have been studied extensively but metaphors in other forms have been under-explored. Recent studies have shown that Vision-Language (VL) models cannot understand visual metaphors in memes and adverts. As of now, no probing studies have been done that involve complex language phenomena like metaphors with videos. Hence, we introduce a new VL task of describing the metaphors present in the videos in our work. To facilitate this novel task, we construct and release two datasets- a manually created dataset with 705 videos and 2115 human-written captions and a synthetic dataset of 90886 MSCOCO images with synthetically generated metaphor captions. We propose a novel video metaphor captioning system: GIT-LLaVA, which uses a frozen video captioning model augmented by a Large Language Model (LLM) for generating metaphors, as a strong baseline. We perform a comprehensive analysis of SOTA video language models on this task. We publish our datasets and benchmark results for our novel task to enable further research",

    "title": "A Two-Agent Game for Zero-shot Relation Triplet Extraction",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Relation triplet extraction is a fundamental task in natural language processing that aims to identify semantic relationships between entities in text. It is particularly challenging in the zero-shot setting, i.e., zero-shot relation triplet extraction (ZeroRTE), where the relation sets between training and test are disjoint. Existing methods deal with this task by integrating relations into prompts, which may lack sufficient understanding of the unseen relations. To address these limitations, this paper presents a novel Two-Agent Game (TAG) approach to deliberate and debate the semantics of unseen relations. TAG consists of two agents, a generator and an extractor. They iteratively interact in three key steps: attempting, criticizing, and rectifying. This enables the agents to fully debate and understand the unseen relations. Experimental results demonstrate consistent improvement over ALBERT-Large, BART, and GPT3.5, without incurring additional inference costs in all cases. Remarkably, our method outperforms strong baselines by a significant margin, achieving an impressive 6%-16% increase in F1 scores, particularly when dealing with FewRel with five unseen relations",

    "title": "My Answer is C\": First-Token Probabilities Do Not Match Text Answers in Instruction-Tuned Language Models",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "The open-ended nature of language generation makes the evaluation of autoregressive large language models (LLMs) challenging. One common evaluation approach uses multiple-choice questions to limit the response space. The model is then evaluated by ranking the candidate answers by the log probability of the first token prediction. However, first-tokens may not consistently reflect the final response output, due to model's diverse response styles such as starting with \"Sure\" or refusing to answer. Consequently, first-token evaluation is not indicative of model behaviour when interacting with users. But by how much? We evaluate how aligned first-token evaluation is with the text output along several dimensions, namely final option choice, refusal rate, choice distribution and robustness under prompt perturbation. Our results show that the two approaches are severely misaligned \\emph{on all dimensions}, reaching mismatch rates over 60\\%. Models heavily fine-tuned on conversational or safety data are especially impacted. Crucially, models remain misaligned even when we increasingly constrain prompts, i.e., force them to start with an option letter or example template. Our findings i) underscore the importance of inspecting the text output, too and ii) caution against relying solely on first-token evaluation",

    "abstract": "Prior research in representation engineering has revealed that LLMs encode concepts within their representation spaces, predominantly centered around English. In this study, we extend this philosophy to a multilingual scenario, delving into multilingual human value concepts in LLMs. Through our comprehensive exploration covering 7 types of human values, 16 languages and 3 LLM series with distinct multilinguality, we empirically substantiate the existence of multilingual human values in LLMs. Further cross-lingual analysis on these concepts discloses 3 traits arising from language resource disparities: cross-lingual inconsistency, distorted linguistic relationships, and unidirectional cross-lingual transfer between high- and low-resource languages, all in terms of human value concepts. Additionally, we prove the feasibility of cross-lingual control over value alignment capabilities of LLMs, leveraging the dominant language as a source language. Drawing from our findings on multilingual value alignment, we prudently provide suggestions on the composition of multilingual data for LLMs pre-training: including a limited number of dominant languages for cross-lingual alignment transfer while avoiding their excessive prevalence, and keeping a more balanced distribution of non-dominant languages. We aspire that our findings will contribute to enhancing the safety and utility of multilingual AI",

While Large Language Models (LLMs) present promising solutions, their effectiveness is limited by the small number of in-context learning demonstrations, particularly for authorship styles not frequently seen during pre-training. In response, this paper proposes an inverse transfer data augmentation (\\model) method, leveraging LLMs to create (neutral text, stylized text) pairs. This method involves removing the existing styles from stylized texts, a process made more feasible due to the prevalence of neutral texts in pre-training.

    "abstract": "Code generation with Large Language Models (LLMs) has been extensively studied and achieved remarkable progress. As a complementary aspect to code generation, test case generation is of crucial importance in ensuring the quality and reliability of code. However, using LLMs as test case generators has been much less explored. Current research along this line primarily focuses on enhancing code generation with assistance from test cases generated by LLMs, while the performance of LLMs in test case generation alone has not been comprehensively examined. To bridge this gap, we conduct extensive experiments to study how well LLMs can generate high-quality test cases. We find that as the problem difficulty increases, state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to generate correct test cases, largely due to their inherent limitations in computation and reasoning. To mitigate this issue, we further propose a multi-agent framework called TestChain that decouples the generation of test inputs and test outputs. Notably, TestChain uses a ReAct format conversation chain for LLMs to interact with a Python interpreter in order to provide more accurate test outputs. Our results indicate that TestChain outperforms the baseline by a large margin. Particularly, in terms of the accuracy of test cases, TestChain using GPT-4 as the backbone achieves a 13.84% improvement over the baseline on the LeetCode-hard dataset",

We show that for popular multiple-choice question benchmarks (e.g., MMLU), minor perturbations to the benchmark, such as changing the order of choices or the method of answer selection, result in changes in rankings up to 8 positions. We explain this phenomenon by conducting systematic experiments over three broad categories of benchmark perturbations and identifying the sources of this behavior.

However, when LLMs face different types of questions, it is worth exploring whether LLMs are aware that some questions have limited answers and have to respond more deterministically but some do not. We refer to the ability as question awareness that LLMs know to adjust the determinacy of the answers according to the questions. The lack of question awareness leads to two contradictory issues: (1) Too casual to answer non-open-ended questions. (2) Too boring to answer open-ended questions. In this paper, we first evaluate the question awareness of LLMs. The experimental results show that LLMs have the above issues of lacking the awareness of questions in certain domains, e.g. factual knowledge. To mitigate these issues, we propose a method called Question Awareness Temperature Sampling (QuATS). This method enhances the question awareness of LLMs by dynamically adjusting the output distributions based on question features. The automatic adjustment in QuATS eliminates the need for manual temperature tuning in text generation and improves model performance in various benchmarks",

This study proposes Contrastive Topic-Length Prompt Learning (CTL-Prompt), a simple method that generates topic-based summaries. First, we used topic prompts to direct our dialogue summarization in order to steer the summary towards a particular topic in light of recent success with prompts in guiding aspects in general summarization. Nevertheless, our preliminary experiment revealed that depending solely on the topic prompt frequently leads to mostly identical summaries across topics. We further added a length control prompt that controls the length of the generated summaries based on the length of the reference summaries for each topic. While it was able to generate a more concise summary, the summaries across topics remained similar. To promote the model to produce concise yet diverse summaries across topics, we propose the use of contrastive learning on topic-length prompts, which make use of positive and negative pairs to enforce the models to learn the similarities and differences of different topics. Experimental results showed that our model outperformed other baseline models in the ROUGE and BERT scores on the DialogSum dataset.

However, a pivotal aspect of alignment for honesty involves discerning an LLM's knowledge boundaries, which demands comprehensive solutions in terms of metric development, benchmark creation, and training methodologies. We address these challenges by first establishing a precise problem definition and defining ``honesty'' inspired by the Analects of Confucius. This serves as a cornerstone for developing metrics that effectively measure an LLM's honesty by quantifying its progress post-alignment. Furthermore, we introduce a flexible training framework which is further instantiated by several efficient fine-tuning techniques that emphasize honesty without sacrificing performance on other tasks.

    "title": "A Modular Approach for Multimodal Summarization of TV Shows",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "In this paper we address the task of summarizing television shows which touches key areas in AI research: complex reasoning, multiple modalities, and long narratives. We present a modular approach where separate components perform specialized sub-tasks which we argue affords greater flexibility compared to end-to-end methods. Our modules involve detecting scene boundaries, reordering scenes so as to minimize the number of cuts between different events, converting visual information to text, summarizing the dialogue in each scene, and fusing the scene summaries into a final summary for the entire episode. We also present a new metric, PREFS (\\textbf{P}recision and \\textbf{R}ecall \\textbf{E}valuation of Summary \\textbf{F}act\\textbf{s}), to measure both precision and recall of generated summaries, which we decompose into atomic facts. Tested on the recently released SummScreen3D dataset (Papalampidi and Lapata, 2023), our method produces higher quality summaries than comparison models, as measured with ROUGE and our new fact-based metric",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "We introduce Bonito, an open-source model for conditional task generation: the task of converting unannotated text into task-specific training datasets for instruction tuning. Our goal is to enable zero-shot task adaptation of large language models on users' specialized, private data. We train Bonito on a new large-scale dataset with 1.65M examples created by remixing existing instruction tuning datasets into meta-templates. The meta-templates for a dataset produce training examples where the input is the unannotated text and the task attribute and the output consists of the instruction and the response. We use Bonito to generate synthetic tasks for seven datasets from specialized domains across three task types---yes-no question answering, extractive question answering, and natural language inference---and adapt language models. We show that Bonito significantly improves the average performance of pretrained and instruction tuned models over the de facto self supervised baseline. For example, adapting Mistral-Instruct-v2 and instruction tuned variants of Mistral and Llama2 with Bonito improves the strong zero-shot performance by 22.1 F1 points whereas the next word prediction objective undoes some of the benefits of instruction tuning and reduces the average performance by 0.8 F1 points. We conduct additional experiments with Bonito to understand the effects of the domain, the size of the training set, and the choice of alternative synthetic task generators. Overall, we show that learning with synthetic instruction tuning datasets is an effective way to adapt language models to new domains",

    "abstract": "Despite the presence of many competitive PEFT methods like LoRA, we still need a PEFT method that is efficient under the single-backbone multi-tenant setting while performing competitively in the downstream tasks. In this work, we propose a novel PEFT method, \\underline{P}rompt \\underline{A}ware \\underline{R}epresentation \\underline{AD}justm\\underline{E}nt (PARADE). First, we propose to install a lightweight vector generator at each Transformer layer to generate vectors that will modify the hidden states in the multi-head self-attention (MHSA) and position-wise feed-forward (FFN) modules and, as a result, modulate the behaviors of the pre-trained backbone. Second, the vector generators are modules with a bottleneck architecture consisting of a pooling operation, two linear projections, and an activation function. To enhance the downstream performance of vector generators, we propose an attention-based capsule network as the pooling operation, which can effectively summarize the semantic information in the input instructions. We have conducted experiments on various tasks, and the experimental results demonstrate that: (a) our PARADE method can outperform the recent baselines with comparable tunable parameters. (b) Our PARADE method is more efficient than LoRA under the single-backbone multi-tenant setting.\\footnote{Codes and fine-tuned models will be open-sourced to facilitate future research. }",

This paper aims to evaluate the reasoning capacities of LLMs, specifically in solving recent competition-level programming problems in Codeforces, which are expert-crafted and unique, requiring deep understanding and robust reasoning skills. We first provide a comprehensive evaluation of GPT-4's perceived zero-shot performance on this task, considering various aspects such as problems' release time, difficulties, and types of errors encountered. Surprisingly, the perceived performance of GPT-4 has experienced a cliff like decline in problems after September 2021 consistently across all the difficulties and types of problems, which shows the potential data contamination, as well as the challenges for any existing LLM to solve unseen complex reasoning problems. We further explore various approaches such as fine-tuning, Chain-of-Thought prompting and problem description simplification, unfortunately none of them is able to consistently mitigate the challenges. Through our work, we emphasize the importance of this excellent data source for assessing the genuine reasoning capabilities of LLMs, and foster the development of LLMs with stronger reasoning abilities and better generalization in the future",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated a powerful ability for text generation. However, achieving optimal results with a given prompt or instruction can be challenging, especially for billion-sized models. Additionally, undesired behaviors such as toxicity or hallucinations can manifest. While much larger models (e.g., ChatGPT) may demonstrate strength in mitigating these issues, there is still no guarantee of complete prevention. In this work, we propose formalizing text generation as a future-constrained generation problem to minimize undesirable behaviors and enforce faithfulness to instructions. The estimation of future constraint satisfaction, accomplished using LLMs, guides the text generation process. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach across three distinct text generation tasks: keyword-constrained generation (Lin et al., 2020), toxicity reduction (Gehman et al., 2020), and factual correctness in question-answering (Gao et al., 2023)",

    "abstract": "Legal case retrieval (LCR) aims to provide similar cases as references for a given fact description. This task is crucial for promoting consistent judgments in similar cases, effectively enhancing judicial fairness and improving work efficiency for judges. However, existing works face two main challenges for real-world applications: existing works mainly focus on case-to-case retrieval using lengthy queries, which does not match real-world scenarios; and the limited data scale, with current datasets containing only hundreds of queries, is insufficient to satisfy the training requirements of existing data-hungry neural models. To address these issues, we introduce an automated method to construct asymmetrically query-candidate pairs and construct the largest LCR dataset to date, LEAD, which is hundreds of times larger than existing datasets. This dataset can provide ample training signals for LCR models. Experimental results demonstrate that models training with LEAD can achieve state-of-the-art results on two widely used LCR benchmarks. Besides, the construction method can be also applied to civil cases and achieve promising results. The code and dataset used in this paper will be released to promote the development of LCR",

    "abstract": "Model editing aims to precisely modify the behaviours of large language models (LLMs) on specific knowledge while keeping irrelevant knowledge unchanged. It has been proven effective in resolving hallucination and out-of-date issues in LLMs. As a result, it can boost the application of LLMs in many critical domains (e.g., medical domain), where the hallucination is not tolerable. In this paper, we propose two model editing studies and validate them in the medical domain: (1) directly editing the factual medical knowledge and (2) editing the explanations to facts. Meanwhile, we observed that current model editing methods struggle with the specialization and complexity of medical knowledge. Therefore, we propose MedLaSA, a novel Layer-wise Scalable Adapter strategy for medical model editing. It employs causal tracing to identify the precise location of knowledge in neurons and then introduces scalable adapters into the dense layers of LLMs. These adapters are assigned scaling values based on the corresponding specific knowledge. To evaluate the editing impact, we build two benchmark datasets and introduce a series of challenging and comprehensive metrics. Extensive experiments on medical LLMs demonstrate the editing efficiency of MedLaSA, without affecting irrelevant knowledge that is not edited",

    "abstract": "Recently, the powerful large language models (LLMs) have been instrumental in propelling the progress of recommender systems (RS). However, while these systems have flourished, their susceptibility to security threats has been largely overlooked. In this work, we reveal that the introduction of LLMs into recommendation models presents new security vulnerabilities due to their emphasis on the textual content of items. We demonstrate that attackers can significantly boost an item's exposure by merely altering its textual content during the testing phase, without requiring direct interference with the model's training process. Additionally, the attack is notably stealthy, as it does not affect the overall recommendation performance and the modifications to the text are subtle, making it difficult for users and platforms to detect. Our comprehensive experiments across four mainstream LLM-based recommendation models demonstrate the superior efficacy and stealthiness of our approach.

We tested large language models (LLMs) on this evaluation resource, and found that LLMs failed to deliver trustworthy explanations for the machine translation errors.

Meta-training for ICL (MetaICL), a method that learns ICL ability for enhancing to follow a few in-context examples, has been proposed. However, the language models trained with MetaICL might not be able to consider information obtained from in-context examples at inference because it is reported that the performance is unaffected when random or flipped outputs are used in a few in-context examples. Our key idea for using in-context information is explicitly giving a relationship between outputs in context and a target output by unifying the output style. Specifically, arbitrary symbols (e.g., integer or word) are inserted into the outputs in context, and we expect the model to focus on examples by learning to output the same symbols at the same positions. To evaluate the proposed method, we create a Japanese dataset containing multiple examples per task.

Drawing inspiration from the actor-critic algorithm in reinforcement learning, PACE leverages LLMs as the dual roles of actors and critics, conceptualizing prompt as a type of policy. PACE refines prompt, taking into account the feedback from both actors performing prompt and critics criticizing response. This process helps LLMs better align prompt to a specific task, thanks to real responses and thinking from LLMs.We conduct extensive experiments on 24 instruction induction tasks and 21 big-bench tasks. Experimental results indicate that PACE elevates the relative performance of medium/low-quality human-written prompts by up to 98\\%, which has comparable performance to high-quality human-written prompts.

    "title": "Towards A Unified View of Answer Calibration for Multi-Step Reasoning",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) employing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting have broadened the scope for improving multi-step reasoning capabilities. We generally divide multi-step reasoning into two phases: *path generation* to generate the reasoning path(s); and *answer calibration* post-processing the reasoning path(s) to obtain a final answer. However, the existing literature lacks systematic analysis on different answer calibration approaches. In this paper, we summarize the taxonomy of recent answer calibration techniques and break them down into step-level and path-level strategies. We then conduct a thorough evaluation on these strategies from a unified view, systematically scrutinizing step-level and path-level answer calibration across multiple paths. Experimental results reveal that integrating the dominance of both strategies tends to derive optimal outcomes. Our study holds the potential to illuminate key insights for optimizing multi-step reasoning with answer calibration",

Large Language Model (LLM)-basedmulti-agent systems have demonstrated promising performance in simulating human society.Can we leverage LLM-based multi-agent systems to simulate human communication? However, current LLM-based multi-agent systemsmainly rely on text as the primary medium.In this paper, we propose SpeechAgents, amulti-modal LLM based multi-agent systemdesigned for simulating human communication. SpeechAgents utilizes multi-modal LLMas the control center for individual agent andemployes multi-modal signals as the mediumfor exchanged messages among agents. Additionally, we propose Multi-Agent Tuning toenhance the multi-agent capabilities of LLMwithout compromising general abilities. Tostrengthen and evaluate the effectiveness ofhuman communication simulation, we buildthe Human-Communication Simulation Benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate thatSpeechAgents can simulate human communication dialogues with consistent content, authentic rhythm, and rich emotions and demonstrateexcellent scalability even with up to 25 agents,which can apply to tasks such as drama creationand audio novels generation.

CHATS-CRITIC is composed of an image-to-text model to recover the table from a chart, and a tabular entailment model applied to score the summary sentence by sentence. We find that CHATS-CRITIC evaluates the summary quality according to human ratings better than reference-based metrics, either learned or n-gram based, and can be further used to fix candidate summaries by removing not supported sentences. We then introduce CHATS-PI, a chart-to-summary pipeline that leverages CHATS-CRITIC during inference to fix and rank sampled candidates from any chart-summarization model.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have attracted great interest in many real-world applications given their increasingly accurate responses and coherent reasoning abilities. On the other hand, because of their complex and black-box nature, the demand for scalable and faithful explanations for LLM-generated outputs continues to grow. Explainability methods for deep learning, especially the well-respected Shapley value, have matured significantly over the past decade. However, there are major challenges in extending Shapley values to LLMs, particularly when dealing with long input contexts (containing thousands of tokens) and considering autoregressive generation of output sequences. In this paper, we introduce TextGenSHAP, an efficient post-hoc explanation method incorporating LLM-specific techniques. We demonstrate that this leads to significant runtime improvements compared to conventional Shapley value computations, reducing runtime from hours to minutes for token-level explanations, and to just seconds for document-level explanations. We then demonstrate how such explanations can improve end-to-end performance of retrieval augmented generation, localizing important words from within long documents, and reranking passages collected by retrieval systems. In open-domain question answering on NQ Open and MIRACL, TextGenSHAP improves the recall of document retrieval systems by multiple points and closes the accuracy gap of open-domain question answering with a 5-10\\% point improvement",

    "abstract": "Mitigating the hallucinations of Large Language Models (LLMs) and enhancing them is a crucial task. Although some existing methods employ model self-enhancement techniques, they fall short of effectively addressing unknown factual hallucinations. Using Knowledge Graph (KG) enhancement approaches fails to address the generalization across different KG sources and the enhancement of open-ended answer questions simultaneously. To tackle these limitations, there is a framework that combines \\textbf{Pseudo-Graph Generation} and \\textbf{Atomic Knowledge Verification} proposed. The enhancement of LLM using KG in an open-ended question-answering setting is implemented by leveraging the Pseudo-Graph Generation. Atomic Knowledge Verification utilizes atomic-level knowledge querying and verification to achieve generalizability under different KG sources. Compared to the baseline, this approach yields a minimum improvement of 11.5 in the ROUGE-L score for open-ended questions. For precise questions, we observe a minimum accuracy improvement of 7.5. Moreover, there is also demonstration that this framework exhibits generalizability across different KG sources. In summary, our results pave the way for enhancing LLMs by incorporating Pseudo- and Multisource-KGs, particularly in the context of open-ended questions",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized the landscape of reasoning tasks. To enhance the capabilities of LLMs to emulate human reasoning, prior studies have focused on modeling reasoning steps using various thought structures like chains, trees, or graphs. However, LLM-based reasoning still encounters the following challenges: (1) Limited adaptability of preset structures to diverse tasks; (2) Insufficient precision in exploiting known conditions to derive new ones; and (3) Inadequate consideration of historical reasoning experiences for subsequent reasoning steps. To this end, we propose DetermLR, a novel perspective that rethinks the reasoning process as an evolution from indeterminacy to determinacy. First, we categorize known conditions into two types: determinate and indeterminate premises, facilitating the transformation process. Subsequently, we leverage quantitative measurements to prioritize more relevant premises to explore new insights. Furthermore, we automate the storage and extraction of available premises and reasoning paths with reasoning memory, preserving historical reasoning details for subsequent reasoning steps. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that DetermLR surpasses all baselines on various logical reasoning benchmarks: LogiQA, ProofWriter, FOLIO, PrOntoQA, and LogicalDeduction. Compared to previous multi-step reasoning methods, DetermLR achieves higher accuracy with fewer reasoning steps, highlighting its superior efficiency and effectiveness in solving logical reasoning tasks",

However, the current MDT construction methods rely heavily on time-consuming and laborious manual annotation. In this work, we propose a novel task, Text2MDT, to explore the automatic extraction of MDTs from medical texts such as medical guidelines and textbooks. We normalized the form of the MDT and created an annotated Text2MDT dataset in Chinese with the participation of medical experts. We investigate two different methods for the Text2MDT tasks: (a) an end-to-end framework that only relies on a GPT style large language models (LLM) instruction tuning to generate all the node information and tree structures. (b) The pipeline framework decomposes the Text2MDT task into three subtasks. Experiments on our Text2MDT dataset demonstrate that (a) the end-to-end method based on LLMs (7B parameters or larger) shows promising results and successfully outperforms the pipeline methods. (b) The chain-of-thought (COT) prompting method \\cite{Wei2022ChainOT} can improve the performance of the fine-tuned LLMs on the Text2MDT test set. (c) the lightweight pipelined method based on encoder-based pre-trained models also performs well with LLMs with model complexity two magnitudes smaller.\\footnote{Our Text2MDT dataset and the source codes are open-sourced, and we will make the dataset and the source codes openly available upon acceptance. }",

    "abstract": "Combining large language models with logical reasoning enhances their capacity to address problems in a robust and reliable manner. Nevertheless, the intricate nature of logical reasoning poses challenges to gathering reliable data from the web for building comprehensive training datasets, subsequently affecting the performance on downstream tasks. To address this, we introduce a novel logic-driven data augmentation approach, AMR-LDA. AMR-LDA converts the original text into an Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graph, a structured semantic representation that encapsulates the logic structure of the sentence, upon which operations are performed to generate logically modified AMR graphs. The modified AMR graphs are subsequently converted back into text to create augmented data. Notably, our methodology is architecture-agnostic and enhances both generative large language models, such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, through prompt augmentation, and discriminative large language models through contrastive learning with logic-driven data augmentation. Empirical evidence underscores the efficacy of our proposed method with improvement in performance across seven downstream tasks, such as reading comprehension requiring logical reasoning, textual entailment, and natural language inference.

We fabricate four unique 'societies' comprised of LLM agents, where each agent is characterized by a specific 'trait' (easy-going or overconfident) and engages in collaboration with a distinct 'thinking pattern' (debate or reflection). Through evaluating these multi-agent societies on three benchmark datasets, we discern that certain collaborative strategies not only outshine previous top-tier approaches, but also optimize efficiency (using fewer API tokens). Moreover, our results further illustrate that LLM agents manifest human-like social behaviors, such as conformity and consensus reaching, mirroring foundational social psychology theories. In conclusion, we integrate insights from social psychology to contextualize the collaboration of LLM agents, inspiring further investigations into the collaboration mechanism for LLMs. We commit to sharing our code and datasets\\footnote{\\url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MachineSoM-3178}.}, hoping to catalyze further research in this promising avenue",

However, the high reliability and risk control requirements in software engineering raise concerns about the need for interpretability of LLMs. To address this concern, we conducted a study to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs and their limitations for code analysis in SE. Code analysis is essential in software development. It identifies bugs, security, and compliance problems and evaluates code quality and performance. We break down the abilities needed for LLMs to address SE tasks related to code analysis into three categories: 1) syntax understanding, 2) static behaviour understanding, and 3) dynamic behaviour understanding. We used four foundational models and assessed the performance of LLMs on multiple-language tasks. We found that, while LLMs are good at understanding code syntax, they struggle with comprehending code semantics, particularly dynamic semantics. Furthermore, our study highlights that LLMs are susceptible to hallucinations when interpreting code semantic structures. It is necessary to explore methods to verify the correctness of LLM's output to ensure its dependability in SE. More importantly, our study provides an initial answer to why the codes generated by LLM are usually syntax-correct but are possibly vulnerable",

We propose a two-stage framework that simulates the scenario of humans recalling easily forgotten references. Initially, the LLM is prompted to recall document title identifiers to obtain a coarse-grained document set. Then, based on the acquired coarse-grained document set, it recalls fine-grained passage. In the two-stage recall process, we use constrained decoding to ensure that content outside of the stored documents is not generated. To increase speed, we only recall a short prefix in the second stage, then locate its position to retrieve a complete passage. Experiments on KILT knowledge-sensitive tasks have verified that LLMs can independently recall reference passage location in various task forms, and the obtained reference significantly assist downstream tasks",

For better granularity, we reframe the task from a dialogue turn classification to a span labeling task. We then evaluate language models on the labeling of such acts and find that the broad range and structure of the proposed labels is hard to model for LLMs such as GPT-3.5/-4 via prompting, but a fine-tuned BERT can perform both act classification and span labeling well.

    "title": "Better Semantic Representation: A Low-Shot Relation Extraction Method Based on Token-Generated Contributions",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "In light of the era of information explosion, traditional relation extraction methods are in a bottleneck due to data limitations in the face of the constant emergence of new relation categories. Therefore the study of low-shot relation extraction in real scenarios is crucial. In the few-shot scenario, it is necessary to build up the model's ability to summarize the semantics of instances. In the zero-shot scenario, it is necessary to establish the label matching ability of the model. Although they need to establish different basic abilities of the model, the common point is that they all need to build excellent semantic representations in the end, which is ignored by the existing methods. In this paper, we propose a method (TGCRE) based on token-generated contribution to unify low-shot relation extraction by generating better semantic representations. Further, we propose a multi-level spatial semantic matching scheme in zero-shot scenarios, aiming to solve the problem that existing methods cannot fully utilize feature information and are susceptible to irrelevant contexts. Experimental results show that our method outperforms previous robust baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance",

    "title": "Do Llamas Work in English? On the Latent Language of Multilingual Transformers",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "We ask whether multilingual language models trained on unbalanced, English-dominated corpora use English as an internal pivot language––a question of key importance for understanding how language models function and the origins of linguistic bias.Focusing on the Llama-2 family of transformer models, our study is based on carefully constructed non-English prompts with a unique correct single-token continuation. From layer to layer, transformers gradually map an input embedding of the final prompt token to an output embedding from which next-token probabilities are computed. Tracking intermediate embeddings through their high-dimensional space reveals three distinct phases, whereby intermediate embeddings (1) start far away from output token embeddings; (2) already in middle layers allow for decoding a semantically correct next token, but giving higher probability to its version in English than in the input language; (3) move into an input-language-specific region of the embedding space. We cast these results into a conceptual model where the three phases operate in ''input space'', ''concept space'', and ''output space'', respectively. Crucially, our evidence suggests that the abstract ''concept space'' lies closer to English than to other input languages, which may have important consequences regarding the biases embodied by multilingual language models",

Melodist leverages tri-tower contrastive pretraining to learn more effective text representation for controllable V2A synthesis. A Chinese song dataset mined from a music website is built up to alleviate data scarcity for our research.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities. Nevertheless, they still suffer from factual errors when tackling knowledge-intensive tasks. Retrieval-augmented reasoning represents a promising approach. However, significant challenges still persist, including inaccurate and insufficient retrieval for complex questions, as well as difficulty in integrating multi-source knowledge. To address this, we propose Beam Aggregation Reasoning (BeamAggR), a reasoning framework for knowledge-intensive multi-hop QA. BeamAggR explores and prioritizes promising answers at each hop of question. Concretely, we parse the complex questions into trees, which include atom and composite questions, followed by bottom-up reasoning. For atomic questions, the LLM conducts reasoning on multi-source knowledge to get answer candidates. For composite questions, the LLM combines beam candidates, explores multiple reasoning paths through probabilistic aggregation, and prioritizes the most promising trajectory. Extensive experiments on four open-domain multi-hop reasoning datasets show that our method significantly outperforms SOTA methods by 8.5%. Moreover, our analysis reveals that BeamAggR elicits better knowledge collaboration and answer aggregation",

    "abstract": "Minimum Bayes-Risk (MBR) decoding is shown to be a powerful alternative to beam search decoding for a wide range of text generation tasks.However, MBR requires a huge amount of time for inference to compute the MBR objective, which makes the method infeasible in many situations where response time is critical.Confidence-based pruning (CBP) (Cheng and Vlachos, 2023) has recently been proposed to reduce the inference time in machine translation tasks. Although it is shown to significantly reduce the amount of computation, it requires hyperparameter tuning using a development set to be effective.To this end, we propose Adaptive Minimum Bayes-Risk (AMBR) decoding, a hyperparameter-free method to run MBR decoding efficiently. AMBR is derived from the observation that the problem of computing the sample-based MBR objective is the \\textit{medoid identification problem}.AMBR uses the Correlated Sequential Halving (CSH) algorithm (Baharav and Tse, 2019), the algorithm with the best performance guarantee to date for the medoid identification problem, to compute the sample-based MBR objective.We evaluate AMBR on machine translation, text summarization, and image captioning tasks. The results show that AMBR achieves on par with CBP, with CBP selecting hyperparameters through an Oracle for each given computation budget",

    "abstract": "Understanding the interplay between emotions in language and user behaviors is critical. We study how moral emotions shape political participation of users based on cross-cultural online petition data. To quantify moral emotions, we employ a context-aware NLP model that is designed to capture the subtle nuances of emotions across cultures. For model training, we construct and share a moral emotion dataset comprising 50,000 petition sentences in Korean and English along with emotion labels annotated by a fine-tuned LLM. We examine two distinct types of user participation: general support (i.e., registered signatures of petitions) and active support (i.e., sharing petitions on social media). We discover that moral emotions like other-suffering increase both forms of participation and help petitions go viral, while self-conscious have the opposite effect. The most prominent moral emotion, other-condemning, led to polarizing responses among the audience. In contrast, other-praising was perceived differently by culture; it led to a rise in active support in Korea but a decline in the UK. Our findings suggest that both moral emotions embedded in language and cultural perceptions are critical in engaging the public in political discourse",

In the training phase, the agent leverages the trajectory contrastive information to update its policy. This iterative process of exploration and training facilitates further improvement for the agents.

Yet even with the correct groundings in the reference, they can ignore them and rely on wrong groundings or their inherent biases to hallucinate when users, being largely unaware of the specifics of the stored information, pose questions that might not directly correlate with the retrieved groundings. In this work, we formulate this knowledge alignment problem and introduce MixAlign, a framework that interacts with both the human user and the knowledge base to obtain and integrate clarifications on how the user question relates to the stored information. MixAlign employs a language model to achieve automatic knowledge alignment and, if necessary, further enhances this alignment through human user clarifications. Experimental results highlight the crucial role of knowledge alignment in boosting model performance and mitigating hallucination, with improvements noted up to 22.2% and 27.1% respectively.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Recent research in zero-shot Relation Extraction (RE) has concentrated on employing Large Language Models (LLMs) as extractors, owing to their notable zero-shot capabilities. By directly prompting the LLM or transforming the task into a Question Answering (QA) problem, the LLM can efficiently extract relations from a given sample. However, current methods often exhibit suboptimal performance, primarily due to the lack of detailed and context-specific prompts necessary for effectively understanding the variety of sentences and relations. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Self-Prompting framework, a novel method designed to fully harness the embedded RE knowledge within LLMs. Specifically, our framework employs a three-stage diversity approach to prompt LLMs, generating multiple synthetic samples that encapsulate specific relations from scratch. These generated samples act as in-context learning samples, offering explicit and context-specific guidance to efficiently prompt LLMs for RE. Experimental evaluations conducted on benchmark datasets have demonstrated the superiority of our approach over existing LLM-based zero-shot RE methods. Furthermore, our experiments highlight the effectiveness of our generation pipeline in producing high-quality synthetic data that significantly enhances performance",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Event Causality Identification (ECI) aims at determining whether there is a causal relation between two event mentions. Conventional prompt learning designs a prompt template to first predict an answer word and then maps it to the final decision. Unlike conventional prompts, we argue that predicting an answer word may not be a necessary prerequisite for the ECI task. Instead, we can first make a deterministic assumption on the existence of causal relation between two events and then evaluate its rationality to either accept or reject the assumption. The design motivation is to try the most utilization of the encyclopedia-like knowledge embedded in a pre-trained language model. In light of such considerations, we propose a deterministic assumption prompt learning model, called DAPrompt, for the ECI task. In particular, we design a simple deterministic assumption template concatenating with the input event pair, which includes two masks as predicted events' tokens. We use the probabilities of predicted events to evaluate the assumption rationality for the final event causality decision.

We compare QE-fusion against beam search and recent reranking techniques, such as Minimum Bayes Risk decoding or QE-reranking. Our method consistently improves translation quality in terms of COMET and BLEURT scores when applied to large language models (LLMs) used for translation (PolyLM, XGLM, Llama2, Mistral, ALMA and Tower) and to multilingual translation models (NLLB), over five language pairs. Notably, QE-fusion exhibits larger improvements for LLMs due to their ability to generate diverse outputs. We demonstrate that our approach generates novel translations in over half of the cases and consistently outperforms other methods across varying numbers of candidates (5–200). Furthermore, we empirically establish that QE-fusion scales linearly with the number of candidates in the pool",

To this end, we introduce TaskBench to evaluate the capability of LLMs in task automation.

In each round, given an input prefixed by task instructions and several exemplars, the generator produces an output.

However, existing methods like GAR and EAR rely heavily on supervised training and often struggle to maintain effectiveness across domains and datasets. Meanwhile, although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated QE capability for information retrieval (IR) tasks, their application in OpenQA is hindered by the inadequate analysis of query's informational needs and the lack of quality control for generated QEs, failing to meet the unique requirements of OpenQA. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel LLM-based QE approach named AGR for the OpenQA task, leveraging a three-step prompting strategy. AGR begins with an analysis of the query, followed by the generation of answer-oriented expansions, and culminates with a refinement process for better query formulation. Extensive experiments on four OpenQA datasets reveal that AGR not only rivals in-domain supervised methods in retrieval accuracy, but also outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in out-domain zero-shot scenarios. Moreover, it exhibits enhanced performance in end-to-end QA evaluations, underscoring the superiority of AGR for OpenQA",

    "title": "Generalizable Chain-of-Thought Prompting in Mixed-task Scenarios with Large Language Models",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have unveiled remarkable reasoning capabilities by exploiting chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, which generates intermediate reasoning chains to serve as the rationale for deriving the answer. However, current CoT methods either simply employ general prompts such as Let's think step by step, or heavily rely on pre-defined task-specific demonstrations to attain preferable performances, thereby engendering an inescapable gap between performance and generalization. To bridge this gap, we propose GeM-CoT, a Generalizable CoT prompting mechanism in Mixed-task scenarios where the type of input questions is unknown. GeM-CoT first categorizes the question type and subsequently samples or constructs demonstrations from the corresponding data pool in an automatic pattern. With this technical design, GeM-CoT simultaneously enjoys superior generalization capabilities and remarkable performances on 10 public reasoning tasks and 23 BBH tasks",

In this paper, we propose a method to evaluate the response preference by using the output probabilities of response pairs under contrastive prompt pairs, which could achieve better performance on LLaMA2-7B and LLaMA2-13B compared to RLAIF. Based on this, we propose an automatic alignment method, Direct Large Model Alignment (DLMA). First, we use contrastive prompt pairs to automatically generate preference data. Then, we continue to evaluate the generated preference data using contrastive prompt pairs and calculate a self-rewarding score. Finally, we use the DPO algorithm to effectively align LLMs by combining this self-rewarding score. In the experimental stage, our DLMA method could surpass the RLHF method without relying on human-annotated preference data",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Supervised contrastive learning has shown impressive performance across multiple NLP tasks, enhancing model generalization by shortening the distance between semantic representations of samples in the same category and increasing the distance between those of different categories. For the task of response selection, directly calculating the similarity between context and response may lead to suboptimal model performance due to insufficient attention mechanism interaction, as compared to traditional full attention methods. To address this issue, we propose an innovative interactive supervised contrastive learning framework that transforms the problem of response selection from classification into a matching issue by introducing a special response named anchor response during training, effectively applying contrastive learning to this task. This framework not only combines the advantages of deep context interaction found in traditional methods but also leverages the strong generalization capability of contrastive learning. Additionally, we introduce a heuristic method for hard negative responses sampling, which significantly reduces the need for large numbers of negative samples in contrastive learning. Applying our method, the results obtained on three publicly available response selection datasets have reached the current state-of-the-art level",

To bridge the gap, we propose F-Eval, a bilingual evaluation benchmark to evaluate the fundamental abilities, including expression, commonsense and logic. The tasks in F-Eval include multi-choice objective tasks, open-ended objective tasks, reference-based subjective tasks and reference-free subjective tasks. For reference-free subjective tasks, we devise new evaluation methods, serving as alternatives to scoring by API models. We conduct evaluations on 13 advanced LLMs. Results show that our evaluation methods show higher correlation coefficients and larger distinction than other evaluators.

However, the non-parametric memory in semiparametric LMs has traditionally been treated as static storage unable to learn and separated from the internal flow of the parametric models to compress information, limiting scalability and efficiency. Based on recent interpretability theories of LMs, we claim that the non-parametric memory represented by $k$NN-LM is actually learnable, and conceptualize it as Mixture-of-Neighbors Induction Memory (MoNIM), which synergizes the induction capabilities of MHSA layers with the memorization strength of FFN layers. We integrate MoNIM into Transformer architecture as a pluggable FFN-like layer, positioned parallel to the final FFN layer, to show that it learns (or compresses data) as part of parametric models does. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoNIM is a scalable continual learner in both data- and model-wise, enhancing the scalability and continual learning performance of semiparametric LMs",

We address a theoretical puzzle about the relationship between these objectives.

On the other hand, quality assessment researchers often suggest that accuracy and fluency are highly correlated and difficult for human raters to distinguish (Callison-Burch et al., 2007). We show that the tension between these views is an instance of Simpson's paradox, and that accuracy and fluency are positively correlated at the level of the corpus but trade off at the level of individual source sentences. We further suggest that the relationship between accuracy and fluency is best evaluated at the sentence level, and that the trade off between these dimensions has implications both for assessing translation quality and developing improved machine translation systems",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) inevitably exhibit hallucinations since the accuracy of generated texts cannot be secured solely by the parametric knowledge they encapsulate. Although retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a practicable complement to LLMs, it relies heavily on the relevance of retrieved documents, raising concerns about how the model behaves if retrieval goes wrong. To this end, we propose the Corrective Retrieval Augmented Generation (CRAG) to improve the robustness of generation. Specifically, a lightweight retrieval evaluator is designed to assess the overall quality of retrieved documents for a query, returning a confidence degree based on which different knowledge retrieval actions can be triggered. Since retrieval from static and limited corpora can only return sub-optimal documents, large-scale web searches are utilized as an extension for augmenting the retrieval results. Besides, a decompose-then-recompose algorithm is designed for retrieved documents to selectively focus on key information and filter out irrelevant information in them. CRAG is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly coupled with various RAG-based approaches. Experiments on four datasets covering short- and long-form generation tasks show that CRAG can significantly improve the performance of RAG-based approaches",

However, our work for the first time reveals the acceleration may be vulnerable to \\textit{Denial-of-Service} (DoS) attacks. In this paper, we propose \\textit{No-Skim}, a general framework to help the owners of skimming-based LLM to understand and measure the efficiency robustness of their acceleration scheme. Specifically, our framework searches minimal and unnoticeable perturbations to generate adversarial inputs that sufficiently increase the remaining token ratio, thus increasing the computation cost and energy consumption. With no direct access to the model internals, we further devise a time-based approximation algorithm to infer the remaining token ratio as the loss oracle. We systematically evaluate the vulnerability of the skimming acceleration in various LLM architectures including BERT and RoBERTa on the GLUE benchmark. In the worst case, the perturbation found by \\textit{No-Skim} substantially increases the running cost of LLM by over 106\\% on average",

    "abstract": "Commonsense reasoning is crucial for connecting premises to hypotheses by leveraging implicit world knowledge. The XCopa dataset, spanning 11 languages, serves as a benchmark for evaluating cross-lingual transfer capabilities in commonsense reasoning and emphasizes the importance of tapping into implicit knowledge for effective communication in diverse linguistic contexts. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Llama2, have made remarkable progress in Causal Commonsense Reasoning, setting new benchmarks. However, multilingual LLMs like XGLM and PolyLM face challenges due to smaller training datasets compared to English-centric LLMs. This work introduces a novel evaluation strategy, G-Evaluation, in the XCopa dataset. While this strategy resulted in decreased accuracy metrics across models, Llama2 showed improved performance, highlighting its adaptability. Despite efforts, multilingual XCopa models still fall behind their English counterparts in accuracy. Models like Llama2 exhibit performance variations across languages, underscoring the need for bridging this gap with Machine Translation (MT). To address this, we propose XTools, a strategy that combines Machine Translation and Automatic Post-Editing tools. By implementing XTools, multilingual accuracy can be elevated to 89.6\\%, aligning with English performance. Our contributions include redefining the evaluation method with G-Evaluation, introducing XTools for enhancing multilingual capabilities, validating Automatic Post-Editing Tool integration, and showcasing the potential of lightweight models in improving overall performance",

Recent major milestones have successfully decoded cognitive signals like functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalogram (EEG) into text under open vocabulary setting. However, how to split the datasets for training, validating, and testing in brain-to-text decoding still remains controversial. Additionally, the issue of data contamination observed in prior research persists. In this study, we undertake a comprehensive analysis on current dataset splitting strategies and discover that data contamination significantly overstates the performance of models. Specifically, first we find the leakage of test subjects' cognitive signals corrupts the training of a robust encoder. Second, we prove the leakage of text stimuli causes the auto-regressive decoder to memorize seen information in test set. To eliminate the influence of data contamination and fairly evaluate different models' generalization ability, we propose a new splitting method for different types of cognitive dataset (e.g. fMRI, EEG). We also evaluate the performance of SOTA brain-to-text decoding models under the proposed dataset splitting paradigm as baselines for further research",

To resolve these two issues, this paper introduces a novel approach named Multimodal Entity Linking with Dynamic Modality Selection and Interactive Prompt Learning (DSMIP). First, we design three expert networks that utilize different subsets of modalities to tackle the task and train them individually. In particular, for the multimodal expert network, we extract multimodal features of entities and mentions by updating multimodal prompts and set up a coupling function to realize the interaction of prompts between modalities. Subsequently, to select the best-suited expert network for each specific sample, we devise a Modality Selection Gating Network to gain the optimal one-hot selection vector by applying a specialized reparameterization technique and a two-stage training. Experimental results on three public benchmark datasets demonstrate that our solution outperforms the majority of state-of-the-art baselines and surpasses all baselines in settings with low training resources",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Tool learning is widely acknowledged as a foundational approach or deploying large language models (LLMs) in real-world scenarios. While current research primarily emphasizes leveraging tools to augment LLMs, it frequently neglects emerging safety considerations tied to their application. To fill this gap, we present $ToolSword$, a comprehensive framework dedicated to meticulously investigating safety issues linked to LLMs in tool learning. Specifically, ToolSword delineates six safety scenarios for LLMs in tool learning, encompassing $malicious$ $queries$ and $jailbreak$ $attacks$ in the input stage, $noisy$ $misdirection$ and $risky$ $cues$ in the execution stage, and $harmful$ $feedback$ and $error$ $conflicts$ in the output stage. Experiments conducted on 11 open-source and closed-source LLMs reveal enduring safety challenges in tool learning, such as handling harmful queries, employing risky tools, and delivering detrimental feedback, which even GPT-4 is susceptible to. Moreover, we conduct further studies with the aim of fostering research on tool learning safety. The data will be released upon acceptance of the paper",

To address this issue, we introduce **TreeEval**, a benchmark-free evaluation method for LLMs that let a high-performance LLM host an irreproducible evaluation session and essentially avoids the data leakage. Moreover, this LLM performs as an examiner to raise up a series of questions under a topic with a tree planing strategy, which considers the current evaluation status to decide the next question generation and ensures the completeness and efficiency of the evaluation process. We evaluate $6$ models of different parameter sizes, including $7$B, $13$B, and $33$B, and ultimately achieved the highest correlation coefficient with AlpacaEval2.0 using only around $45$ questions.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in visual perception and understanding. However, these models also suffer from hallucinations, which limit their reliability as AI systems. We believe that these hallucinations are partially due to the models' struggle with understanding what they can and cannot perceive from images, a capability we refer to as self-awareness in perception. Despite its importance, this aspect of MLLMs has been largely unexplored in prior studies. The study in this paper aims to define and evaluate the self-awareness of MLLMs in perception. To do this, we first introduce the knowledge quadrant in perception, which helps define what MLLMs know and do not know about images. Using this framework, we propose a novel benchmark, the Self-Awareness in Perception for MLLMs (MM-SAP), specifically designed to assess this capability. We apply MM-SAP to a variety of popular MLLMs, offering a comprehensive analysis of their self-awareness and providing detailed insights. The experiment results reveal that current MLLMs possess limited self-awareness capabilities, pointing to a crucial area for future advancement in the development of reliable MLLMs",

Traversing this query grounds each inference step in KG facts while maintaining reasoning flow, combining the robust knowledge of KGs with the semantic reasoning of LLMs. Our approach synergistically integrates neural and symbolic reasoning to achieve hybrid reasoning capabilities.

Despite the promising performance of current PEFT methods, they present challenges in hyperparameter selection, such as determining the rank of LoRA or Adapter, or specifying the length of soft prompts. In addressing these challenges, we propose a novel approach to fine-tuning neural models, termed Representation EDiting (RED), which scales and biases the representation produced at each layer. RED substantially reduces the number of trainable parameters by a factor of $25,700$ compared to full parameter fine-tuning, and by a factor of $32$ compared to LoRA. Remarkably, RED achieves comparable or superior results to full parameter fine-tuning and other PEFT methods.Extensive experiments were conducted across models of varying architectures and scales, including RoBERTa, GPT-2, T5, and Llama-2, and the results demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of RED, positioning it as a promising PEFT approach for large neural models",

Our work diverges by fine-tuning a pre-trained BERT model to assess its efficacy in both text-only scenarios and when incorporating Japanese-specific stylistic features. Key findings reveal an 84% accuracy rate for identifying five authors using only text data, and a notable 82% accuracy with an expanded set of 80 authors, highlighting the potential of deep learning for managing larger author pools. However, the addition of stylistic features for a set of 25 authors resulted in reduced accuracy (53%). The study further achieved 97% accuracy in distinguishing Japanese speakers and 61% in nationality prediction.

Our study, focusing on safety-sensitive documents obtained through adversarial attacks, reveals significant disparities in the safety alignment of various NLP tasks. For instance, LLMs can effectively summarize malicious long documents but often refuse to translate them. This discrepancy highlights a previously unidentified vulnerability: attacks exploiting tasks with weaker safety alignment, like summarization, can potentially compromise the integrity of tasks traditionally deemed more robust, such as translation and question-answering (QA). Moreover, the concurrent use of multiple NLP tasks with lesser safety alignment increases the risk of LLMs inadvertently processing harmful content. We demonstrate these vulnerabilities in various safety-aligned LLMs, particularly Llama2 models, Gemini and GPT-4, indicating an urgent need for strengthening safety alignments across a broad spectrum of NLP tasks",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Knowledge Graph (KG) embeddings are essential for link prediction over KGs. Compared to triplets, hyper-relational facts consisting of a base triplet and an arbitrary number of key-value pairs, can better characterize real-world facts and have aroused various hyper-relational embedding techniques recently. Nevertheless, existing works seldom consider the ontology of KGs, which is beneficial to link prediction tasks. A few studies attempt to incorporate the ontology information, by either utilizing the ontology as constraints on entity representations or jointly learning from hyper-relational facts and the ontology. However, existing approaches mostly overlook the ontology hierarchy and suffer from the dominance issue of facts over ontology, resulting in suboptimal performance. Against this background, we propose a universal contrastive learning framework for hyper-relational KG embeddings ($\\textbf{HyperCL}$), which is flexible to integrate different hyper-relational KG embedding methods and effectively boost their link prediction performance. HyperCL designs relation-aware Graph Attention Networks to capture the hierarchical ontology and a concept-aware contrastive loss to alleviate the dominance issue. We evaluate HyperCL on three real-world datasets in different link prediction tasks. Experimental results show that HyperCL consistently boosts the performance of state-of-the-art baselines with an average improvement of 3.1-7.4% across the three datasets",

Despite this progress, there remains a notable lack of scholarly understanding of the processes by which LLMs engage with and analyze computational arguments. Classical studies have delved into the linguistic frameworks of arguments, encapsulating their essence within the realms of structural organization and logical coherence. Yet, it remains unclear whether LLMs utilize these recognized frameworks in addressing argument-related tasks. In an effort to illuminate this research void, our study introduces three hypotheses centered on the dynamics of claim, evidence and stance identification in argument mining tasks: 1) Omitting specific logical connectors in an argument does not change the implicit logical relationship, and LLMs can learn it from the modified context. 2) The importance of words or phrases in an argument is determined by the extent of implicit information they encapsulate, regardless of their individual components within the structure of the argument. 3) Removing crucial words or phrases from an argument alters the implicit logical relationship, making it impossible for LLMs to learn the original logic from the modified text.Through comprehensive assessments on the standard IAM dataset, it is revealed that information contained in the phrases within the argument has a greater impact on the understanding of the argument by large models, and the experiment results validate our hypothesis",

This paper first proposes a novel generative temporal knowledge graph question answering framework, GenTKGQA, which guides LLMs to answer temporal questions through two phases: Subgraph Retrieval and Answer Generation. First, we exploit LLM's intrinsic knowledge to mine temporal constraints and structural links in the questions without extra training, thus narrowing down the subgraph search space in both temporal and structural dimensions. Next, we design virtual knowledge indicators to fuse the graph neural network signals of the subgraph and the text representations of the LLM in a non-shallow way, which helps the open-source LLM deeply understand the temporal order and structural dependencies among the retrieved facts through instruction tuning.

    "abstract": "Biomedical Relation Extraction (Bio-RE) aims to recognize and classify the potential relations between various molecules and biomolecules. The main obstacle in Bio-RE is the scarcity of annotations especially in low-resource relation labels, thus the models cannot fully understand the connection between chemicals and diseases or drug-drug interactions. Existing works usually adopted data augmentation approaches to generate pseudo-annotated instances to alleviate the scarcity of annotations. However, the generated sentences largely ignore the semantic consistency of the biomedical domain and the logical coherence between biomolecules and diseases, causing a fatal phenomenon that the generated sentences introduce counterfactual information when learning the interactions between the drugs or diseases. To this end, this paper proposes a bio-notion-dedicated data augmentation approach that is able to measure intersections between biomedical relation notions and tokens of each instance to generate augmented data with semantic consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method could bring 5.61% F1 improvement over SoTA baseline methods on three benchmark Bio-RE datasets in terms of BLURB",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements have seen Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) surpassing general human capabilities in various tasks, approaching the proficiency level of human experts across multiple domains. With traditional benchmarks becoming less challenging for these models, new rigorous challenges are essential to gauge their advanced abilities. In this work, we present OlympiadBench, an Olympiad-level bilingual multimodal scientific benchmark, featuring 8,952 problems from Olympiad-level mathematics and physics competitions, including the Chinese college entrance exam. Each problem is detailed with expert-level annotations for step-by-step reasoning. Evaluating top-tier models on OlympiadBench, we implement a comprehensive assessment methodology to accurately evaluate model responses. Notably, the best-performing model, GPT-4V, attains an average score of 17.23\\% on OlympiadBench, with a mere 11.28\\% in physics, highlighting the benchmark rigor and the intricacy of physical reasoning. Our analysis orienting GPT-4V points out prevalent issues with hallucinations, knowledge omissions, and logical fallacies.

To tackle this issue, we propose $ToolEyes$, a fine-grained system tailored for the evaluation of the LLMs' tool learning capabilities in authentic scenarios. The system meticulously examines seven real-world scenarios, analyzing five dimensions crucial to LLMs in tool learning: $format$ $alignment$, $intent$ $comprehension$, $behavior$ $planning$, $tool$ $selection$, and $answer$ $organization$. Additionally, ToolEyes incorporates a tool library boasting approximately 600 tools, serving as an intermediary between LLMs and the physical world.

Structured pruning, offers an effective means to compress LLMs, thereby reducing storage costs and enhancing inference speed for more efficient utilization. In this work, we study data-efficient and resource-efficient structure pruning methods to obtain smaller yet still powerful models. Knowledge Distillation is well-suited for pruning, as the intact model can serve as an excellent teacher for pruned students. However, it becomes challenging in the context of LLMs due to memory constraints. To address this, we propose an efficient progressive Numerous-teacher pruning method (NutePrune). NutePrune mitigates excessive memory costs by loading only one intact model and integrating it with various masks and LoRA modules, enabling it to seamlessly switch between teacher and student roles. This approach allows us to leverage numerous teachers with varying capacities to progressively guide the pruned model, enhancing overall performance. Extensive experiments across various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of NutePrune. In LLaMA-7B zero-shot experiments, NutePrune retains 97.17% of the performance of the original model at 20% sparsity and 95.07% at 25% sparsity",

Current research predominantly emphasizes LLMs' capacity to utilize tools in well-structured environments while overlooking their stability when confronted with the inevitable noise of the real world. To bridge this gap, we introduce $RoTBench$, a multi-level benchmark for evaluating the robustness of LLMs in tool learning. Specifically, we establish five external environments, each featuring varying levels of noise (i.e., Clean, Slight, Medium, Heavy, and Union), providing an in-depth analysis of the model's resilience across three critical phases: tool selection, parameter identification, and content filling. Experiments involving six widely-used models underscore the urgent necessity for enhancing the robustness of LLMs in tool learning. For instance, the performance of GPT-4 even drops significantly from 80.00 to 58.10 when there is no substantial change in manual accuracy. More surprisingly, the noise correction capability inherent in the GPT family paradoxically impedes its adaptability in the face of mild noise. In light of these findings, we propose RoTTuning, a strategy that enriches the diversity of training environments to bolster the robustness of LLMs in tool learning",

In-context learning (ICL), a streamlined method, has shown potential in boosting these models' performance without modifying their underlying parameters, especially when supplied with suitable demonstrations. However, existing methods mainly choose demonstrations by comparing surface-level semantic similarities (e.g., based on embedding) and fall short of identifying the most fitting ones. This paper introduces the concept of a ``latent learningscape'', a more nuanced representation that describes the characteristic of the demonstrations. Building on this concept, we develop a results-driven approach to characterize the latent learningscape features of demonstrations, which then inform the creation of more effective prompts. Through comprehensive testing across datasets in arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks, our approach outperforms leading models, showing an average increase in scores by 7.4 percentage points",

With open-source pre-trained language models becoming widely available in the last couple of years, the weak supervision text classification domain has received renewed interest due to the potential for transfer learning. Recent weak supervision methods proposed using pre-trained language models have performed well against the popular WRENCH benchmark datasets (Zhang et al., 2021), demonstrating the capability of transfer learning. However, these methods use pre-trained language models that are computationally expensive to perform inference with and are unfeasible to finetune without specialized accelerated hardware. Methods that don't require fine-tuning often require repeated inference or large storage needs to achieve their results. In this paper, an alternative solution is proposed that uses a single inference step, has minimal storage and memory requirements, doesn't require accelerated hardware, and can provide competitive results to much more hardware-intensive methods",

We also implement distributed PCGU for large models. It is empirically shown, through quantitative and qualitative analyses, that negation via Task Vector method outperforms PCGU in debiasing with minimum deterioration in performance and perplexity of the models.

To study the ability of LLMs to comply with format specifications, we identify the concept of format faithfulness. Based on the formal definition and the detailed taxonomization of format faithfulness, we present FormatBench, a benchmark that covers full categories of format faithfulness in our taxonomy and a wide range of LLM application scenarios. Extensive experiments on FormatBench reveal that state-of-the-art LLMs can still have difficulties in generating basic structured output as instructed. To improve the format faithfulness of LLMs, we design and implement three adaptation approaches, namely format regulation, format tuning, and format refinement.

    "abstract": "Sentence Representation Learning (SRL) is a crucial task in Natural Language Processing (NLP), where contrastive Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) is currently a mainstream approach. However, the reasons behind its remarkable effectiveness remain unclear. Specifically, in other research fields, contrastive SSL shares similarities in both theory and practical performance with non-contrastive SSL (e.g., alignment & uniformity, Barlow Twins, and VICReg). However, in SRL, contrastive SSL outperforms non-contrastive SSL significantly. Therefore, two questions arise: First, what commonalities enable various contrastive losses to achieve superior performance in SRL? Second, how can we make non-contrastive SSL, which is similar to contrastive SSL but ineffective in SRL, effective? To address these questions, we start from the perspective of gradients and discover that four effective contrastive losses can be integrated into a unified paradigm, which depends on three components: the Gradient Dissipation, the Weight, and the Ratio. Then, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the roles these components play in optimization and experimentally demonstrate their significance for model performance. Finally, by adjusting these components, we enable non-contrastive SSL to achieve outstanding performance in SRL",

    "abstract": "Protecting privacy leakage in large language models remains a paramount challenge. In this paper, we reveal Privacy Seesaw in LLM privacy safeguarding, a phenomenon where measures to secure specific private information inadvertently heighten exposure risks for other privacy. Through comprehensive analysis, we identify the amount of targeted privacy data and the volume of edited privacy neurons as the two central triggers to this issue. To mitigate privacy seesaw, we propose Augmented Privacy Neuron Editing via Activation Patching (APNEAP), a novel framework designed to well balance model performance with privacy protection. The proposed APNEAP augments collected private data by automatically synthesizing new private data, which deactivates the first trigger to the privacy seesaw issue. Additionally, it adapts activation patching to privacy neuron editing for switching off the second trigger to the privacy seesaw problem. Experimental results show that the proposed APNEAP is capable of alleviating the privacy seesaw phenomenon and offers a more stable and reliable approach to privacy protection in LLMs than previous methods",

Due to the heavy cost associated with fine-tuning, fine-tuning-free methods have emerged, typically modifying LLM decoding with external auxiliary methods. However, these methods do not essentially enhance the LLM itself. In this paper, we rethink the derivation procedures of DPO, based on which we conversely build an instant scorer using the states of the LLM before and after In-context Learning (ICL). Accordingly, we propose a novel approach called In-Context Direct Preference Optimization (ICDPO). It enables LLMs to borrow the HPA capabilities from superior LLMs with ICL, generating well-aligned responses as estimated by the aforementioned instant scorer, thereby enhancing the final performance. ICDPO can be further enhanced with a two-stage retriever and an upgraded scorer, both offering benefits. Extensive experiments show its effectiveness, particularly in outperforming two fine-tuning-free baselines, and it exhibits competitiveness with SFT + LoRA.

Subsequently, we introduce an efficient pre-training strategy, continuing pre-training LLaMA2 to obtain the Ziya2 model. Ziya2 significantly outperforms LLaMA2 on all selected benchmarks and meets or exceeds the performance of representative open-source models of the same size. Upon analyzing the intermediate checkpoints, we find that different types of data vary in their efficiency in enhancing the performance of Ziya2. Thus, we define three data attributes and establish new data-centric scaling laws to illustrate how different data impacts LLMs. Finally, we arrive at two conclusions that improving the `Coherence' and `Readability' of the data provides a larger boost to the LLMs than improving the `Similarity' to the downstream tasks",

Different from previous works that only rely on one positive and hard negatives as candidate passages, we create dark examples that all have moderate relevance to the query by strengthening negatives and masking positives in the discrete space.

Then, we conduct extensive experiments with two fine-tuning methods, three LLM backbones, and 18 translation tasks across nine language pairs.

Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis of these LLMs tailored for DocMT, exploring aspects such as translation errors, discourse phenomena, training strategy, the scaling law of parallel documents, additional evaluation on recent test sets, and zero-shot crosslingual transfer.

Then, we align the domains via matching the label distributions and the representations.

However, these works consider the generated programs as an indivisible entity, which falls short for LLMs in debugging the programs, especially when the programs contain complex logic flows and data operations. In contrast, when human developers debug programs, they typically set breakpoints and selectively examine runtime execution information. The execution flow and the intermediate variables play a crucial role in the debugging process, yet they are underutilized in the existing literature on code generation. In this study, we introduce Large Language Model Debugger (LDB), a novel debugging framework that enables LLMs to refine their generated programs with the runtime execution information. Specifically, LDB segments the programs into basic blocks and tracks the values of intermediate variables after each block throughout the runtime execution. This allows LLMs to concentrate on simpler code units within the overall execution flow, verify their correctness against the task description block by block, and efficiently pinpoint any potential errors.

    "title": "Context Repair with Large Language Models for Document-level Neural Machine Translation",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Current neural machine translation models generate translation output sentence-by-sentence, where each translation procedure is carried out independently. This sentence-level decoding strategy results in an inherent issue of incoherence. Consequently, considerable effort has been dedicated to document-level machine translation to mitigate the incoherence problem. In this work, we propose a simple and effective technique to repair document context by leveraging the power of large language models. The document-level translation task is decomposed into a sentence-level translation task and a contextual information repair task. we first employ a conventional sentence-level translation model to generate sentence-level translation outputs. Then, we pair these outputs with their corresponding translation references to create few-shot examples. Finally, we utilize a large language model along with these few-shot examples to perform context repair for the test sentences. Experimental results on the Bilingual Web Books test set demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in document-context translation. Besides, the approach also works with other methods. Further analysis and human evaluation results indicate that the proposed approach outperforms the baseline model in terms of human preference",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the literary performance of hybrid text co-created by a professional author and a large language model (LLM), exemplified by the novel Pharmako-AI by K Allado-Mcdowell (2020). While pre-trained LLMs have gained particular popularity for their literary output such as poetry, recent studies suggest potential shortcomings in LLMs' literary performance. Benchmarking and assessing LLMs are important, because they improve LLMs' interpretability and transparency in various aspects, including literary performance. Computational linguistic assessments for hybrid text are relatively understudied, which motivates this study. From NLP perspective, we aim to characterize and evaluate the collaboration between a human writer and an LLM. Drawing on previous investigations of LLMs' creative capabilities, our study utilizes sentiment and similarity analyses to analyze Pharmako-AI's literary aspects, comparing human and LLMs generated text. Findings reveal nuanced sentiment patterns and higher sophistication in human-generated text. This indicates the distinctive nature of the hybrid text relative to a traditional work of fiction. Our study contributes to understanding the interplay between human and LLM contributions in literary collaboration",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly popular due to their ability to process and generate natural language. However, as they are trained on massive datasets of text, LLMs can also inherit harmful biases and produce outputs that are not aligned with human values. This paper explores two main approaches to LLM alignment: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) and contrastive learning-based methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each approach, highlighting the complexity and instability of RLHF compared to the simpler but potentially less robust DPO. With that in mind, we propose MPO (Mixed Preference Optimization), a novel method that combines the strengths of both approaches. Specifically, we introduce a data selection method that utilizes the score difference of a reward model and divides the data into two parts: an easy set and a hard set. We then propose a two-stage training procedure: first train DPO on the easy dataset, and then train PPO on the difficult set with DPO model being the reference model. Experiments are conducted on two public alignment datasets, namely HH-RLHF and TLDR, demonstrating the effectiveness of MPO, both in terms of GPT4 evaluation and human evaluation",

    "abstract": "Recent work has uncovered promising ways to extract well-calibrated confidence estimates from language models (LMs), in which the model's confidence score reflects its prediction accuracy. However, while an LM may be well-calibrated on multiple domains combined, it can be significantly miscalibrated within each domain (e.g., overconfidence in math balances out underconfidence in history). In order to attain well-calibrated confidence estimates for each slice of the distribution, we propose a new framework for few-shot slice-specific recalibration. Specifically, we train a recalibration model that takes in a few unlabeled examples from a given slice and predicts the slice-specific precision scores at various confidence thresholds. Our trained model can recalibrate for new slices, without using any labeled data from that slice. This helps us identify domain-specific confidence thresholds above which the LM's predictions can be trusted, and below which it should abstain. Experiments show that our few-shot recalibrator consistently outperforms existing calibration methods, for instance improving calibration error for PaLM2-Large on MMLU by 16%, as compared to temperature scaling",

    "abstract": "As natural language becomes the default interface for human-AI interaction, there is a critical need for LMs to appropriately communicate uncertainties in downstream applications. In this work, we investigate how LMs incorporate confidence about their responses via natural language and how downstream users behave in response to LM-articulated uncertainties. We examine publicly deployed models and find that LMs are reluctant to express uncertainties when answering questions even when they produce incorrect responses. LMs can be explicitly prompted to express confidences, but tend to be overconfident, resulting in high error rates (an average of 47%) among confident responses. We test the risks of LM overconfidence by conducting human experiments and show that users rely heavily on LM generations, whether or not they are marked by certainty. Lastly, we investigate the preference-annotated datasets used in post training alignment and find that humans have a bias against texts with uncertainty.

    "abstract": "Most language model pre-training frameworks concatenate multiple documents into fixed-length sequences and use \\emph{causal masking} to compute the likelihood of each token given its context; this strategy is widely adopted due to its simplicity and efficiency. However, to this day, the influence of the pre-training sequence composition strategy on the generalisation properties of the model remains under-explored. In this work, we find that applying causal masking can lead to the inclusion of distracting information from previous documents during pre-training, which negatively impacts the performance of the models on language modelling and downstream tasks. In \\emph{intra-document causal masking}, the likelihood of each token is only conditioned on the previous tokens in the same document, which eliminates potential distracting information from previous documents and significantly improves the performance. Furthermore, we find that concatenating related documents can reduce some potential distractions during pre-training, and our proposed efficient retrieval-based sequence construction method, \\textsc{Bm25}Chunk, can improve in-context learning (+11.6\\%), knowledge memorisation (+9.8\\%), and context utilisation (+7.2\\%) abilities of language models without sacrificing efficiency",

We evaluate CAA's effectiveness on Llama 2 Chat using multiple-choice behavioral question datasets and open-ended generation tasks. We demonstrate that CAA significantly alters model behavior, is effective over and on top of traditional methods like finetuning and system prompt design, and minimally reduces capabilities. Moreover, we gain deeper insights into CAA's mechanisms by employing various activation space interpretation methods.

We investigate three LLMs and three methods of detecting synthetic texts (log-likelihood, DetectGPT, and supervised classification), finding that they all perform better than human raters, but they are all impractical in the real world (requiring either access to token likelihood information or a large dataset of CFM texts). We also explore the possibility of creating a proxy CFM: an LLM fine-tuned on a similar dataset to one used by the real 'content farm'. We find that even a small amount of fine-tuning data suffices for creating a successful detector, but we need to know which base LLM is used, which is a major challenge.

Despite their ability to generate diverse subnetworks without retraining, the quality of these subnetworks is not guaranteed due to weight sharing. In NLP tasks like machine translation and pre-trained language modeling, there is a significant performance gap between supernet and training from scratch for the same model architecture, necessitating retraining post optimal architecture identification.This study introduces a solution called mixture-of-supernets, a generalized supernet formulation leveraging mixture-of-experts (MoE) to enhance supernet model expressiveness with minimal training overhead. Unlike conventional supernets, this method employs an architecture-based routing mechanism, enabling indirect sharing of model weights among subnetworks. This customization of weights for specific architectures, learned through gradient descent, minimizes retraining time, significantly enhancing training efficiency in NLP. The proposed method attains state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance in NAS for fast machine translation models, exhibiting a superior latency-BLEU tradeoff compared to HAT, the SoTA NAS framework for machine translation.

Nowadays, to tackle increasingly more complex tasks, Transformer-based models are stretched to enormous sizes, requiring increasingly larger training datasets, and unsustainable amount of compute resources. The ubiquitous nature of the Transformer and its core component, the attention mechanism, are thus prime targets for efficiency research. In this work, we propose an alternative compatibility function for the self-attention mechanism introduced by the Transformer architecture. This compatibility function exploits an overlap in the learned representation of the traditional scaled dot-product attention, leading to a symmetric with pairwise coefficient dot-product attention. When applied to the pre-training of BERT-like models, this new symmetric attention mechanism reaches a score of 79.36 on the GLUE benchmark against 78.74 for the traditional implementation, leads to a reduction of 6% in the number of trainable parameters, and reduces the number of training steps required before convergence by half",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive abilities in generating unstructured natural language according to instructions. However, their performance can be inconsistent when tasked with producing text that adheres to specific structured formats, which is crucial in applications like named entity recognition (NER) or relation extraction (RE). To address this issue, this paper introduces an efficient method, G&O, to enhance their structured text generation capabilities. It breaks the generation into a two-step pipeline: initially, LLMs generate answers in natural language as intermediate responses. Subsequently, LLMs are asked to organize the output into the desired structure, using the intermediate responses as context. G&O effectively separates the generation of content from the structuring process, reducing the pressure of completing two orthogonal tasks simultaneously. Tested on zero-shot NER and RE, the results indicate a significant improvement in LLM performance with minimal additional efforts. This straightforward and adaptable prompting technique can also be combined with other strategies, like self-consistency, to further elevate LLM capabilities in various structured text generation tasks",

    "title": "LaRS: Latent Reasoning Skills for Chain-of-Thought Reasoning",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a popular in-context learning (ICL) approach for large language models (LLMs), especially when tackling complex reasoning tasks. Traditional ICL approaches construct prompts using examples that contain questions similar to the input question. However, CoT prompting, which includes crucial intermediate reasoning steps (rationales) within its examples, necessitates selecting examples based on these rationales rather than the questions themselves. Existing methods require human experts or pre-trained LLMs to describe the skill, a high-level abstraction of rationales, to guide the selection. These methods, however, are often costly and difficult to scale. Instead, this paper introduces a new approach named Latent Reasoning Skills (LaRS) that employs unsupervised learning to create a latent space representation of rationales, with a latent variable called a reasoning skill. Concurrently, LaRS learns a reasoning policy to determine the required reasoning skill for a given question. Then the ICL examples are selected by aligning the reasoning skills between past examples and the question. Our approach is theoretically grounded and sample-efficient, eliminating the need for helper LLM inference or manual prompt design. Empirically, LaRS achieves performance comparable to SOTA rationale-based selection methods, saving thousands of LLM inferences and significantly reducing the time required to process the example bank",

Despite significant progress in Natural Language Processing across various domains, its application in detecting dehumanizing language is limited, largely due to the scarcity of publicly available annotated data for this domain. This paper evaluates the performance of cutting-edge NLP models, including GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and LLAMA-2, in identifying dehumanizing language. Our findings reveal that while these models demonstrate potential, achieving a 70\\% accuracy rate in distinguishing dehumanizing language from broader hate speech, they also display biases. They are over-sensitive in classifying other forms of hate speech as dehumanization for a specific subset of target groups, while more frequently failing to identify clear cases of dehumanization for other target groups. Moreover, leveraging one of the best-performing models, we automatically annotated a larger dataset for training more accessible models. However, our findings indicate that these models currently do not meet the high-quality data generation threshold necessary for this task",

However, it remains challenging for a machine learning model to incorporate context, data scarcity, data imbalance and other aspects in thematic analysis. We employed transfer learning, combining the pre-trained models BERT and ResNet to propose an annotation assistance model and evaluated its accuracy and efficiency for semi-automatic annotation. We experimented on a dataset of focus group discussions between researchers and participants on perception towards robots in public spaces. We tested various training methods, including few-shot learning, data augmentation, and the use of different data modalities, to evaluate the impact of dataset size, data balance, and data modality on the proposed annotation assistance model's performance. The best-performing model achieved an average balanced accuracy of 59.89% for predicting thematic labels in researcher sentences and 48.67% for participant sentences",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "The widespread use of Text-to-Image (T2I) models in content generation requires careful examination of their safety, including their robustness to adversarial attacks. Despite extensive research on adversarial attacks, the reasons for their effectiveness remain underexplored. This paper presents an empirical study on adversarial attacks against T2I models, focusing on analyzing factors associated with attack success rates (ASR). We introduce a new attack objective - entity swapping using adversarial suffixes and two gradient-based attack algorithms. Human and automatic evaluations reveal the asymmetric nature of ASRs on entity swap: for example, it is easier to replace \"human\" with \"robot\" in the prompt \"a human dancing in the rain.\" with an adversarial suffix, but the reverse replacement is significantly harder. We further propose probing metrics to establish indicative signals from the model's beliefs to the adversarial ASR. We identify conditions that result in a success probability of 60% for adversarial attacks and others where this likelihood drops below 5%",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Despite the remarkable strides of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various fields, the wide applications of LLMs on edge devices are limited due to their massive parameters and computations. To address this, quantization is commonly adopted to generate lightweight LLMs with efficient computations and fast inference. However, Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) methods dramatically degrade in quality when quantizing weights, activations, and KV cache together to below 8 bits. Besides, many Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) works quantize model weights, leaving the activations untouched, which do not fully exploit the potential of quantization for inference acceleration on the edge. In this paper, we propose EdgeQAT, the Entropy and Distribution Guided QAT for the optimization of lightweight LLMs to achieve inference acceleration on Edge devices. We first identify that the performance drop of quantization primarily stems from the information distortion in quantized attention maps, demonstrated by the different distributions in quantized query and key of the self-attention mechanism. Then, the entropy and distribution guided QAT is proposed to mitigate the information distortion. Moreover, we design a token importance-aware adaptive method to dynamically quantize the tokens with different bit widths for further optimization and acceleration. Our extensive experiments verify the substantial improvements with our framework across various datasets. Furthermore, we achieve an on-device speedup of up to 2.37x compared with its FP16 counterparts across multiple edge devices, signaling a groundbreaking advancement",

Despite the recent success, the current development of voice LLMs in low-resource applications is hampered by data scarcity and high computational cost. In this work, we propose VoiceTuner, with a self-supervised pre-training and efficient fine-tuning approach for low-resource voice generation. Specifically, 1) to mitigate data scarcity, we leverage large-scale unlabeled dataset and pre-train VoiceTuner-SSL without pre-defined applications, which can be fine-tuned in downstream tasks; 2) to further reduce the high training cost in complete fine-tuning, we introduce a multiscale adapter to effectively update around only 1% parameters as a plug-and-play module; and 3) to alleviate the challenges of modeling long audio tokens inherited from inefficient attention mechanism, we introduce VoiceTuner-Mamba with multiscale state space models in place of transformers. Experimental results demonstrate that VoiceTuner-SSL presents strong acoustic continuations.

    "abstract": "Large diffusion models have been successful in text-to-audio (T2A) synthesis tasks, but they often suffer from common issues such as semantic misalignment and poor temporal consistency due to limited natural language understanding and data scarcity. Additionally, 2D spatial structures widely used in T2A works lead to unsatisfactory audio quality when generating variable-length audio samples since they ignore the time-frequency structure in the mel-spectrogram. To address these challenges, we propose TETA, a latent diffusion-based T2A method. Our approach includes several techniques to improve semantic alignment and temporal consistency: Firstly, we use pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to parse the text into structured <event \\& order> pairs for better temporal information capture. We also introduce another structured-text encoder to aid in learning semantic alignment during the diffusion denoising process. To improve the performance of variable length generation and enhance the temporal information extraction, we design a feed-forward Transformer-based diffusion denoiser. Finally, we use LLMs to augment and transform a large amount of audio-label data into audio-text datasets to alleviate the problem of scarcity of temporal data. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms baseline models in both objective and subjective metrics, and achieves significant gains in temporal information understanding, semantic consistency, and sound quality.

    "abstract": "Do LMs infer the semantics of text from co-occurrence patterns in their training data? Merrill et al. (2022) argue that, in theory, probabilities predicted by an optimal LM encode semantic information about entailment relations, but it is unclear whether neural LMs trained on corpora learn entailment in this way because of strong idealizing assumptions made by Merrill et al. In this work, we investigate whether their theory can be used to decode entailment judgments from neural LMs. We find that a test similar to theirs can decode entailment relations between natural sentences, well above random chance, though not perfectly, across many datasets and LMs. This suggests LMs implicitly model aspects of semantics to predict semantic effects on sentence co-occurrence patterns. However, we find the test that predicts entailment in practice works in the opposite direction to the theoretical test. We thus revisit the assumptions underlying the original test, finding its derivation did not adequately account for redundancy in human-written text. We argue that correctly accounting for redundancy related to *explanations* might derive the observed flipped test and, more generally, improve linguistic theories of human speakers",

    "abstract": "Direct preference optimization (DPO) is a successful fine-tuning strategy for aligning large language models with human preferences without the need to train a reward model or employ reinforcement learning. DPO, as originally formulated, relies on binary preference data and fine-tunes a language model to increase the likelihood of a preferred response over a dispreferred response. However, not all preference pairs are equal: while in some cases the preferred response is only slightly better than the dispreferred response, there can be a stronger preference for one response when, for example, the other response includes harmful or toxic content. In this paper, we propose a generalization of DPO, termed DPO with an offset (ODPO), that does not treat every preference pair equally during fine-tuning. Intuitively, ODPO requires the difference between the likelihood of the preferred and dispreferred response to be greater than an offset value. The offset is determined based on the extent to which one response is preferred over another. Our experiments on various tasks suggest that ODPO significantly outperforms DPO in aligning language models, especially when the number of preference pairs is limited",

We achieve this by generating semantically relevant labels as children connected to the existing branches, creating a deeper taxonomy that better overlaps with the input texts. We leverage the enriched hierarchy to perform Zero-Shot Hierarchical Classification by using the Upward score Propagation technique. We test our method on four public datasets, obtaining new state-of-the art results on three of them.

    "abstract": "Recently, pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive abilities in generating codes from natural language descriptions, repairing buggy codes, translating codes between languages, and retrieving relevant code segments. However, the evaluation of these models has often been performed in a scattered way on only one or two specific tasks, in a few languages, at a partial granularity (e.g., function) level, and in many cases without proper training data. Even more concerning is that in most cases the evaluation of generated codes has been done in terms of mere lexical overlap with a reference code rather than actual execution. We introduce *xCodeEval*, the largest executable multilingual multitask benchmark to date consisting of $25$M document-level coding examples ($16.5$B tokens) from about $7.5$K unique problems covering up to $11$ programming languages with execution-level parallelism. It features a total of $7$ tasks involving code understanding, generation, translation and retrieval. *xCodeEval* adopts an execution-based evaluation and offers a multilingual code execution engine, \\texttt{ExecEval} that supports unit test based execution in all the $11$ languages.

As data-driven methods, existing factor mining models can be categorized into symbol-based and neural-based models. Symbol-based models are interpretable but inefficient, while neural-based approaches are efficient but lack interpretability. Hence, mining interpretable factors effectively presents a significant challenge. Inspired by the success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various tasks, we propose a FActor Mining Agent (FAMA) model that enables LLMs to integrate the strengths of both neural and symbolic models for factor mining. In this paper, FAMA consists of two main components:Cross-Sample Selection (CSS) and Chain-of-Experience (CoE). CSS addresses the homogeneity challenges in LLMs during factor mining by assimilating diverse factors as in-context samples, whereas CoE enables LLMs leverage past successful mining experiences, expediting the mining of effective factors.

LiBS is an inference-time procedure that is NMT-model agnostic and does not require any additional parallel data.

To help reduce the manual efforts in completing and validating the affected-package field, existing work proposes to automatically identify this information.

VulLibGen conducts supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) to supply domain knowledge to the LLM, and a local search technique to ensure that the generated name of an affected package is among the names of the packages under consideration. Our evaluation results show that VulLibGen has an average accuracy of 0.806 for identifying vulnerable packages in the four most popular ecosystems in GitHub Advisory (Java, JS, Python, Go) while the best SOTA ranking approaches achieve only 0.721.

To promote the CGEC field to better adapt to the era of LLMs, we rethink the roles of LLMs in the CGEC task so that they can be better utilized and explored in CGEC. Considering the rich grammatical knowledge stored in LLMs and their powerful semantic understanding capabilities, we utilize LLMs as explainers to provide explanation information for the CGEC small models during error correction to enhance performance. We also use LLMs as evaluators to bring more reasonable CGEC evaluations, thus alleviating the troubles caused by the subjectivity of the CGEC task.

To address this issue, we propose Multi-Passage to Dialogue (MP2D), a data generation framework that automatically creates conversational question-answering datasets with natural topic transitions.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in various natural language processing areas, but they demand high computation resources which limits their deployment in realworld. Distillation is one technique to solve this problem through either knowledge distillation or task distillation. Both distillation approaches train small models to imitate specific features of LLMs, but they all neglect basic reading education for small models on generic texts that are unrelated to downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose basic reading distillation (BRD) which educates a small model to imitate LLMs basic reading behaviors, such as named entity recognition, question raising and answering, on each sentence. After such basic education, we apply the small model on various tasks including language inference benchmarks and BIG-Bench-Hard tasks. It shows that the small model can outperform or perform comparable to over 20x bigger LLMs. Probing analysis reveals that our small model gains strengthened abilities layerwisely, leading to better performances across various tasks",

    "abstract": "This study introduces the Semantic Textual Similarity Pseudo-Label Semi-Supervised Clustering (STSPL-SSC) framework. The STSPL-SSC framework is designed to tackle the prevalent issue of scarce labeled data by combining a Semantic Textual Similarity Pseudo-Label Generation process with a Robust Contrastive Learning module. The process begins with employing k-means clustering on embeddings for initial pseudo-Label allocation. Then we use a Semantic Text Similarity-enhanced module to supervise the secondary clustering of pseudo-labels using labeled data to better align with the real clustering centers. Subsequently, an Adaptive Optimal Transport (AOT) approach fine-tunes the pseudo-labels. Finally, a Robust Contrastive Learning module is employed to foster the learning of classification and instance-level distinctions, aiding clusters to better separate. Experiments conducted on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that with just one label per class, clustering performance can be significantly improved, outperforming state-of-the-art models with an increase of 1-6% in both accuracy and normalized mutual information, approaching the results of fully-labeled classification",

Despite the impressive language generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs), there has been limited research on how LLMs can effectively learn the popularity of text to better engage the public. Therefore, we introduce a novel approach called Response-augmented Popularity-Aligned Language Model (RePALM), which aligns language generation with popularity by leveraging insights from augmented auto-responses provided by readers. We utilize the Proximal Policy Optimization framework with a dual-reward mechanism to jointly optimize for the popularity of the quote tweet and its consistency with the auto-responses.

Nevertheless, some of these benchmarks are not naturally generated by LLMs but are intentionally induced. Also, many merely focus on the factuality hallucination while ignoring the faithfulness hallucination. Additionally, although dialogue pattern is more widely utilized in the era of LLMs, current benchmarks only concentrate on sentence-level and passage-level hallucination. In this study, we propose DiaHalu, the first dialogue-level hallucination evaluation benchmark to our knowledge. Initially, we integrate the collected topics into system prompts and facilitate a dialogue between two ChatGPT3.5. Subsequently, we manually modify the contents that do not adhere to human language conventions and then have LLMs re-generate, simulating authentic human-machine interaction scenarios. Finally, professional scholars annotate all the samples in the dataset. DiaHalu covers four common multi-turn dialogue domains and five hallucination subtypes, extended from factuality and faithfulness hallucination. Experiments through some well-known LLMs and detection methods on the dataset show that DiaHalu is a challenging benchmark, holding significant value for further research",

    "abstract": "Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is crucial for enhancing their utility in terms of helpfulness, truthfulness, safety, harmlessness, and interestingness. Existing methods for achieving this alignment often involve employing reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to fine-tune LLMs based on human labels assessing the relative quality of model responses. Nevertheless, RLHF is susceptible to instability during fine-tuning and presents challenges in implementation. Drawing inspiration from the emerging field of representation engineering (RepE), this study aims to identify relevant representations for high-level human preferences embedded in patterns of activity within an LLM and achieve precise control of model behavior by transforming its representations. This novel approach, denoted as Representation Alignment from Human Feedback (RAHF), proves to be effective, computationally efficient, and easy to implement. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of RAHF in not only capturing but also manipulating representations to align with a broad spectrum of human preferences or values, rather than being confined to a singular concept or function (e.g. honesty or bias). RAHF's versatility in accommodating diverse human preferences shows its potential for advancing LLM performance",

Consequently, RE2 demonstrates strong generality and compatibility with most thought-eliciting prompting methods, including CoT. Crucially, RE2 facilitates a \"bidirectional\" encoding in unidirectional decoder-only LLMs because the first pass could provide global information for the second pass. We begin with a preliminary empirical study as the foundation of RE2, illustrating its potential to enable \"bidirectional\" attention mechanisms. We then evaluate RE2 on extensive reasoning benchmarks across 14 datasets, spanning 112 experiments, to validate its effectiveness and generality. Our findings indicate that, with the exception of a few scenarios on vanilla ChatGPT, RE2 consistently enhances the reasoning performance of LLMs through a simple re-reading strategy. Further analyses reveal RE2's adaptability, showing how it can be effectively integrated with different LLMs, thought-eliciting prompting, and ensemble strategies",

Additionally, we introduce an extra training objective aimed at maximizing the similarity between the compressed graph text and the ground-truth summary at the node level. Our approach utilizes an innovative method for constructing text graphs to tackle the challenges of applying graph structures in multi-document scenarios. With a base PRIMERA model, our method shows superior performance compared to previous state-of-the-art models on the Multi-news, Multi-XScience and Wikisum datasets",

    "abstract": "This study introduces EventRL, a reinforcement learning approach that significantly enhances the event extraction capabilities of large language models (LLMs). EventRL addresses the challenges of instruction following and hallucination by introducing outcome supervision, which provides direct feedback on the accuracy of event extraction. The method employs specialized reward functions—Argument-F1, Average-F1, and Product-F1—to guide the model's training and improve its understanding of event structures. Our experiments on the ACE05 dataset, which includes both Held-in Test (for seen event types) and Held-out Test (for unseen event types), demonstrate that EventRL outperforms Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Few-Shot Prompting (FSP) (based on GPT4) methods for event extraction. The results further show that EventRL is particularly effective in handling unseen event types, and that the choice of reward function and the inclusion of code data can significantly improve event extraction performance",

    "abstract": "Despite their impressive capabilities, large language models (LLMs) have been observed to generate responses that include inaccurate or fabricated information, a phenomenon commonly known as ``hallucination''. In this work, we propose a simple \\textit{Induce-then-Contrast} Decoding (ICD) strategy to alleviate hallucinations. We first construct a factually weak LLM by inducing hallucinations from the original LLMs. Then, we penalize these induced hallucinations during decoding to enhance the factuality of the generated content. Concretely, we determine the final next-token predictions by amplifying the predictions from the original model and downplaying the induced untruthful predictions via contrastive decoding. Experimental results on both discrimination-based and generation-based hallucination evaluation benchmarks, such as TruthfulQA and \\textsc{FActScore}, demonstrate that our proposed ICD methods can effectively enhance the factuality of LLMs across various model sizes and families. For example, when equipped with ICD, Llama2-7B-Chat and Mistral-7B-Instruct achieve performance comparable to ChatGPT and GPT4 on TruthfulQA, respectively",

Specifically, factuality can significantly impact various benchmark characteristics especially when benchmarks are related to knowledge domain, and initial data quality plays a critical role, whereas the number of learning steps has a lesser impact.Additionally, we noted that once the language model is trained with a dataset contaminated by noise, restoring its original performance becomes exceptionally challenging, verging on irreversible",

    "abstract": "The remarkable advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have not rendered them immune to challenges, particularly in the context of handling deceptive information in prompts, thus producing hallucinated responses under such conditions. To quantitatively assess this vulnerability, we present MAD-Bench, a carefully curated benchmark that contains 850 test samples divided into 6 categories, such as non-existent objects, count of objects, spatial relationship, and visual confusion. We provide a comprehensive analysis of popular MLLMs, ranging from GPT-4V, Gemini-Pro, to open-sourced models, such as LLaVA-1.5 and CogVLM. Empirically, we observe significant performance gaps between GPT-4V and other models; and previous robust instruction-tuned models, such as LRV-Instruction and LLaVA-RLHF, are not effective on this new benchmark. While GPT-4V achieves 75.02% accuracy on MAD-Bench, accuracy of any other model in our experiments ranges from 5% to 35%. We further propose a remedy that adds an additional paragraph to the deceptive prompts to encourage models to think twice before answering the question. Surprisingly, this simple method can even double the accuracy; however, the absolute numbers are still too low to be satisfactory. We hope MAD-Bench can serve as a valuable benchmark to stimulate further research to enhance models' resilience against deceptive prompts",

    "abstract": "Instruction tuning for large language models (LLMs) can drive them to produce results consistent with human goals in specific downstream tasks. However, the process of continual instruction tuning (CIT) for LLMs may bring about the catastrophic forgetting (CF) problem, where previously learned abilities are degraded. Recent methods try to alleviate the CF problem by modifying models or replaying data, which may only remember the surface-level pattern of instructions and get confused on held-out tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel continual instruction tuning method based on Key-part Information Gain (KPIG). Our method computes the information gain on masked parts to dynamically replay data and refine the training objective, which enables LLMs to capture task-aware information relevant to the correct response and alleviate overfitting to general descriptions in instructions. In addition, we propose two metrics, P-score and V-score, to measure the generalization and instruction-following abilities of LLMs. Experiments demonstrate our method achieves superior performance on both seen and held-out tasks",

We introduce a simple yet effective framework to accelerate text generation in such languages. Our approach involves employing a new language model head with a vocabulary set tailored to a specific target language for a pre-trained LLM. This is followed by fine-tuning the new head while incorporating a verification step to ensure the model's performance is preserved. We show that this targeted fine-tuning, while freezing other model parameters, effectively reduces token fragmentation for the target language.

To generate task-based zero-shot classifiers, we train a hypernetwork that receives class descriptions and outputs a multi-class model. The hypernetwork is designed to be equivariant with respect to the set of descriptions and the classification layer, thus obeying the symmetries of the problem and improving generalization. Our approach generates non-linear classifiers and can handle rich textual descriptions. We evaluate this approach in a series of zero-shot classification tasks, for image, point-cloud, and action recognition, using a range of text descriptions: From single words to rich descriptions. Our results demonstrate strong improvements over previous approaches, showing that zero-shot learning can be applied with little training data.Furthermore, we conduct an analysis with foundational vision and language models, demonstrating that they struggle to generalize when describing what attributes the class lacks",

Despite the integration of RAG, LLMs may still present unsupported or contradictory claims to the retrieved contents. In order to develop effective hallucination prevention strategies under RAG, it is important to create benchmark datasets that can measure the extent of hallucination. This paper presents RAGTruth, a corpus tailored for analyzing word-level hallucinations in various domains and tasks within the standard RAG frameworks for LLM applications. RAGTruth comprises nearly 18,000 naturally generated responses from diverse LLMs using RAG. These responses have undergone meticulous manual annotations at both the individual case and word levels, incorporating evaluations of hallucination intensity. We not only benchmark hallucination frequencies across different LLMs, but also critically assess the effectiveness of several existing hallucination detection methodologies. We show that using a high-quality dataset such as RAGTruth, it is possible to finetune a relatively small LLM and achieve a competitive hallucination detection performance when compared to the existing prompt-based approaches using state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-4. Furthermore, the finetuned model can effectively mitigate hallucination in LLM responses",

Language models employing cross-encoding demonstrate satisfactory performance in STS, yet their effectiveness significantly diminishes in C-STS. In this work, we argue that the failure of cross-encoding language models in C-STS is not due to their inability to extract effective features, but rather because they extract an excessive number of features, thereby diluting the impact of condition-relevant features. To alleviate this, we propose Self-Augmentation via Self-Reweighting, which does not require the introduction of any external auxiliary information. Instead, it amplifies the impact of condition-relevant features and suppresses condition-irrelevant features through model's intrinsic information. The self-reweighted outputs are used as a self-augmentation signal to enhance the model's original outputs. On the C-STS test set, our proposed method consistently improves the performance of all fine-tuning baseline models (up to around 3 points). Remarkably, it even enables models with smaller parameter scales to surpass the performance of zero-shot and few-shot prompted large language models (such as GPT-4) with substantially larger parameter scales",

To response to these, in this work, we propose a Hybrid Alignment Training (HBAT) approach, based on alternating alignment and modified elastic weight consolidation methods. The basic idea is to alternate between different objectives during alignment training, so that better collaboration can be achieved between the two alignment tasks.

Prior research attempts to mitigate backdoor learning while training the LMs on the poisoned dataset, yet struggles against complex backdoor attacks in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we investigate the learning mechanisms of backdoor LMs in the frequency space by Fourier analysis. Our findings indicate that the backdoor mapping presented on the poisoned datasets exhibits a more discernible inclination towards lower frequency compared to clean mapping, resulting in the faster convergence of backdoor mapping.

Experimental results demonstrate that MuScleLoRA outperforms baselines significantly. Notably, MuScleLoRA reduces the average success rate of diverse backdoor attacks to below 15\\% across multiple datasets and generalizes to various backbone LMs, including BERT, RoBERTa, and Llama2.

To prevent privacy leakage, researchers have investigated word-level perturbations, relying on the formal guarantees of differential privacy (DP) in the embedding space. However, many existing approaches either achieve unsatisfactory performance in the high privacy regime when using the Laplacian or Gaussian mechanism, or resort to weaker relaxations of DP that are inferior to the canonical DP in terms of privacy strength. This raises the question of whether a new method for private word embedding can be designed to overcome these limitations. In this paper, we propose a novel private embedding method called the high dimensional truncated Laplacian mechanism. Specifically, we introduce a non-trivial extension of the truncated Laplacian mechanism, which was previously only investigated in one-dimensional space cases. Theoretically, we show that our method has a lower variance compared to the previous private word embedding methods. To further validate its effectiveness, we conduct comprehensive experiments on private embedding and downstream tasks using three datasets. Remarkably, even in the high privacy regime, our approach only incurs a slight decrease in utility compared to the non-private scenario",

Nevertheless, akin to their linguistic counterparts, these models are susceptible to various hallucinations. In this paper, we focus on a new form of hallucination, specifically termed as number hallucination, which denotes instances where models fail to accurately identify the quantity of objects in an image. We establish a dataset and employ evaluation metrics to assess number hallucination, revealing a pronounced prevalence of this issue across mainstream large vision language models (LVLMs). Additionally, we delve into a thorough analysis of number hallucination, examining inner and outer inconsistency problem from two related perspectives. We assert that this inconsistency is one cause of number hallucination and propose a consistency training method as a means to alleviate such hallucination",

Our primary objective is to cultivate the counterfactual thought processes within LLMs and rigorously assess these processes for their validity.

In this task, LLMs must adeptly alter a given argumentative text to uphold a predetermined logical relationship. To effectively evaluate a generation model's counterfactual capabilities, we propose an innovative evaluation metric, the decomposed Self-Evaluation Score (SES) to directly evaluate the natural language output of LLMs instead of modeling the task as a multiple-choice problem. Analysis shows that the proposed automatic metric aligns well with human preference. Our experimental results show that while LLMs demonstrate a notable capacity for logical counterfactual thinking, there remains a discernible gap between their current abilities and human performance.

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of social media, the wide dissemination of fake news on social media is increasingly threatening both individuals and society. In the dynamic landscape of social media, fake news detection aims to develop a model trained on news reporting past events. The objective is to predict and identify fake news about future events, which often relate to subjects entirely different from those in the past. However, existing fake detection methods exhibit a lack of robustness and cannot generalize to unseen events. To address this, we introduce Future ADaptive Event-based Fake news Detection (FADE) framework. Specifically, we train a target predictor through an adaptive augmentation strategy and graph contrastive learning to make more robust overall predictions. Simultaneously, we independently train an event-only predictor to obtain biased predictions. Then we further mitigate event bias by obtaining the final prediction by subtracting the output of the event-only predictor from the output of the target predictor. Encouraging results from experiments designed to emulate real-world social media conditions validate the effectiveness of our method in comparison to existing state-of-the-art approaches",

While attention has been paid to the collection and composition of datasets, determining the data sampling strategy in training remains an open question.

Specifically, ClusterClip Sampling utilizes data clustering to reflect the data distribution of the training set and balances the common samples and rare samples during training based on the cluster results.

Recent studies introduce LLM-based evaluators that operate as reference-free metrics, demonstrating their capability to adeptly handle novel tasks. However, these models generally rely on a single-agent approach, which, we argue, introduces an inherent limit to their performance. This is because there exist biases in LLM agent's responses, including preferences for certain text structure or content. In this work, we propose DEBATE, an NLG evaluation framework based on multi-agent scoring system augmented with a concept of Devil's Advocate. Within the framework, one agent is instructed to criticize other agents' arguments, potentially resolving the bias in LLM agent's answers. DEBATE substantially outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods in two meta-evaluation benchmarks in NLG evaluation, SummEval and TopicalChat. We also show that the extensiveness of debates among agents and the persona of an agent can influence the performance of evaluators",

    "abstract": "In the current environment, psychological issues are prevalent and widespread, with social media serving as a key outlet for individuals to share their feelings. This results in the generation of vast quantities of data daily, where negative emotions have the potential to precipitate crisis situations. There is a recognized need for models capable of efficient analysis. While pre-trained language models have demonstrated their effectiveness broadly, there's a noticeable gap in pre-trained models tailored for specialized domains like psychology. To address this, we have collected a huge dataset from Chinese social media platforms and enriched it with publicly available datasets to create a comprehensive database encompassing 3.36 million text entries. To enhance the model's applicability to psychological text analysis, we integrated psychological lexicons into the pre-training masking mechanism. Building on an existing Chinese language model, we performed adaptive training to develop a model specialized for the psychological domain. We assessed our model's effectiveness across four public benchmarks, where it not only surpassed the performance of standard pre-trained models but also showed a inclination for making psychologically relevant predictions. Due to concerns regarding data privacy, the dataset will not be made publicly available.

Moreover, no explicit framework has been explored to guide the dialogue, which results in some useless communications that affect the experience.

However, the reliability of LLMs in combining these two capabilities into reasoning through multi-hop facts has not been widely explored. This paper systematically investigates the possibilities for LLMs to utilize shortcuts based on direct connections between the initial and terminal entities of multi-hop knowledge. We first explore the existence of factual shortcuts through Knowledge Neurons, revealing that: (i) the strength of factual shortcuts is highly correlated with the frequency of co-occurrence of initial and terminal entities in the pre-training corpora; (ii) few-shot prompting leverage more shortcuts in answering multi-hop questions compared to chain-of-thought prompting. Then, we analyze the risks posed by factual shortcuts from the perspective of multi-hop knowledge editing. Analysis shows that approximately 20% of the failures are attributed to shortcuts, and the initial and terminal entities in these failure instances usually have higher co-occurrences in the pre-training corpus. Finally, we propose erasing shortcut neurons to mitigate the associated risks and find that this approach significantly reduces failures in multiple-hop knowledge editing caused by shortcuts.

To address these problems, we propose a knowledge-aware fine-tuning (KnowTuning) method to explicitly and implicitly improve the knowledge awareness of LLMs. We devise an explicit knowledge-aware generation stage to train LLMs to explicitly identify knowledge triples in answers. We also propose an implicit knowledge-aware comparison stage to train LLMs to implicitly distinguish between reliable and unreliable knowledge, in three aspects: completeness, factuality, and logicality. Extensive experiments on both generic and medical question answering (QA) datasets confirm the effectiveness of KnowTuning, through automatic and human evaluations, across various sizes of LLMs. Finally, we demonstrate that the improvements of KnowTuning generalize to unseen QA datasets",

However, when it comes to multi-choice machine reading comprehension (MMRC), solely learning from the rationales generated by the teacher model for correct options overlooks educational significance of understanding the reasons behind incorrect options. In education, metacognition requires individuals to actively identify errors when reading to deepen their understanding. To this end, we propose a novel framework for achieving metacognitive symbolic distillation. Initially, we prompt the teacher large language model (LLM) to generate rationales for each option in the MMRC dataset. Subsequently, the student model could be fine-tuned based on the MMRC data equipped with these rationales. Our experiments on two MMRC datasets demonstrate that our approach effectively enhances the performance of the small model compared with standard fine-tuned models and symbolic distilled models. Moreover, when the student model is large enough, upgrading the teacher model can lead to further improvements. We will make our code and data publicly available",

InferAligner utilizes safety steering vectors extracted from safety-aligned model to modify the activations of the target model when responding to harmful inputs, thereby guiding the target model to provide harmless responses.

However, many studies have highlighted that the model's performance is sensitive to the choice of demonstrations, presenting a significant challenge for practical applications where we lack prior knowledge of user queries. Consequently, we need to construct an extensive demonstration pool and incorporate external databases to assist the model, leading to considerable time and financial costs. In light of this, some recent research has shifted focus towards zero-shot ICL, aiming to reduce the model's reliance on external information by leveraging their inherent generative capabilities. Despite the effectiveness of these approaches, the content generated by the model may be unreliable, and the generation process is time-consuming. To address these issues, we propose Demonstration Augmentation for In-context Learning (DAIL), which employs the model's previously predicted historical samples as demonstrations for subsequent ones. DAIL brings no additional inference cost and does not rely on the model's generative capabilities. Our experiments reveal that DAIL can significantly improve the model's performance over direct zero-shot inference and can even outperform few-shot ICL without any external information",

However, it has a clear drawback: many soft tokens must be inserted into the input sequences to guarantee downstream performance. As a result, soft prompt tuning is less considered than Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) in the large language modeling (LLM) era. In this work, we propose a novel prompt tuning method, \\underline{I}nstruction-\\underline{A}ware \\underline{P}rompt \\underline{T}uning (IAPT), that requires only four soft tokens. First, we install a parameter-efficient soft prompt generator at each Transformer layer to generate idiosyncratic soft prompts for each input instruction. The generated soft prompts can be seen as a semantic summary of the input instructions and can effectively guide the output generation. Second, the soft prompt generators are modules with a bottleneck architecture consisting of a self-attention pooling operation, two linear projections, and an activation function. Pilot experiments show that prompt generators at different Transformer layers require different activation functions. Thus, we propose to learn the idiosyncratic activation functions for prompt generators automatically with the help of rational functions. We have conducted experiments on various tasks, and the experimental results demonstrate that (a) our IAPT method can outperform the recent baselines with comparable tunable parameters.

    "abstract": "Fact verification aims to automatically probe the veracity of a claim based on several pieces of evidence. Existing works are always engaging in accuracy improvement, let alone explainability, a critical capability of fact verification systems.Constructing an explainable fact verification system in a complex multi-hop scenario is consistently impeded by the absence of a relevant, high-quality dataset. Previous datasets either suffer from excessive simplification or fail to incorporate essential considerations for explainability. To address this, we present EX-FEVER, a pioneering dataset for multi-hop explainable fact verification. With over 60,000 claims involving 2-hop and 3-hop reasoning, each is created by summarizing and modifying information from hyperlinked Wikipedia documents. Each instance is accompanied by a veracity label and an explanation that outlines the reasoning path supporting the veracity classification. Additionally, we demonstrate a novel baseline system on our EX-FEVER dataset, showcasing document retrieval, explanation generation, and claim verification, and validate the significance of our dataset. Furthermore, we highlight the potential of utilizing Large Language Models in the fact verification task. We hope our dataset could make a significant contribution by providing ample opportunities to explore the integration of natural language explanations in the domain of fact verification",

    "abstract": "Eye movements in reading reveal humans' cognitive processes during language understanding. As such, the time a reader's eyes dwell on a token has been utilized as a measure for the visual attention paid to that word, or the importance of that word to the reader. This study investigates the alignment of the importance attributed to input tokens by language models (LMs) on the one hand and humans, in the form of fixation durations, on the other hand. While previous research on the internal processes of LMs have employed the models' attention weights, recent studies have argued in favor of gradient-based methods. Moreover, previous approaches to interpret LMs' internals with human gaze have neglected the tasks readers performed during reading, even though psycholinguistic research underlines that reading patterns are task-dependent. We thus introduce a novel approach that employs a gradient-based saliency method designed to emulate task-specific human reading strategies to align model and human importance, and we find that task specificity plays a crucial role in this alignment",

To overcome this limitation, we introduce a new type of GM watermark, the Logits-Addition watermark, as well as three variants that aim to enhance diversity, particularly the GumbelSoft watermark (i.e., the softmax variant of the Logits-Addition watermark). When assessed for detectability in high diversity settings, our Gumbelsoft demonstrates superior performance, with its AUROC score exceeding those of the two alternative variants by a margin of 0.1 to 0.3 and outperforming other decoding-based watermarking methods by a minimum of 0.1",

Nevertheless, the common practice of indiscriminately mixing instruction-following data from various tasks may result in suboptimal overall performance due to different instruction formats and knowledge domains across tasks. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel Comprehensive Task Balancing (CoTBal) algorithm for multi-task visual instruction tuning of LMMs. To our knowledge, this is the first work that explores multi-task optimization in visual instruction tuning. Specifically, we consider two key dimensions for task balancing: (1) Inter-Task Contribution, the phenomenon where learning one task potentially enhances the performance in other tasks, attributable to the overlapping knowledge domains, and (2) Intra-Task Difficulty, which refers to the learning difficulty within a single task. By quantifying these two dimensions with performance-based metrics, task balancing is thus enabled by assigning more weights to tasks that offer substantial contributions to others, receive minimal contributions from others, and also have great intra-task difficulties. Experiments show that our CoTBal leads to superior overall performance in multi-task visual instruction tuning",

To enhance the quality of draft tokens, a self-distillation method is integrated. This early-exiting design not only reduces deployment and training costs but also significantly accelerates the token generation speed. Moreover, we introduce a novel sampling mechanism that leverages Thompson Sampling to regulate the generation processes, automatically determining the quantity of draft tokens in each round. The original LLM is then employed to validate these draft tokens through a single forward pass, and thus guarantees that the final output text maintains a distribution consistent with vanilla auto-regressive decoding.

    "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frame work is showing state-of-the-art performance on open-domain question answering tasks by referencing external knowledge. However, the RAG system faces challenges with performance degradation when it is fed contexts of low relevance or when the relative relevance among the input contexts is inaccurately assessed. In this work, we propose a RE-RAG framework that injects an explicit context relevance estimator (RE) into the RAG system. RE-RAG re-evaluates the retrieved contexts with the proposed context RE and passes the more relevant contexts along with their measure importance to the generator. To train context RE, we propose an unsupervised learning method, which does not utilize any labeled document ranking data to train the context RE. To examine the efficacy of RE-RAG, we examine its performance on Natural Questions and TriviaQA datasets. RE-RAG achieves on-par performance compared to the FiD variants while utilizing fewer contexts (0.25x). We show that the proposed context RE, which was trained with the T5 model, is also applicable to RAG with LLMs(ChatGPT) by improving the performance on NQ (+6.4EM) and TQA (+2.8EM), respecitvely. Lastly, we display that RE can add interpretability to RAG framework as RE score highly correlates with the RE-RAG accuracy. Consequently, RE can be utilized to filter out unanswerable scenarios where context does not contain answers with 38.9%-51.3% accuracy just by examining a set of retrieved contexts",

    "title": "SEER: Facilitating Structured Reasoning and Explanation via Reinforcement Learning",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Elucidating the reasoning process with structured explanations from question to answer is crucial, as it significantly enhances the interpretability, traceability, and trustworthiness of question-answering (QA) systems. However, structured explanations demand models to perform intricately structured reasoning, which poses great challenges. Most existing methods focus on single-step reasoning through supervised learning, ignoring logical dependencies between steps. Moreover, existing reinforcement learning (RL) based methods overlook the structured relationships, underutilizing the potential of RL in structured reasoning. In this paper, we propose SEER, a novel method that maximizes a structure-based return to facilitate structured reasoning and explanation. Our proposed structure-based return precisely describes the hierarchical and branching structure inherent in structured reasoning, effectively capturing the intricate relationships between different reasoning steps. In addition, we introduce a fine-grained reward function to meticulously delineate diverse reasoning steps. Extensive experiments show that SEER significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an absolute improvement of 6.9% over RL-based methods on EntailmentBank, a 4.4% average improvement on STREET benchmark, and exhibiting outstanding efficiency and cross-dataset generalization performance",

To address this gap, we introduce GATE X-E, an extension to the GATE (Rarrick et al., 2023) corpus, that consists of human translations from Turkish, Hungarian, Finnish, and Persian into English. Each translation is accompanied by feminine, masculine, and neutral variants. The dataset, which contains between 1250 and 1850 instances for each of the four language pairs, features natural sentences with a wide range of sentence lengths and domains, challenging translation rewriters on various linguistic phenomena. Additionally, we present a translation gender rewriting solution built with GPT-4 and use GATE X-E to evaluate it. We open source our contributions to encourage further research on gender debiasing",

As LLM-driven agents learn to negotiate and act like real humans, how to evaluate agents' bargaining abilities remains an open problem.For the first time, we formally described the Bargaining task as an asymmetric incomplete information game, defining the gains of the Buyer and Seller in multiple bargaining processes. It allows us to quantitatively assess an agent's performance in the Bargain task.We collected a real product price dataset, AmazonHistoryPrice, and conducted evaluations of various LLM agents' bargaining abilities. We find that playing a Buyer is much harder than a Seller, and increasing model size can not effectively improve the Buyer's performance.To address the challenge, we propose a novel approach called OG-Narrator that integrates a deterministic Offer Generator to control the price range of Buyer's offers, and an LLM Narrator to create natural language sentences for generated offers.Experimental results show that OG-Narrator improves the buyer's deal rates from 26.67% to 88.88% and brings a ten times of multiplication of profits on all baselines, even a model that has not been aligned",

However, the lack of publicly available benchmark datasets and the over-reliance on manually defined rules for webshell escape sample generation have slowed down the progress of research related to webshell escape sample generation and artificial intelligence-based webshell detection. To address the drawbacks of weak webshell sample escape capabilities, the lack of webshell datasets with complex malicious features, and to promote the development of webshell detection, we propose the Hybrid Prompt algorithm for webshell escape sample generation with the help of large language models. As a prompt algorithm specifically developed for webshell sample generation, the Hybrid Prompt algorithm not only combines various prompt ideas including Chain of Thought, Tree of Thought, but also incorporates various components such as webshell hierarchical module and few-shot example to facilitate the LLM in learning and reasoning webshell escape strategies. Experimental results show that the Hybrid Prompt algorithm can work with multiple LLMs with excellent code reasoning ability to generate high-quality webshell samples with high Escape Rate ($88.61\\%$ with GPT-4 model on VIRUSTOTAL detection engine) and Survival Rate ($54.98\\%$ with GPT-4 model)",

To address this, we introduce Observation-Driven Agent (ODA), a novel AI agent framework tailored for tasks involving KGs.

Confronting the exponential explosion of knowledge during observation, we innovatively design a recursive observation mechanism.

In this paper, we formulated a causal graph for ED and found that the mention surfaces can act as a shortcut, misleading the ED models to be biased towards common entities.

Prevailing benchmarks related to multi-modal reasoning attempt to assess MLLMs through yes/no or multi-choice questions, which by design can introduce position bias and overlook the intermediate reasoning process, thereby rendering the results less convincing. To this end, we systematically categorize the reasoning tasks into deductive, abductive and analogical reasoning, and introduce InfiMM-Eval, a manually curate benchmark featuring 279 diverse and nuanced reasoning questions across these categories. The questions are designed to be fully open-ended to better represent the characteristics of generative models. To mitigate the challenge of answering complex reasoning questions, we encourage models to generate intermediate reasoning steps. These steps are incorporated into the evaluation protocol to reduce bias towards plausible guesses or responses that lack definitive answers, while facilitating the assessment of more nuanced reasoning skills. This evaluation scheme closely resembles the method by which humans evaluate exams in real-world settings, enabling a more reliable assessment.

This paper investigates whether we can create high-quality grounded preference data for model alignment without using annotations from humans or large proprietary models.

Recently, the common model compression process involves obtaining a sparse LLM through pruning, followed by LoRA-finetuning. However, these methods often suffer from significant performance degradation. We attempted to address this by introducing additional teacher distillation, but found limited improvements due to the gap between the teacher and student models and constrained training iterations. To overcome these challenges, we propose Sparse KD, the first distillation framework specifically designed for sparse models in constrained fine-tuning scenarios. Our framework includes dynamic temperature, knowledge alignment, and Bayesian distillation optimization strategies. Dynamic temperature can adaptively align the strength of the teacher's knowledge, and the Knowledge Alignment Module can bridge the gap by projecting teacher-student knowledge to the same interval. Applying Bayesian optimization swiftly finds optimal settings based on these strategies, thereby improving model performance.

To address data scarcity, this paper proposes a new data collection pipeline. Specifically, we use GPT-4 to simulate a role-play between a suspect and a police officer. During interrogation, the suspect lies to the police officer to evade responsibility for the crime, while the police officer uncovers the truth and gathers evidence. Compared with previous datasets, this strategy reduces data collection costs, providing a promising way to increase the dataset size.

LLMs need to process and cross-reference entities and numbers, handle data inconsistencies and redundancies, and develop planning capabilities such as building a working memory for managing complex data queries. In this paper, we introduce four novel tasks centered around sports data analytics to evaluate the numerical reasoning and information fusion capabilities of LLMs. These tasks involve providing LLMs with detailed, play-by-play sports game descriptions, then challenging them with adversarial scenarios such as new game rules, longer durations, scrambled narratives, and analyzing key statistics in game summaries. We conduct extensive experiments on NBA and NFL games to assess the performance of LLMs on these tasks. Our benchmark, SportsMetrics, introduces a new mechanism for assessing LLMs' numerical reasoning and fusion skills",

    "abstract": "Users post numerous product-related questions on e-commerce platforms, affecting their purchase decisions. Product-related question answering (PQA) entails utilizing product-related resources to provide precise responses to users. We propose a novel task of Multilingual Cross-market Product-based Question Answering (MCPQA) and define the task as providing answers to product-related questions in a main marketplace by utilizing information from another resource-rich auxiliary marketplace in a multilingual context. We introduce a large-scale dataset comprising over 7 million questions from 17 marketplaces across 11 languages. We then perform automatic translation on the Electronics category of our dataset, naming it as McMarket. We focus on two subtasks: review-based answer generation and product-related question ranking. For each subtask, we label a subset of McMarket using an LLM and further evaluate the quality of the annotations via human assessment. We then conduct experiments to benchmark our dataset, using models ranging from traditional lexical models to LLMs in both single-market and cross-market scenarios across McMarket and the corresponding LLM subset. Results show that incorporating cross-market information significantly enhances performance in both tasks",

Overlooking this factor may cause the models to over-criticize themselves, resulting in unreliable conclusions regarding the efficacy of self-correction in LLMs. To address the over-criticism issue, we introduce an If-or-Else (IoE) prompting principle, which guides LLMs to judge themselves with intrinsic ``confidence'', enabling effective self-correction without relying on external feedback or human-annotated examples",

    "abstract": "The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has increasingly drawn attention to the use of LLMs for human-like planning. Existing work on LLM-based planning either focuses on leveraging the inherent language generation capabilities of LLMs to produce free-style plans, or employs reinforcement learning approaches to learn decision-making for a limited set of actions within restricted environments. However, both approaches exhibit significant discrepancies from the open and executable requirements in real-world planning. In this paper, we propose a new planning task--open grounded planning. The primary objective of open grounded planning is to ask the model to generate an executable plan based on a variable action set, thereby ensuring the executability of the produced plan. To this end, we establishes a benchmark for open grounded planning spanning a wide range of domains. Then we test current state-of-the-art LLMs along with five planning approaches, revealing that existing LLMs and methods still struggle to address the challenges posed by grounded planning in open domains. The outcomes of this paper define and establish a foundational dataset for open grounded planning, and shed light on the potential challenges and future directions of LLM-based planning",

We propose an evaluation methodology, an open-source code base for the MERA assessment, and a leaderboard with a submission system.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) excel in abstractive summarization tasks, delivering fluent and pertinent summaries. Recent advancements have extended their capabilities to handle long-input contexts, exceeding 100k tokens. However, in question answering, language models exhibit uneven utilization of their input context. They tend to favor the initial and final segments, resulting in a U-shaped performance pattern concerning where the answer is located within the input. This bias raises concerns, particularly in summarization where crucial content may be dispersed throughout the source document(s). Besides, in summarization, mapping facts from the source to the summary is not trivial as salient content is usually re-phrased. In this paper, we conduct the first comprehensive study on context utilization and position bias in summarization. Our analysis encompasses 5 LLMs, 10 datasets, and 5 evaluation metrics.

MLA-PLM adopts structural and semantic pre-training (SSP) to implement global relationship modeling, and point matching pre-training (PMP) to achieve alignment between visual points and textual points. LA-FA employs a layout-aware attention mask to realize point-guided cross-modal fusion for further boosting layout awareness of LANS. Extensive experiments on datasets Geometry3K and PGPS9K validate the effectiveness of the layout-aware modules and superior problem-solving performance of our LANS solver, over existing symbolic and neural solvers. The code will be made public available soon",

But it still faces challenges of resource consumption when scaling up to larger models. Previous studies employ pruning techniques by evaluating the importance of LoRA parameters for different layers to address the problem. However, these efforts only analyzed parameter features to evaluate their importance. Indeed, the output of LoRA related to the parameters and data is the factor that directly impacts the frozen model. To this end, we propose LoRA-drop which evaluates the importance of the parameters by analyzing the LoRA output. We retain LoRA for important layers and the LoRA of the other layers share the same parameters. Abundant experiments on NLU and NLG tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of LoRA-drop",

    "abstract": "Deductive reasoning plays a pivotal role in the formulation of sound and cohesive arguments. It allows individuals to draw conclusions that logically follow, given the truth value of the information provided. Recent progress in the domain of large language models (LLMs) has showcased their capability in executing deductive reasoning tasks. Nonetheless, a significant portion of research primarily assesses the accuracy of LLMs in solving such tasks, often overlooking a deeper analysis of their reasoning behavior. In this study, we draw upon principles from cognitive psychology to examine inferential strategies employed by LLMs, through a detailed evaluation of their responses to propositional logic problems. Our findings indicate that LLMs display reasoning patterns akin to those observed in humans, including strategies like $\\textit{supposition following}$ or $\\textit{chain construction}$. Moreover, our research demonstrates that the architecture and scale of the model significantly affect its preferred method of reasoning, with more advanced models tending to adopt strategies more frequently than less sophisticated ones. Importantly, we assert that a model's accuracy, that is the correctness of its final conclusion, does not necessarily reflect the validity of its reasoning process. This distinction underscores the necessity for more nuanced evaluation procedures in the field",

    "abstract": "Disentangled latent spaces usually have better semantic separability and geometrical properties, which leads to better interpretability and more controllable data generation. While this has been well investigated in Computer Vision, in tasks such as image disentanglement, in the NLP domain, sentence disentanglement is still comparatively under-investigated. Most previous work have concentrated on disentangling task-specific generative factors, such as sentiment, within the context of style transfer. In this work, we focus on a more general form of sentence disentanglement, targeting the localised modification and control of more general sentence semantic features. To achieve this, we contribute to a novel notion of sentence semantic disentanglement and introduce a flow-based invertible neural network (INN) mechanism integrated with a transformer-based language Autoencoder (AE) in order to deliver latent spaces with better separability properties. Experimental results demonstrate that the model can conform the distributed latent space into a better semantically disentangled sentence space, leading to improved language interpretability and controlled generation when compared to the recent state-of-the-art language VAE models",

Addressing these gaps, we propose PG-Video-LLaVA, the first LMM with pixel-level grounding capability, integrating audio cues by transcribing them into text to enrich video-context understanding.

    "abstract": "LLMs confront inherent limitations in terms of its knowledge, memory, and action. The retrieval augmentation stands as a vital mechanism to address these limitations, which brings in useful information from external sources to augment the LLM. However, existing retrieval methods encounter two pressing issues. On one hand, the general retrievers are not properly optimized for retrieval augmentation hence exhibit limited effectiveness; on the other hand, the task-specific retrievers excel in the targeted retrieval augmentation scenario, while lack the versatility to handle diverse scenarios. In this work, we propose LLM-Embedder for the unified support of diverse retrieval augmentation scenarios. Our method presents three technical contributions. Firstly, we introduce a new reward formulation, namely rank-aware reward. It exploits the ranking position of the desired output among N sampled outputs from the LLM, which leads to fine-grained and robust computation of reward from the LLM's feedback. Secondly, we design a novel distillation objective, called graded distillation. It incorporates both the absolute value and the relative order of the reward for more sufficient utilization of the LLM's feedback. Thirdly, we systematically optimize the multi-task learning, which effectively unifies the multiple retrieval functionalities into one model. In our experiment, LLM-Embedder substantially improves the LLM's performances in various downstream tasks, while introducing superior retrieval augmentation's effect over both general and task-specifc retrievers",

    "title": "Mitigating Reversal Curse via Semantic-aware Permutation Training",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "While large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across diverse tasks, recent studies showcase that causal LLMs suffer from the \"reversal curse\". It is a typical example that the model knows \"A's father is B\", but is unable to reason \"B's child is A\". This limitation poses a challenge to the advancement of artificial general intelligence (AGI), as it suggests a gap in the models' ability to comprehend and apply bidirectional reasoning. In this paper, we first conduct substantial evaluation and identify that the root cause of the reversal curse lies in the different word order between the training and inference stage, namely, the poor ability of causal language models to predict antecedent words within the training data. Accordingly, permutation on the training data is considered as a potential solution, since this can make the model predict antecedent words or tokens. However, previous permutation methods may disrupt complete phrases or entities, thereby posing challenges for the model to comprehend and learn from training data. To address this issue, we propose Semantic-aware Permutation Training (SPT), which addresses this issue by segmenting the training sentences into semantic units (i.e., entities or phrases) with an assistant language model and permuting these units before feeding into the model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SPT effectively mitigates the reversal curse since the performance on reversed questions approximates that on the forward ones, and significantly advances the performance of existing works",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional proficiency in instruction-following, becoming increasingly crucial across various applications. However, this capability brings with it the risk of prompt injection attacks, where attackers inject instructions into LLMs' input to elicit undesirable actions or content. Understanding the robustness of LLMs against such attacks is vital for their safe implementation. In this work, we establish a benchmark to evaluate the robustness of instruction-following LLMs against prompt injection attacks. Our objective is to determine (1) the extent to which LLMs can be influenced by injected instructions and (2) their ability to differentiate between these injected and original target instructions. Through extensive experiments with leading instruction-following LLMs, we uncover significant vulnerabilities in their robustness to such attacks. Our results indicate that some models are overly tuned to follow any embedded instructions in the prompt, overly focusing on the latter parts of the prompt without fully grasping the entire context. By contrast, models with a better grasp of the context and instruction-following capabilities will potentially be more susceptible to compromise by injected instructions. This underscores the need to shift the focus from merely enhancing LLMs' instruction-following capabilities to improving their overall comprehension of prompts and discernment of instructions that are appropriate to follow. We hope our in-depth analysis offers insights into the underlying causes of these vulnerabilities, aiding in the development of future solutions",

To quantify the effect, we propose CorrelationQA, the first benchmark that assesses the hallucination level given spurious images. This benchmark contains 7,308 text-image pairs across 13 categories. Based on the proposed CorrelationQA, we conduct a thorough analysis on 9 mainstream MLLMs, illustrating that they universally suffer from this instinctive bias to varying degrees.

This module retains the tokens with the highest top-$K$ attention weights and simultaneously rebuilds the discarded tokens, which may become essential for future decoding.Comprehensive experiments in natural language generation and natural language modeling task reveal that our method is not only competitive with full attention in terms of performance but also achieves a significant throughput improvement of up to $\\textbf{221.8\\%}$.The code for replication is available on the https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ADORE-5384",

In this work, we investigate how multilinguality during instruction tuning of a multilingual LLM affects instruction-following across languages from the pre-training corpus. We first show that many languages transfer some instruction-following capabilities to other languages from even monolingual tuning. Furthermore, we find that only 40 multilingual examples integrated in an English tuning set substantially improve multilingual instruction-following, both in seen and unseen languages during tuning. In general, we observe that models tuned on multilingual mixtures exhibit comparable or superior performance in multiple languages compared to monolingually tuned models, despite training on 10x fewer examples in those languages. Finally, we find that diversifying the instruction tuning set with even just 2-4 languages significantly improves cross-lingual generalization.

    "abstract": "Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are fundamental resources in knowledge-intensive tasks in NLP. Due to the limitation of manually creating KGs, KG Completion (KGC) has an important role in automatically completing KGs by scoring their links with KG Embedding (KGE). To handle many entities in training, KGE relies on Negative Sampling (NS) loss that can reduce the computational cost by sampling. Since the appearance frequencies for each link are at most one in KGs, sparsity is an essential and inevitable problem. The NS loss is no exception. As a solution, the NS loss in KGE relies on smoothing methods like Self-Adversarial Negative Sampling (SANS) and subsampling. However, it is uncertain what kind of smoothing method is suitable for this purpose due to the lack of theoretical understanding. This paper provides theoretical interpretations of the smoothing methods for the NS loss in KGE and induces a new NS loss, Triplet Adaptive Negative Sampling (TANS), that can cover the characteristics of the conventional smoothing methods. Experimental results of TransE, DistMult, ComplEx, RotatE, HAKE, and HousE on FB15k-237, WN18RR, and YAGO3-10 datasets and their sparser subsets show the soundness of our interpretation and performance improvement by our TANS",

However, in relation classification, only a subset of sentences in a document, known as evidence, is required to determine the relationship category of entity pairs. In this paper, we propose a prototype learning method with evidence match (PLEM). By introducing an evidence matching auxiliary task in the process of relation prototype construction, the model is guided to focus more on the semantics of evidence sentences when building prototypes, thereby enhancing the relation prototypes. We further design task-specific evidence prototypes, enabling the model to adapt to the evidence semantic space of different relation categories.

    "abstract": "Named entity recognition (NER) is a fundamental task in natural language processing and is widely implemented in natural language processing systems. Conventionally, the most common method for NER has been sequential labelling utilizing conditional random fields (CRFs). In recent years, span-based methods that input a group of multiple words and determine whether the input group is an NE have also been used. In this paper, we propose a span-based NER method that utilizes attention-based aggregation to combine information from multiple words into a single vector. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves a state-of-the-art performance for the WNUT-16 and WNUT-17 datasets commonly used in NER",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Recognizing emotions in conversations involves an internal cognitive process that interprets emotional cues by using a collection of past emotional experiences. However, many existing methods struggle to decipher emotional cues in dialogues due to their models' lack of capacity for cognitive reasoning. In this work, we introduce an innovative Detective Network (DetectiveNN), a novel model that is grounded in the cognitive theory of emotion and utilizes a \"recall-detect-predict\" framework to imitate human emotional reasoning. This process begins by `recalling' past interactions of a specific speaker to collect emotional cues. It then `detects' relevant emotional patterns by interpreting these cues in the context of the ongoing conversation. Finally, it `predicts' the speaker's emotional state in the next moment. Tested on three benchmark datasets, our approach outperforms existing methods. This highlights the advantages of incorporating cognitive factors into deep learning, enhancing task efficiency and prediction accuracy",

    "title": "Incremental Sequence Labeling: A Tale of Two Shifts",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "The incremental sequence labeling task involves continuously learning new classes over time while retaining knowledge of the previous ones. Our investigation identifies two significant semantic shifts: E2O (where the model mislabels an old entity as a non-entity) and O2E (where the model labels a non-entity or old entity as a new entity). Previous research has predominantly focused on addressing the E2O problem, neglecting the O2E issue. This negligence results in a model bias towards classifying new data samples as belonging to the new class during the learning process. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, Incremental Sequential Labeling without Semantic Shifts (IS3). Motivated by the identified semantic shifts (E2O and O2E), IS3 aims to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in models. As for the E2O problem, we use knowledge distillation to maintain the model's discriminative ability for old entities. Simultaneously, to tackle the O2E problem, we alleviate the model's bias towards new entities through debiased loss and optimization levels.Our experimental evaluation, conducted on three datasets with various incremental settings, demonstrates the superior performance of IS3 compared to the previous state-of-the-art method by a significant margin",

In addition, we derive the formula of information bottleneck to facilitate its application in novel comprehensive evaluations, the selection of supervised fine-tuning data, and the construction of reinforcement learning rewards.

    "abstract": "Enterprise documents such as forms, receipts, reports, and other such records, often carry rich semantics at the intersection of textual and spatial modalities. The visual cues offered by their complex layouts play a crucial role in comprehending these documents effectively. In this paper, we present DocLLM, a lightweight extension to traditional large language models (LLMs) for reasoning over visual documents, taking into account both textual semantics and spatial layout. Our model differs from existing multimodal LLMs by avoiding expensive image encoders and focuses exclusively on bounding box information to incorporate the spatial layout structure. Specifically, the cross-alignment between text and spatial modalities is captured by decomposing the attention mechanism in classical transformers to a set of disentangled matrices. Furthermore, we devise a pre-training objective that learns to infill text segments. This approach allows us to address irregular layouts and heterogeneous content frequently encountered in visual documents. The pre-trained model is fine-tuned using a large-scale instruction dataset, covering four core document intelligence tasks. We demonstrate that our solution outperforms SotA LLMs on 14 out of 16 datasets across all tasks, and generalizes well to 4 out of 5 previously unseen datasets",

We then generate QA pairs based on the identified sentence subset and train the model on the selected sentences to obtain the final model.

In recent years, extensive efforts have been devoted to the latter stage, where Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have dominated.

To this end, we systematically investigate the robustness of DocRE models to entity name variations in this work. We first propose a principled pipeline to generate entity-renamed documents by replacing the original entity names with names from Wikidata. By applying the pipeline to DocRED and Re-DocRED datasets, we construct two novel benchmarks named Env-DocRED and Env-Re-DocRED for robustness evaluation. Experimental results show that both three representative DocRE models and two LLM-based in-context learning methods consistently lack sufficient robustness to entity name variations. Finally, we propose an entity variation robust training method which not only effectively improves the robustness of DocRE models but also enhances their understanding and reasoning capabilities",

Previous works have investigated the selection bias problem in MCQs within few-shot scenarios, in which the LLM's performance may be influenced by the presentation of answer choices, leaving the selection bias during Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) unexplored. In this paper, we reveal that selection bias persists in the SFT phase of LLMs, primarily due to the LLM's inadequate Multiple Choice Symbol Binding (MCSB) capability. This limitation implies that the model struggles to associate the answer options with their corresponding symbols effectively. To enhance the model's MCSB capability, we first incorporate option contents into the loss function and subsequently adjust the weights of the option symbols and contents, guiding the model to understand the option content of the current symbol. Based on this, we introduce an efficient SFT algorithm for MCQs, termed Point-wise Intelligent Feedback (PIF). PIF constructs negative instances by randomly combining the incorrect option contents with all candidate option symbols, and proposes a point-wise loss to provide feedback on these negative samples into LLMs. Our experimental results demonstrate that PIF significantly reduces the model's selection bias by improving its MCSB capability. Remarkably, PIF exhibits a substantial enhancement in the accuracy for MCQs",

It may arise from the lack of high-quality instruction following data in these languages. Directly translating English samples into these languages can be a solution but unreliable, leading to responses with translation errors and lacking language-specific or cultural knowledge. To address this issue, we propose a novel method to construct cross-lingual instruction following samples with instruction in English and response in low-resource languages. Specifically, the language model first learns to generate appropriate English instructions according to the natural web texts in other languages as responses. The candidate cross-lingual instruction tuning samples are further refined and diversified. We have employed this method to build a large-scale cross-lingual instruction tuning dataset on 10 languages, namely X-Instruction. The instruction data built using our method incorporate more language-specific knowledge compared with the naive translation method. Experimental results have shown that the response quality of the model tuned on X-Instruction greatly exceeds the model distilled from a powerful teacher model, reaching or even surpassing the ones of ChatGPT. In addition, we find that models tuned on cross-lingual instruction following samples can follow the instruction in the output language without further tuning",

In practice, unseen aspects, due to distinct data distribution, impose many challenges for a trained neural model. Motivated by this, this work formulates ASQP into the few-shot scenario, which aims for fast adaptation in real applications. Therefore, we first construct a few-shot ASQP dataset (FSQP) that contains richer categories and is more balanced for the few-shot study. Moreover, recent methods extract quads through a generation paradigm, which involves converting the input sentence into a templated target sequence. However, they primarily focus on the utilization of a single template or the consideration of different template orders, thereby overlooking the correlations among various templates. To tackle this issue, we further propose a Broad-view Soft Prompting (BvSP) method that aggregates multiple templates with a broader view by taking into account the correlation between the different templates. Specifically, BvSP uses the pre-trained language model to select the most relevant k templates with Jensen–Shannon divergence. BvSP further introduces soft prompts to guide the pre-trained language model using the selected templates. Then, we aggregate the results of multi-templates by voting mechanism. Empirical results demonstrate that BvSP significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods under four few-shot settings and other public datasets.

Recently, the adoption of large language models (LLMs), known for their vast knowledge repositories and advanced logical inference capabilities, has emerged as a promising way for efficient and effective MRL. Despite their potential, these methods predominantly rely on textual data, thus not fully harnessing the wealth of structural information inherent in molecular graphs.Moreover, the absence of a unified framework exacerbates the issue of insufficient data exploitation, as it hinders the sharing of interaction mechanism learned across various datasets. To address these challenges, this work proposes a novel LLM-based multi-modal framework for molecular interaction modeling following Chain-of-Thought (CoT) theory, termed MolTC, which effectively integrate graphical information of two molecules in pair. For achieving a unified training paradigm, MolTC innovatively develops a dynamic parameter-sharing strategy for cross-dataset information exchange.

Raker is evaluated on three public datasets and achieves SOTA performance in inductive relation prediction when compared with the baseline methods. Notably, the absolute improvement of Raker is even more than 10\\% on the FB15k-237 inductive setting. Moreover, Raker also demonstrates its superiority in both transductive and few-shot settings.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "The unparalleled performance of closed-sourced ChatGPT has sparked efforts towards its democratization, with notable strides made by leveraging real user and ChatGPT conversations, as evidenced by Vicuna. However, due to challenges in gathering conversations involving human participation, current endeavors like Baize and UltraChat rely on ChatGPT conducting roleplay to simulate humans based on instructions, resulting in overdependence on seeds, diminished human-likeness, limited topic diversity, and an absence of genuine multi-round conversational dynamics. To address the above issues, we propose a paradigm to simulate human behavior better and explore the benefits of incorporating more human-like questions in multi-turn conversations. Specifically, we directly target human questions extracted from genuine human-machine conversations as a learning goal and provide a novel user simulator called `Socratic`. The experimental results show our response model, `PlatoLM`, achieves SOTA performance among LLaMA-based 7B models in MT-Bench. Our findings further demonstrate that our method introduces highly human-like questioning patterns, which can teach the response model better than previous works in multi-round conversations",

    "abstract": "The reasoning capabilities of LLMs are currently hotly debated. We examine the issue from the perspective of claim/rumour verification. We propose the first logical reasoning framework designed to break down any claim or rumor paired with evidence into the atomic reasoning steps necessary for verification. Based on our framework, we curate two annotated collections of such claim/evidence pairs: a synthetic dataset from Wikipedia and a real-world set stemming from rumours circulating on Twitter. We use them to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4 (hereinafter referred to as ChatGPT) within the context of our framework, providing a thorough analysis. Our results show that ChatGPT struggles in abductive reasoning, although this can be somewhat mitigated by using manual Chain of Thought (CoT) as opposed to Zero Shot (ZS) and ZS CoT approaches. Our study contributes to the growing body of research suggesting that ChatGPT's reasoning processes are unlikely to mirror human-like reasoning, and that LLMs need to be more rigorously evaluated in order to distinguish between hype and actual capabilities, especially in high stake real-world tasks such as claim verification",

ProtLLM features a unique dynamic protein mounting mechanism, enabling it to handle complex inputs where the natural language text is interspersed with an arbitrary number of proteins.

Additionally, we construct a large-scale interleaved protein-text dataset, named InterPT, for pre-training. This dataset comprehensively encompasses both (1) structured data sources like protein annotations and (2) unstructured data sources like biological research papers, thereby endowing ProtLLM with crucial knowledge for understanding proteins. We evaluate ProtLLM on classic supervised protein-centric tasks and explore its novel protein-language applications.

    "abstract": "Summarization is an important application of large language models (LLMs). Most previous evaluation of summarization models has focused on their performance in content selection, faithfulness, grammaticality and coherence. However, it is well known that LLMs reproduce and reinforce harmful social biases. This raises the question: Do these biases affect model outputs in a relatively constrained setting like summarization?To help answer this question, we first motivate and introduce a number of definitions for biased behaviours in summarization models, along with practical operationalizations. Since we find that biases inherent to input documents can confound bias analysis in summaries, we propose a method to generate input documents with carefully controlled demographic attributes. This allows us to study summarizer behavior in a controlled setting, while still working with realistic input documents.Finally, we measure gender bias in English summaries generated by both purpose-built summarization models and general purpose chat models as a case study. We find content selection in single document summarization to be largely unaffected by gender bias, while hallucinations exhibit evidence of downstream biases in summarization",

While existing deep-learning based methods have made progress in detecting fake news accurately, their reliability may be compromised caused by the non-transparent reasoning processes, poor generalization abilities and inherent risks of integration with large language models (LLMs). To address this challenge, we propose {\\methodname}, a novel framework for trustworthy fake news detection that prioritizes explainability, generalizability and controllability of models. This is achieved via a dual-system framework that integrates cognition and decision systems, adhering to the principles above. The cognition system harnesses human expertise to generate logical predicates, which guide LLMs in generating human-readable logic atoms. Meanwhile, the decision system deduces generalizable logic rules to aggregate these atoms, enabling the identification of the truthfulness of the input news across diverse domains and enhancing transparency in the decision-making process.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "The subjective perception of emotion leads to inconsistent labels from human annotators. Typically, utterances lacking majority-agreed labels are excluded when training an emotion classifier, which cause problems when encountering ambiguous emotional expressions during testing. This paper investigates three methods to handle ambiguous emotion. First, we show that incorporating utterances without majority-agreed labels as an additional class in the classifier reduces the classification performance of the other emotion classes. Then, we propose detecting utterances with ambiguous emotions as out-of-domain samples by quantifying the uncertainty in emotion classification using evidential deep learning. This approach retains the classification accuracy while effectively detects ambiguous emotion expressions. Furthermore, to obtain fine-grained distinctions among ambiguous emotions, we propose representing emotion as a distribution instead of a single class label. The task is thus re-framed from classification to distribution estimation where every individual annotation is taken into account, not just the majority opinion. The evidential uncertainty measure is extended to quantify the uncertainty in emotion distribution estimation. Experimental results on the IEMOCAP and CREMA-D datasets demonstrate the superior capability of the proposed method in terms of majority class prediction, emotion distribution estimation, and uncertainty estimation",

    "abstract": "The advent of large language models (LLMs) has predominantly catered to high-resource languages, leaving a disparity in performance for low-resource languages. Conventional Continual Training (CT) approaches to bridge this gap often undermine a model's original linguistic proficiency when expanding to multilingual contexts. Addressing this issue, we introduce a novel MoE-CT architecture, a paradigm that innovatively separates the base model's learning from the multilingual expansion process. Our design freezes the original LLM parameters, thus safeguarding its performance in high-resource languages, while an appended MoE module, trained on diverse language datasets, augments low-resource language proficiency. Our approach significantly outperforms conventional CT methods, as evidenced by our experiments, which show marked improvements in multilingual benchmarks without sacrificing the model's original language performance. Moreover, our MoE-CT framework demonstrates enhanced resistance to forgetting and superior transfer learning capabilities. By preserving the base model's integrity and focusing on strategic parameter expansion, our methodology advances multilingual language modeling and represents a significant step forward for low-resource language inclusion in LLMs, indicating a fruitful direction for future research in language technologies",

While large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance on arithmetic word problems based solely on text, we found that introducing visual data significantly increases the difficulty. Specifically, the compositional task of counting objects following recognition becomes a formidable hurdle for large vision-language models (LVLMs). The dual demands of recognizing objects and performing arithmetic reasoning pose a significant challenge, hindering LVLMs from excelling in both tasks simultaneously. The commonly employed chain-of-thought (CoT) approach, designed for LLMs, proves ineffective when applied to this multimodal task. As an alternative to the demonstration-based CoT method, we propose a novel decomposition prompting approach, explicitly breaking down the task breakdown into two stages as follows. The first stage performs object detection and enumeration referenced within the mathematical problem. The second stage then leverages the output from stage one to directly address the posed question. Our results demonstrate that this approach leads to substantial performance improvements on established benchmarks for visual and language arithmetic problems. This breaks the chains of CoT, paving the way towards a multimodal breakdown approach",

    "abstract": "Over the past few years, the abilities of large language models (LLMs) have received extensive attention, which have performed exceptionally well in complicated scenarios such as logical reasoning and symbolic inference. A significant factor contributing to this progress is the benefit of in-context learning and few-shot prompting. However, the reasons behind the success of such models using contextual reasoning have not been fully explored. Do LLMs have understand logical rules to draw inferences, or do they ``guess'' the answers by learning a type of probabilistic mapping through context? This paper investigates the reasoning capabilities of LLMs on two logical reasoning datasets by using counterfactual methods to replace context text and modify logical concepts. Based on our analysis, it is found that LLMs do not truly understand logical rules; rather, in-context learning has simply enhanced the likelihood of these models arriving at the correct answers. If one alters certain words in the context text or changes the concepts of logical terms, the outputs of LLMs can be significantly disrupted, leading to counter-intuitive responses.This work provides critical insights into the limitations of LLMs, underscoring the need for more robust mechanisms to ensure reliable logical reasoning in LLMs",

    "title": "Explore Spurious Correlations at the Concept Level in Language Models for Text Classification",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Language models (LMs) have achieved notable success in numerous NLP tasks, employing both fine-tuning and in-context learning (ICL) methods. While language models demonstrate exceptional performance, they face robustness challenges due to spurious correlations arising from imbalanced label distributions in training data or ICL exemplars. Previous research has primarily concentrated on word, phrase, and syntax features, neglecting the concept level, often due to the absence of concept labels and difficulty in identifying conceptual content in input texts. This paper introduces two main contributions. First, we employ ChatGPT to assign concept labels to texts, assessing concept bias in models during fine-tuning or ICL on test data. We find that LMs, when encountering spurious correlations between a concept and a label in training or prompts, resort to shortcuts for predictions. Second, we introduce a data rebalancing technique that incorporates ChatGPT-generated counterfactual data, thereby balancing label distribution and mitigating spurious correlations. Our method's efficacy, surpassing traditional token removal approaches, is validated through extensive testing",

    "abstract": "Efficiently modeling historical information is a critical component in addressing user queries within a conversational question-answering (QA) context, as historical context plays a vital role in clarifying the user's questions. However, irrelevant history induces noise in the reasoning process, especially for those questions with a considerable historical context. In our novel approach, referred to as CoTaH (Consistency-Trained augmented History), we augment the historical information with synthetic questions and subsequently employ consistency training to train a model that utilizes both real and augmented historical data to implicitly make the reasoning robust to irrelevant history. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance of research using data augmentation to model conversational QA settings. By citing a common modeling error prevalent in previous research, we introduce a new baseline model and compare our model's performance against it, demonstrating an improvement in results, particularly when dealing with questions that include a substantial amount of historical context",

    "abstract": "Self-attention is an essential component of large language models(LLMs) but a significant source of inference latency for long sequences. In multi-tenant LLMs serving scenarios, the compute and memory operation cost of self-attention can be optimized by using the probability that multiple LLM requests have shared system prompts in prefixes. In this paper, we introduce ChunkAttention, a prefix-aware self-attention module that can detect matching prompt prefixes across multiple requests and share their key/value tensors in memory at runtime to improve the memory utilization of KV cache. This is achieved by breaking monolithic key/value tensors into smaller chunks and structuring them into the auxiliary prefix tree. Consequently, on top of the prefix-tree based KV cache, we design an efficient self-attention kernel, where a two-phase partition algorithm is implemented to improve the data locality during self-attention computation in the presence of shared system prompts. Experiments show that ChunkAttention can speed up the self-attention kernel by 3.2-4.8$\\times$ compared to the start-of-the-art implementation, with the length of the system prompt ranging from 1024 to 4096",

To tackle this challenge, recent studies have delved into the realm of model editing, which manipulates specific memories of language models and changes the related language generation. However, the robustness of model editing remains an open question. This work seeks to understand the strengths and limitations of editing methods, thus facilitating robust, realistic applications of communicative AI. Concretely, we conduct extensive analysis to address the three key research questions. Q1: Can edited LLMs behave consistently resembling communicative AI in realistic situations? Q2: To what extent does the rephrasing of prompts lead LLMs to deviate from the edited knowledge memory? Q3: Which knowledge features are correlated with the performance and robustness of editing? Our experimental results uncover a substantial disparity between existing editing methods and the practical application of LLMs. On rephrased prompts that are complex and flexible but common in realistic applications, the performance of editing experiences a significant decline. Further analysis shows that more popular knowledge is memorized better, easier to recall, and more challenging to edit effectively",

These approaches yield sporadic successes, yet generally fall short of expectations.In this work, we aim to improve zero-shot event detection by training models to better follow event definitions. We hypothesize that a diverse set of event types and definitions are the key for models to learn to follow event definitions while existing event extraction datasets focus on annotating many high-quality examples for a few event types. To verify our hypothesis, we construct an automatically generated Diverse Event Definition (DivED) dataset and conduct comparative studies. Our experiments reveal that a large number of event types (200) and diverse event definitions can significantly boost event extraction performance; on the other hand, the performance does not scale with over ten examples per event type.Beyond scaling, we incorporate event ontology information and hard-negative samples during training, further boosting the performance.

    "abstract": "Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) is a critical paradigm for tackling distribution shifts during inference, especially in visual recognition tasks. However, while acoustic models face similar challenges due to distribution shifts in test-time speech, TTA techniques specifically designed for acoustic modeling in the context of open-world data shifts remain scarce. This gap is further exacerbated when considering the unique characteristics of acoustic foundation models: 1) they are primarily built on transformer architectures with layer normalization and 2) they deal with test-time speech data of varying lengths in a non-stationary manner. These aspects make the direct application of vision-focused TTA methods, which are mostly reliant on batch normalization and assume independent samples, infeasible. In this paper, we delve into TTA for pre-trained acoustic models facing open-world data shifts. We find that noisy, high-entropy speech frames, often non-silent, carry key semantic content. Traditional TTA methods might inadvertently filter out this information using potentially flawed heuristics. In response, we introduce a learning-based adaptation enriched by confidence enhancement. Noting that speech signals' short-term consistency, we also apply consistency regularization during test-time optimization.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs), such as LLaMA and T5, have shown exceptional performance across various tasks through fine-tuning. Although low-rank adaption (LoRA) has emerged to cheaply fine-tune these LLMs on downstream tasks, their deployment is still hindered by the vast model scale and computational costs. Post-training model pruning offers a way to compress LLMs. However, the current pruning methods designed for LLMs are not compatible with LoRA. This is due to their utilization of unstructured pruning on LLMs, impeding the merging of LoRA weights, or their dependence on the gradients of pre-trained weights to guide pruning, which can impose significant memory overhead. To this end, we propose LoRAPrune, a new framework that delivers an accurate structured pruned model in a highly memory-efficient manner. Specifically, we first design a LoRA-guided pruning criterion, which uses the weights and gradients of LoRA, rather than the gradients of pre-trained weights for importance estimation. We subsequently integrate this criterion into an iterative pruning process, effectively removing redundant channels and heads. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our LoRAPrune over existing approaches on the LLaMA series models. At a 50% compression rate, LoRAPrune demonstrates superior performance over LLM-Pruner, achieving a reduction in perplexity by 4.81 on WikiText2 and 3.46 on PTB, while also decreasing memory usage by 52.6%. Besides, LoRAPrune also matches semi-structural pruning across multiple LLMs, proving its wide applicability",

Recent works have complex designs such as compressing the output temporally for the speech encoder, tackling modal alignment for the projector, and utilizing parameter-efficient fine-tuning for the LLM. We found that delicate designs are not necessary, while an embarrassingly simple composition of off-the-shelf speech encoder, LLM, and the only trainable linear projector is competent for the ASR task. To be more specific, we benchmark and explore various combinations of LLMs and speech encoders, leading to the optimal LLM-based ASR system, which we call SLAM-ASR. The proposed SLAM-ASR provides a clean setup and little task-specific design, where only the linear projector is trained. To the best of our knowledge, SLAM-ASR achieves the best performance on the Librispeech benchmark among LLM-based ASR models and even outperforms the latest LLM-based audio-universal model trained on massive pair data. Finally, we explore the capability emergence of LLM-based ASR in the process of modal alignment.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to significant success in using LLMs as agents. Nevertheless, a common assumption that LLMs always process honest information neglects the widespread deceptive or misleading content in human and AI-generated material. This oversight might expose LLMs to malicious manipulations. To enhance LLMs' ability to identify and counteract deceptive information, in this paper, inspired by humans' recursive thinking and perspective-taking, we introduce a novel cognitive framework, Recursive Contemplation (ReCon). ReCon combines formulation and refinement contemplation processes; formulation contemplation produces initial thoughts and speech, while refinement contemplation further polishes them. Additionally, we incorporate first-order and second-order perspective transitions into these processes respectively. Specifically, the first-order allows an LLM agent to infer others' mental states, and the second-order involves understanding how others perceive the agent's mental state. After integrating ReCon with various LLMs, extensive experiment results from the Avalon game and BigTom benchmark indicate ReCon's efficacy in aiding LLMs to discern and maneuver around deceptive information without extra fine-tuning and data. Finally, we demonstrate ReCon's scaling trend with model parameters, and explore the current limitations of LLMs in terms of safety and reasoning, potentially furnishing insights for subsequent research",

This framework offers robustness and reliability for transmission in complex channels, as well as resistance to text rendering and word blocking.

Existing benchmarking tasks often require models to identify the temporal validity duration of a single statement. However, many data sources contain additional context, such as successive sentences in a story or posts on a social media profile. This context may alter the duration for which the originally collected statement is expected to be valid. We propose Temporal Validity Change Prediction, a natural language processing task benchmarking the capability of machine learning models to detect context statements that induce such change. We create a dataset consisting of temporal target statements sourced from Twitter and crowdsource corresponding context statements. We then benchmark a set of transformer-based language models on our dataset. Finally, we experiment with a multitasking approach to improve the state-of-the-art performance",

The presented work extends Shapley values to account for parsing-based syntactic dependencies. Taking a game theoric approach, SyntaxShap only considers coalitions constraint by the dependency tree. We adopt a model-based evaluation to compare SyntaxShap and its weighted form to state-of-the-art explainability methods adapted to text generation tasks, using diverse metrics including faithfulness, complexity, coherency, and semantic alignment of the explanations to the model.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Zero-shot Singing Voice Synthesis (SVS) with style transfer aims to generate high-quality singing voices of unseen timbres and styles (including singing methods, rhythm, techniques, and pronunciation) from the prompt audio. However, the multifaceted nature of singing voice styles poses a significant challenge for comprehensive modeling and effective transfer. Furthermore, existing SVS models often fail to generate singing voices with a wealth of stylistic nuances for unseen singers. In this paper, we introduce TransferSinger, a novel zero-shot SVS model that primarily employs three modules to address these challenges: 1) the style encoder that employs a Vector Quantization (VQ) model to condense style information into a compact latent space, thus facilitating subsequent predictions; 2) the Style and Duration Language Model (S\\&D-LM), which concurrently predicts style information and phoneme duration, thereby enhancing both; and 3) the style adaptive decoder that uses a novel style adaptive normalization method to generate singing voices with enhanced details. Experimental results show that TransferSinger outperforms baseline models in terms of both synthesis quality and singer similarity across various tasks, including zero-shot SVS, controllable style synthesis, cross-lingual style transfer, and speech-to-singing style transfer.

Unlike knowledge graph embedding methods, RulE learns rule embeddings from existing triplets and first-order {rules} by jointly representing \\textbf{entities}, \\textbf{relations} and \\textbf{logical rules} in a unified embedding space. Based on the learned rule embeddings, a confidence score can be calculated for each rule, reflecting its consistency with the observed triplets. This allows us to perform logical rule inference in a soft way, thus alleviating the brittleness of logic. On the other hand, RulE injects prior logical rule information into the embedding space, enriching and regularizing the entity/relation embeddings. This makes KGE alone perform better too. RulE is conceptually simple and empirically effective. We conduct extensive experiments to verify each component of RulE.Results on multiple benchmarks reveal that our model outperforms the majority of existing embedding-based and rule-based approaches",

In this era of open-ended language modeling, where task boundaries are gradually fading, an urgent question emerges: have we made significant progress in text classification with the full benefit of LLMs? To answer this question, we propose RGPT, an adaptive boosting framework tailored to produce a specialized text classification LLM by recurrently ensembling a pool of strong base learners. The base learners are constructed by adaptively adjusting the distribution of training samples and iteratively fine-tuning LLMs with them. Such base learners are then ensembled to be a specialized text classification LLM, by recurrently incorporating the historical predictions from the previous learners. Through a comprehensive empirical comparison, we show that RGPT significantly outperforms 8 SOTA PLMs and 7 SOTA LLMs on four benchmarks by 1.36% on average.

    "abstract": "Large language models show compelling performance on reasoning tasks but they tend to perform much worse in languages other than English. This is unsurprising given that their training data largely consists of English text and instructions. A typical solution is to translate instruction data into all languages of interest, and then train on the resulting multilingual data, which is called translate-training. This approach not only incurs high cost, but also results in poorly translated data due to the non-standard formatting of mathematical chain-of-thought. In this paper, we explore the benefits of question alignment, where we train the model to translate reasoning questions into English by finetuning on X-English parallel question data. In this way we perform targeted, in-domain language alignment which makes best use of English instruction data to unlock the LLMs' multilingual reasoning abilities. Experimental results on LLaMA2-13B show that question alignment leads to consistent improvements over the translate-training approach: an average improvement of 11.3\\% and 16.1\\% accuracy across ten languages on the MGSM and MSVAMP reasoning benchmarks",

In this paper, we unveil the Helping and Empowering through Adaptive Language in Mental Enhancement (HealMe) model. This novel cognitive reframing therapy method effectively addresses deep-rooted negative thoughts and fosters rational, balanced perspectives. Diverging from traditional LLM methods, HealMe employs empathetic dialogue based on psychotherapeutic frameworks. It systematically guides clients through distinguishing circumstances from feelings, brainstorming alternative viewpoints, and developing empathetic, actionable suggestions. Moreover, we adopt the first comprehensive and expertly crafted psychological evaluation metrics, specifically designed to rigorously assess the performance of cognitive reframing, in both AI-simulated dialogues and real-world therapeutic conversations.

    "abstract": "Previous research on radiology report generation has made significant progress in terms of increasing the clinical accuracy of generated reports. In this paper, we emphasize another crucial quality that it should possess, i.e., inter-report consistency, which refers to the capability of generating consistent reports for semantically equivalent radiographs. This quality is even of greater significance than the overall report accuracy in terms of ensuring the system's credibility, as a system prone to providing conflicting results would severely erode users' trust. Regrettably, existing approaches struggle to maintain inter-report consistency, exhibiting biases towards common patterns and susceptibility to lesion variants. To address this issue, we propose ICON, which improves the inter-report consistency of radiology report generation. Aiming at enhancing the system's ability to capture the similarities in semantically equivalent lesions, our approach involves first extracting lesions from input images and examining their characteristics. Then, we introduce a lesion-aware mix-up augmentation technique to ensure that the representations of the semantically equivalent lesions align with the same attributes, by linearly interpolating them during the training phase. Extensive experiments on three publicly available chest X-ray datasets verify the effectiveness of our approach, both in terms of improving the consistency and accuracy of the generated reports",

    "abstract": "Recently, tremendous strides have been made to align the generation of Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values to mitigate toxic or unhelpful content. Leveraging Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) proves effective and is widely adopted by researchers. However, implementing RLHF is complex, and its sensitivity to hyperparameters renders achieving stable performance and scalability challenging. Furthermore, prevailing approaches to preference alignment primarily concentrate on pairwise comparisons, with limited exploration into multi-response scenarios, thereby overlooking the potential richness within the candidate pool. For the above reasons, we propose a new approach: Listwise Reward Enhancement for Preference Alignment (LIRE), a gradient-based reward optimization approach that incorporates the offline rewards of multiple responses into a streamlined listwise framework, thus eliminating the need for online sampling during training. LIRE is straightforward to implement, requiring minimal parameter tuning, and seamlessly aligns with the pairwise paradigm while naturally extending to multi-response scenarios. Moreover, we introduce a self-enhancement algorithm aimed at iteratively refining the reward during training. Our experiments demonstrate that LIRE consistently outperforms existing methods across several benchmarks on dialogue and summarization tasks, with good transferability to out-of-distribution data, assessed using proxy reward models and human annotators",

To address this complexity, we propose a tailored representation model designed to effectively encapsulate the nuanced aspects of macro topics. Our model relies on a comprehensive multidimensional analysis of sub-topics within a given macro topic, employing a specially designed discourse-based Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model. Utilizing this representation, an aggregation analysis is implemented to deduce stances on the macro topic by examining the array of sub-topic stances. The analysis of stances associated with sub-topics expressed in text is achieved by leveraging the semantic analysis capability of large language models (LLMs).

To ensure this, smart contract code is introduced to predefine transaction rules, and stipulate that the code should automatically execute without intermediaries when someone calls it.

Therefore, the security of smart contract code is crucial in Blockchain domain. Currently, smart contracts are primarily manually written by developers, facing challenges such as experienced developer shortage, low development efficiency, and substantial security risks. There is an urgent need for code generation technology to assist both developers and non-professional programmers in creating secure and efficient smart contract codes.In this paper, we propose CodeBC, a more secure smart contract Code generation model for Blockchain, which employs a two-stage fine-tuning approach based on CodeLlama: the first stage uses a multi-task learning framework for code infilling and vulnerability detection, enhancing the model's understanding of smart contract code and its ability to identify security vulnerabilities; in the second stage, tags-guided instruction fine-tuning is employed to improve the model's comprehension of human instructions, thereby generating higher-security code.We construct an Blockchain-HumanEval dataset to assess whether the generated code meets human requirements.

To facilitate more effective utilization of judgments, we propose a novel framework, Contrastive Unlikelihood Training (CUT), that allows for fine-grained inappropriate content detection and correction based on judgments.Our results show that, with merely 1317 off-the-shelf judgment data, CUT (LLaMA2-13b) can beat the 175B DaVinci003 and surpass the best baseline by 52.34 points on AlpacaEval.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable generative capabilities, enabling the generation of valuable information. Despite these advancements, previous research found that LLMs sometimes struggle with adhering to specific constraints (e.g., in specific place or at specific time), at times even overlooking them, which leads to responses that are either too generic or not fully satisfactory. Existing approaches attempted to address this issue by decomposing or rewriting input instructions, yet they fall short in adequately emphasizing specific constraints and in unlocking the underlying knowledge (e.g., programming within the context of software development). In response, this paper proposes a simple yet effective method named Chain-of-Specificity (CoS). Specifically, CoS iteratively emphasizes the specific constraints in the input instructions, unlocks knowledge within LLMs, and refines responses. Experiments conducted on publicly available and self-build complex datasets demonstrate that CoS outperforms existing methods in enhancing generated content especially for the specificity. Besides, as the number of specific constraints increase, other baselines falter, while CoS still performs well. Moreover, we show that distilling responses generated by CoS effectively enhances the ability of smaller models to follow the constrained instructions.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Metaphors Detection, as an important task in the field of Natural Language Processing, has been receiving sustained academic attention in recent years. Current research focuses on the development of supervised Metaphors Detection systems, which usually require large-scale, high-quality labeled data support. With the rapid development of large-scale generative language models (e.g., ChatGPT), they have been widely used in a number of domains, including automatic summarization, sentiment analysis, and question and answer systems. However, it is worth noting that the use of ChatGPT for unsupervised Metaphors Detection task is often challenged with less-than-expected performance. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to explore how to bootstrap and combine ChatGPT by detecting the most prevalent verb metaphors among metaphors. Our approach first utilizes ChatGPT to obtain literal collocations of target verbs and subject-object pairs of verbs in the text to be detected. Subsequently, these literal collocations and subject-object pairs are mapped to the same set of topics, and finally the verb metaphors are detected through the analysis of entailment relations. The experimental results show that our method achieves the best performance on the unsupervised verb Metaphors Detection task compared to past unsupervised methods or direct prediction using ChatGPT",

    "abstract": "Parameter-efficient tuning methods such as LoRA could achieve comparable performance to model tuning by tuning a small portion of the parameters. However, substantial computational resources are still required, as this process involves calculating gradients and performing back-propagation throughout the model. Much effort has recently been devoted to utilizing the derivative-free optimization method to eschew the computation of gradients and showcase an augmented level of robustness in few-shot settings. In this paper, we prepend the low-rank modules into each self-attention layer of the model and employ two derivative-free optimization methods to optimize these low-rank modules at each layer alternately. Extensive results on various tasks and language models demonstrate that our proposed method achieves substantial improvement and exhibits clear advantages in memory usage and convergence speed compared to existing gradient-based parameter-efficient tuning and derivative-free optimization methods in few-shot settings",

    "title": "Direct Metric Optimization for Image Captioning through Reward-Weighted Augmented Data Utilization",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "While image captioning is an essential field of vision language models (VLM), a lack of continuity between the learning objective and final performance metrics of VLMs complicates their training and optimization. Reinforcement learning (RL) can directly optimize such metrics, but it is accompanied by a significant computational cost, making it difficult to apply to recent large-scale VLMs. In this paper, we propose Direct Metric Optimization (DMO), which is a lightweight final-metric-optimizing training method. We replace the computationally expensive exploration process in RL with an offline, diverse text data augmentation and show that self-supervised training on reward-weighted augmented data leads to direct and stable metric optimization. Our experiments demonstrate that DMO achieves performance comparable to those of the state-of-the-art RL method while saving hundreds of times more model forwarding iterations and greater amounts of computation time. This suggests that DMO constitutes a promising alternative for metric optimization in the era of large-scale VLMs",

    "title": "Token-Level Adversarial Prompt Detection Based on Perplexity Measures and Contextual Information",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "In recent years, Large Language Models (LLM) have emerged as pivotal tools in various applications. However, these models are susceptible to adversarial prompt attacks, where attackers can carefully curate input strings that mislead LLMs into generating incorrect or undesired outputs. Previous work has revealed that with relatively simple yet effective attacks based on discrete optimization, it is possible to generate adversarial prompts that bypass moderation and alignment of the models. This vulnerability to adversarial prompts underscores a significant concern regarding the robustness and reliability of LLMs. Our work aims to address this concern by introducing a novel approach to detecting adversarial prompts at a token level, leveraging the LLM's capability to predict the next token's probability. We measure the degree of the model's perplexity, where tokens predicted with high probability are considered normal, and those exhibiting high perplexity are flagged as adversarial. Additionaly, our method also integrates context understanding by incorporating neighboring token information to encourage the detection of contiguous adversarial prompt sequences. To this end, we design two algorithms for adversarial prompt detection: one based on optimization techniques and another on Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGM). Both methods are equipped with efficient solving methods, ensuring efficient adversarial prompt detection. Our token-level detection result can be visualized as heatmap overlays on the text sequence, allowing for a clearer and more intuitive representation of which part of the text may contain adversarial prompts",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) generative models have shown remarkable capabilities in producing diverse and imaginative visuals based on text prompts. Despite the advancement, these diffusion models sometimes struggle to translate the semantic content from the text into images entirely. While conditioning on the layout has shown to be effective in improving the compositional ability of T2I diffusion models, they typically require manual layout input. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to improving T2I diffusion models using Large Language Models (LLMs) as layout generators. Our method leverages the Chain-of-Thought prompting of LLMs to interpret text and generate spatially reasonable object layouts. The generated layout is then used to enhance the generated images' composition and spatial accuracy. Moreover, we propose an efficient adapter based on a cross-attention mechanism, which explicitly integrates the layout information into the stable diffusion models. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in image quality and layout accuracy, showcasing the potential of LLMs in augmenting generative image models",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have succeeded remarkably in understanding long-form contents. However, exploring their capability for generating long-form contents, such as reports and articles, has been relatively unexplored and inadequately assessed by existing benchmarks. The prevalent evaluation methods, which predominantly rely on crowdsourcing, are recognized for their labor-intensive nature and lack of efficiency, whereas automated metrics, such as the ROUGE score, demonstrate discordance with human judgment criteria. In this paper, we propose ProxyQA, an innovative framework dedicated to assessing long-text generation. ProxyQA comprises in-depth human-curated meta-questions spanning various domains, each accompanied by specific proxy-questions with pre-annotated answers. LLMs are tasked to generate extensive content in response to these meta-questions, by engaging an evaluator and incorporating the generated texts as contextual background, ProxyQA assesses the generated content's quality through the evaluator's accuracy in addressing the proxy-questions. We examine multiple LLMs, emphasizing ProxyQA's demanding nature as a high-quality assessment tool. Human evaluation demonstrates that the proxy-question method is notably self-consistent and aligns closely with human evaluative standards. The dataset and leaderboard will be publicly available",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Recently, instruction-following audio-language models have received broad attention for human-audio interaction. However, the absence of benchmarks capable of evaluating audio-centric interaction capabilities has impeded advancements in this field. Previous models primarily focus on assessing different fundamental tasks, such as Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), and lack an assessment of the open-ended generative capabilities centered around audio. Thus, it is challenging to track the progression in the Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) domain and to provide guidance for future improvement. In this paper, we introduce AIR-Bench (Audio Instruction Benchmark), the first benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of LALMs to understand various types of audio signals (including human speech, natural sounds, and music), and furthermore, to interact with humans in the textual format. AIR-Bench encompasses two dimensions: foundation and chat benchmarks. The former consists of 19 tasks with approximately 19k single-choice questions, intending to inspect the basic single-task ability of LALMs. The latter one contains 2k instances of open-ended question-and-answer data, directly assessing the comprehension of the model on complex audio and its capacity to follow instructions. Both benchmarks require the model to generate hypotheses directly. We design a unified framework that leverages advanced language models, such as GPT-4, to evaluate the scores of generated hypotheses given the meta-information of the audio. Experimental results demonstrate a high level of consistency between GPT-4-based evaluation and human evaluation. By revealing the limitations of existing LALMs through evaluation results, AIR-Bench can provide insights into the direction of future research",

Furthermore, the question and answer pairs are extracted directly from the corpus in predefined formats offers limited context. To address this limitation, we improve reading comprehension via LLM and clustering. LLM focuses on leveraging domain knowledge within the corpus to refine comprehension stage, while clustering supplies relevant knowledge by extending the context to enrich reading stage. Additionally, our method incorporates parameter-efficient fine-tuning to improve the efficiency of domain adaptation. In comparison to AdaptLLM, our method achieves an improvement exceeding 5% in domain-specific tasks",

To solve this, we introduce EASYTOOL, a framework transforming diverse and lengthy tool documentation into a unified and concise tool instruction for easier tool usage.

Specifically, inspired by the Jung's theory of psychological types and the active exploration mechanism of agent in environment, we designed three components to support the goal of caring for user. The Character Extractor (CE) obtains the personality through Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) and attributes for character descriptions; the Memory Reconstructor (MR) achieves multi-topic summaries based on multi-clue branching for complete memories; the Decision Adapter (DA) selects the best topic summary as the background memory and adapts the agent intention to control the scenario of new session.

    "abstract": "Despite Multi-modal Large Language Models (MM-LLMs) have made exciting strides recently, they are still struggling to efficiently model the interactions among multi-modal inputs and the generation in non-textual modalities. In this work, we propose \\textit{TEAL (Tokenize and Embed ALL)}, an approach to treat the input from any modality as a token sequence and learn a joint embedding space for all modalities. Specifically, for the input from any modality, \\textit{TEAL} firstly discretizes it into a token sequence with the off-the-shelf tokenizer and embeds the token sequence into a joint embedding space with a learnable embedding matrix. MM-LLMs just need to predict the multi-modal tokens autoregressively as conventional textual LLMs do. Finally, the corresponding de-tokenizer is applied to generate the output in each modality based on the predicted token sequence. With the joint embedding space, \\textit{TEAL} enables the frozen LLMs to perform both understanding and generation tasks involving non-textual modalities, such as image and audio. Thus, the textual LLM can just work as an interface and maintain its high performance in textual understanding and generation. Experiments show that \\textit{TEAL} achieves substantial improvements in multi-modal understanding, and implements a simple scheme for multi-modal generation",

To address this issue, we propose Long Video Chat (LV-CHAT), where Frame-Scalable Encoding (FSE) is introduced to dynamically adjust the number of embeddings in alignment with the duration of the video to ensure long videos are not overly compressed into a few embeddings. To deal with long videos whose length is beyond videos seen during training, we propose Interleaved Frame Encoding (IFE), repeating positional embedding and interleaving multiple groups of videos to enable long video input, avoiding performance degradation due to overly long videos.

    "title": "Muffin: Mitigating Unhelpfulness in Emotional Support Conversations with Multifaceted AI Feedback",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Emotional support conversation systems are designed to alleviate users' emotional distress and assist them in overcoming their challenges. While previous studies have made progress, their models occasionally generate unhelpful responses, which are intended to be supportive but instead have counterproductive effects. Since unhelpful responses can hinder the effectiveness of emotional support, it is crucial to mitigate them within conversations. Our solution is motivated by two principal considerations: (1) multiple facets of emotional support are expected to be considered when developing emotional support conversation models, and (2) directly reducing the probability of generating unhelpful responses can effectively mitigate their occurrence. Accordingly, we introduce a novel $\\textbf{model-agnostic}$ framework named $\\underline{M}$itigating $\\underline{u}$nhelpfulness with multi\\underline{f}aceted AI $\\underline{f}$eedback for emot$\\underline{i}$o$\\underline{n}$al support ($\\textit{Muffin}$). It first employs a multifaceted AI feedback module designed to assess the helpfulness model responses across various facets of emotional support. Leveraging contrastive learning, Muffin then reduces the unhelpful responses' likelihoods. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, we apply Muffin to various previous emotional support generation models, including the state-of-the-art. Experimental results demonstrate that Muffin can significantly mitigate unhelpful response generation while enhancing response fluency and relevance",

In this paper, we introduce an LLM-guided method PFQS (for Planning First, Question Second), which utilizes Llama 2 to generate an answer plan and then generates questions based on it. The plan not only includes candidate answers but also integrates LLM's understanding and multiple requirements, which make question generation simple and controllable. We evaluate our approach on the FairytaleQA dataset, a well-structured QA dataset derived from child-friendly storybooks. In the dataset, the attribute label represents content control, while the local_or_sum and ex_or_im labels denote difficulty control. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous state-of-the-art results and achieves better consistency with requirements compared to prompt-based method.

The cutting-edge techniques for event reasoning play crucial and fundamental abilities underlying various natural language processing applications. Large language models (LLMs) have made significant advancements in event reasoning owing to their wealth of knowledge and reasoning capabilities. However, open-source LLMs currently in use do not consistently demonstrate exceptional proficiency in managing event reasoning. This discrepancy arises from insufficient learning of knowledge of event relations and incomplete reasoning paradigms. In this paper, we propose WizardEvent, the hybrid event-aware instruction tuning leading to better event reasoning abilities. Specifically, we first represent the events and relation of the event relational knowledge in a novel structure. We then mine the knowledge from raw text. Second, we introduce the prototypical event reasoning paradigms which include four reasoning formats. Lastly, we wrap our constructed \\eqs with our reasoning paradigms to create the instruction tuning dataset. We fine-tune to obtain WizardEvent using this enriched dataset, significantly improving their event reasoning. The performance of WizardEvent is rigorously evaluated through a series of extensive experiments across 10 event reasoning tasks. We also annotate a new dataset for event relational knowledge evaluation. The results from these evaluations demonstrate that WizardEvent substantially outperforms other instruction-tuned models, indicating the success of our approach in enhancing LLMs' proficiency in event reasoning",

For example, on the MWP benchmark GSM8K, the accuracy of GPT-3.5-Turbo and MetaMath-70B reaches 80.80% and 82.30%, respectively. One question arises, does it mean that LLMs have truly mastered related mathematical problem-solving abilities, such as the ability to evaluate the mathematical reasoning process of MWP? In this paper, by presenting two types of benchmarks, where MCGSM8K aims at selecting one correct solution from four solutions, while GSM8K-Judgement judges whether a solution to a given question is true or false, we show that the ability of most LLMs to evaluate the mathematical reasoning process of MWP is far from sufficient. To compensate for this issue, we propose hybrid supervised fine-tuning data from the training data of GSM8K, MCGSM8K, and GSM8K-Judegment, which significantly improves performance on the proposed reasoning process evaluation benchmarks. For example, fine-tuning improves the performance of LLaMA-2-13B from 33.51% to 70.89% on MCGSM8K.

    "abstract": "Reasoning encompasses two typical types: deductive reasoning and inductive reasoning. Despite extensive research into the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), most studies have failed to rigorously differentiate between inductive and deductive reasoning, leading to a blending of the two. This raises an essential question: In LLM reasoning, which poses a greater challenge - deductive or inductive reasoning? While the deductive reasoning capabilities of LLMs, (i.e. their capacity to follow instructions in reasoning tasks), have received considerable attention, their abilities in true inductive reasoning remain largely unexplored. To delve into the true inductive reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we propose a novel framework, SolverLearner. This framework enables LLMs to learn the underlying function (i.e., $y = f_w(x)$), that maps input data points $(x)$ to their corresponding output values $(y)$, using only in-context examples. By focusing on inductive reasoning and separating it from LLM-based deductive reasoning, we can isolate and investigate inductive reasoning of LLMs in its pure form via SolverLearner. Our observations reveal that LLMs demonstrate remarkable inductive reasoning capabilities through SolverLearner, achieving near-perfect performance with ACC of 1 in most cases. Surprisingly, despite their strong inductive reasoning abilities, LLMs tend to relatively lack deductive capabilities, particularly in tasks involving ``counterfactual'' reasoning",

NL's status as the optimal format for LLMs, particularly in single-LLM reasoning and multi-agent communication, has not been thoroughly examined. In this work, we challenge the default use of NL by exploring the utility of non-NL formats in these contexts. We show that allowing LLMs to autonomously select the most suitable format before reasoning or communicating leads to a 3.3 to 5.7% improvement in reasoning efficiency for different LLMs, and up to a 72.7% reduction in token usage in multi-agent communication, all while maintaining communicative effectiveness. Our comprehensive analysis further reveals that LLMs can devise a format from limited task instructions and that the devised format is effectively transferable across different LLMs. Intriguingly, the structured communication format decided by LLMs exhibits notable parallels with established agent communication languages, suggesting a natural evolution towards efficient, structured communication in agent communication",

To harmonize the inherent conflicts among the various styles and qualities in multi-source data, we introduce data-specific prompts, termed AlchemistPrompts, inspired by hindsight relabeling, to improve the consistency between instructions and responses. We further propose to incorporate the data evolution process itself into the fine-tuning data to enhance the code comprehension capabilities of LLMs, including instruction evolution, data filtering, and code review. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AlchemistCoder holds a clear lead among all models of the same size (6.7B/7B) and rivals or even surpasses larger models (15B/33B/70B), showcasing the efficacy of our method in refining instruction-following capabilities and advancing the boundaries of code intelligence",

    "abstract": "However, fine-tuning with extra data, a common practice to gain speciality, often leads to catastrophic forgetting (CF) of previously acquired versatility, hindering the model's performance across diverse tasks. In response to this challenge, we propose CoFiTune, a coarse to fine framework in an attempt to strike the balance between speciality and versatility. At the coarse-grained level, an empirical tree-search algorithm is utilized to pinpoint and update specific modules that are crucial for speciality, while keeping other parameters frozen; at the fine-grained level, a soft-masking mechanism regulates the update to the LLMs, mitigating the CF issue without harming speciality. In an overall evaluation of both speciality and versatility, CoFiTune consistently outperforms baseline methods across diverse tasks and model scales. Compared to the full-parameter SFT, CoFiTune leads to about 14% versatility improvement and marginal speciality loss on a 13B model.

Moreover, by formulating a joint embedding space for text, audio, and sign, we bind data from the three modalities and leverage the semantic consistency across modalities to provide informative feedback signals for the model training. This embedding-consistency learning strategy minimizes the reliance on triplet sign language data and ensures continuous model refinement, even with a missing audio modality.

    "abstract": "While auxiliary information has become a key to enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs), relatively little is known about how LLMs merge these contexts, specifically contexts generated by LLMs and those retrieved from external sources. To investigate this, we formulate a systematic framework to identify whether LLMs' responses, derived from the integration of generated and retrieved contexts, are attributed to either generated or retrieved contexts. To easily trace the origin of the response, we construct datasets with conflicting contexts, i.e., each question is paired with both generated and retrieved contexts, yet only one of them contains the correct answer. Our experiments reveal a significant bias in several LLMs (GPT-4/3.5 and Llama2) to favor generated contexts, even when they provide incorrect information. We further identify two key factors contributing to this bias: i) contexts generated by LLMs typically show greater similarity to the questions, increasing their likelihood of being selected; ii) the segmentation process used in retrieved contexts disrupts their completeness, thereby hindering their full utilization in LLMs. Our analysis enhances the understanding of how LLMs merge diverse contexts, offering valuable insights for advancing current augmentation methods for LLMs",

    "abstract": "Although model editing has shown promise in revising knowledge in Large Language Models (LLMs), its impact on the inherent capabilities of LLMs is often overlooked. In this work, we reveal a critical phenomenon: even a single edit can trigger model collapse, manifesting as significant performance degradation in various benchmark tasks. However, benchmarking LLMs after each edit, while necessary to prevent such collapses, is impractically time-consuming and resource-intensive. To mitigate this, we propose using perplexity as a surrogate metric, validated by extensive experiments demonstrating its strong correlation with downstream tasks performance. We further conduct an in-depth study on sequential editing, a practical setting for real-world scenarios, across various editing methods and LLMs, focusing on hard cases from our previous single edit studies. The results indicate that nearly all examined editing methods result in model collapse after only few edits. To facilitate further research, we have utilized ChatGPT to develop a new dataset, HardEdit, based on those hard cases.

Given the diversity of downstream tasks and varying demands, efficiently deploying multiple full-parameter fine-tuned models presents a significant challenge. To address this, we analyze $\\textit{Balanced Intermediate Dropout}$, a distribution-related phenomenon, whereby the matrix-computed intermediate results for the delta weight of each fine-tuned model have extremely small variance and min-max range.

    "abstract": "Recent language model (LM) advancements have showcased impressive zero-shot voice conversion (VC) performance. However, existing LM-based VC models usually apply offline conversion from source semantics to acoustic features, demanding the complete source speech, and limiting their deployment to real-time applications. In this paper, we introduce StreamVoice, a novel streaming LM-based model for zero-shot VC, facilitating real-time conversion given arbitrary speaker prompts and source speech. Specifically, to enable streaming capability, StreamVoice employs a fully causal context-aware LM with a temporal-independent acoustic predictor, while alternately processing semantic and acoustic features at each time step of autoregression which eliminates the dependence on complete source speech. To address the potential performance degradation from the incomplete context in streaming processing, we enhance the context-awareness of the LM through two strategies: 1) teacher-guided context foresight, using a teacher model to summarize the present and future semantic context during training to guide the model's forecasting for missing context; 2) semantic masking strategy, promoting acoustic prediction from preceding corrupted semantic and acoustic input, enhancing context-learning ability. Notably, StreamVoice is the first LM-based streaming zero-shot VC model without any future look-ahead. Experiments demonstrate StreamVoice's streaming conversion capability while achieving zero-shot performance comparable to non-streaming VC systems",

As is observed, intermediate guided profile generation enables LLMs to summarize, and extract the important, distinctive features from the personal context into concise, descriptive sentences, precisely tailoring their generation more closely to an individual's unique habits and preferences.

    "abstract": "As the scale of Large Language Models (LLMs) increases, it is necessary to compress the models to reduce the substantial demand on computational resources. Network pruning significantly reduces the model size by converting the weight matrix from dense to sparse data format. Current methodologies advocate for one-shot pruning to avoid the expense of retraining, ensuring the maintenance of model performance under conditions of 50%-60% unstructured pruning. Nevertheless, matrices characterized by this level of sparsity could not be treated as sparse matrices, because the indices would incur significant costs. To mitigate this problem, NVIDIA introduced the 2:4 structured sparsity. However, we observe a notable decline in model performance when adopting 2:4 structured sparsity due to group constraints. In this paper, we introduce the Weight Recover Prune (WRP) approach. By recovering a minimal set of critical weights, WRP aims to enhance model performance while maintaining the efficiency of the compression. Our evaluation of the WRP method on the LLAMA2 and OPT models shows that it outperforms other 2:4 pattern one-shot pruning methods.

To address these issues, we propose EditBias, an efficient model editing method to remove stereotyped bias from language models with small editor networks. We design a debiasing loss to guide editor networks to conduct local edits on partial parameters for debiasing, and a remaining loss to preserve the original language modeling abilities of models during editing. Experiments demonstrate the high effectiveness and robustness of EditBias on eliminating bias compared to classical debiasing baselines. Additionally, we explore the effects of bias and debiasing on language models, finding that it is challenging to debias larger and causal language models, and necessary to balance the trade-off between debiasing efforts and language modeling abilities when designing debiasing strategies",

A MOR builds reasoning logic over a finite state machine (FSM) that solves problems through autonomous executions and transitions over disentangled modules. This allows humans to provide direct feedback to the individual modules, and thus naturally forms process supervision. Based on this reasoning and feedback framework, we develop A MOR through two-stage fine-tuning: warm-up and adaptation. The former fine-tunes the LLM with examples automatically constructed from various public datasets and enables A MOR to generalize across different knowledge environments, while the latter tailors A MOR to specific domains using process feedback.

Typically, reward models are trained to align with human preferences and are then utilized to optimize the pretrained language models. However, given the multifaceted nature of human preferences, it is challenging to appropriately combine rewards from different aspects. Recent studies have developed algorithms to address this issue by employing techniques such as weighting, and ranking. Nonetheless, these methods can perform poorly in certain scenarios despite their elegant design. In this paper, we explore the reward composition problem from a novel perspective. We posit that different reward models focus on distinct optimization directions, which the language model cannot discern, perceiving only the reward value. To formulate an appropriate reward signal, we introduce a global reward model that composes rewards from various aspects in a self-supervised manner, a simple yet effective approach. This global reward model can be trained without the need for additional supervised data and is compatible with any type of reward model.

    "title": "Zero-Shot Position Debiasing for Large Language Models",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Fine-tuning has been demonstrated to be an effective method to improve the domain performance of large language models (LLMs). However, LLMs might fit the dataset bias and shortcuts for prediction, leading to poor generation performance. Previous works have proven that LLMs are prone to exhibit position bias, i.e., leveraging information positioned at the beginning or end, or specific positional cues within the input. Existing debiasing methods for LLMs require external bias knowledge or annotated non-biased samples, which is lacking for position debiasing and impractical in reality. In this work, we propose a zero-shot position debiasing (ZOE) framework to mitigate position bias for LLMs. ZOE leverages unsupervised responses from pre-trained LLMs for debiasing without relying on any external knowledge. To improve the quality of unsupervised responses, we propose a MSA module to prune these responses. Experiments on eight datasets and five tasks show that ZOE consistently outperforms existing methods in mitigating three types of position biases. Besides, ZOE achieves this by sacrificing only a small performance on biased samples, which is general and effective",

    "abstract": "In this study, we aim to reduce generation latency for Named Entity Recognition (NER) with Large Language Models (LLMs). The main cause of high latency in LLMs is the sequential decoding process, which autoregressively generates all labels and mentions for NER, significantly increase the sequence length. To this end, we introduce Parallel Decoding in LLM for NER (PaDeLLM-NER), a approach that integrates seamlessly into existing generative model frameworks without necessitating additional modules or architectural modifications. PaDeLLM-NER accelerates decoding by simultaneous generating all mentions at once, i.e., a label-mention pair per sequence. This results in shorter sequences and faster inference. Experiments reveal that PaDeLLM-NER significantly increases inference speed that is 1.76 to 10.22 times faster than the autoregressive approach for both English and Chinese. Concurrently, it maintains the prediction quality as evidenced by the micro F-score that is on par with the state-of-the-art across various datasets",

    "title": "LauraGPT: Listen, Attend, Understand, and Regenerate Audio with GPT",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) models have achieved remarkable performance on various natural language processing tasks, and have shown great potential as backbones for audio-and-text large language models (LLMs). Previous mainstream audio-and-text LLMs use discrete audio tokens to represent both input and output audio; however, they suffer from performance degradation on tasks such as automatic speech recognition, speech-to-text translation, and speech enhancement over models using continuous speech features. In this paper, we propose LauraGPT, a novel unified audio-and-text GPT-based LLM for audio recognition, understanding, and generation. LauraGPT is a versatile LLM that can process both audio and text inputs and generate outputs in either modalities. We propose a novel data representation that combines continuous and discrete features for audio: LauraGPT encodes input audio into continuous representations using an audio encoder and generates output audio from discrete codec codes. We propose a one-step codec vocoder to overcome the prediction challenge caused by the multimodal distribution of codec tokens. We fine-tune LauraGPT using supervised multi-task learning. Extensive experiments show that LauraGPT consistently achieves comparable to superior performance compared to strong baselines on a wide range of audio tasks related to content, semantics, paralinguistics, and audio-signal analysis, such as automatic speech recognition, speech-to-text translation, text-to-speech synthesis, speech enhancement, automated audio captioning, speech emotion recognition, and spoken language understanding",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Building machines with commonsense has been a longstanding challenge in NLP due to the reporting bias of commonsense rules and the exposure bias of rule-based commonsense reasoning. In contrast, humans convey and pass down commonsense implicitly through stories. This paper investigates the inherent commonsense ability of large language models (LLMs) expressed through storytelling. We systematically investigate and compare stories and rules for retrieving and leveraging commonsense in LLMs. Experimental results on 28 commonsense QA datasets show that stories outperform rules as the expression for retrieving commonsense from LLMs, exhibiting higher generation confidence and commonsense accuracy. Moreover, stories are the more effective commonsense expression for answering questions regarding daily events, while rules are more effective for scientific questions. This aligns with the reporting bias of commonsense in text corpora. We further show that the correctness and relevance of commonsense stories can be further improved via iterative self-supervised fine-tuning. These findings emphasize the importance of using appropriate language to express, retrieve, and leverage commonsense for LLMs, highlighting a promising direction for better exploiting their commonsense abilities",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are being tasked with increasingly open-ended, delicate, and subjective tasks. In particular, retrieval-augmented models can now answer contentious or subjective questions (e.g., \"is aspartame linked to cancer\") and in doing so, conditioning on arbitrary websites that vary wildly in style, format, and veracity. Importantly, information from these websites will often conflict with one another. Humans are faced with similar conflicts, and in order to come to an answer they critically evaluate the arguments, trustworthiness, and credibility of a source. In this work, we study what types of evidence current LLMs find convincing, and if they make judgements that align with human preferences. Specifically, we construct ConflictingQA, a benchmark that pairs controversial questions with a series of evidence documents that contain different facts (e.g., quantitative results), argument styles (e.g., appeals to authority), and answers (Yes or No). Using this benchmark, we perform sensitivity analyses and counterfactual experiments to explore how in-the-wild differences in text affect model judgements. We find that models overkey off the relevance of a website to the user's search query. On the other hand, the stylistic features tested tended to have little influence on model predictions",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) may generate text that lacks consistency with human knowledge, leading to factual inaccuracies or hallucination. Existing research for evaluating the factuality of LLMs involves extracting fact claims using an LLM and verifying them against a predefined fact source. However, these evaluation metrics are task-specific, and not scalable, and the substitutability of fact sources in different tasks is under-explored. To address these challenges, we categorize four available fact sources: human-written evidence, reference documents, search engine results, and LLM knowledge, along with five text generation tasks containing six representative datasets. Then, we propose UFO, an LLM-based unified and flexible evaluation framework to verify facts against plug-and-play fact sources. We implement five evaluation scenarios based on this framework. Experimental results show that for most QA tasks, human-written evidence and reference documents are crucial, and they can substitute for each other in retrieval-augmented QA tasks.

    "title": "RelayAttention for Efficient Large Language Model Serving with Long System Prompts",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Practical large language model (LLM) services may involve a long system prompt, which specifies the instructions, examples, and knowledge documents of the task and is reused across numerous requests. However, the long system prompt causes throughput/latency bottlenecks as the cost of generating the next token grows w.r.t. the sequence length. This paper aims to improve the efficiency of LLM services that involve long system prompts. Our key observation is that handling these system prompts requires heavily redundant memory accesses in existing causal attention computation algorithms. Specifically, for batched requests, the cached hidden states (\\ie, key-value pairs) of system prompts are transferred from off-chip DRAM to on-chip SRAM multiple times, each corresponding to an individual request. To eliminate such a redundancy, we propose RelayAttention, an attention algorithm that allows reading these hidden states from DRAM exactly once for a batch of input tokens. RelayAttention is a free lunch: it maintains the generation quality while requiring no model retraining, as it is based on a mathematical reformulation of causal attention",

However, LLMs are complex statistical learners without straightforward deductive rules, making them prone to unexpected behaviors. In this study, we highlight the limitations of LLMs in simulating human interactions, particularly focusing on LLMs' ability to simulate political debates. Our findings indicate a tendency for LLM agents to conform to the model's inherent social biases despite being directed to debate from certain political perspectives. This tendency results in behavioral patterns that seem to deviate from well-established social dynamics among humans. We reinforce these observations using an automatic self-fine-tuning method, which enables us to manipulate the biases within the LLM and demonstrate that agents subsequently align with the altered biases. These results underscore the need for further research to develop methods that help agents overcome these biases, a critical step toward creating more realistic simulations",

Through a modified version of the standard supervised contrastive loss, COCONUT preserves the learned representations by pulling closer samples from the same class and pushing away the others. Moreover, we leverage a multimodal contrastive loss that helps the model learn more discriminative representations of the new data by aligning audio and text features. We also investigate different contrastive designs to combine the strengths of the contrastive loss with teacher-student architectures used for distillation. Experiments on two established SLU datasets reveal the effectiveness of our proposed approach and significant improvements over the baselines.

To explore the origins of the LLMs personality, we conduct experiments on pre-trained language models (PLMs, such as BERT and GPT) and Chat models (ChatLLMs, such as ChatGPT). The results show that LLMs do contain certain personalities, for example, we think ChatGPT tends to exhibit openness, conscientiousness and neuroticism, while ChatGLM only exhibited conscientiousness and neuroticism. More importantly, we find that the personality of LLMs comes from their pre-training data, and the instruction data can facilitate the generation of data containing personality. We also compare the results of LLMs with the human average personality score, and find that the humanity of FLAN-T5 in PLMs and ChatGPT in ChatLLMs is more similar to that of a human, with score differences of 0.34 and 0.22, respectively",

The early exit approach, involving obtaining results from different intermediate layers for each token before reaching the final layer, offers a promising solution for accelerating auto-regressive decoding.

Our findings indicate that early exit is a natural capability within Transformer-based models. While joint optimization is not strictly necessary for early exit capability, it must be employed to address challenges by 1) improving the accuracy of locating the optimal early exit layer through gating functions and 2) mitigating key-value copy issues. Additionally, we uncover tendencies in early exit behavior that make the model struggle to predict the first sub-word in a word and identify the potential for early exit strategies based on sub-layers",

Distilling Step-by-Step (DSS), a novel method utilizing chain-of-thought (CoT) distillation, has demonstrated promise by imbuing smaller models with the superior reasoning capabilities of their larger counterparts. In DSS, the distilled model acquires the ability to generate rationales and predict labels concurrently through a multi-task learning framework. However, DSS overlooks the intrinsic relationship between the two training tasks, leading to ineffective integration of CoT knowledge with the task of label prediction. To this end, we investigate the mutual relationship of the two tasks from Information Bottleneck perspective and formulate it as maximizing the mutual information of the representation features of the two tasks. We propose a variational approach to solve this optimization problem using a learning-based method.

Motivated by the observation that adding more concise CoT examples in the prompt can improve LLM reasoning performance, CoT-Influx employs a coarse-to-fine pruner to maximize the input of effective and concise CoT examples. The pruner first selects as many crucial CoT examples as possible and then prunes unimportant tokens to fit the context window. A math reasoning dataset with diverse difficulty levels and reasoning steps is used to train the pruner, along with a math-specialized reinforcement learning approach. As a result, by enabling more CoT examples with double the context window size in tokens, CoT-Influx significantly outperforms various prompting baselines across various LLMs (LLaMA2-7B, 13B, 70B) and 5 math datasets, achieving up to 4.55% absolute improvements.

Our approach involves initializing two CoT promptings, performing evolutionary operations based on LLMs to create a varied set, and utilizing the LLMs to select a suitable CoT prompting for a given problem. Additionally, a rewriting operation, guided by the selected CoT prompting, enhances the understanding of the LLMs about the problem. Extensive experiments conducted across ten reasoning datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method compared to current zero-shot CoT prompting methods on GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4. Moreover, in-depth analytical experiments underscore the adaptability and effectiveness of our method in various reasoning tasks",

    "title": "An Element is Worth a Thousand Words: Enhancing Legal Case Retrieval by Incorporating Legal Elements",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Legal case retrieval plays an important role in promoting judicial justice and fairness. One of its greatest challenges is that the definition of relevance goes far beyond the common semantic relevance as in ad-hoc retrieval.In this paper, we reveal that the legal elements, which typically comprise key facts in a specialized legal context, can largely improve the relevance matching of legal case retrieval. To facilitate the use of legal elements, we construct a Chinese legal element dataset called LeCaRD-Elem based on the widely-used LeCaRD dataset, through a two-stage semi-automatic method with a minimized reliance on human labor. Meanwhile, we introduce two new models to enhance legal search using legal elements. The first, Elem4LCR-E, is a two-stage model that explicitly predicts legal elements from texts and then leverages them for improved ranking. Recognizing the potential benefits of more seamless integration, we further propose an end-to-end model called Elem4LCR-I, which internalizes the legal element knowledge into its model parameters using a tailored teacher-student training framework. Extensive experiments underscore the significant value of legal elements and demonstrate the superiority of our two proposed models in enhancing legal search over existing methods",

    "title": "Structure-Aware Adapter for Large Language Model",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown effective in various natural language processing tasks, especially when fine-tuned on specific downstream scenarios. However, the full fine-tuning of LLMs is usually computationally expensive and time-consuming due to the ever-increasing parameter size. In addition, while the LLMs are pre-trained to memorize the facts and knowledge from unstructured textual corpora, they cannot be well generalized to some domain-specific scenarios where additional structured knowledge is required, such as enterprise databases or social graphs. In this paper, we design a novel structure-aware adapter for LLMs to utilize structured relational information from knowledge graphs with a structure-aware relational attention mechanism. The proposed adapter framework only introduces a small scale of new parameters and therefore significantly reduces the cost of fine-tuning, without perturbing the initial pre-trained parameters of LLMs. We also propose a knowledge-graph-induced path-of-thought prompt to enhance the utilization of the LLM adapter to retrieve information from the knowledge graph. We evaluate the proposed model on two question-answering benchmarks. The evaluation results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art LLM adapters by 4.1%-15.9% and 1.4%-17.6% in question-answering accuracy of CSQA and OBQA datasets. Ablation studies are also discussed to prove the effectiveness of the proposed modules",

    "abstract": "Program induction (PI) has become a promising paradigm for using knowledge bases (KBs) to help large language models (LLMs) answer complex knowledge-intensive questions. Nonetheless, PI typically relies on a large number of parallel question-program pairs to make the LLM aware of the schema of the given KB, and is thus challenging for many low-resourced KBs that lack annotated data. To this end, we propose KB-Plugin, a plug-and-play framework that enables LLMs to induce programs over any low-resourced KB. Firstly, KB-Plugin adopts self-supervised learning to encode the detailed schema information of a given KB into a pluggable module, namely schema plugin. Secondly, KB-Plugin utilizes abundant annotated data from a rich-resourced KB to train another pluggable module, namely PI plugin, which can help the LLM extract question-relevant schema information from the schema plugin of any KB and utilize this information to induce programs over this KB. Experiments on five heterogeneous KBQA datasets show that KB-Plugin achieves better or comparable performance with 25x smaller backbone LLM compared to SoTA PI methods for low-resourced KBs, and even approaches the performance of supervised methods",

    "abstract": "Advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have led to significant progress in generating natural language descriptions for visual contents. These powerful models are known for producing texts that are factually inconsistent with the visual input. While some efforts mitigate such inconsistencies in natural image captioning, the factuality of generated captions for structured visuals, such as charts, has not received as much scrutiny. This work introduces a comprehensive typology of factual errors in generated chart captions. A large-scale human annotation effort provides insight into the error patterns in captions generated by various models, ultimately forming the foundation of a dataset, CHOCOLATE. Our analysis reveals that even advanced models like GPT-4V frequently produce captions laced with factual inaccuracies. To combat this, we establish the task of Chart Caption Factual Error Correction and introduce CHARTVE, a visual entailment model that outperforms current LVLMs in evaluating caption factuality. Furthermore, we propose C2TFEC, an interpretable two-stage framework that excels at correcting factual errors. This work inaugurates a new domain in factual error correction for chart captions, presenting a novel evaluation metric, and demonstrating an effective approach to ensuring the factuality of generated chart captions",

Experimental results demonstrate that QueryAgent notably outperforms all previous few-shot methods using only one example on GrailQA and GraphQ by 7.0 and 15.0 points. Furthermore, our approach exhibits superiority in terms of efficiency, including run-time, query overhead, and API invocation costs.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Conversational dense retrieval has shown to be effective in conversational search. However, a major limitation of conversational dense retrieval is their lack of interpretability, hindering intuitive understanding of model behaviors for targeted improvements. This paper presents CONVINV, a simple yet effective approach to shed light on interpretable conversational dense retrieval models. CONVINV transforms opaque conversational session embeddings into explicitly interpretable text while faithfully maintaining their original retrieval performance as much as possible. Such transformation is achieved by training a recently proposed Vec2Text model based on the ad-hoc query encoder, leveraging the fact that the session and query embeddings share the same space in existing conversational dense retrieval.To further enhance interpretability, we propose to incorporate external interpretable query rewrites into the transformation process. Extensive evaluations on three conversational search benchmarks demonstrate that CONVINV can yield more interpretable text and faithfully preserve original retrieval performance than baselines. Our work connects opaque session embeddings with transparent query rewriting, paving the way toward trustworthy conversational search",

    "title": "Generalizing Conversational Dense Retrieval via LLM-Cognition Data Augmentation",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Conversational search utilizes muli-turn natural language contexts to retrieve relevant passages. Existing conversational dense retrieval models mostly view a conversation as a fixed sequence of questions and responses, overlooking the severe data sparsity problem -- that is, users can perform a conversation in various ways, and these alternate conversations are unrecorded. Consequently, they often struggle to generalize to diverse conversations in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a framework for generalizing Conversational dense retrieval via LLM-cognition data Augmentation (ConvAug). We first generate multi-level augmented conversations to capture the diverse nature of conversational contexts. Inspired by human cognition, we devise a cognition-aware prompting process to mitigate the generation of false positives, false negatives, and hallucinations. Moreover, we develop a difficulty-adaptive sample filter that selects challenging samples for complex conversations, thereby giving the model a larger learning space. A contrastive learning objective is then employed to train a better conversational context encoder. Extensive experiments conducted on four public datasets, under both normal and zero-shot settings, demonstrate the effectiveness, generalizability, and applicability of ConvAug",

    "abstract": "As versatile agents, large-scale language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across various domains. Their capabilities in language-based pattern recognition and machine learning have garnered significant attention and have been applied to numerous tasks with remarkable success. However, different LLMs still rely on specific instruction prompts, and the design of prompt tokens is still heavily dependent on manual design, which hinders the widespread application of LLMs. In response to this challenge, we propose a concise and effective input optimization method, which consists of two modules: original input rewriting and filtering. Inspired by the concept of collaboration between large and small models, we introduce a rewriting module between input prompts and LLMs inference. This module rewrites the input component based on the preferences of the LLMs for the data. The filtering module performs the quality inspection on the rewritten data and filters out invalid and hallucinatory data. Experimental results on language pattern recognition tasks verify that our rewriting and filtering method effectively transforms ambiguous data into more precise input prompts. In comparison to the original inputs, performance improvement is consistently observed across various tasks",

In this work, we propose an inference-time method, Self-Highlighted Hesitation (SH2), to help LLMs decode more truthfully. SH2 is based on a simple fact rooted in information theory that for an LLM, the tokens predicted with lower probabilities are prone to be more informative than others. Our analysis shows that the tokens assigned with lower probabilities by an LLM are more likely to be closely related to factual information, such as nouns, proper nouns, and adjectives. Therefore, we propose to \"highlight'' the factual information by selecting the tokens with the lowest probabilities and concatenating them to the original context, thus forcing the model to repeatedly read and hesitate on these tokens before generation. During decoding, we also adopt contrastive decoding to emphasize the difference in the output probabilities brought by the hesitation. Experimental results demonstrate that our SH2, requiring no additional data or models, can effectively help LLMs elicit factual knowledge and distinguish hallucinated contexts. Significant and consistent improvements are achieved by SH2 for LLaMA-7b, LLaMA2-7b and Mistral-7b on multiple hallucination tasks",

ANAH consists of ~12k sentence-level annotations for ~4.3k LLM responses covering over 700 topics, constructed by a human-in-the-loop pipeline.

    "title": "TransliCo: A Contrastive Learning Framework to Address the Script Barrier in Multilingual Pretrained Language Models",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "The world's more than 7000 languages are written in at least 293 scripts. Due to various reasons, many closely related languages use different scripts, which poses a difficulty for multilingual pretrained language models (mPLMs) in learning crosslingual knowledge through lexical overlap. As a consequence, mPLMs are faced with a script barrier: representations from different scripts are located in different subspaces, which can result in crosslingual transfer involving languages of different scripts performing suboptimally. To address this problem, we propose Furina, a framework that optimizes the Transliteration Contrastive Modeling (TCM) objective to fine-tune an mPLM by contrasting sentences in its training data and their transliterations in a unified script (in our case Latin), which enhances uniformity in the representation space for different scripts. Using Glot500-m, an mPLM pretrained on over 500 languages, as our source model, we fine-tune it on a small portion (5%) of its training data, and refer to the resulting model as Furina. We show that Furina not only better aligns representations from distinct scripts but also outperforms the original Glot500-m on various crosslingual transfer tasks. Additionally, we achieve consistent improvement in a case study on the Indic group where the languages are highly related but use different scripts. We make our code and models publicly available",

Efficient data management, particularly in formulating a well-suited training dataset, is significant for enhancing model performance and improving training efficiency during pretraining and supervised fine-tuning stages. Despite the considerable importance of data management, the current research community still falls short in providing a systematic analysis of the effects of data management strategy selection, methodologies for evaluating curated datasets, and the ongoing pursuit of improved strategies. Consequently, the exploration of data management has attracted more and more attention among the research community. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of current research in data management within both the pretraining and supervised fine-tuning stages of LLMs, covering various noteworthy aspects of data management strategy design: data quantity, data quality, domain/task composition, etc. Looking toward the future, we extrapolate existing challenges and outline promising directions for development in this field. Therefore, this survey serves as a guiding resource for practitioners aspiring to construct powerful LLMs through efficient data management practices",

Yet, how to evaluate and analyze the tool utilization capability of LLMs is still under-explored. In contrast to previous works that evaluate models holistically, we comprehensively decompose the tool utilization into multiple sub-processes, including instruction following, planning, reasoning, retrieval, understanding, and review. Based on that, we further introduce T-Eval to evaluate the tool-utilization capability step by step. T-Eval disentangles the tool utilization evaluation into several sub-domains along model capabilities, facilitating the inner understanding of both holistic and isolated competency of LLMs. We conduct extensive experiments on T-Eval and in-depth analysis of various LLMs. T-Eval not only exhibits consistency with the outcome-oriented evaluation but also provides a more fine-grained analysis of the capabilities of LLMs, providing a new perspective in LLM evaluation on tool-utilization ability.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "3D spatial sound field synthesis takes the head-mounted audio signals and body poses as input and renders a 3D sound field around the center body, in which spatial audio can be inferred at any arbitrary position. To achieve this, a multi-modal system is required to spatialize input audio signals with the guidance of pose streams. Then, a numerical method is used to render the sound field with hundreds of spatial audio. However, there exist several challenges including hybrid audio input signals, cross-modal matching, and few data resources. To address them, we propose NAT3DSound, a unit-based framework for high-quality 3D spatial sound synthesis, which consists of 1) a general tokenization scheme for both dense and impulsive input audio signals, 2) a non-autoregressive transformer with multi-scale modality fusion for efficient cross-modal alignment and 3) a parallel sampling strategy for fast prediction. Furthermore, we investigate the feasibility of acoustic pre-training for low-resource learning in data-scarce scenarios. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of NAT3DSound in terms of spatialization quality and generalization ability.

    "abstract": "Visual grounding (VG) aims at locating the foreground entities that match the given natural language expression. Previous datasets and methods for classic VG task mainly rely on the prior assumption that the given expression must literally refer to the target object, which greatly impedes the practical deployment of agents in real-world scenarios. Since users usually prefer to provide the intention-based expressions for the desired object instead of covering all the details, it is necessary for the agents to interpret the intention-driven instructions. Thus, in this work, we take a step further to the intention-driven visual-language (V-L) understanding. To promote classic VG towards human intention interpretation, we propose a new intention-driven visual grounding (IVG) task and build a largest-scale IVG dataset named IntentionVG with free-form intention expressions. Considering that practical agents need to move and find specific targets among various scenarios to realize the grounding task, our IVG task and IntentionVG dataset have taken the crucial properties of both multi-scenario perception and egocentric view into consideration. Besides, various types of models are set up as the baselines to realize our IVG task. Extensive experiments on our IntentionVG dataset and baselines demonstrate the necessity and efficacy of our method for the V-L field. To foster future research in this direction, our newly built dataset and baselines will be publicly available",

In this work, we examine the proficiency of LLMs in crafting succinct survey articles specific to the niche field of NLP in computer science, focusing on a curated list of 99 topics.

While our findings suggest that GPT-created surveys are more contemporary and accessible than human-authored ones, certain limitations were observed.

After training, such masked language models (MLMs) can provide distributions of tokens in the masked positions in a sequence. However, this paper shows that distributions corresponding to different masking patterns can demonstrate considerable inconsistencies, i.e., they cannot be derived from a coherent joint distribution when considered together. This fundamental flaw in MLMs can lead to self-contradictory behaviors during inference. On various benchmark datasets including MMLU, MLMs can give different predictions to the same input question. From BERT-base to UL2-20B, we show that such inconsistencies exist ubiquitously in MLMs of diverse sizes and configurations. In light of our observations, we further propose an inference-time strategy for MLMs called Ensemble of Conditionals. It jointly considers a selected range of inconsistent conditionals directly produced by the MLM for the final prediction, which often leads to considerable accuracy improvement",

Through comparisons, we prove that the model exhibits information loss from the question over the shallow attention layers when generating rationales or answers. Based on the probing findings, we design a novel method called RIDERS (Residual decodIng and sERial-position Swap), which compensates for the information deficit in the model from both decoding and serial-position perspectives.

This limitation could potentially be ascribed to the fact that the generated codes, albeit functionally accurate, frequently display a pronounced stylistic deviation from the ground truth code in the codebase. In this paper, we extend the foundational GAR framework and propose a simple yet effective method that additionally Rewrites the Code (ReCo) within the codebase for style normalization. Experimental results demonstrate that ReCo significantly boosts retrieval accuracy across sparse (up to 35.7\\%), zero-shot dense (up to 27.6\\%), and fine-tuned dense (up to 23.6\\%) retrieval settings in diverse search scenarios.

We propose a Knowledge Prefix Adapter (KoPA) to fulfill this stated goal. The KoPA uses a structural pre-training phase to comprehend the intricate relations and entities within KGs. Then KoPA communicates such structural understanding to the LLMs through a knowledge prefix adapter which projects the structural embeddings into the textual space and obtains virtual knowledge tokens positioned as a prefix of the input prompt. We conduct comprehensive experiments and provide incisive analysis concerning how the introduction of structural information would be better for LLM's knowledge reasoning ability.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) offer significant potential as tools to support an expanding range of decision-making tasks. However, given their training on human (created) data, LLMs can inherit both societal biases against protected groups, as well as be subject to cognitive bias. Such human-like bias can impede fair and explainable decisions made with LLM assistance. Our work introduces \\ours, a framework designed to uncover, evaluate, and mitigate cognitive bias in LLMs, particularly in high-stakes decision-making tasks. Inspired by prior research in psychology and cognitive sciences, we develop a dataset containing 16,800 prompts to evaluate different cognitive biases (e.g., prompt-induced, sequential, inherent). We test various bias mitigation strategies, amidst proposing a novel method utilising LLMs to debias their own prompts. Our analysis provides a comprehensive picture on the presence and effects of cognitive bias across different commercial and open-source models. We demonstrate that our self-help debiasing effectively mitigate cognitive bias without having to manually craft examples for each bias type",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel Chunking-Free In-Context (CFIC) retrieval approach, specifically tailored for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Traditional RAG systems often struggle with grounding responses using precise evidence text due to the challenges of processing lengthy documents and filtering out irrelevant content. Commonly employed solutions, such as document chunking and adapting language models to handle longer contexts, have their limitations. These methods either disrupt the semantic coherence of the text or fail to effectively address the issues of noise and inaccuracy in evidence retrieval.The CFIC approach addresses these challenges by circumventing the conventional chunking process. It utilizes the encoded hidden states of documents for in-context retrieval, employing auto-aggressive decoding to accurately identify the specific evidence text required for user queries, eliminating the need for chunking. CFIC is further enhanced by incorporating two innovative decoding strategies, namely Constrained Sentence Prefix Decoding and Skip Decoding. These strategies not only improve the efficiency of the retrieval process but also ensure that the fidelity of the generated grounding text evidence is maintained.Our evaluations of CFIC on a range of open question answering datasets demonstrate its superiority in retrieving relevant and accurate information, offering a significant improvement over traditional methods. By doing away with the need for document chunking, CFIC presents a more streamlined, effective, and efficient retrieval solution, making it a valuable advancement in the field of RAG systems",

    "abstract": "Text-Video Retrieval (TVR) aims to align relevant video content with natural language queries. To date, most of the state-of-the-art TVR methods learn image-to-video transfer learning based on the large-scale pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP). However, fully fine-tuning these pre-trained models for TVR incurs prohibitively expensive computation cost. To this end, we propose to conduct efficient text-video Retrieval with a salient-and-correlated AdaPter (RAP), i.e., fine-tuning the pre-trained model with a few parameterized layers. To accommodate the text-video scenario, we equip our RAP with two indispensable characteristics including temporal sparsity and correlation. Specifically, we propose a low-rank modulation module to refine the per-image features from frozen CLIP backbone, which accentuates silent frames within the video features while alleviating temporal redundancy. Besides, we introduce an asynchronous self-attention mechanism which firstly selects top responsive visual patch and augments the correlation modeling between them with learnable temporal and patch offsets. Extensive experiments on four TVR datasets demonstrate that our RAP achieves superior or comparable performance compared to the fully fine-tuned counterpart and other parameter-efficient finetuning methods",

    "abstract": "We explore the mechanism of in-context learning and propose a hypothesis using locate-and-project method. In shallow layers, the features of demonstrations are merged into their corresponding labels, and the features of the input text are aggregated into the last token. In deep layers, in-context heads make great contributions. In each in-context head, the value-output matrix extracts the labels' features. Query and key matrices compute the attention weights between the input text and each demonstration. The larger the attention weight is, the more label information is transferred into the last token for predicting the next word. Query and key matrices can be regarded as two towers for learning the similarity metric between the input text and each demonstration. Based on this hypothesis, we explain why imbalanced labels and demonstration order affect predictions. We conduct experiments on GPT2 large, Llama 7B, 13B and 30B.

While previous studies have made strides in optimizing model performance, there is a pressing need to bolster the model's capacity for diagnostic logic to ensure patient safety. In response to this need, we propose an approach termed preference learning from process feedback (PLPF), which involves integrating the doctor's diagnostic logic into LLMs. PLPF encompasses three key components: rule modeling, preference data generation, and preference alignment. These components collectively serve to train the model to adhere to the diagnostic process. Our experimental results, utilizing Standardized Patient Testing, demonstrate that PLPF enhances the diagnostic accuracy of the baseline model in medical conversations by 17.6%, surpassing the performance of traditional approaches. Moreover, PLPF exhibits effectiveness in both multi-round and single-round dialogue tasks, thereby highlighting its potential in improving medical dialogue generation",

Specifically, we encode each paper using the text embeddings by large language models, extract similar samples by cosine similarity, and synthesize a counterfactual sample by the weighted average of similar papers according to their similarity values. We apply the resulting metric, called CausalCite, as a causal formulation of paper citations. We show its effectiveness on various criteria, such as high correlation with paper impact as reported by scientific experts on a previous dataset of 1K papers, and test-of-time awards for past papers, and sub-field stable behavior.

Traditional methods focused on training models at the token level, leading to sub-optimal performance in character-level infilling tasks during the inference stage. Alternately, some approaches considered character-level infilling but they relied on predicting sub-tokens in inference, yet this strategy diminished ability in character-level infilling tasks due to the large perplexity of the model on sub-tokens. In this paper, we introduce FIM-SE, which stands for Fill-In-the-Middle with both Starting and Ending character constraints. The proposed method addresses character-level infilling tasks by utilizing a line-level format to avoid predicting any sub-token in inference.

However, the potential relationship between them is far from well studied, especially for long context window extending. In fact, anomalous behaviors harming long context extrapolation exist between Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) and vanilla self-attention unveiled by our work. To address this issue, we propose a novel attention mechanism, CoCA (\\textbf{Co}llinear \\textbf{C}onstrained \\textbf{A}ttention).

Nonetheless, this will incur significant expenses in constructing data and training model. Therefore, this paper introduces CodeM, a novel data construction strategy, which can efficiently train a versatile model using less data via our newly proposed ability matrix. CodeM uses ability matrix to decouple code LLMs' abilities into two dimensions, constructing a lightweight training corpus that only covers a subset of target scenarios. Extensive experiments on HumanEvalPack and MultiPL-E imply that code LLMs can combine the single-dimensional abilities to master composed abilities, validating the effectiveness of CodeM",

    "abstract": "Knowledge-editing updates knowledge of large language models (LLMs) and contributes to the interpretability and application of LLMs. However, knowledge applying is context-consistent: LLMs can recall the same knowledge in different contexts. Existing works ignore this property and the editing lacks generalization. Based on empirical evidence, we have observed that the effect of different contexts in recalling the same knowledge follows a Gaussian-like distribution. Hence, when editing LLMs, we sample Gaussian noises to simulate the effect of different contexts rather than requiring real contexts. We make LLMs see the unseen contexts where edited knowledge will be applied, thereby improving editing generalization. Experimental results on three LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and distinguish ours from the others of fine-tuning LLMs via noises",

We conduct extensive and comprehensive experiments on several benchmarks on mathematical question-answering and common-sense reasoning. The empirical results demonstrate that our AlignedCoT significantly improves performance over the carefully handcrafted demonstrations. Specifically, with AlignedCoT, we observe an average +3.2\\% improvement for \\texttt{gpt-3.5-turbo} compared to the carefully handcrafted CoT on multi-step reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, we use AlignedCoT to rewrite the CoT text style in the training set, which improves the performance of Retrieval Augmented Generation by 3.6\\%",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "While GPT-4V(ision) impressively models both visual and textual information simultaneously, it's hallucination behavior has not been systematically assessed. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new benchmark, namely, the Bias and Interference Challenges in Visual Language Models (Bingo). This benchmark is designed to evaluate and shed light on the two common types of hallucinations in visual language models: bias and interference. Here, bias refers to the model's tendency to hallucinate certain types of responses, possibly due to imbalance in its training data. Interference pertains to scenarios where the judgment of GPT-4V(ision) can be disrupted due to how the text prompt is phrased or how the input image is presented. We identify a notable regional bias, whereby GPT-4V(ision) is better at interpreting Western images or images with English writing compared to images from other countries or containing text in other languages. Moreover, GPT-4V(ision) is vulnerable to leading questions and is often confused when interpreting multiple images together. Popular mitigation approaches, such as self-correction and chain-of-thought reasoning, are not effective in resolving these challenges. We also identified similar biases and interference vulnerabilities with LLaVA and Bard. Our results characterize the hallucination challenges in GPT-4V(ision) and state-of-the-art visual-language models, and highlight the need for new solutions",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Recently, retrieval augmentation and tool augmentation have demonstrated a remarkable capability to expand the internal memory boundaries of language models (LMs) by providing external context. However, internal memory and external context inevitably clash, leading to knowledge conflicts within LMs. In this paper, we aim to interpret the mechanism of knowledge conflicts through the lens of information flow, and then mitigate conflicts by precise interventions at the pivotal point. We find there are some attention heads with opposite effects in the later layers, where memory heads can recall knowledge from internal memory, and context heads can retrieve knowledge from external context. Therefore, we reveal that the pivotal point at which knowledge conflicts emerge in LMs is the integration of inconsistent information flows by memory heads and context heads. Inspired by our insights, we propose a novel method called Pruning Head via PatH PatcHing (PH3), which can efficiently mitigate knowledge conflicts by pruning conflicting attention heads without updating model parameters. PH3 can flexibly control eight LMs to use internal memory ($\\uparrow$ 44.0%) or external context ($\\uparrow$ 38.5%). Moreover, PH3 can also improve the performance of LMs on open-domain QA tasks. We also conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the cross-model, cross-relation, and cross-format generalization of our method",

Meanwhile, various dropout methods, initially designed for full finetuning with all the parameters updated, alleviates overfitting associated with excessive parameter redundancy. Hence, a possible contradiction arises from negligible trainable parameters of LoRA and the effectiveness of previous dropout methods, which has been largely overlooked. To fill this gap, we first confirm that parameter-efficient LoRA is also overfitting-prone. We then revisit transformer-specific dropout methods, and establish their equivalence and distinctions mathematically and empirically. Building upon this comparative analysis, we introduce a unified framework for a comprehensive investigation, which instantiates these methods based on dropping position, structural pattern and compensation measure. Through this framework, we reveal the new preferences and performance comparisons of them when involved with limited trainable parameters. This framework also allows us to amalgamate the most favorable aspects into a novel dropout method named HiddenKey. Extensive experiments verify the remarkable superiority and sufficiency of HiddenKey across multiple models and tasks, which highlights it as the preferred approach for high-performance and parameter-efficient finetuning of LLMs",

Then, we combine the source sentence with the initial correction and feed it through an alignment model for another round of correction, aiming to enforce the alignment model to focus on potential overcorrection. Moreover, to enhance the model's ability to identify nuances, we further explore the reverse alignment of the source sentence and the initial correction. Finally, we transfer the alignment knowledge from two alignment models to the correction model, instructing it on how to avoid overcorrection. Experimental results on three CGEC datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in alleviating overcorrection and improving overall performance",

Existing quality improvement methods alter instruction data through dataset expansion or curation. However, the expansion method introduces the risk of data deficiency and redundancy, potentially compromising the correctness and accuracy of the LLM's knowledge, while the curation approach confines the LLM's potential to the original dataset. Our aim is to surpass the original data quality without confronting these shortcomings. To achieve this, we propose LIFT (LLM Instruction Fusion Transfer), a novel and versatile paradigm designed to elevate the instruction quality to new heights. LIFT strategically broadens data distribution to encompass more high-quality subspaces and eliminates redundancy, concentrating on high-quality segments across overall data subspaces. Experimental results demonstrate that, even with a limited quantity of high-quality instruction data selected by our paradigm, LLMs not only consistently uphold robust performance across natural language understanding and code generation tasks but also surpass many state-of-the-art results, highlighting the significant improvement in instruction quality achieved by our paradigm",

There are substantial differences among cultures that contribute to their affective expressions.

We study the difference in the functional relationship between arousal and valence (so-called V-shaped) among individuals in the US and China and explore the associated content differences. Furthermore, we correlate word usage and topics in both platforms to interpret their differences. We observe that for Twitter users, the variation in emotional intensity is less distinct between negative and positive emotions compared to Weibo users, and there is a sharper escalation in arousal corresponding with heightened emotions. From language features, we discover that affective expressions are associated with personal life and feelings on Twitter, while on Weibo such discussions are about socio-political topics in the society.

To begin with, we apply linear probing to LLMs. The high probing accuracy suggests that \\textit{LLMs in early pre-training can already distinguish concepts in each trustworthiness dimension}. Therefore, to further uncover the hidden possibilities of pre-training, we extract steering vectors from a LLM's pre-training checkpoints to enhance the LLM's trustworthiness. Finally, inspired by the theoretical result that mutual information estimation is bounded by linear probing accuracy, we also probe LLMs with mutual information to investigate the dynamics of trustworthiness during pre-training.

Generally, the larger the model's parameter size and the more extensive the learning data, the stronger its ICL capability. In this paper, we propose a method SLEICL that involves learning from examples using strong language models and then summarizing and transferring these learned skills to weak language models for inference and application. This ensures the stability and effectiveness of ICL. Compared to directly enabling weak language models to learn from prompt examples, SLEICL reduces the difficulty of ICL for these models. Our experiments, conducted on up to eight datasets with five language models, demonstrate that weak language models achieve consistent improvement over their own zero-shot or few-shot capabilities using the SLEICL method.

To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective Plug-and-Play Tag-guided method for few-shot Semantic Entity Recognition (PPTSER) on visually-rich documents. PPTSER is built upon off-the-shelf multi-modal pre-trained models. It leverages the semantics of the tags to guide the SER task, reformulating SER into entity typing and span detection, handling both tasks simultaneously via cross-attention. Experimental results illustrate that PPTSER outperforms existing fine-tuning and few-shot methods, especially in low-data regimes. With full training data, PPTSER achieves comparable or superior performance to fine-tuning baseline. For instance, on the FUNSD benchmark, our method improves the performance of LayoutLMv3-base in 1-shot, 3-shot and 5-shot scenarios by 15.61%, 2.13%, and 2.01%, respectively.

    "title": "Efficient Active Learning with Adapters",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "One of the main obstacles for deploying Active Learning (AL) in practical NLP tasks is high computational cost of modern deep learning models. This issue can be partially mitigated by applying lightweight models as an acquisition model, but it can lead to the acquisition-successor mismatch (ASM) problem. Previous works show that the ASM problem can be partially alleviated by using distilled versions of a successor models as acquisition ones. However, distilled versions of pretrained models are not always available. Also, the exact pipeline of model distillation that does not lead to the ASM problem is not clear. To address these issues, we propose to use adapters as an alternative to full fine-tuning for acquisition model training. Since adapters are lightweight, this approach reduces the training cost of the model. We provide empirical evidence that it does not cause the ASM problem and can help to deploy active learning in practical NLP tasks",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "In the rapidly advancing field of conditional image generation research, challenges such as limited explainability lie in effectively evaluating the performance and capabilities of various models. This paper introduces VIEScore, a Visual Instruction-guided Explainable metric for evaluating any conditional image generation tasks. VIEScore leverages general knowledge from Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as the backbone and does not require training or fine-tuning. We evaluate VIEScore on seven prominent tasks in conditional image tasks and found: (1) VIEScore (GPT4-v) achieves a high Spearman correlation of 0.3 with human evaluations, while the human-to-human correlation is 0.45. (2) VIEScore (with open-source MLLM) is significantly weaker than GPT-4v in evaluating synthetic images. (3) VIEScore achieves a correlation on par with human ratings in the generation tasks but struggles in editing tasks. With these results, we believe VIEScore shows its great potential to replace human judges in evaluating image synthesis tasks",

    "title": "LAI: Label Annotation Interaction based Representation Ehancement for End to End Relation Extraction",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "While numerous studies on end-to-end relation extraction (E2ERE) have centered on enhancing span representations to improve model performance, challenges remain due to the gaps between subtasks (named entity recognition and relation extraction) and the modeling discrepancies between entities and relations. In this paper, we propose a novel Label Annotation Interaction based representation enhancement method for E2ERE, which institutes a two-phase semantic interaction to augment representations. Specifically, we firstly feed label annotations that are easy to manually annotate into a language model, and conduct the first round interaction between three types of tokens with a partial attention mechanism; Then construct a latent multi-view graph to capture various possible links between label and entity (pair) nodes, facilitating the second round interaction between entities and labels. A regimen of rigorous experimentation demonstrates that LAI-Net achieving performance parity with the current SOTA models on ADE/SciERC dataset in terms of NER task (a SOTA performance has been achieved on the ACE05 dataset pecifically), and establishing a new SOTA result (with nearly a 10% advance on the SciERC dataset for RE specifically) in terms of RE task",

    "abstract": "Audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) is a multimodal extension of automatic speech recognition (ASR), using video as a complement to audio. In AVSR, considerable efforts have been directed at datasets for facial features such as lip-readings, while they often fall short in evaluating the image comprehension capabilities in broader contexts. In this paper, we construct SlideAVSR, an AVSR dataset using scientific paper explanation videos. SlideAVSR provides a new benchmark where models transcribe speech utterances with texts on the slides on the presentation recordings. As technical terminologies that are frequent in paper explanations are notoriously challenging to transcribe without reference texts, our SlideAVSR dataset spotlights a new aspect of AVSR problems. As a simple yet effective baseline, we propose DocWhisper, an AVSR model that can refer to textual information from slides, and confirm its effectiveness on SlideAVSR",

    "title": "UP4LS: User Profile Constructed by Multiple Attributes for Enhancing Linguistic Steganalysis",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Linguistic steganalysis (LS) tasks aim to effectively detect stegos generated by linguistic steganography. Existing LS methods overlook the distinctive user characteristics, leading to weak performance in social networks. The limited occurrence of stegos further complicates detection. In this paper, we propose the UP4LS, a novel framework with the User Profile for enhancing LS performance. Specifically, by delving into post content, we explore user attributes like writing habits, psychological states, and focal areas, thereby building the user profile for LS. For each attribute, we design the identified feature extraction module. The extracted features are mapped to high-dimensional user features via deep-learning networks from existing methods. Then the language model is employed to extract content features. The user and content features are integrated to optimize feature representation. During the training phase, we prioritize the distribution of stegos. Experiments demonstrate that UP4LS can significantly enhance the performance of existing methods, and an overall accuracy improvement of nearly 25%. In particular, the improvement is especially pronounced with fewer stego samples. Additionally, UP4LS also sets the stage for studies on related tasks, encouraging extensive applications on LS tasks",
