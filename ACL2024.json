    "title": "Can Large Multimodal Models Uncover Deep Semantics Behind Images?",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Understanding the deep semantics of images is essential in the era dominated by social media. However, current research works primarily on the superficial description of images, revealing a notable deficiency in the systematic investigation of the inherent deep semantics. In this work, we introduce DEEPEVAL, a comprehensive benchmark to assess Large Multimodal Models' (LMMs) capacities of visual deep semantics. DEEPEVAL includes human-annotated dataset and three progressive subtasks: fine-grained description selection, in-depth title matching, and deep semantics understanding. Utilizing DEEPEVAL, we evaluate 9 open-source LMMs and GPT-4V(ision). Our evaluation demonstrates a substantial gap between the deep semantic comprehension capabilities of existing LMMs and humans. For example, GPT-4V is 30% behind humans in understanding deep semantics, even though it achieves human-comparable performance in image description. Further analysis reveals that LMM performance on DEEPEVAL varies according to the specific facets of deep semantics explored, indicating the fundamental challenges remaining in developing LMMs",

    "title": "Expanding Horizons in Short Text Analysis: Integrating LLMs and VAEs for Enhanced Topic Modeling",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Topic models are one of the compelling methods for discovering latent semantics in a document collection. However, it assumes that a document has sufficient co-occurrence information to be effective. However, in short texts, co-occurrence information is minimal, which results in feature sparsity in document representation. Therefore, existing topic models (probabilistic or neural) mostly fail to mine patterns from them to generate coherent topics. In this paper, we take a new approach to short-text topic modeling to address the data-sparsity issue by extending short text into longer sequences using large language models (LLMs) and decoding topics using a variational autoencoder (VAE). We observe that our model can substantially improve the performance of short-text topic modeling. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets under extreme data sparsity scenarios show that our models can generate high-quality topics that outperform state-of-the-art models",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Transformer Architecture Search (TAS) methods aim at automates searching the optimal Transformer architecture configurations for a given task. However, they are impeded by the prohibitive cost of evaluating Transformer architectures. Recently, several Zero-Shot TAS methods have been proposed to mitigate this problem by utilizing zero-cost proxies for evaluating Transformer architectures without training. Unfortunately, they are limited to specific tasks and lack theoretical guarantees. To solve this problem, we develop a new zero-cost proxy called NTSR that combines two theoretically-inspired indicators to measure the trainability and expressivity of Transformer networks separately. We then integrate it into an effective regularized evolution framework called ETAS demonstrate its efficacy on various tasks. The results show that our proposed NTSR proxy can consistently achieve a higher correlation with the true performance of Transformer networks on both computer vision and natural language processing tasks. Further, it can significantly accelerate the search process for finding the best-performing Transformer network architecture configurations",

    "abstract": "Despite the recent successes of large, pretrained neural language models (LLMs), little is known about the representations of linguistic structure they learn during pretraining, leading to unexpected behavior in response to small changes in inputs or application contexts. To better understand these models and behaviors, we propose a general analysis framework to move beyond traditional performance-based evaluation of LLMs and instead analyze them on the basis of their internal representations. Our framework, CALM (Competence-based Analysis of Language Models), is designed to study and measure the linguistic competence of LLMs in the context of specific tasks by intervening on models' internal representations of different linguistic properties using causal probing, and evaluating models' alignment under these interventions with a given ground-truth causal model of the task. We also develop a novel approach for performing causal probing interventions using gradient-based adversarial attacks, which can target a broader range of properties and representations than existing techniques. Finally, we carry out a case study of CALM using these interventions to analyze BERT and RoBERTa's competence across a variety of lexical inference tasks, showing that CALM can be used to explain and predict their behavior across these tasks",

    "abstract": "Interactive fiction games have emerged as an important application to improve the generalization capabilities of language-based reinforcement learning (RL) agents. Existing environments for interactive fiction games are domain-specific or time-consuming to generate and do not train the RL agents to master a specific set of skills. In this work, we introduce an interactive environment for self-supervised RL, \\textit{STARLING}, for text-based games that bootstraps the text-based RL agents with automatically generated games (based on the seed set of game ideas) to boost the performance and generalization capabilities to reach a goal of the target environment. These games let the agent hone their skills on a predefined set of tasks. We create and test an environment with $100$ games, generated using this automated framework that uses large language models (GPT3) and an interactive fiction game engine (based on Inform7) to provide the user with the ability to generate more games under minimal human supervision. Experimental results based on both the human participants and baseline text-based RL agents reveal that current state-of-the-art text-based RL agents cannot use previously learned skills in new situations at the level humans can. These results enforce STARLING's potential to serve as a sandbox environment for further research in self-supervised text-based RL",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Text watermarking has emerged as an important technique for detecting machine-generated text. However, existing methods generally use arbitrary vocabulary partitioning during decoding, which results in the absence of appropriate words during the response generation and disrupts the language model's expressiveness, thus severely degrading the quality of text response. To address these issues, we introduce a novel approach, Watermarking with Mutual Exclusion (WatME). Specifically, by leveraging linguistic prior knowledge of inherent lexical redundancy, WatME can dynamically optimize the use of available vocabulary during the decoding process of language models. It employs a mutually exclusive rule to manage this redundancy, avoiding situations where appropriate words are unavailable and maintaining the expressive power of large language models (LLMs). We present theoretical analysis and empirical evidence demonstrating that WatME substantially preserves the text generation ability of LLMs while maintaining watermark detectability. Specifically, we investigate watermarking's impact on the emergent abilities of LLMs, including knowledge recall and logical reasoning. Our comprehensive experiments confirm that WatME consistently outperforms existing methods in retaining these crucial capabilities of LLMs. Our code will be released to facilitate future research",

We identify the limitations of current methods that prioritize semantic similarity and underscore the importance of syntactic information, which has been underrepresented in sentence-level classification tasks. Through experiments measuring semantic and syntactic similarities, we reveal that ICL methods tend to favor syntactic congruence. Consequently, we propose a novel Semantics and Syntax-based Sentence Selection (SSSS) framework for selecting demonstration examples in ICL, integrating both semantic and syntactic dimensions. This approach addresses the challenges of constructing accurate semantic representations and quantifying syntactic structure similarities. The experimental results on three datasets suggest that the SSSS approach can facilitate more effective ICL by incorporating syntax into the demonstrative example selection, potentially leading to enhanced model performance",

In this paper, we assess the effectiveness of news embeddings from ChatGPT for detecting fake news and showcase that despite their initial performance slightly surpassing the pre-trained BERT model, they still lag behind the state-of-the-arts. This shortfall is attributed to the reliance on tokenized training text, which misses the complex narratives and subtleties that are crucial for identifying fake news. To capture these nuances, we probe the high-level semantic relations among the news pieces, real entities, and topics, which are modeled as a heterogeneous graph with nodes denoting different items and the relations are represented as edges.

Second, our framework can be used as a fast and effective additional tool for robustness evaluation since it (a) saves 30x-193x runtime compared to the traditional technique, (b) is transferable across models, (c) can be used under adversarial training, and (d) robust to statistical randomness.

Our evaluations show that DCD significantly improves LLM performance across various reasoning benchmarks, outperforming existing methods and achieving state-of-the-art results in both GSM8K and StrategyQA",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Due to the continuous emergence of online data, version iteration has become an indispensable requirement for Large Language Models (LLMs), which exacerbates the training cost of LLMs. Hence, one of the pivotal challenges for LLMs is how to reduce the total training cost across different versions. To achieve a better balance between the pre-training performance and training cost, we conduct a systematic investigation into the impact of various learning rate schedules. Extensive experiments on commonly used learning rate schedules show that these approaches primarily focus on the performance of LLMs of the current version, but overlook the mutual influence of training processes of LLMs across different versions. To address the above issue, we design a pre-training strategy called Branches Switching based Pre-Training for the training of LLMs across different versions. Compared with pre-training LLMs of different versions from scratch, our strategy reduces the total training cost to 58\\% while maintaining optimal pre-training performance",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Though advanced in understanding visual information with human languages, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) still suffer from multimodal hallucinations. A natural concern is that during multimodal interaction, the generated hallucinations could influence the LVLMs' subsequent generation. Thus, we raise a question: $\\textit{When presented with a query relevant to the previously generated hallucination, will LVLMs be misled and respond incorrectly, even though the ground visual information exists?}$ To answer this, we propose a framework to evaluate LVLMs' behaviors when encountering generated hallucinations, where LVLMs are required to answer specific visual questions with a curated hallucinatory conversation. Crucially, our experiment shows that the performance of LVLMs drops by $31\\%$ at least, indicating that LVLMs are prone to accept the generated hallucinations and make false claims that they would have not supported without distractions, which we term as $\\textit{Multimodal Hallucination Snowballing}$. To mitigate this issue, we further propose a training-free method called $\\textit{Residual Visual Decoding},$ where we revise the output distribution of LVLMs that are derived from the residual visual input, which provides models with direct access to the visual information. Experiments show that our method can mitigate more than $24%$ of the snowballed multimodal hallucination while maintaining capabilities",

    "abstract": "Language models have become the backbone of today's AI systems. However, their predominant left-to-right (L2R) generation limits the use of bidirectional context, which is essential for tasks that involve filling text in the middle. We propose the Fill-in Language Model (FiLM) that allows for flexible generation at any position without adhering to a specific generation order. Its training extends the masked language modeling objective by adopting varying mask probabilities sampled from the Beta distribution to enhance the generative capabilities.During inference, FiLM can seamlessly insert missing phrases, sentences, or paragraphs, ensuring that the outputs are fluent and are coherent with the surrounding context. In both automatic and human evaluations, FiLM outperforms existing infilling methods that rely on L2R language models trained on rearranged text segments. FiLM is easy to implement and can be either trained from scratchor fine-tuned from a L2R language model. Notably, as the model size grows, FiLM's perplexity approaches that of strong L2R language models of similar sizes, indicating FiLM's scalability and potential as a large language model",

    "abstract": "Although we have witnessed the powerful capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in the past, it is undeniable that in the current timeline, there are still unknown errors or information. %%Additionally, training a new LLM from scratch is a costly option. In response to these challenges, a series of methods injecting new facts into the LLM have been proposed. However, adjusting model weights to accommodate changes in information is likely to trigger a cascade of reactions, including adverse effects on the performance of knowledge outside the scope of editing. In this study, we introduce an \\textbf{RAINPOEM} -- \\textbf{R}etrieval-\\textbf{a}ugmented \\textbf{In}-context knowledge \\textbf{po}st \\textbf{e}diting on massive-editing \\textbf{m}emory -- that is designed for re-evaluating the results of massive-edited models by recalling their editing facts through retrieval and leveraging the in-context reasoning capabilities of LLMs to facilitate more robust responses.

This integration enables more precise and consistent guidance of language models towards desired outcomes, particularly in complex and open text generation tasks. By employing a methodology that filters and combines multiple rewards based on their consistency, the framework provides a robust mechanism for improving model alignment.

Considering the high computing power overhead, data-efficient instruction tuning was proposed to reduce the training data size in this process, aiming at selecting high-quality instructional data. Nevertheless, we argue that most current data-efficient instruction-tuning methods are highly dependent on the quality of the original instruction-tuning dataset. When it comes to datasets synthesized by LLMs, a common scenario in this field, dirty samples will even be selected with a higher probability than other samples. To address these challenges, we utilized external knowledge (relevant examples or paragraphs) to evaluate those samples synthesized by LLMs with an in-context-based relative predictive entropy.

Although word embeddings are usually interpreted as feature vectors for individual words, their roles in language model generation remain underexplored. In this work, we theoretically and empirically revisit output word embeddings and find that their linear transformations are equivalent to steering language model generation styles. We name such steers LM-Steers and find them existing in LMs of all sizes. It requires learning parameters equal to 0.2\\% of the original LMs' size for steering each style. On tasks such as language model detoxification and sentiment control, LM-Steers can achieve comparable or superior performance compared with state-of-the-art controlled generation methods while maintaining a better balance with generation quality. The learned LM-Steer serves as a lens in text styles: it reveals that word embeddings are interpretable when associated with language model generations, and can highlight text spans that most indicate the style differences. A LM-Steer is transferrable between different language models by an explicit-form calculation. One can also continuously steer LMs simply by scaling the LM-Steer, or compose multiple LM-Steers by adding their transformations.

In this paper, we introduce MAVEN-Arg, which augments MAVEN datasets with event argument annotations, making the first all-in-one dataset supporting event detection, event argument extraction (EAE), and event relation extraction. As an EAE benchmark, MAVEN-Arg offers three main advantages: (1) a comprehensive schema covering 162 event types and 612 argument roles, all with expert-written definitions and examples; (2) a large data scale, containing 98,591 events and 290,613 arguments obtained with laborious human annotation; (3) the exhaustive annotation supporting all task variants of EAE, which annotates both entity and non-entity event arguments in document level. Experiments indicate that MAVEN-Arg is quite challenging for both fine-tuned EAE models and proprietary large language models (LLMs). Furthermore, to demonstrate the benefits of an all-in-one dataset, we preliminarily explore a potential application, future event prediction, with LLMs. MAVEN-Arg and our baseline codes will be publicly released",

    "abstract": "This work focuses on a new challenging problem, open-world multi-label text classification under extremely weak supervision, where only raw documents are provided without any labels or ground-truth label space. The multi-label nature makes the existing (hard-)clustering-based methods ineffective. We observe that (1)~most documents have a dominant class covering the majority of content and (2) long-tail labels would appear in some documents as dominant class. Following these observations, we propose a novel method, \\our, to discover a comprehensive label space and construct a multi-label classifier. Specifically, we start with a reasonable subset of all the documents and prompt a large language model (LLM) for their most dominant keyphrases to obtain an initial set of labels. We then leverage a zero-shot multi-label classifier, identifying the documents with lower predicted scores and revisiting the keyphrases in those documents for more long-tail labels. Later, we include these long-tail labels into the label set and reiterate this process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \\our exhibits a remarkable 40\\% increase on the AAPD dataset in ground-truth label space coverage compared to traditional topic modeling methods. Additionally, it achieves higher accuracy in zero-shot multi-label text classification",

    "abstract": "Deepfakes, particularly in the auditory domain, have become a significant threat, necessitating the development of robust countermeasures. This paper addresses the escalating challenges posed by deepfake attacks on Automatic Speaker Verification (ASV) systems. We present a novel Urdu deepfake audio dataset for deepfake detection, focusing on two spoofing attacks – Tacotron and VITS TTS. The dataset construction involves careful consideration of phonemic cover and balance and comparison with existing corpora like PRUS and PronouncUR. Evaluation with AASIST-L model shows EERs of 0.495 and 0.524 for VITS TTS and Tacotron-generated audios, respectively, with variability across speakers Further, this research implements a detailed human evaluation, incorporating a user study to gauge whether people are able to discern deepfake audios from real (bonafide) audios. The ROC curve analysis shows an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.63, indicating that individuals demonstrate a limited ability to detect deepfakes (approximately 1 in 3 fake audio samples are regarded as real). Our work contributes a valuable resource for training deepfake detection models in low-resource languages like Urdu, addressing the critical gap in existing datasets",

Further, we hypothesize that the decomposition should be easier to distill into a smaller model compared to the problem solving because the latter requires large amounts of domain knowledge while the former only requires learning general problem solving strategies.We propose methods to distill these two capabilities and evaluate their impact on reasoning outcomes and inference cost.We find that we can distill the problem decomposition phase and at the same time achieve good generalization across tasks, datasets, and models.However, it is harder to distill the problem solving capability without losing performance and the resulting distilled model struggles with generalization.These results indicate that by using smaller, distilled problem decomposition models in combination with problem solving LLMs we can achieve reasoning with cost-efficient inference and local adaptation",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Despite the impressive performance on information-seeking tasks, large language models (LLMs) still struggle with hallucinations. Attributed LLMs, which augment generated text with in-line citations, demonstrate potential in mitigating hallucinations and improving verifiability. Nonetheless, current attributed LLMs suffer from suboptimal citation quality due to their reliance on in-context learning or post-hoc retrieval, lacking a built-in attribution mechanism. Moreover, the practice of merely citing document identifiers falls short in aiding users to pinpoint specific supporting evidence. To bridge these gaps, this work introduces FRONT, a training framework that advances the verification process in attributed LLMs through Fine-grained grounded citations. It equips LLMs with the ability to first anchor in fine-grained supporting quotes, which then guide the generation of attributed answers. Grounded quotes not only elevate LLM attribution quality but also serve as a mechanism for fine-grained verification, significantly enhancing information traceability. Experiments on the ALCE benchmark demonstrate the efficacy of FRONT in generating superior grounded responses and highly supportive citations. With LLaMA-2-7B, the framework significantly outperforms all the baselines, even surpassing ChatGPT, by achieving an average outperformance of 14.21% across all datasets. Notably, FRONT implements an automated procedure and exhibits generalization across models and data scales, enabling continuous performance improvements",

Recent research LIMA demonstrates that alignment is essentially a process where the model adapts instructions' interaction style or format to solve various tasks, leveraging pre-trained knowledge and skills. Therefore, for instructional data, the most important aspect is the task it represents, rather than the specific semantics and knowledge information. The latent representations of instructions play roles for some instruction-related tasks like data distillation for instruction tuning and prompt retrieval for in-context learning. However, they are always derived from text embeddings, encompass overall semantic information that influences the representation of task categories. In this work, we introduce a new concept, instruction embedding, and construct Instruction Embedding Benchmark (IEB) for its evaluation. Then, we propose baseline method, prompt-based instruction embedding (PIE), to make the instruction embeddings more attention on task rather than whole semantic information. The evaluation of PIE, alongside other embedding methods on IEB, demonstrates its superior performance in accurately identifying task categories. Moreover, the application of PIE in downstream tasks showcases its effectiveness and suitability for instruction-related tasks",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has been a crucial component in the recent success of Large Language Models. However, RLHF is know to exploit biases in human preferences, such as verbosity. A well-formatted and eloquent answer is often more highly rated by users, even when it is less helpful and objective. A number of approaches have been developed to control those biases in the classical RLHF literature, but the problem remains relatively under-explored for Direct Alignment Algorithms such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Unlike classical RLHF, DPO does not train a separate reward model or use reinforcement learning directly, so previous approaches developed to control verbosity cannot be directly applied to this setting. Our work makes several contributions. For the first time, we study the length problem in the DPO setting, showing significant exploitation in DPO and linking it to out-of-distribution bootstrapping. We then develop a principled but simple regularization strategy that prevents length exploitation, while still maintaining improvements in model quality. We demonstrate these affects across datasets on summarization and dialogue, where we achieve up to 20\\% improvement in win rates when controlling for length, despite the GPT4 judge's well-known verbosity bias",

Humans have produced texts in various languages for thousands of years; however, most of the computational literature is focused on contemporary languages and corpora. The emerging field of historical psychology relies on computational techniques to extract aspects of psychology from historical corpora using new methods developed in natural language processing (NLP). The present pipeline, called Contextualized Construct Representations (CCR), combines expert knowledge in psychometrics (i.e., psychological surveys) with text representations generated via transformer-based language models to measure psychological constructs such as traditionalism, norm strength, and collectivism in classical Chinese corpora. Considering the scarcity of available data, we propose an indirect supervised contrastive learning approach and build the first Chinese historical psychological corpus (C-HIS-PSY) to fine-tune pre-trained models.

Despite many models now extending the context window several times beyond the base model, the performance of these models in processing long texts varies across different tasks.

Our method achieves length generalization of LLM by leveraging the large model itself to retrieve the most relevant information for the task when the context window is limited. Moreover, this method is task-agnostic, and different tasks only need different prompts to achieve their retrieval. Results from the LongBench benchmark show that AESS can improve LLM performance by 9-10% compared to other retrieval methods. Furthermore, our method can also be adapted to various models and improve performance. Therefore, AESS is a promising solution for various applications that require LLMs to handle tasks with lengthy inputs effectively",

However, the majority of these architectures have been evaluated predominantly in languages with a fixed word order, such as English.

In this work, we examine the robustness of graph-based parsing architectures on 4 relatively free word order languages. We focus on investigating essential modifications such as data augmentation and the removal of position encoding required to adapt these architectures accordingly. To this end, we propose a contrastive loss objective to make the model robust to word order variations.

In this paper, we use models of this scaling behavior to estimate the scale at which our current methods will yield a SLM with the English proficiency of text-based Large Language Models (LLMs). We establish a strong correlation between pre-training loss and downstream syntactic and semantic performance in SLMs and LLMs, which results in predictable scaling of linguistic performance. We show that the linguistic performance of SLMs scales up to three orders of magnitude more slowly than the performance of text-based LLMs. Additionally, we study the effects of coarser speech tokenization, and the benefits of synthetic data designed to boost semantic understanding",

Thus, researchers proposed a modified CL approach equipped with extra modules such as human-written implications or machine-generated augmented data for better implicit hate speech detection.

In this study, we (1) create a dataset for intrinsic gender bias measurement in Bangla, (2) discuss necessary adaptations for Bangla, and (3) examine the effect of context length variation on bias measurement in established methods within a Bangla-based setup. We observe a definite dependency of bias metrics on context length. We consider our work as a stepping stone for bias measurement in the Bangla Language. All of our resources will be publicly available to support future research on Bangla NLP",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Time-sensitive question answering is to answer questions with specific timestamps from the given long document. Existing works mostly focus on only one of the high-quality answers, but it is common that multiple answers simultaneously satisfy the constraints of a specific timestamp in the time-sensitive question. For example, an individual may play two different roles during a specific timestamp. In this paper, we construct a Multi-answer Time-sensitive question answering dataset, MulTiple, consisting of 17,580 multi-answer instances. Each contains a question, a corresponding long document and multiple answers. To ensure that the generated questions have multiple answers, we propose a global iteration method to obtain time-evolving events with multiple objects for the same subject and relation. Moreover, the baseline model IterBird is proposed to progressively gain multiple answers by integrating an iterative mechanism with the single-answer model. We construct extensive experiments on MulTiple and results show that IterBird significantly outperforms other baselines with SEM scores of 25.65\\% and 22.69\\%. It demonstrates that existing models struggle to obtain the full answers, even as clue words are provided in the time-sensitive questions. The dataset and code are released in \\url{http://github.com/multipledata/MTQA}",

Existing approaches to ASTE often complicate the task with additional structures or external data.

The proposed approach demonstrates comparable or superior performance in comparison to state-of-the-art techniques, while featuring a more compact design and reduced computational overhead. Notably, even in the era of Large Language Models (LLMs), our method exhibits superior efficacy compared to GPT 3.5 and GPT 4 in a few-shot learning scenarios.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown potential for data annotation and evaluation. Despite the evident benefits of speed and lower cost, we raise concerns about the reliability of LLMs when applied to this evaluation, especially within the ground of consistency. In this paper, we conduct extensive studies on the two different aspects of consistency in LLM evaluations, Self-Consistency (SC) and Inter-Consistency (IC), comparing the rating scale and criterion granularity. Additionally, we study effects of inconsistency along with accuracy. We empirically observe that Llama-2-based evaluators are more consistent and accurate in general. Lastly, we present two effective methods: (1) Self-Consistency Evaluation (SCE) and (2) distilled In-Context Learning ($d$ICL) to jointly promote consistency and accuracy without further training. Along with accuracy-driven research, we insist the importance of research towards additionally assessing on the consistency in pursuit of safer LLM applications if we intend to exploit them as human evaluation proxies",

While previous song translation works explore ways to incorporate and satisfy music constraints, they cannot ensure basic translation quality which is critical in musicals. This paper is dedicated to enhancing translation quality while simultaneously maintaining the singability features, such as adherence to length and rhyme constraints. Our approach consists of three main components. First, we collect a dataset to train reward models, giving an automatic evaluation of translation quality. To enhance both the singability and translation capabilities, we adopt a two-stage training recipe with filtering techniques. Finally, our inference-time optimizing framework composes the whole-song translation. Extensive experiments of both automatic evaluations and human evaluation not only show improvements over the baseline method by large margins but also demonstrate the effectiveness of different components in our approach",

    "abstract": "Psychological evidence highlights the influence of personality traits on decision-making. For instance, agreeableness and openness enhance negotiation outcomes positively, whereas neuroticism can lead to unfavorable outcomes. This paper introduces a simulation framework that integrates LLM agents endowed with synthesized personality traits. These agents negotiate within a traditional bargaining domain with customizable personalities and negotiation objectives. The experimental results indicate that the behavioral tendencies of LLM-based simulations generally mirror those observed in human negotiations. A case study based on synthesized bargaining dialogues reveals intriguing behavioral dynamics, including deceitful and compromising behaviors. The contribution is twofold. First, we propose a simulation methodology that harnesses LLM agents' linguistic and economic capabilities. Secondly, we offer empirical insights into the impact of Big-Five personality traits on bilateral negotiation outcomes",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in numerous domains but often struggle to process lengthy inputs effectively and efficiently due to limited length generalization and attention's quadratic computational demands.Many sought to mitigate this by restricting the attention window within the pre-trained length. However, these methods introduce new issues such as ignoring the middle context and requiring additional training.To address these problems, we propose LongHeads, a training-free framework that enhances LLM's long context ability by unlocking multi-head attention's untapped potential.Instead of allowing each head to attend to the full sentence, which struggles with generalizing to longer sequences due to out-of-distribution (OOD) issues, we allow each head to process in-distribution length by selecting and attending to important context chunks.To this end, we propose a chunk selection strategy that relies on the inherent correlation between the query and the key representations, efficiently distributing context chunks to different heads.In this way, each head ensures it can effectively process attended tokens within the trained length, while different heads in different layers can collectively process longer contexts.LongHeads works efficiently in linear time, fits seamlessly with many LLMs that use relative positional encoding.Our extensive empirical analyses verify LongHeads's efficacy in extending the usable context window for existing models, showcasing its promise for enhancing long text understanding",

Since mel-spectrogram is a relatively strong condition which limits the possible audios to a small range, waveODE models the ground truth distribution with a mel-conditioned prior distribution rather than the standard Gaussian distribution,and adopts a distillation method to accelerate the inference process.Experimental results show that our model is comparable with previous vocoders in sample quality, and could generate waveform with a single inference step",

Understanding how information is transmitted among communities of users is a critical step towards understanding the impact social networks have on real-world events. Two significant barriers in this vein of work are identifying user clusters and meaningfully characterizing these communities. Thus, we propose the PGNSC benchmark, which builds information pathways based on the audiences of influential news sources and uses their content to characterize the communities. We present methods of aggregating these news-source-centric communities and for constructing the community feature representations that are used sequentially to construct information pathway prediction pipelines.Lastly, we perform extensive experiments to demonstrate the performance of baseline pipeline constructions and to highlight the possibilities for future work",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) , with algorithms such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) serving as a representative approach for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values. While effective, these methods have faced challenges due to high costs and unstable training processes. In response, alternative approaches have been proposed to serve as replacements for the PPO process or integrate Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and contrastive learning to directly achieve fine-tuning and value alignment. However, these methods still need voluminous data to learn the preference and sacrifices a portion of generalization ability of LLMs. To further enhance alignment efficiency and performance while mitigating the loss of generalization ability, this paper introduces DEFT, an efficient alignment framework incorporating data filtering and distributional guidance. DEFT comprises two main components: (1) Data Grading, involving the integration of reward model scores to filter data of varying quality from the original dataset and achieve alignment using the best subset; (2) Distribution Reward, which extracts positive and negative discrepancy distributions from the data and guides the language model output distribution accordingly. Experimental results demonstrate that the methods enhanced by DEFT outperform the original methods in both alignment capability and generalization ability. The overall framework is easy to implement, and the training time overhead is significantly reduced",
