    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "We propose the task of Panoptic Scene Completion (PSC) which extends the recently popular Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) task with instance-level information to produce a richer understanding of the 3D scene. Our PSC proposal utilizes a hybrid mask-based technique on the non-empty voxels from sparse multi-scale completions. Whereas the SSC literature overlooks uncertainty which is critical for robotics applications, we instead propose an efficient ensembling to estimate both voxel-wise and instance-wise uncertainties along PSC. This is achieved by building on a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) strategy, while improving performance and yielding better uncertainty for little additional compute. Additionally, we introduce a technique to aggregate permutation-invariant mask predictions. Our experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses all baselines in both Panoptic Scene Completion and uncertainty estimation on three large-scale autonomous driving datasets.

    "title": "Mesh-Guided Neural Implicit Field Editing",
    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Neural implicit fields have emerged as a powerful 3D representation for reconstructing and rendering photo-realistic views, yet they possess limited editability. Conversely, explicit 3D representations, such as polygonal meshes, offer ease of editing but may not be as suitable for rendering high-quality novel views. To harness the strengths of both representations, we propose a new approach that employs a mesh as a guiding mechanism in editing the neural radiance field. We first introduce a differentiable method using marching tetrahedra for polygonal mesh extraction from the neural implicit field and then design a differentiable color extractor to assign colors obtained from the volume renderings to this extracted mesh. This differentiable colored mesh allows gradient back-propagation from the explicit mesh to the implicit fields, empowering users to easily manipulate the geometry and color of neural implicit fields. To enhance user control from coarse-grained to fine-grained levels, we introduce an octree-based structure into its optimization. This structure prioritizes the edited regions and the surface part, making our method achieve fine-grained edits to the neural implicit field and accommodate various user modifications, including object additions, component removals, specific area deformations, and adjustments to local and global colors. Through extensive experiments involving diverse scenes and editing operations, we have demonstrated the capabilities and effectiveness of our method.

In this paper, we propose the use of diffusion models as they offer a promising approach to gradually refine the details of shadow regions during the diffusion process. Our method improves this process by conditioning on a learned latent feature space that inherits the characteristics of shadow-free images, thus avoiding the limitation of conventional methods that condition on degraded images only. Additionally, we propose to alleviate potential local optima during training by fusing noise features with the diffusion network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach which outperforms the previous best method by 13% in terms of RMSE on the AISTD dataset. Further, we explore instance-level shadow removal, where our model outperforms the previous best method by 82% in terms of RMSE on the DESOBA dataset",

    "title": "Aligning and Prompting Everything All at Once for Universal Visual Perception",
    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Vision foundation models have been explored recently to build general-purpose vision systems. However, predominant paradigms, driven by casting instance-level tasks as an object-word alignment, bring heavy cross-modality interaction, which is not effective in prompting object detection and visual grounding. Another line of work that focuses on pixel-level tasks often encounters a large annotation gap of things and stuff, and suffers from mutual interference between foreground-object and background-class segmentation. In stark contrast to the prevailing methods, we present APE, a universal visual perception model for aligning and prompting everything all at once in an image to perform diverse tasks, i.e., detection, segmentation, and grounding, as an instance-level sentence-object matching paradigm. Specifically, APE advances the convergence of detection and grounding by reformulating language-guided grounding as open-vocabulary detection, which efficiently scales up model prompting to thousands of category vocabularies and region descriptions while maintaining the effectiveness of cross-modality fusion. To bridge the granularity gap of different pixel-level tasks, APE equalizes semantic and panoptic segmentation to proxy instance learning by considering any isolated regions as individual instances. APE aligns vision and language representation on broad data with natural and challenging characteristics all at once without task-specific fine-tuning. The extensive experiments on over 160 datasets demonstrate that, with only one-suit of weights, APE outperforms (or is on par with) the state-of-the-art models, proving that an effective yet universal perception for anything aligning and prompting is indeed feasible.

    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Image keypoint descriptions that are discriminative and matchable over large changes in viewpoint are vital for 3D reconstruction. However, descriptions output by learned descriptors are typically not robust to camera rotation. While they can be made more robust by, e.g., data augmentation, this degrades performance on upright images. Another approach is test-time augmentation, which incurs a significant increase in runtime. We instead learn a linear transform in description space that encodes rotations of the input image. We call this linear transform a steerer since it allows us to transform the descriptions as if the image was rotated. From representation theory we know all possible steerers for the rotation group. Steerers can be optimized (A) given a fixed descriptor, (B) jointly with a descriptor or (C) we can optimize a descriptor given a fixed steerer. We perform experiments in all of these three settings and obtain state-of-the-art results on the rotation invariant image matching benchmarks AIMS and Roto-360.

    "title": "Guarding Barlow Twins Against Overfitting with Mixed Samples",
    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Self-supervised Learning (SSL) aims to learn transferable feature representations for downstream applications without relying on labeled data. The Barlow Twins algorithm, renowned for its widespread adoption and straightforward implementation compared to its counterparts like contrastive learning methods, minimizes feature redundancy while maximizing invariance to common corruptions. Optimizing for the above objective forces the network to learn useful representations, while avoiding noisy or constant features, resulting in improved downstream task performance with limited adaptation. Despite Barlow Twins' proven effectiveness in pre-training, the underlying SSL objective can inadvertently cause feature overfitting due to the lack of strong interaction between the samples unlike the contrastive learning approaches. From our experiments, we observe that optimizing for the Barlow Twins objective doesn't necessarily guarantee sustained improvements in representation quality beyond a certain pre-training phase, and can potentially degrade downstream performance on some datasets. To address this challenge, we introduce Mixed Barlow Twins, which aims to improve sample interaction during Barlow Twins training via linearly interpolated samples. This results in an additional regularization term to the original Barlow Twins objective, assuming linear interpolation in the input space translates to linearly interpolated features in the feature space. Pre-training with this regularization effectively mitigates feature overfitting and further enhances the downstream performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, TinyImageNet, STL-10, and ImageNet datasets.

    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "We present Readout Guidance, a method for controlling text-to-image diffusion models with learned signals. Readout Guidance uses readout heads, lightweight networks trained to extract signals from the features of a pre-trained, frozen diffusion model at every timestep. These readouts can encode single-image properties, such as pose, depth, and edges; or higher-order properties that relate multiple images, such as correspondence and appearance similarity. Furthermore, by comparing the readout estimates to a user-defined target, and back-propagating the gradient through the readout head, these estimates can be used to guide the sampling process. Compared to prior methods for conditional generation, Readout Guidance requires significantly fewer added parameters and training samples, and offers a convenient and simple recipe for reproducing different forms of conditional control under a single framework, with a single architecture and sampling procedure. We showcase these benefits in the applications of drag-based manipulation, identity-consistent generation, and spatially aligned control. Project page: https://readout-guidance.github.io",

Since each generated scale is guided by a different text prompt, our method enables deeper levels of zoom than traditional super-resolution methods that may struggle to create new contextual structure at vastly different scales.

    "abstract": "This paper enhances image-GPT (iGPT), one of the pioneering works that introduce autoregressive pretraining to predict next pixels for visual representation learning. Two simple yet essential changes are made. First, we shift the prediction target from raw pixels to semantic tokens, enabling a higher-level understanding of visual content. Second, we supplement the autoregressive modeling by instructing the model to predict not only the next tokens but also the visible tokens. This pipeline is particularly effective when semantic tokens are encoded by discriminatively trained models, such as CLIP. We introduce this novel approach as D-iGPT. Extensive experiments showcase that D-iGPT excels as a strong learner of visual representations: A notable achievement of D-iGPT is its compelling performance on the ImageNet-1K dataset -- by training on publicly available datasets, D-iGPT achieves 89.5\\% top-1 accuracy with a vanilla ViT-Large model.

    "title": "Repurposing Diffusion-Based Image Generators for Monocular Depth Estimation",
    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Monocular depth estimation is a fundamental computer vision task. Recovering 3D depth from a single image is geometrically ill-posed and requires scene understanding, so it is not surprising that the rise of deep learning has led to a breakthrough. The impressive progress of monocular depth estimators has mirrored the growth in model capacity, from relatively modest CNNs to large Transformer architectures. Still, monocular depth estimators tend to struggle when presented with images with unfamiliar content and layout, since their knowledge of the visual world is restricted by the data seen during training, and challenged by zero-shot generalization to new domains. This motivates us to explore whether the extensive priors captured in recent generative diffusion models can enable better, more generalizable depth estimation. We introduce Marigold, a method for affine-invariant monocular depth estimation that is derived from Stable Diffusion and retains its rich prior knowledge. The estimator can be fine-tuned in a couple of days on a single GPU using only synthetic training data. It delivers state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of datasets, including over 20% performance gains in specific cases. Project page: https://marigoldmonodepth.github.io",

Using reinforcement learning, this generator autonomously explores vast combinations within the action space and searches for configurations that give the highest detection accuracy according to the training dataset.

The idea is to apply a language decoder that auto-regressively predicts the text tokens from image embeddings to form labels. To ground this prediction process in auto-regression, we customize a non-causal attention mask for the decoder, incorporating two key features: modeling tokens from different labels to be independent, and treating image tokens as a prefix. This masking mechanism inspires an efficient method - one-shot sampling - to simultaneously sample tokens of multiple labels in parallel and rank generated labels by their probabilities during inference. To further enhance the efficiency, we propose a simple strategy to construct a compact decoder by simply discarding the intermediate blocks of a pretrained language model. This approach yields a decoder that matches the full model's performance while being notably more efficient. The code is available at https://github.com/kaiyuyue/nxtp",

It enables correspondence learning on arbitrary uninterrupted videos without any camera pose or depth labels, heralding a new era for self-supervised correspondence learning. Specifically, we formulated the problem of correspondence learning as a bilevel optimization, which takes the reprojection error from bundle adjustment as a supervisory signal for the model. To avoid large memory and computation overhead, we leverage the stationary point to effectively back-propagate the implicit gradients through bundle adjustment.

In this paper, we study the effectiveness of vision transformers in diffusion-based generative learning.

We present MANUS, a method for Markerless Hand-Object Grasp Capture using Articulated 3D Gaussians.

Since our representation uses Gaussian primitives, it enables us to efficiently and accurately estimate contacts between the hand and the object. For the most accurate results, our method requires tens of camera views that current datasets do not provide. We therefore build MANUS-Grasps, a new dataset that contains hand-object grasps viewed from 53 cameras across 30+ scenes, 3 subjects, and comprising over 7M frames.

Concretely, objects of synthesized 3D scenes could be easily manipulated through steering the corresponding BEV maps. Moreover, by adequately incorporating positional encoding and low-pass filters into the generator, the representation becomes equivariant to the given BEV map. Such equivariance allows us to produce large-scale, even infinite-scale, 3D scenes via synthesizing local scenes and then stitching them with smooth consistency.

Specifically, we build a global static scene model using an extended plane-based scene representation to synthesize temporally coherent novel video. Our plane-based scene representation is augmented with spherical harmonics and displacement maps to capture view-dependent effects and model non-planar complex surface geometry. We opt to represent the dynamic content as per-frame point clouds for efficiency. While such representations are inconsistency-prone, minor temporal inconsistencies are perceptually masked due to motion. We develop a method to quickly estimate such a hybrid video representation and render novel views in real time.

    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Large-scale Text-to-Image (T2I) models have rapidly gained prominence across creative fields, generating visually compelling outputs from textual prompts. However, controlling these models to ensure consistent style remains challenging, with existing methods necessitating fine-tuning and manual intervention to disentangle content and style. In this paper, we introduce StyleAligned, a novel technique designed to establish style alignment among a series of generated images. By employing minimal `attention sharing' during the diffusion process, our method maintains style consistency across images within T2I models. This approach allows for the creation of style-consistent images using a reference style through a straightforward inversion operation. Our method's evaluation across diverse styles and text prompts demonstrates high-quality synthesis and fidelity, underscoring its efficacy in achieving consistent style across various inputs",

    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "A look is worth a thousand words is a popular phrase. And why is a simple look enough to portray our feelings about something or someone? Behind this question are the theoretical foundations of the field of psychology regarding social cognition and the studies of psychologist Paul Ekman. Facial expressions, as a form of non-verbal communication, are the primary way to transmit emotions between human beings. The set of movements and expressions of facial muscles that convey some emotional state of the individual to their observers are targets of studies in many areas. Our research aims to evaluate Ekman's action units in datasets of real human faces, posed and spontaneous, and virtual human faces resulting from transferring real faces into Computer Graphics faces. In addition, we also conducted a case study with specific movie characters, such as SheHulk and Genius. We intend to find differences and similarities in facial expressions between real and CG datasets, posed and spontaneous faces, and also to consider the actors' genders in the videos. This investigation can help several areas of knowledge, whether using real or virtual human beings, in education, health, entertainment, games, security, and even legal matters. Our results indicate that AU intensities are greater for posed than spontaneous datasets, regardless of gender. Furthermore, there is a smoothing of intensity up to 80 percent for AU6 and 45 percent for AU12 when a real face is transformed into CG",

We employ an online tracking and mapping pipeline while tailoring it to specifically use an underlying Gaussian representation and silhouette-guided optimization via differentiable rendering.

Inspired by the image-generation paradigm of VQ-GAN and MaskGIT, where transformers are used to model the discrete latent sequences of a VQ-VAE, we use GIVT to model the unquantized real-valued latent sequences of a VAE. When applying GIVT to class-conditional image generation with iterative masked modeling, we show competitive results with MaskGIT, while our approach outperforms both VQ-GAN and MaskGIT when using it for causal modeling.

We parameterize each splat by a local coordinate frame of a triangle and optimize for explicit displacement offset to obtain a more accurate geometric representation. During avatar reconstruction, we jointly optimize for the morphable model parameters and Gaussian splat parameters in an end-to-end fashion. We demonstrate the animation capabilities of our photorealistic avatar in several challenging scenarios.

    "title": "Implicit Learning of Scene Geometry from Poses for Global Localization",
    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Global visual localization estimates the absolute pose of a camera using a single image, in a previously mapped area. Obtaining the pose from a single image enables many robotics and augmented/virtual reality applications. Inspired by latest advances in deep learning, many existing approaches directly learn and regress 6 DoF pose from an input image. However, these methods do not fully utilize the underlying scene geometry for pose regression. The challenge in monocular relocalization is the minimal availability of supervised training data, which is just the corresponding 6 DoF poses of the images. In this paper, we propose to utilize these minimal available labels (.i.e, poses) to learn the underlying 3D geometry of the scene and use the geometry to estimate the 6 DoF camera pose. We present a learning method that uses these pose labels and rigid alignment to learn two 3D geometric representations (\\textit{X, Y, Z coordinates}) of the scene, one in camera coordinate frame and the other in global coordinate frame. Given a single image, it estimates these two 3D scene representations, which are then aligned to estimate a pose that matches the pose label. This formulation allows for the active inclusion of additional learning constraints to minimize 3D alignment errors between the two 3D scene representations, and 2D re-projection errors between the 3D global scene representation and 2D image pixels, resulting in improved localization accuracy. During inference, our model estimates the 3D scene geometry in camera and global frames and aligns them rigidly to obtain pose in real-time. We evaluate our work on three common visual localization datasets, conduct ablation studies, and show that our method exceeds state-of-the-art regression methods' pose accuracy on all datasets",

In this work, we propose VLTSeg to enhance domain generalization in semantic segmentation, where the network is solely trained on the source domain and evaluated on unseen target domains. Our method leverages the inherent semantic robustness of vision-language models. First, by substituting traditional vision-only backbones with pre-trained encoders from CLIP and EVA-CLIP as transfer learning setting we find that in the field of DG, vision-language pre-training significantly outperforms supervised and self-supervised vision pre-training. We thus propose a new vision-language approach for domain generalized segmentation, which improves the domain generalization SOTA by 7.6% mIoU when training on the synthetic GTA5 dataset. We further show the superior generalization capabilities of vision-language segmentation models by reaching 76.48% mIoU on the popular Cityscapes-to-ACDC benchmark, outperforming the previous SOTA approach by 6.9% mIoU on the test set at the time of writing. Additionally, our approach shows strong in-domain generalization capabilities indicated by 86.1% mIoU on the Cityscapes test set, resulting in a shared first place with the previous SOTA on the current leaderboard at the time of submission",

However, accurate long-sequence colonoscopy reconstruction faces three major challenges: (1) dissimilarity among segments of the colon due to its meandering and convoluted shape; (2) co-existence of simple and intricately folded geometry structures; (3) sparse viewpoints due to constrained camera trajectories. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a new reconstruction framework based on neural radiance field (NeRF), named ColonNeRF, which leverages neural rendering for novel view synthesis of long-sequence colonoscopy. Specifically, to reconstruct the entire colon in a piecewise manner, our ColonNeRF introduces a region division and integration module, effectively reducing shape dissimilarity and ensuring geometric consistency in each segment. To learn both the simple and complex geometry in a unified framework, our ColonNeRF incorporates a multi-level fusion module that progressively models the colon regions from easy to hard. Additionally, to overcome the challenges from sparse views, we devise a DensiNet module for densifying camera poses under the guidance of semantic consistency. We conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets to evaluate our ColonNeRF. Quantitatively, our ColonNeRF outperforms existing methods on two benchmarks over four evaluation metrics. Notably, our LPIPS-ALEX scores exhibit a substantial increase of about 67%-85% on the SimCol-to-3D dataset.

Despite the major progress attained, previous works primarily focus on task-specific agents and lack generalizability to unseen scenarios. Recently, LLMs have presented remarkable capabilities across various fields, and provided a promising opportunity for embodied navigation. Drawing on this, we propose the first generalist model for embodied navigation, NaviLLM. It adapts LLMs to embodied navigation by introducing schema-based instruction. The schema-based instruction flexibly casts various tasks into generation problems, thereby unifying a wide range of tasks. This approach allows us to integrate diverse data sources from various datasets into the training, equipping NaviLLM with a wide range of capabilities required by embodied navigation. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance and generalizability of our model. The experimental results demonstrate that our unified model achieves state-of-the-art performance on CVDN, SOON, and ScanQA. Specifically, it surpasses the previous stats-of-the-art method by a significant margin of 29% in goal progress on CVDN.

    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Image super-resolution aims to synthesize high-resolution image from a low-resolution image. It is an active area to overcome the resolution limitations in several applications like low-resolution object-recognition, medical image enhancement, etc. The generative adversarial network (GAN) based methods have been the state-of-the-art for image super-resolution by utilizing the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based generator and discriminator networks. However, the CNNs are not able to exploit the global information very effectively in contrast to the transformers, which are the recent breakthrough in deep learning by exploiting the self-attention mechanism. Motivated from the success of transformers in language and vision applications, we propose a SRTransGAN for image super-resolution using transformer based GAN. Specifically, we propose a novel transformer-based encoder-decoder network as a generator to generate 2x images and 4x images. We design the discriminator network using vision transformer which uses the image as sequence of patches and hence useful for binary classification between synthesized and real high-resolution images. The proposed SRTransGAN outperforms the existing methods by 4.38 % on an average of PSNR and SSIM scores. We also analyze the saliency map to understand the learning ability of the proposed method",

    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Composed image retrieval (CIR) task takes a composed query of image and text, aiming to search relative images for both conditions. Conventional CIR approaches need a training dataset composed of triplets of query image, query text, and target image, which is very expensive to collect. Several recent works have worked on the zero-shot (ZS) CIR paradigm to tackle the issue without using pre-collected triplets. However, the existing ZS-CIR methods show limited backbone scalability and generalizability due to the lack of diversity of the input texts during training. We propose a novel CIR framework, only using language for its training. Our LinCIR (Language-only training for CIR) can be trained only with text datasets by a novel self-supervision named self-masking projection (SMP). We project the text latent embedding to the token embedding space and construct a new text by replacing the keyword tokens of the original text. Then, we let the new and original texts have the same latent embedding vector. With this simple strategy, LinCIR is surprisingly efficient and highly effective; LinCIR with CLIP ViT-G backbone is trained in 48 minutes and shows the best ZS-CIR performances on four different CIR benchmarks, CIRCO, GeneCIS, FashionIQ, and CIRR, even outperforming supervised method on FashionIQ.

Recent research on the application of GNN to FC suggests that exploiting the time-varying properties of the FC could significantly improve the accuracy and interpretability of the model prediction. However, the high cost of acquiring high-quality fMRI data and corresponding phenotypic labels poses a hurdle to their application in real-world settings, such that a model na\\\"ively trained in a supervised fashion can suffer from insufficient performance or a lack of generalization on a small number of data. In addition, most Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) approaches for GNNs to date adopt a contrastive strategy, which tends to lose appropriate semantic information when the graph structure is perturbed or does not leverage both spatial and temporal information simultaneously. In light of these challenges, we propose a generative SSL approach that is tailored to effectively harness spatio-temporal information within dynamic FC. Our empirical results, experimented with large-scale (>50,000) fMRI datasets, demonstrate that our approach learns valuable representations and enables the construction of accurate and robust models when fine-tuned for downstream tasks",

    "title": "Bootstrapping SparseFormers from Vision Foundation Models",
    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "The recently proposed SparseFormer architecture provides an alternative approach to visual understanding by utilizing a significantly lower number of visual tokens via adjusting RoIs, greatly reducing computational costs while still achieving promising performance. However, training SparseFormers from scratch is still expensive, and scaling up the number of parameters can be challenging. In this paper, we propose to bootstrap SparseFormers from ViT-based vision foundation models in a simple and efficient way. Since the majority of SparseFormer blocks are the standard transformer ones, we can inherit weights from large-scale pre-trained vision transformers and freeze them as much as possible. Therefore, we only need to train the SparseFormer-specific lightweight focusing transformer to adjust token RoIs and fine-tune a few early pre-trained blocks to align the final token representation. In such a way, we can bootstrap SparseFormer architectures from various large-scale pre-trained models (e.g., IN-21K pre-trained AugRegs or CLIPs) using a rather smaller amount of training samples (e.g., IN-1K) and without labels or captions within just a few hours. As a result, the bootstrapped unimodal SparseFormer (from AugReg-ViT-L/16-384) can reach 84.9% accuracy on IN-1K with only 49 tokens, and the multimodal SparseFormer from CLIPs also demonstrates notable zero-shot performance with highly reduced computational cost without seeing any caption during the bootstrapping procedure. In addition, CLIP-bootstrapped SparseFormers, which align the output space with language without seeing a word, can serve as efficient vision encoders in multimodal large language models.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel unified representation of diffusion models for image generation and segmentation. Specifically, we use a colormap to represent entity-level masks, addressing the challenge of varying entity numbers while aligning the representation closely with the image RGB domain. Two novel modules, including the location-aware color palette and progressive dichotomy module, are proposed to support our mask representation. On the one hand, a location-aware palette guarantees the colors' consistency to entities' locations. On the other hand, the progressive dichotomy module can efficiently decode the synthesized colormap to high-quality entity-level masks in a depth-first binary search without knowing the cluster numbers. To tackle the issue of lacking large-scale segmentation training data, we employ an inpainting pipeline and then improve the flexibility of diffusion models across various tasks, including inpainting, image synthesis, referring segmentation, and entity segmentation. Comprehensive experiments validate the efficiency of our approach, demonstrating comparable segmentation mask quality to state-of-the-art and adaptability to multiple tasks.

    "abstract": "Capturing and preserving motion semantics is essential to motion retargeting between animation characters. However, most of the previous works neglect the semantic information or rely on human-designed joint-level representations. Here, we present a novel Semantics-aware Motion reTargeting (SMT) method with the advantage of vision-language models to extract and maintain meaningful motion semantics. We utilize a differentiable module to render 3D motions. Then the high-level motion semantics are incorporated into the motion retargeting process by feeding the vision-language model with the rendered images and aligning the extracted semantic embeddings. To ensure the preservation of fine-grained motion details and high-level semantics, we adopt a two-stage pipeline consisting of skeleton-aware pre-training and fine-tuning with semantics and geometry constraints. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method in producing high-quality motion retargeting results while accurately preserving motion semantics.

    "abstract": "Cartoon editing, appreciated by both professional illustrators and hobbyists, allows extensive creative freedom and the development of original narratives within the cartoon domain. However, the existing literature on cartoon editing is complex and leans heavily on manual operations, owing to the challenge of automatic identification of individual character instances. Therefore, an automated segmentation of these elements becomes imperative to facilitate a variety of cartoon editing applications such as visual style editing, motion decomposition and transfer, and the computation of stereoscopic depths for an enriched visual experience. Unfortunately, most current segmentation methods are designed for natural photographs, failing to recognize from the intricate aesthetics of cartoon subjects, thus lowering segmentation quality. The major challenge stems from two key shortcomings: the rarity of high-quality cartoon dedicated datasets and the absence of competent models for high-resolution instance extraction on cartoons. To address this, we introduce a high-quality dataset of over 100k paired high-resolution cartoon images and their instance labeling masks. We also present an instance-aware image segmentation model that can generate accurate, high-resolution segmentation masks for characters in cartoon images. We present that the proposed approach enables a range of segmentation-dependent cartoon editing applications like 3D Ken Burns parallax effects, text-guided cartoon style editing, and puppet animation from illustrations and manga",

To achieve this, current works try to construct a Tri-Perspective View (TPV) or Occupancy (OCC) representation extending from the Bird-Eye-View perception. However, compressed views like TPV representation lose 3D geometry information while raw and sparse OCC representation requires heavy but reducant computational costs. To address the above limitations, we propose Compact Occupancy TRansformer (COTR), with a geometry-aware occupancy encoder and a semantic-aware group decoder to reconstruct a compact 3D OCC representation. The occupancy encoder first generates a compact geometrical OCC feature through efficient explicit-implicit view transformation. Then, the occupancy decoder further enhances the semantic discriminability of the compact OCC representation by a coarse-to-fine semantic grouping strategy. Empirical experiments show that there are evident performance gains across multiple baselines, e.g., COTR outperforms baselines with a relative improvement of 8%-15%, demonstrating the superiority of our method",

    "abstract": "Early detection of anomalies in medical images such as brain MRI is highly relevant for diagnosis and treatment of many conditions. Supervised machine learning methods are limited to a small number of pathologies where there is good availability of labeled data. In contrast, unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) has the potential to identify a broader spectrum of anomalies by spotting deviations from normal patterns. Our research demonstrates that existing state-of-the-art UAD approaches do not generalise well to diverse types of anomalies in realistic multi-modal MR data. To overcome this, we introduce a new UAD method named Aggregated Normative Diffusion (ANDi). ANDi operates by aggregating differences between predicted denoising steps and ground truth backwards transitions in Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) that have been trained on pyramidal Gaussian noise. We validate ANDi against three recent UAD baselines, and across three diverse brain MRI datasets. We show that ANDi, in some cases, substantially surpasses these baselines and shows increased robustness to varying types of anomalies. Particularly in detecting multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions, ANDi achieves improvements of up to 178% in terms of AUPRC",

    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Vision transformer (ViT) has shown high potential in video recognition, owing to its flexible design, adaptable self-attention mechanisms, and the efficacy of masked pre-training. Yet, it still remains unclear how to adapt these pre-trained short-term ViTs for temporal action detection (TAD) in untrimmed videos. The existing works treat them as off-the-shelf feature extractors for each short trimmed snippet without capturing the fine-grained relation among different snippets in a broader temporal context. To mitigate this issue, this paper focuses on designing a new mechanism for adapting these pre-trained ViT models as a unified long-form video transformer to fully unleash its modeling power in capturing inter-snippet relation, while still keeping low computation overhead and memory consumption for efficient TAD. To this end, we design effective cross-snippet propagation modules to gradually exchange short-term video information among different snippets from two levels. For inner-backbone information propagation, we introduce a cross-snippet propagation strategy to enable multi-snippet temporal feature interaction inside the backbone. For post-backbone information propagation, we propose temporal transformer layers for further clip-level modeling. With the plain ViT-B pre-trained with VideoMAE, our end-to-end temporal action detector (ViT-TAD) yields a very competitive performance to previous temporal action detectors, riching up to 69.0 average mAP on THUMOS14, 37.12 average mAP on ActivityNet-1.3 and 17.20 average mAP on FineAction",

    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated their incredible capability in image understanding and response generation. However, this rich visual interaction also makes LVLMs vulnerable to adversarial examples. In this paper, we formulate a novel and practical gray-box attack scenario that the adversary can only access the visual encoder of the victim LVLM, without the knowledge of its prompts (which are often proprietary for service providers and not publicly available) and its underlying large language model (LLM). This practical setting poses challenges to the cross-prompt and cross-model transferability of targeted adversarial attack, which aims to confuse the LVLM to output a response that is semantically similar to the attacker's chosen target text. To this end, we propose an instruction-tuned targeted attack (dubbed InstructTA) to deliver the targeted adversarial attack on LVLMs with high transferability. Initially, we utilize a public text-to-image generative model to \"reverse\" the target response into a target image, and employ GPT-4 to infer a reasonable instruction $\\boldsymbol{p}^\\prime$ from the target response. We then form a local surrogate model (sharing the same visual encoder with the victim LVLM) to extract instruction-aware features of an adversarial image example and the target image, and minimize the distance between these two features to optimize the adversarial example. To further improve the transferability, we augment the instruction $\\boldsymbol{p}^\\prime$ with instructions paraphrased from an LLM. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method in targeted attack performance and transferability",

    "abstract": "Visual question answering (VQA) is a fundamental and essential AI task, and VQA-based disaster scenario understanding is a hot research topic. For instance, we can ask questions about a disaster image by the VQA model and the answer can help identify whether anyone or anything is affected by the disaster. However, previous VQA models for disaster damage assessment have some shortcomings, such as limited candidate answer space, monotonous question types, and limited answering capability of existing models. In this paper, we propose a zero-shot VQA model named Zero-shot VQA for Flood Disaster Damage Assessment (ZFDDA). It is a VQA model for damage assessment without pre-training. Also, with flood disaster as the main research object, we build a Freestyle Flood Disaster Image Question Answering dataset (FFD-IQA) to evaluate our VQA model. This new dataset expands the question types to include free-form, multiple-choice, and yes-no questions. At the same time, we expand the size of the previous dataset to contain a total of 2,058 images and 22,422 question-meta ground truth pairs. Most importantly, our model uses well-designed chain of thought (CoT) demonstrations to unlock the potential of the large language model, allowing zero-shot VQA to show better performance in disaster scenarios. The experimental results show that the accuracy in answering complex questions is greatly improved with CoT prompts.

Due to the unique multi-instance learning of medical images and the difficulty in identifying decision-making regions, many interpretability models that have been proposed still have problems of insufficient accuracy and interpretability in medical image disease diagnosis. To solve these problems, we propose feature-driven inference network (FeaInfNet). Our first key innovation involves proposing a feature-based network reasoning structure, which is applied to FeaInfNet. The network of this structure compares the similarity of each sub-region image patch with the disease templates and normal templates that may appear in the region, and finally combines the comparison of each sub-region to make the final diagnosis. It simulates the diagnosis process of doctors to make the model interpretable in the reasoning process, while avoiding the misleading caused by the participation of normal areas in reasoning. Secondly, we propose local feature masks (LFM) to extract feature vectors in order to provide global information for these vectors, thus enhancing the expressive ability of the FeaInfNet. Finally, we propose adaptive dynamic masks (Adaptive-DM) to interpret feature vectors and prototypes into human-understandable image patches to provide accurate visual interpretation. We conducted qualitative and quantitative experiments on multiple publicly available medical datasets, including RSNA, iChallenge-PM, Covid-19, ChinaCXRSet, and MontgomerySet.

    "abstract": "When models, e.g., for semantic segmentation, are applied to images that are vastly different from training data, the performance will drop significantly. Domain adaptation methods try to overcome this issue, but need samples from the target domain. However, this might not always be feasible for various reasons and therefore domain generalization methods are useful as they do not require any target data. We present a new diffusion-based domain extension (DIDEX) method and employ a diffusion model to generate a pseudo-target domain with diverse text prompts. In contrast to existing methods, this allows to control the style and content of the generated images and to introduce a high diversity. In a second step, we train a generalizing model by adapting towards this pseudo-target domain. We outperform previous approaches by a large margin across various datasets and architectures without using any real data. For the generalization from GTA5, we improve state-of-the-art mIoU performance by 3.8% absolute on average and for SYNTHIA by 11.8% absolute, marking a big step for the generalization performance on these benchmarks.

Specifically, in the first stage, we map the audio to mesh by learning two motions, including non-rigid expression motion and rigid head motion. For expression motion, both blendshape and vertex are adopted as the intermediate representation to maximize the representation ability of the model. For natural head motion, a novel learnable head pose codebook with a two-phase training mechanism is proposed. In the second stage, we proposed a dual branch motion-vae and a generator to transform the meshes into dense motion and synthesize high-quality video frame-by-frame. Extensive experiments show that the proposed VividTalk can generate high-visual quality talking head videos with lip-sync and realistic enhanced by a large margin, and outperforms previous state-of-the-art works in objective and subjective comparisons",

    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Test-time adaptation (TTA) adapts the pre-trained models during inference using unlabeled test data and has received a lot of research attention due to its potential practical value. Unfortunately, without any label supervision, existing TTA methods rely heavily on heuristic or empirical studies. Where to update the model always falls into suboptimal or brings more computational resource consumption. Meanwhile, there is still a significant performance gap between the TTA approaches and their supervised counterparts. Motivated by active learning, in this work, we propose the active test-time adaptation for semantic segmentation setup. Specifically, we introduce the human-in-the-loop pattern during the testing phase, which queries very few labels to facilitate predictions and model updates in an online manner. To do so, we propose a simple but effective ATASeg framework, which consists of two parts, i.e., model adapter and label annotator. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ATASeg bridges the performance gap between TTA methods and their supervised counterparts with only extremely few annotations, even one click for labeling surpasses known SOTA TTA methods by 2.6% average mIoU on ACDC benchmark. Empirical results imply that progress in either the model adapter or the label annotator will bring improvements to the ATASeg framework, giving it large research and reality potential",

    "abstract": "Plug-and-play algorithms constitute a popular framework for solving inverse imaging problems that rely on the implicit definition of an image prior via a denoiser. These algorithms can leverage powerful pre-trained denoisers to solve a wide range of imaging tasks, circumventing the necessity to train models on a per-task basis. Unfortunately, plug-and-play methods often show unstable behaviors, hampering their promise of versatility and leading to suboptimal quality of reconstructed images. In this work, we show that enforcing equivariance to certain groups of transformations (rotations, reflections, and/or translations) on the denoiser strongly improves the stability of the algorithm as well as its reconstruction quality. We provide a theoretical analysis that illustrates the role of equivariance on better performance and stability. We present a simple algorithm that enforces equivariance on any existing denoiser by simply applying a random transformation to the input of the denoiser and the inverse transformation to the output at each iteration of the algorithm. Experiments on multiple imaging modalities and denoising networks show that the equivariant plug-and-play algorithm improves both the reconstruction performance and the stability compared to their non-equivariant counterparts",

However, existing generative AI mostly focuses on producing visually pleasant artworks, without emphasizing the painting process. We introduce a novel task, Collaborative Neural Painting (CNP), to facilitate collaborative art painting generation between humans and machines. Given any number of user-input brushstrokes as the context or just the desired object class, CNP should produce a sequence of strokes supporting the completion of a coherent painting. Importantly, the process can be gradual and iterative, so allowing users' modifications at any phase until the completion. Moreover, we propose to solve this task using a painting representation based on a sequence of parametrized strokes, which makes it easy both editing and composition operations. These parametrized strokes are processed by a Transformer-based architecture with a novel attention mechanism to model the relationship between the input strokes and the strokes to complete. We also propose a new masking scheme to reflect the interactive nature of CNP and adopt diffusion models as the basic learning process for its effectiveness and diversity in the generative field. Finally, to develop and validate methods on the novel task, we introduce a new dataset of painted objects and an evaluation protocol to benchmark CNP both quantitatively and qualitatively.

    "abstract": "Currently, many studies have addressed security concerns related to visible and infrared detectors independently. In practical scenarios, utilizing cross-modal detectors for tasks proves more reliable than relying on single-modal detectors. Despite this, there is a lack of comprehensive security evaluations for cross-modal detectors. While existing research has explored the feasibility of attacks against cross-modal detectors, the implementation of a robust attack remains unaddressed. This work introduces the Two-stage Optimized Unified Adversarial Patch (TOUAP) designed for performing attacks against visible-infrared cross-modal detectors in real-world, black-box settings. The TOUAP employs a two-stage optimization process: firstly, PSO optimizes an irregular polygonal infrared patch to attack the infrared detector; secondly, the color QR code is optimized, and the shape information of the infrared patch from the first stage is used as a mask. The resulting irregular polygon visible modal patch executes an attack on the visible detector. Through extensive experiments conducted in both digital and physical environments, we validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. As the TOUAP surpasses baseline performance, we advocate for its widespread attention",

In this paper, we present IMProv - a generative model that is able to in-context learn visual tasks from multimodal prompts. Given a textual description of a visual task (e.g. \"Left: input image, Right: foreground segmentation\"), a few input-output visual examples, or both, the model in-context learns to solve it for a new test input. We train a masked generative transformer on a new dataset of figures from computer vision papers and their associated captions, together with a captioned large-scale image-text dataset. During inference time, we prompt the model with text and/or image task example(s) and have the model inpaint the corresponding output. We show that training our model with text conditioning and scaling the dataset size improves in-context learning for computer vision tasks by over +10\\% AP for Foreground Segmentation, over +5\\% gains in AP for Single Object Detection, and almost 20\\% lower LPIPS in Colorization. Our empirical results suggest that vision and language prompts are complementary and it is advantageous to use both to achieve better in-context learning performance.

    "abstract": "Our study aims to utilize fMRI to identify the affected brain regions within the Default Mode Network (DMN) in subjects with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), using a novel Node Significance Score (NSS). We construct subject-specific DMN graphs by employing partial correlation of Regions of Interest (ROIs) that make-up the DMN. For the DMN graph, ROIs are the nodes and edges are determined based on partial correlation. Four popular community detection algorithms (Clique Percolation Method (CPM), Louvain algorithm, Greedy Modularity and Leading Eigenvectors) are applied to determine the largest sub-community. NSS ratings are derived for each node, considering (I) frequency in the largest sub-community within a class across all subjects and (II) occurrence in the largest sub-community according to all four methods. After computing the NSS of each ROI in both healthy and MCI subjects, we quantify the score disparity to identify nodes most impacted by MCI. The results reveal a disparity exceeding 20% for 10 DMN nodes, maximally for PCC and Fusiform, showing 45.69% and 43.08% disparity. This aligns with existing medical literature, additionally providing a quantitative measure that enables the ordering of the affected ROIs. These findings offer valuable insights and could lead to treatment strategies aggressively targeting the affected nodes",

    "abstract": "The goal of weakly supervised video anomaly detection is to learn a detection model using only video-level labeled data. However, prior studies typically divide videos into fixed-length segments without considering the complexity or duration of anomalies. Moreover, these studies usually just detect the most abnormal segments, potentially overlooking the completeness of anomalies. To address these limitations, we propose a Dynamic Erasing Network (DE-Net) for weakly supervised video anomaly detection, which learns multi-scale temporal features. Specifically, to handle duration variations of abnormal events, we first propose a multi-scale temporal modeling module, capable of extracting features from segments of varying lengths and capturing both local and global visual information across different temporal scales. Then, we design a dynamic erasing strategy, which dynamically assesses the completeness of the detected anomalies and erases prominent abnormal segments in order to encourage the model to discover gentle abnormal segments in a video. The proposed method obtains favorable performance compared to several state-of-the-art approaches on three datasets: XD-Violence, TAD, and UCF-Crime.

    "abstract": "In some applications, the object space of light field imaging system is restrictive, such as industrial and medical endoscopes. If the traditional light field imaging system is used in the restrictive object space (ROS) directly but without any specific considerations, the ROS will lead to severe microlens image distortions and then affects light field decoding, calibration and 3D reconstruction. The light field imaging in restrictive object space (ROS-LF) is complicated but significant. In this paper, we first deduce that the reason of the microlens image deviation is the position variation of the angular plane, then we propose the flexible angular plane for ROS-LF, while in the traditional light field the angular plane always coincides with the main lens plane. Subsequently, we propose the microlens image non-distortion principle for ROS-LF and introduce the ROS-LF imaging principle. We demonstrate that the difference is an aperture constant term between the ROS-LF and traditional light field imaging models. At last, we design a ROS-LF simulated system and calibrate it to verify principles proposed in this paper",

    "abstract": "Zero-shot age estimation aims to learn feature information about age from input images and make inferences about a given person's image or video frame without specific sample data. The development of zero-shot age estimation can improve the efficiency and accuracy of various applications (e.g., age verification and secure access control, etc.), while also promoting research on multi-modal and zero-shot learning in the social media field. For example, zero-sample age estimation can be used to create social networks focused on specific age groups. However, existing methods mainly focus on supervised, labeled age estimation learning, and the prediction effect of zero-shot learning is very poor. To tackle the above issues, we propose a novel CLIP-driven Zero-shot Learning for Correcting Inverse Age Estimation (CZL-CIAE). Specifically, we first introduce the CLIP model to extract image features and text semantic information respectively, and map them into a highly semantically aligned high-dimensional feature space. Next, we designed a new Transformer architecture (i.e., FourierFormer) to achieve channel evolution and spatial interaction of images, and to fuse image and text semantic information. Finally, we introduce reversible age estimation, which uses end-to-end error feedback to reduce the error rate of age predictions. Through extensive experiments on multiple data sets, CZL-CIAE has achieved better age prediction results",

However, when the class imbalance ratio is high, it requires adjusting the supervised contrastive loss to support the tail classes, as the conventional contrastive learning is biased towards head classes by default. To this end, we present Rebalanced Contrastive Learning (RCL), an efficient means to increase the long tail classification accuracy by addressing three main aspects: 1. Feature space balancedness - Equal division of the feature space among all the classes, 2. Intra-Class compactness - Reducing the distance between same-class embeddings, 3. Regularization - Enforcing larger margins for tail classes to reduce overfitting. RCL adopts class frequency-based SoftMax loss balancing to supervised contrastive learning loss and exploits scalar multiplied features fed to the contrastive learning loss to enforce compactness. We implement RCL on the Balanced Contrastive Learning (BCL) Framework, which has the SOTA performance. Our experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the richness of the learnt embeddings and increased top-1 balanced accuracy RCL provides to the BCL framework. We further demonstrate that the performance of RCL as a standalone loss also achieves state-of-the-art level accuracy",

    "abstract": "Text-to-image person re-identification (ReID) aims to retrieve images of a person based on a given textual description. The key challenge is to learn the relations between detailed information from visual and textual modalities. Existing works focus on learning a latent space to narrow the modality gap and further build local correspondences between two modalities. However, these methods assume that image-to-text and text-to-image associations are modality-agnostic, resulting in suboptimal associations. In this work, we show the discrepancy between image-to-text association and text-to-image association and propose CADA: Cross-Modal Adaptive Dual Association that finely builds bidirectional image-text detailed associations. Our approach features a decoder-based adaptive dual association module that enables full interaction between visual and textual modalities, allowing for bidirectional and adaptive cross-modal correspondence associations. Specifically, the paper proposes a bidirectional association mechanism: Association of text Tokens to image Patches (ATP) and Association of image Regions to text Attributes (ARA). We adaptively model the ATP based on the fact that aggregating cross-modal features based on mistaken associations will lead to feature distortion. For modeling the ARA, since the attributes are typically the first distinguishing cues of a person, we propose to explore the attribute-level association by predicting the masked text phrase using the related image region. Finally, we learn the dual associations between texts and images, and the experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our dual formulation. Codes will be made publicly available",

SNNs can be used in conventional neural network-based time- and energy-consuming applications. However, research on generative models within SNNs remains limited, despite their advantages. In particular, diffusion models are a powerful class of generative models, whose image generation quality surpass that of the other generative models, such as GANs. However, diffusion models are characterized by high computational costs and long inference times owing to their iterative denoising feature. Therefore, we propose a novel approach fully spiking denoising diffusion implicit model (FSDDIM) to construct a diffusion model within SNNs and leverage the high speed and low energy consumption features of SNNs via synaptic current learning (SCL). SCL fills the gap in that diffusion models use a neural network to estimate real-valued parameters of a predefined probabilistic distribution, whereas SNNs output binary spike trains. The SCL enables us to complete the entire generative process of diffusion models exclusively using SNNs. We demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art fully spiking generative model",

    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we tackle the challenge of face recognition in the wild, where images often suffer from low quality and real-world distortions. Traditional heuristic approaches-either training models directly on these degraded images or their enhanced counterparts using face restoration techniques-have proven ineffective, primarily due to the degradation of facial features and the discrepancy in image domains. To overcome these issues, we propose an effective adapter for augmenting existing face recognition models trained on high-quality facial datasets. The key of our adapter is to process both the unrefined and the enhanced images by two similar structures where one is fixed and the other trainable. Such design can confer two benefits. First, the dual-input system minimizes the domain gap while providing varied perspectives for the face recognition model, where the enhanced image can be regarded as a complex non-linear transformation of the original one by the restoration model. Second, both two similar structures can be initialized by the pre-trained models without dropping the past knowledge. The extensive experiments in zero-shot settings show the effectiveness of our method by surpassing baselines of about 3%, 4%, and 7% in three datasets.

    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Full-spectrum out-of-distribution (F-OOD) detection aims to accurately recognize in-distribution (ID) samples while encountering semantic and covariate shifts simultaneously. However, existing out-of-distribution (OOD) detectors tend to overfit the covariance information and ignore intrinsic semantic correlation, inadequate for adapting to complex domain transformations. To address this issue, we propose a Likelihood-Aware Semantic Alignment (LSA) framework to promote the image-text correspondence into semantically high-likelihood regions. LSA consists of an offline Gaussian sampling strategy which efficiently samples semantic-relevant visual embeddings from the class-conditional Gaussian distribution, and a bidirectional prompt customization mechanism that adjusts both ID-related and negative context for discriminative ID/OOD boundary. Extensive experiments demonstrate the remarkable OOD detection performance of our proposed LSA especially on the intractable Near-OOD setting, surpassing existing methods by a margin of $15.26\\%$ and $18.88\\%$ on two F-OOD benchmarks, respectively",

    "title": "Simultaneous Alignment and Surface Regression Using Hybrid 2D-3D Networks for 3D Coherent Layer Segmentation of Retinal OCT Images with Full and Sparse Annotations",
    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Layer segmentation is important to quantitative analysis of retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT). Recently, deep learning based methods have been developed to automate this task and yield remarkable performance. However, due to the large spatial gap and potential mismatch between the B-scans of an OCT volume, all of them were based on 2D segmentation of individual B-scans, which may lose the continuity and diagnostic information of the retinal layers in 3D space. Besides, most of these methods required dense annotation of the OCT volumes, which is labor-intensive and expertise-demanding. This work presents a novel framework based on hybrid 2D-3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to obtain continuous 3D retinal layer surfaces from OCT volumes, which works well with both full and sparse annotations. The 2D features of individual B-scans are extracted by an encoder consisting of 2D convolutions. These 2D features are then used to produce the alignment displacement vectors and layer segmentation by two 3D decoders coupled via a spatial transformer module. Two losses are proposed to utilize the retinal layers' natural property of being smooth for B-scan alignment and layer segmentation, respectively, and are the key to the semi-supervised learning with sparse annotation. The entire framework is trained end-to-end. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that attempts 3D retinal layer segmentation in volumetric OCT images based on CNNs. Experiments on a synthetic dataset and three public clinical datasets show that our framework can effectively align the B-scans for potential motion correction, and achieves superior performance to state-of-the-art 2D deep learning methods in terms of both layer segmentation accuracy and cross-B-scan 3D continuity in both fully and semi-supervised settings, thus offering more clinical values than previous works",

    "abstract": "Given a clothing image and a person image, an image-based virtual try-on aims to generate a customized image that appears natural and accurately reflects the characteristics of the clothing image. In this work, we aim to expand the applicability of the pre-trained diffusion model so that it can be utilized independently for the virtual try-on task.The main challenge is to preserve the clothing details while effectively utilizing the robust generative capability of the pre-trained model. In order to tackle these issues, we propose StableVITON, learning the semantic correspondence between the clothing and the human body within the latent space of the pre-trained diffusion model in an end-to-end manner. Our proposed zero cross-attention blocks not only preserve the clothing details by learning the semantic correspondence but also generate high-fidelity images by utilizing the inherent knowledge of the pre-trained model in the warping process. Through our proposed novel attention total variation loss and applying augmentation, we achieve the sharp attention map, resulting in a more precise representation of clothing details. StableVITON outperforms the baselines in qualitative and quantitative evaluation, showing promising quality in arbitrary person images.

    "title": "Disentangled Interaction Representation for One-Stage Human-Object Interaction Detection",
    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection is a core task for human-centric image understanding. Recent one-stage methods adopt a transformer decoder to collect image-wide cues that are useful for interaction prediction; however, the interaction representations obtained using this method are entangled and lack interpretability. In contrast, traditional two-stage methods benefit significantly from their ability to compose interaction features in a disentangled and explainable manner. In this paper, we improve the performance of one-stage methods by enabling them to extract disentangled interaction representations. First, we propose Shunted Cross-Attention (SCA) to extract human appearance, object appearance, and global context features using different cross-attention heads. This is achieved by imposing different masks on the cross-attention maps produced by the different heads. Second, we introduce the Interaction-aware Pose Estimation (IPE) task to learn interaction-relevant human pose features using a disentangled decoder. This is achieved with a novel attention module that accurately captures the human keypoints relevant to the current interaction category. Finally, our approach fuses the appearance feature and pose feature via element-wise addition to form the interaction representation. Experimental results show that our approach can be readily applied to existing one-stage HOI detectors. Moreover, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on two benchmarks: HICO-DET and V-COCO",

In this study, we propose mutual prompt learning (mPrompt), which leverages a regressor and a segmenter as guidance for each other, solving bias and inaccuracy caused by annotation variance while distinguishing foreground from background. In specific, mPrompt leverages point annotations to tune the segmenter and predict pseudo head masks in a way of point prompt learning. It then uses the predicted segmentation masks, which serve as spatial constraint, to rectify biased point annotations as context prompt learning. mPrompt defines a way of mutual information maximization from prompt learning, mitigating the impact of annotation variance while improving model accuracy.

    "title": "Mitigating Fine-Grained Hallucination by Fine-Tuning Large Vision-Language Models with Caption Rewrites",
    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. To comprehend and execute diverse human instructions over image data, instruction-tuned large vision-language models (LVLMs) have been introduced. However, LVLMs may suffer from different types of object hallucinations. Nevertheless, LVLMs are evaluated for coarse-grained object hallucinations only (i.e., generated objects non-existent in the input image). The fine-grained object attributes and behaviors non-existent in the image may still be generated but not measured by the current evaluation methods. In this paper, we thus focus on reducing fine-grained hallucinations of LVLMs. We propose \\textit{ReCaption}, a framework that consists of two components: rewriting captions using ChatGPT and fine-tuning the instruction-tuned LVLMs on the rewritten captions. We also propose a fine-grained probing-based evaluation method named \\textit{Fine-Grained Object Hallucination Evaluation} (\\textit{FGHE}). Our experiment results demonstrate that ReCaption effectively reduces fine-grained object hallucination for different LVLM options and improves their text generation quality.

    "title": "Hulk: A Universal Knowledge Translator for Human-Centric Tasks",
    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Human-centric perception tasks, e.g., human mesh recovery, pedestrian detection, skeleton-based action recognition, and pose estimation, have wide industrial applications, such as metaverse and sports analysis. There is a recent surge to develop human-centric foundation models that can benefit a broad range of human-centric perception tasks. While many human-centric foundation models have achieved success, most of them only excel in 2D vision tasks or require extensive fine-tuning for practical deployment in real-world scenarios. These limitations severely restrict their usability across various downstream tasks and situations. To tackle these problems, we present Hulk, the first multimodal human-centric generalist model, capable of addressing most of the mainstream tasks simultaneously without task-specific finetuning, covering 2D vision, 3D vision, skeleton-based, and vision-language tasks. The key to achieving this is condensing various task-specific heads into two general heads, one for discrete representations, e.g., languages, and the other for continuous representations, e.g., location coordinates. The outputs of two heads can be further stacked into four distinct input and output modalities. This uniform representation enables Hulk to treat human-centric tasks as modality translation, integrating knowledge across a wide range of tasks. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conduct comprehensive experiments on 11 benchmarks across 8 human-centric tasks. Experimental results surpass previous methods substantially, demonstrating the superiority of our proposed method. The code will be available on https://github.com/OpenGVLab/HumanBench",

    "abstract": "Recently, the rise of query-based Transformer decoders is reshaping camera-based 3D object detection. These query-based decoders are surpassing the traditional dense BEV (Bird's Eye View)-based methods. However, we argue that dense BEV frameworks remain important due to their outstanding abilities in depth estimation and object localization, depicting 3D scenes accurately and comprehensively. This paper aims to address the drawbacks of the existing dense BEV-based 3D object detectors by introducing our proposed enhanced components, including a CRF-modulated depth estimation module enforcing object-level consistencies, a long-term temporal aggregation module with extended receptive fields, and a two-stage object decoder combining perspective techniques with CRF-modulated depth embedding. These enhancements lead to a \"modernized\" dense BEV framework dubbed BEVNeXt. On the nuScenes benchmark, BEVNeXt outperforms both BEV-based and query-based frameworks under various settings, achieving a state-of-the-art result of 64.2 NDS on the nuScenes test set",

    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) is an emerging medical imaging technique to visualize the internal anatomical structures of patients. During a CBCT scan, several projection images of different angles or views are collectively utilized to reconstruct a tomographic image. However, reducing the number of projections in a CBCT scan while preserving the quality of a reconstructed image is challenging due to the nature of an ill-posed inverse problem. Recently, a neural attenuation field (NAF) method was proposed by adopting a neural radiance field algorithm as a new way for CBCT reconstruction, demonstrating fast and promising results using only 50 views. However, decreasing the number of projections is still preferable to reduce potential radiation exposure, and a faster reconstruction time is required considering a typical scan time. In this work, we propose a fast and accurate sparse-view CBCT reconstruction (FACT) method to provide better reconstruction quality and faster optimization speed in the minimal number of view acquisitions ($<$ 50 views). In the FACT method, we meta-trained a neural network and a hash-encoder using a few scans (= 15), and a new regularization technique is utilized to reconstruct the details of an anatomical structure. In conclusion, we have shown that the FACT method produced better, and faster reconstruction results over the other conventional algorithms based on CBCT scans of different body parts (chest, head, and abdomen) and CT vendors (Siemens, Phillips, and GE)",

However, existing end-to-end models have already demonstrated remarkable capabilities. Rather than using denoising diffusion probabilistic models alone, integrating the abilities of both denoising diffusion probabilistic models and existing end-to-end models can better improve the performance of image segmentation. Based on this, we implicitly introduce residual term into the diffusion process and propose ResEnsemble-DDPM, which seamlessly integrates the diffusion model and the end-to-end model through ensemble learning. The output distributions of these two models are strictly symmetric with respect to the ground truth distribution, allowing us to integrate the two models by reducing the residual term. Experimental results demonstrate that our ResEnsemble-DDPM can further improve the capabilities of existing models.

    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Deep learning based methods for medical images can be easily compromised by adversarial examples (AEs), posing a great security flaw in clinical decision-making. It has been discovered that conventional adversarial attacks like PGD which optimize the classification logits, are easy to distinguish in the feature space, resulting in accurate reactive defenses. To better understand this phenomenon and reassess the reliability of the reactive defenses for medical AEs, we thoroughly investigate the characteristic of conventional medical AEs. Specifically, we first theoretically prove that conventional adversarial attacks change the outputs by continuously optimizing vulnerable features in a fixed direction, thereby leading to outlier representations in the feature space. Then, a stress test is conducted to reveal the vulnerability of medical images, by comparing with natural images. Interestingly, this vulnerability is a double-edged sword, which can be exploited to hide AEs. We then propose a simple-yet-effective hierarchical feature constraint (HFC), a novel add-on to conventional white-box attacks, which assists to hide the adversarial feature in the target feature distribution. The proposed method is evaluated on three medical datasets, both 2D and 3D, with different modalities. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of HFC, \\emph{i.e.,} it bypasses an array of state-of-the-art adversarial medical AE detectors more efficiently than competing adaptive attacks, which reveals the deficiencies of medical reactive defense and allows to develop more robust defenses in future",

Different from traditional Image-guided Image Style Transfer (IIST) methods that require a style reference image as input to define the desired style, recent works start to tackle the problem in a text-guided manner, i.e., Text-guided Image Style Transfer (TIST). Compared to IIST, such approaches provide more flexibility with text-specified styles, which are useful in scenarios where the style is hard to define with reference images. Unfortunately, many TIST approaches produce undesirable artifacts in the transferred images. To address this issue, we present a novel method to achieve much improved style transfer based on text guidance. Meanwhile, to offer more flexibility than IIST and TIST, our method allows style inputs from multiple sources and modalities, enabling MultiModality-guided Image Style Transfer (MMIST). Specifically, we realize MMIST with a novel cross-modal GAN inversion method, which generates style representations consistent with specified styles. Such style representations facilitate style transfer and in principle generalize any IIST methods to MMIST. Large-scale experiments and user studies demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on TIST task.

    "abstract": "Image search is an essential and user-friendly method to explore vast galleries of digital images. However, existing image search methods heavily rely on proximity measurements like tag matching or image similarity, requiring precise user inputs for satisfactory results.To meet the growing demand for a contemporary image search engine that enables accurate comprehension of users' search intentions, we introduce an innovative user intent expansion framework. Our framework leverages visual-language models to parse and compose multi-modal user inputs to provide more accurate and satisfying results. It comprises two-stage processes: 1) a parsing stage that incorporates a language parsing module with large language models to enhance the comprehension of textual inputs, along with a visual parsing module that integrates an interactive segmentation module to swiftly identify detailed visual elements within images; and 2) a logic composition stage that combines multiple user search intents into a unified logic expression for more sophisticated operations in complex searching scenarios. Moreover, the intent expansion framework enables users to perform flexible contextualized interactions with the search results to further specify or adjust their detailed search intents iteratively. We implemented the framework into an image search system for NFT (non-fungible token) search and conducted a user study to evaluate its usability and novel properties. The results indicate that the proposed framework significantly improves users' image search experience. Particularly the parsing and contextualized interactions prove useful in allowing users to express their search intents more accurately and engage in a more enjoyable iterative search experience",

    "title": "SequencePAR: Understanding Pedestrian Attributes via A Sequence Generation Paradigm",
    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Current pedestrian attribute recognition (PAR) algorithms are developed based on multi-label or multi-task learning frameworks, which aim to discriminate the attributes using specific classification heads. However, these discriminative models are easily influenced by imbalanced data or noisy samples. Inspired by the success of generative models, we rethink the pedestrian attribute recognition scheme and believe the generative models may perform better on modeling dependencies and complexity between human attributes. In this paper, we propose a novel sequence generation paradigm for pedestrian attribute recognition, termed SequencePAR. It extracts the pedestrian features using a pre-trained CLIP model and embeds the attribute set into query tokens under the guidance of text prompts. Then, a Transformer decoder is proposed to generate the human attributes by incorporating the visual features and attribute query tokens. The masked multi-head attention layer is introduced into the decoder module to prevent the model from remembering the next attribute while making attribute predictions during training. Extensive experiments on multiple widely used pedestrian attribute recognition datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed SequencePAR. The source code and pre-trained models will be released at https://github.com/Event-AHU/OpenPAR",

    "abstract": "Terahertz (THz) waves are electromagnetic waves in the 0.1 to 10 THz frequency range, and THz imaging is utilized in a range of applications, including security inspections, biomedical fields, and the non-destructive examination of materials. However, THz images have low resolution due to the long wavelength of THz waves. Therefore, improving the resolution of THz images is one of the current hot research topics. We propose a novel network architecture called J-Net which is improved version of U-Net to solve the THz image super-resolution. It employs the simple baseline blocks which can extract low resolution (LR) image features and learn the mapping of LR images to highresolution (HR) images efficiently. All training was conducted using the DIV2K+Flickr2K dataset, and we employed the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) for quantitative comparison. In our comparisons with other THz image super-resolution methods, JNet achieved a PSNR of 32.52 dB, surpassing other techniques by more than 1 dB. J-Net also demonstrates superior performance on real THz images compared to other methods. Experiments show that the proposed J-Net achieves better PSNR and visual improvement compared with other THz image super-resolution methods",

    "abstract": "Previous head avatar methods have mostly relied on fixed explicit primitives (mesh, point) or implicit surfaces (Sign Distance Function) and volumetric neural radiance field, it challenging to strike a balance among high fidelity, training speed, and resource consumption. The recent popularity of hybrid field has brought novel representation, but is limited by relying on parameterization factors obtained through fixed mappings. We propose GaussianHead: an head avatar algorithm based on anisotropic 3D gaussian primitives. We leverage canonical gaussians to represent dynamic scenes. Using explicit \"dynamic\" tri-plane as an efficient container for parameterized head geometry, aligned well with factors in the underlying geometry and tri-plane, we obtain aligned canonical factors for the canonical gaussians. With a tiny MLP, factors are decoded into opacity and spherical harmonic coefficients of 3D gaussian primitives. Finally, we use efficient differentiable gaussian rasterizer for rendering. Our approach benefits significantly from our novel representation based on 3D gaussians, and the proper alignment transformation of underlying geometry structures and factors in tri-plane eliminates biases introduced by fixed mappings. Compared to state-of-the-art techniques, we achieve optimal visual results in tasks such as self-reconstruction, novel view synthesis, and cross-identity reenactment while maintaining high rendering efficiency (0.12s per frame). Even the pores around the nose are clearly visible in some cases. Code and additional video can be found on the project homepage",

In this paper, we explore whether modern LLMs can also be adapted to classifying an image into a set of categories. First, we evaluate multimodal LLMs that are tuned for generative tasks on zero-shot image classification and find that their performance is far below that of specialized models like CLIP. We then propose an approach for light fine-tuning of LLMs using the same contrastive image-caption matching objective as CLIP. Our results show that LLMs can, indeed, achieve good image classification performance when adapted this way. Our approach beats state-of-the-art mLLMs by 13% and slightly outperforms contrastive learning with a custom text model, while also retaining the LLM's generative abilities.

Retraining a new model for adaptation to new scenarios or settings takes expensive computation and time cost, which raises the demand for versatile and universal segmentation model that can cater to various granularity. Although some attempts have been made for unifying different segmentation tasks or generalization to various scenarios, limitations in the definition of paradigms and input-output spaces make it difficult for them to achieve accurate understanding of content at arbitrary granularity. To this end, we present UniLSeg, a universal segmentation model that can perform segmentation at any semantic level with the guidance of language instructions. For training UniLSeg, we reorganize a group of tasks from original diverse distributions into a unified data format, where images with texts describing segmentation targets as input and corresponding masks are output. Combined with a automatic annotation engine for utilizing numerous unlabeled data, UniLSeg achieves excellent performance on various tasks and settings, surpassing both specialist and unified segmentation models",

Technically, we first formulate the full residual model where Gradient, Hessian and observation covariance are explicitly modeled. Then Schur complement is employed to decompose the full model into ego-motion residual model and landmark residual model. Finally, Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) update is implemented in these two models with high efficiency.

    "abstract": "Multimodal Person Reidentification is gaining popularity in the research community due to its effectiveness compared to counter-part unimodal frameworks. However, the bottleneck for multimodal deep learning is the need for a large volume of multimodal training examples. Data augmentation techniques such as cropping, flipping, rotation, etc. are often employed in the image domain to improve the generalization of deep learning models. Augmenting in other modalities than images, such as text, is challenging and requires significant computational resources and external data sources. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of two computer vision data augmentation techniques: cutout and cutmix, for text augmentation in multi-modal person re-identification. Our approach merges these two augmentation strategies into one strategy called CutMixOut which involves randomly removing words or sub-phrases from a sentence (Cutout) and blending parts of two or more sentences to create diverse examples (CutMix) with a certain probability assigned to each operation. This augmentation was implemented at inference time without any prior training. Our results demonstrate that the proposed technique is simple and effective in improving the performance on multiple multimodal person re-identification benchmarks",

However, LVLMs are usually trained on short high-level captions only referring to sparse focus regions in images. Such a ``tunnel vision'' limits LVLMs to exploring other relevant contexts in complex scenes. To address this challenge, we introduce Question-Driven Visual Exploration (QVix), a novel prompting strategy that enhances the exploratory capabilities of LVLMs in zero-shot reasoning tasks. QVix leverages LLMs' strong language prior to generate input-exploratory questions with more details than the original query, guiding LVLMs to explore visual content more comprehensively and uncover subtle or peripheral details. QVix enables a wider exploration of visual scenes, improving the LVLMs' reasoning accuracy and depth in tasks such as visual question answering and visual entailment. Our evaluations on various challenging zero-shot vision-language benchmarks, including ScienceQA and fine-grained visual classification, demonstrate that QVix significantly outperforms existing methods, highlighting its effectiveness in bridging the gap between complex visual data and LVLMs' exploratory abilities",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) have demonstrated strong capabilities in zero-shot classification by aligning visual representations with target text embeddings in an image level. However, in dense prediction tasks, CLIP often struggles to localize visual features within an image and fails to give accurate pixel-level predictions, which prevents it from functioning as a generalized visual foundation model. In this work, we aim to enhance CLIP's potential for semantic segmentation with minimal modifications to its pretrained models. By rethinking self-attention, we surprisingly find that CLIP can adapt to dense prediction tasks by simply introducing a novel Correlative Self-Attention (CSA) mechanism. Specifically, we replace the traditional self-attention block of CLIP vision encoder's last layer by our CSA module and reuse its pretrained projection matrices of query, key, and value, leading to a training-free adaptation approach for CLIP's zero-shot semantic segmentation. Extensive experiments show the advantage of CSA: we obtain a 38.2% average zero-shot mIoU across eight semantic segmentation benchmarks highlighted in this paper, significantly outperforming the existing SoTA's 33.9% and the vanilla CLIP's 14.1%",

We propose Signed Binarization, a unified co-design framework that synergistically integrates hardware-software systems, quantization functions, and representation learning techniques to address this trade-off. Our results demonstrate that Signed Binarization is more accurate than binarization with the same number of non-zero weights. Detailed analysis indicates that signed binarization generates a smaller distribution of effectual (non-zero) parameters nested within a larger distribution of total parameters, both of the same type, for a DNN block. Finally, our approach achieves a 26% speedup on real hardware, doubles energy efficiency, and reduces density by 2.8x compared to binary methods for ResNet 18, presenting an alternative solution for deploying efficient models in resource-limited environments",

In this paper, we investigate a challenging yet practical scenario of BDD, Unsupervised Building Damage Detection (U-BDD), where only unlabelled pre- and post-disaster satellite image pairs are provided. As a pilot study, we have first proposed an advanced U-BDD baseline that leverages pre-trained vision-language foundation models (i.e., Grounding DINO, SAM and CLIP) to address the U-BDD task. However, the apparent domain gap between satellite and generic images causes low confidence in the foundation models used to identify buildings and their damages. In response, we further present a novel self-supervised framework, U-BDD++, which improves upon the U-BDD baseline by addressing domain-specific issues associated with satellite imagery. Furthermore, the new Building Proposal Generation (BPG) module and the CLIP-enabled noisy Building Proposal Selection (CLIP-BPS) module in U-BDD++ ensure high-quality self-training. Extensive experiments on the widely used building damage assessment benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for unsupervised building damage detection.

    "abstract": "Cross-view person matching and 3D human pose estimation in multi-camera networks are particularly difficult when the cameras are extrinsically uncalibrated. Existing efforts generally require large amounts of 3D data for training neural networks or known camera poses for geometric constraints to solve the problem. However, camera poses and 3D data annotation are usually expensive and not always available. We present a method, PME, that solves the two tasks without requiring either information. Our idea is to address cross-view person matching as a clustering problem using each person as a cluster center, then obtain correspondences from person matches, and estimate 3D human poses through multi-view triangulation and bundle adjustment. We solve the clustering problem by introducing a \"size constraint\" using the number of cameras and a \"source constraint\" using the fact that two people from the same camera view should not match, to narrow the solution space to a small feasible region. The 2D human poses used in clustering are obtained through a pre-trained 2D pose detector, so our method does not require expensive 3D training data for each new scene. We extensively evaluate our method on three open datasets and two indoor and outdoor datasets collected using arbitrarily set cameras. Our method outperforms other methods by a large margin on cross-view person matching, reaches SOTA performance on 3D human pose estimation without using either camera poses or 3D training data, and shows good generalization ability across five datasets of various environment settings",

Consequently, concomitant with the decreasing cost of capturing these images, there is a need to develop efficient techniques for storing, transmitting, and analyzing hyperspectral images. This paper develops a method for hyperspectral image compression using implicit neural representations where a multilayer perceptron network F with sinusoidal activation functions \"learns\" to map pixel locations to pixel intensities for a given hyperspectral image I. F thus acts as a compressed encoding of this image, and the original image is reconstructed by evaluating F at each pixel location. We use a sampling method with two factors: window size and sampling rate to reduce the compression time. We have evaluated our method on four benchmarks -- Indian Pines, Jasper Ridge, Pavia University, and Cuprite using PSNR and SSIM -- and we show that the proposed method achieves better compression than JPEG, JPEG2000, and PCA-DCT at low bitrates. Besides, we compare our results with the learning-based methods like PCA+JPEG2000, FPCA+JPEG2000, 3D DCT, 3D DWT+SVR, and WSRC and show the corresponding results in the \"Compression Results\" section.

There is a notable gap between the theoretical assumptions researchers make about computer vision models and the reality those models face when deployed in the real world. One of the critical reasons for this gap is a challenging problem known as distribution shift. Distribution shifts tend to vary with complexity of the data, dataset size, and application type. In our paper, we discuss the identification of such a prominent gap, exploring the concept of distribution shift and its critical significance. We provide an in-depth overview of various types of distribution shifts, elucidate their distinctions, and explore techniques within the realm of the data-centric domain employed to address them. Distribution shifts can occur during every phase of the machine learning pipeline, from the data collection stage to the stage of training a machine learning model to the stage of final model deployment. As a result, it raises concerns about the overall robustness of the machine learning techniques for computer vision applications that are deployed publicly for consumers. Different deep learning models each tailored for specific type of data and tasks, architectural pipelines; highlighting how variations in data preprocessing and feature extraction can impact robustness., data augmentation strategies (e.g. geometric, synthetic and learning-based); demonstrating their role in enhancing model generalization, and training mechanisms (e.g. transfer learning, zero-shot) fall under the umbrella of data-centric methods. Each of these components form an integral part of the neural-network we analyze contributing uniquely to strengthening model robustness against distribution shifts.

    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Recently, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has showcased remarkable capabilities of zero-shot segmentation, while NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields) has gained popularity as a method for various 3D problems beyond novel view synthesis. Though there exist initial attempts to incorporate these two methods into 3D segmentation, they face the challenge of accurately and consistently segmenting objects in complex scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the Segment Anything for NeRF in High Quality (SANeRF-HQ) to achieve high quality 3D segmentation of any object in a given scene. SANeRF-HQ utilizes SAM for open-world object segmentation guided by user-supplied prompts, while leveraging NeRF to aggregate information from different viewpoints. To overcome the aforementioned challenges, we employ density field and RGB similarity to enhance the accuracy of segmentation boundary during the aggregation. Emphasizing on segmentation accuracy, we evaluate our method quantitatively on multiple NeRF datasets where high-quality ground-truths are available or manually annotated. SANeRF-HQ shows a significant quality improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods in NeRF object segmentation, provides higher flexibility for object localization, and enables more consistent object segmentation across multiple views.

    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Expert annotation of 3D medical image for downstream analysis is resource-intensive, posing challenges in clinical applications. Visual self-supervised learning (vSSL), though effective for learning visual invariance, neglects the incorporation of domain knowledge from medicine. To incorporate medical knowledge into visual representation learning, vision-language pre-training (VLP) has shown promising results in 2D image. However, existing VLP approaches become generally impractical when applied to high-resolution 3D medical images due to GPU hardware constraints and the potential loss of critical details caused by downsampling, which is the intuitive solution to hardware constraints. To address the above limitations, we introduce T3D, the first VLP framework designed for high-resolution 3D medical images. T3D incorporates two text-informed pretext tasks: (\\lowerromannumeral{1}) text-informed contrastive learning; (\\lowerromannumeral{2}) text-informed image restoration. These tasks focus on learning 3D visual representations from high-resolution 3D medical images and integrating clinical knowledge from radiology reports, without distorting information through forced alignment of downsampled volumes with detailed anatomical text. Trained on a newly curated large-scale dataset of 3D medical images and radiology reports, T3D significantly outperforms current vSSL methods in tasks like organ and tumor segmentation, as well as disease classification. This underlines T3D's potential in representation learning for 3D medical image analysis. All data and code will be available upon acceptance",

    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Recently, medical vision-language pre-training (VLP) has reached substantial progress to learn global visual representation from medical images and their paired radiology reports. However, medical imaging tasks in real world usually require finer granularity in visual features. These tasks include visual localization tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation, object detection) and visual grounding task. Yet, current medical VLP methods face challenges in learning these fine-grained features, as they primarily focus on brute-force alignment between image patches and individual text tokens for local visual feature learning, which is suboptimal for downstream dense prediction tasks. In this work, we propose a new VLP framework, named \\textbf{G}lobal to \\textbf{D}ense level representation learning (G2D) that achieves significantly improved granularity and more accurate grounding for the learned features, compared to existing medical VLP approaches. In particular, G2D learns dense and semantically-grounded image representations via a pseudo segmentation task parallel with the global vision-language alignment. Notably, generating pseudo segmentation targets does not incur extra trainable parameters: they are obtained on the fly during VLP with a parameter-free processor. G2D achieves superior performance across 6 medical imaging tasks and 25 diseases, particularly in semantic segmentation, which necessitates fine-grained, semantically-grounded image features. In this task, G2D surpasses peer models even when fine-tuned with just 1\\% of the training data, compared to the 100\\% used by these models. The code will be released upon acceptance",

In this paper, we propose CityGen, a novel end-to-end framework for infinite, diverse and controllable 3D city layout generation.First, we propose an outpainting pipeline to extend the local layout to an infinite city layout. Then, we utilize a multi-scale diffusion model to generate diverse and controllable local semantic layout patches. The extensive experiments show that CityGen achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance under FID and KID in generating an infinite and controllable 3D city layout.

In particular, Large Language Models (LLM) have demonstrated impressive capabilities recently and continued to set new state-of-the-art performance on almost all natural language tasks. While many have proposed architectures to combine vision models with LLMs for multimodal tasks, few have explored practical fine-tuning strategies.

Material-specific parameters are used by the formulation to control the garment inextensibility. This delivers unrealistic results with physically implausible stretching. Oftentimes, the draped garment is pushed inside the body which is either corrected by an expensive post-processing, thus adding to further inconsistent stretching; or by deploying a separate training regime for each body type, restricting its scalability. Additionally, the flawed skinning process deployed by existing methods produces incorrect results on loose garments. In this paper, we introduce a geometrical constraint to the existing formulation that is collision-aware and imposes garment inextensibility wherever possible. Thus, we obtain realistic results where draped clothes stretch only while covering bigger body regions. Furthermore, we propose a geometry-aware garment skinning method by defining a body-garment closeness measure which works for all garment types, especially the loose ones",

    "title": "Diffusion Posterior Sampling for Nonlinear CT Reconstruction",
    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Diffusion models have been demonstrated as powerful deep learning tools for image generation in CT reconstruction and restoration. Recently, diffusion posterior sampling, where a score-based diffusion prior is combined with a likelihood model, has been used to produce high quality CT images given low-quality measurements. This technique is attractive since it permits a one-time, unsupervised training of a CT prior; which can then be incorporated with an arbitrary data model. However, current methods only rely on a linear model of x-ray CT physics to reconstruct or restore images. While it is common to linearize the transmission tomography reconstruction problem, this is an approximation to the true and inherently nonlinear forward model. We propose a new method that solves the inverse problem of nonlinear CT image reconstruction via diffusion posterior sampling. We implement a traditional unconditional diffusion model by training a prior score function estimator, and apply Bayes rule to combine this prior with a measurement likelihood score function derived from the nonlinear physical model to arrive at a posterior score function that can be used to sample the reverse-time diffusion process. This plug-and-play method allows incorporation of a diffusion-based prior with generalized nonlinear CT image reconstruction into multiple CT system designs with different forward models, without the need for any additional training. We develop the algorithm that performs this reconstruction, including an ordered-subsets variant for accelerated processing and demonstrate the technique in both fully sampled low dose data and sparse-view geometries using a single unsupervised training of the prior",

In addition, the best-performing methods have not proven to be generalizable to diverse test datasets with contrast variations and image artifacts. In this work, we developed an accurate and generalizable MS lesion segmentation model using the well-known U-Net architecture without further modification. A novel test-time self-ensembled lesion fusion strategy is proposed that not only achieved the best performance using the ISBI 2015 MS segmentation challenge data but also demonstrated robustness across various self-ensemble parameter choices.

Driver intention can be leveraged to improve road safety, such as warning surrounding vehicles in the event the driver is attempting a dangerous maneuver. In this work, we propose a novel method of utilizing in-cabin and external camera data to improve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in predicting future driver actions. Compared to existing methods, our approach explicitly extracts object and road-level features from external camera data, which we demonstrate are important features for predicting driver intention. Using our handcrafted features as inputs for both a transformer and an LSTM-based architecture, we empirically show that jointly utilizing in-cabin and external features improves performance compared to using in-cabin features alone. Furthermore, our models predict driver maneuvers more accurately and earlier than existing approaches, with an accuracy of 87.5% and an average prediction time of 4.35 seconds before the maneuver takes place.

However, combining image and text modalities using current state-of-the-art methods has been a challenge due to the high resolution of histopathology images. Automatic report generation for histopathology images is one such challenge. In this work, we show that using an existing pre-trained Vision Transformer in a two-step process of first using it to encode 4096x4096 sized patches of the Whole Slide Image (WSI) and then using it as the encoder and a pre-trained Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model for language modeling-based decoder for report generation, we can build a fairly performant and portable report generation mechanism that takes into account the whole of the high resolution image, instead of just the patches. Our method allows us to not only generate and evaluate captions that describe the image, but also helps us classify the image into tissue types and the gender of the patient as well.

In this work we present the Disentangled-and-Deformable Spatio-Temporal Adapter (D$^2$ST-Adapter), a novel adapter tuning framework for few-shot action recognition, which is designed in a dual-pathway architecture to encode spatial and temporal features in a disentangled manner.

However, rendering dynamic, long-duration radiance fields on ubiquitous devices remains challenging, due to data storage and computational constraints.

At the core is a serialized 2D feature image stream representing the 4D radiance field all in one. We introduce a tailored training scheme directly applied to this 2D domain to impose the temporal and spatial redundancy of the feature image stream. By leveraging the redundancy, we show that the feature image stream can be efficiently compressed by 2D video codecs, which allows us to exploit video hardware accelerators to achieve real-time decoding. On the other hand, based on the feature image stream, we propose a novel rendering pipeline for VideoRF, which has specialized space mappings to query radiance properties efficiently. Paired with a deferred shading model, VideoRF has the capability of real-time rendering on mobile devices thanks to its efficiency.

Sparse neural networks as the product, have demonstrated numerous favorable benefits like low complexity, undamaged generalization, etc. Most of the prominent pruning strategies are invented from a model-centric perspective, focusing on searching and preserving crucial weights by analyzing network topologies. However, the role of data and its interplay with model-centric pruning has remained relatively unexplored. In this research, we introduce a novel data-model co-design perspective: to promote superior weight sparsity by learning important model topology and adequate input data in a synergetic manner. Specifically, customized Visual Prompts are mounted to upgrade neural Network sparsification in our proposed VPNs framework. As a pioneering effort, this paper conducts systematic investigations about the impact of different visual prompts on model pruning and suggests an effective joint optimization approach. Extensive experiments with 3 network architectures and 8 datasets evidence the substantial performance improvements from VPNs over existing start-of-the-art pruning algorithms. Furthermore, we find that subnetworks discovered by VPNs from pre-trained models enjoy better transferability across diverse downstream scenarios.

To handle various weather conditions, an AiO framework is expected to adaptively learn weather-specific knowledge for different degradations and shared knowledge for common patterns. However, existing methods: 1) rely on extra supervision signals, which are usually unknown in real-world applications; 2) employ fixed network structures, which restrict the diversity of weather-specific knowledge. In this paper, we propose a Language-driven Restoration framework (LDR) to alleviate the aforementioned issues. First, we leverage the power of pre-trained vision-language (PVL) models to enrich the diversity of weather-specific knowledge by reasoning about the occurrence, type, and severity of degradation, generating description-based degradation priors. Then, with the guidance of degradation prior, we sparsely select restoration experts from a candidate list dynamically based on a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) structure. This enables us to adaptively learn the weather-specific and shared knowledge to handle various weather conditions (e.g., unknown or mixed weather).

It is regrettable that this avenue remains unexplored and underutilized, a consequence from the challenges mainly associated with three aspects: 1) the intrinsic imprecision of verbal descriptions; 2) the significant gaps between texts and images; and 3) the immense hurdle posed by insufficient databases.To tackle this problem, we present DiFace, a solution that effectively achieves face recognition via text through a controllable diffusion process, by establishing its theoretical connection with probability transport. Our approach not only unleashes the potential of DPMs across a broader spectrum of tasks but also achieves, to the best of our knowledge, a significant accuracy in text-to-image face recognition for the first time, as demonstrated by our experiments on verification and identification",

    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Emerging Implicit Neural Representation (INR) is a promising data compression technique, which represents the data using the parameters of a Deep Neural Network (DNN). Existing methods manually partition a complex scene into local regions and overfit the INRs into those regions. However, manually designing the partition scheme for a complex scene is very challenging and fails to jointly learn the partition and INRs. To solve the problem, we propose MoEC, a novel implicit neural compression method based on the theory of mixture of experts. Specifically, we use a gating network to automatically assign a specific INR to a 3D point in the scene. The gating network is trained jointly with the INRs of different local regions. Compared with block-wise and tree-structured partitions, our learnable partition can adaptively find the optimal partition in an end-to-end manner. We conduct detailed experiments on massive and diverse biomedical data to demonstrate the advantages of MoEC against existing approaches. In most of experiment settings, we have achieved state-of-the-art results. Especially in cases of extreme compression ratios, such as 6000x, we are able to uphold the PSNR of 48.16",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, pulmonary Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) is the main tool for detecting Pulmonary Embolism (PE). However, manual interpretation of CTA volume requires a radiologist, which is time-consuming and error-prone due to the specific conditions of lung tissue, large volume of data, lack of experience, and eye fatigue. Therefore, Computer-Aided Design (CAD) systems are used as a second opinion for the diagnosis of PE. The purpose of this article is to review, evaluate, and compare the performance of deep learning and traditional-based CAD system for diagnosis PE and to help physicians and researchers in this field. In this study, all articles available in databases such as IEEE, ScienceDirect, Wiley, Springer, Nature, and Wolters Kluwer in the field of PE diagnosis were examined using traditional and deep learning methods. From 2002 to 2023, 23 papers were studied to extract the articles with the considered limitations. Each paper presents an automatic PE detection system that we evaluate using criteria such as sensitivity, False Positives (FP), and the number of datasets. This research work includes recent studies, state-of-the-art research works, and a more comprehensive overview compared to previously published review articles in this research area",

    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Medical imaging provides many valuable clues involving anatomical structure and pathological characteristics. However, image degradation is a common issue in clinical practice, which can adversely impact the observation and diagnosis by physicians and algorithms. Although extensive enhancement models have been developed, these models require a well pre-training before deployment, while failing to take advantage of the potential value of inference data after deployment. In this paper, we raise an algorithm for source-free unsupervised domain adaptive medical image enhancement (SAME), which adapts and optimizes enhancement models using test data in the inference phase. A structure-preserving enhancement network is first constructed to learn a robust source model from synthesized training data. Then a teacher-student model is initialized with the source model and conducts source-free unsupervised domain adaptation (SFUDA) by knowledge distillation with the test data. Additionally, a pseudo-label picker is developed to boost the knowledge distillation of enhancement tasks. Experiments were implemented on ten datasets from three medical image modalities to validate the advantage of the proposed algorithm, and setting analysis and ablation studies were also carried out to interpret the effectiveness of SAME. The remarkable enhancement performance and benefits for downstream tasks demonstrate the potential and generalizability of SAME.

In this study, we propose a facial emotion recognition system capable of recognizing emotions from individuals wearing different face masks. A novel data augmentation technique was utilized to improve the performance of our model using four mask types for each face image. We evaluated the effectiveness of four convolutional neural networks, Alexnet, Squeezenet, Resnet50 and VGGFace2 that were trained using transfer learning. The experimental findings revealed that our model works effectively in multi-mask mode compared to single-mask mode. The VGGFace2 network achieved the highest accuracy rate, with 97.82% for the person-dependent mode and 74.21% for the person-independent mode using the JAFFE dataset. However, we evaluated our proposed model using the UIBVFED dataset. The Resnet50 has demonstrated superior performance, with accuracies of 73.68% for the person-dependent mode and 59.57% for the person-independent mode. Moreover, we employed metrics such as precision, sensitivity, specificity, AUC, F1 score, and confusion matrix to measure our system's efficiency in detail.

Additionally, utilizing a parallel configuration within each Transformer block rather than the conventional serialized method has been revealed to accelerate the training of LLMs without significantly impacting performance. However, when the MLP and attention block were run in parallel for the image classification task, we observed a noticeable decline in performance. We propose a novel transformer variant that integrates non-linearity within the attention block to tackle this problem. We implemented the GLU-based activation function on the Value tensor, and this new technique surpasses the current state-of-the-art S/16 variant of Vision Transformers by 0.6% on the ImageNet-1K dataset while utilizing fewer parameters. It also supersedes the B/16 variant while using only half the parameters. Furthermore, we provide results with the GELU activation function variant to confirm our assertions. Lastly, we showcase that the MABViT variants exhibit greater potential when utilized in deep transformers compared to the standard architecture",

The state-of-the-art methods recognize object shapes via image reconstruction or pixel classification. However , these methods are biased toward texture information and overlook the essential shape descriptions, thus, they fail to generalize to unseen shapes. We are the first to propose a fewshot shape descriptor (FSSD) to recognize object shapes given only one or a few samples. We employ an embedding module for FSSD to extract transformation-invariant shape features. Secondly, we develop a dual attention mechanism to decompose and reconstruct the shape features via learnable shape primitives. In this way, any shape can be formed through a finite set basis, and the learned representation model is highly interpretable and extendable to unseen shapes. Thirdly, we propose a decoding module to include the supervision of shape masks and edges and align the original and reconstructed shape features, enforcing the learned features to be more shape-aware. Lastly, all the proposed modules are assembled into a few-shot shape recognition scheme. Experiments on five datasets show that our FSSD significantly improves the shape classification compared to the state-of-the-art under the few-shot setting",

    "abstract": "Generalizable manipulation of articulated objects remains a challenging problem in many real-world scenarios, given the diverse object structures, functionalities, and goals. In these tasks, both semantic interpretations and physical plausibilities are crucial for a policy to succeed. To address this problem, we propose SAGE, a novel framework that bridges the understanding of semantic and actionable parts of articulated objects to achieve generalizable manipulation under language instructions. Given a manipulation goal specified by natural language, an instruction interpreter with Large Language Models (LLMs) first translates them into programmatic actions on the object's semantic parts. This process also involves a scene context parser for understanding the visual inputs, which is designed to generate scene descriptions with both rich information and accurate interaction-related facts by joining the forces of generalist Visual-Language Models (VLMs) and domain-specialist part perception models. To further convert the action programs into executable policies, a part grounding module then maps the object semantic parts suggested by the instruction interpreter into so-called Generalizable Actionable Parts (GAParts). Finally, an interactive feedback module is incorporated to respond to failures, which greatly increases the robustness of the overall framework. Experiments both in simulation environments and on real robots show that our framework can handle a large variety of articulated objects with diverse language-instructed goals. We also provide a new benchmark for language-guided articulated-object manipulation in realistic scenarios",

    "abstract": "Generating novel views of an object from a single image is a challenging task. It requires an understanding of the underlying 3D structure of the object from an image and rendering high-quality, spatially consistent new views. While recent methods for view synthesis based on diffusion have shown great progress, achieving consistency among various view estimates and at the same time abiding by the desired camera pose remains a critical problem yet to be solved. In this work, we demonstrate a strikingly simple method, where we utilize a pre-trained video diffusion model to solve this problem. Our key idea is that synthesizing a novel view could be reformulated as synthesizing a video of a camera going around the object of interest -- a scanning video -- which then allows us to leverage the powerful priors that a video diffusion model would have learned. Thus, to perform novel-view synthesis, we create a smooth camera trajectory to the target view that we wish to render, and denoise using both a view-conditioned diffusion model and a video diffusion model. By doing so, we obtain a highly consistent novel view synthesis, outperforming the state of the art",

    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "In todays competitive landscape, businesses grapple with customer retention. Churn prediction models, although beneficial, often lack accuracy due to the reliance on a single data source. The intricate nature of human behavior and high dimensional customer data further complicate these efforts. To address these concerns, this paper proposes a multimodal fusion learning model for identifying customer churn risk levels in financial service providers. Our multimodal approach integrates customer sentiments financial literacy (FL) level, and financial behavioral data, enabling more accurate and bias-free churn prediction models. The proposed FL model utilizes a SMOGN COREG supervised model to gauge customer FL levels from their financial data. The baseline churn model applies an ensemble artificial neural network and oversampling techniques to predict churn propensity in high-dimensional financial data. We also incorporate a speech emotion recognition model employing a pre-trained CNN-VGG16 to recognize customer emotions based on pitch, energy, and tone. To integrate these diverse features while retaining unique insights, we introduced late and hybrid fusion techniques that complementary boost coordinated multimodal co learning. Robust metrics were utilized to evaluate the proposed multimodal fusion model and hence the approach validity, including mean average precision and macro-averaged F1 score. Our novel approach demonstrates a marked improvement in churn prediction, achieving a test accuracy of 91.2%, a Mean Average Precision (MAP) score of 66, and a Macro-Averaged F1 score of 54 through the proposed hybrid fusion learning technique compared with late fusion and baseline models. Furthermore, the analysis demonstrates a positive correlation between negative emotions, low FL scores, and high-risk customers",

Furthermore, we also introduce a new latent-aware encoding technique in our framework named \\Approach, harnessing pretrained Stable Diffusion for advanced steganographic image generation, giving rise to a better trade-off between image quality and message recovery.

    "abstract": "Monocular depth estimation using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has shown impressive performance in outdoor driving scenes. However, self-supervised learning of indoor depth from monocular sequences is quite challenging for researchers because of the following two main reasons. One is the large areas of low-texture regions and the other is the complex ego-motion on indoor training datasets. In this work, our proposed method, named IndoorDepth, consists of two innovations. In particular, we first propose a novel photometric loss with improved structural similarity (SSIM) function to tackle the challenge from low-texture regions. Moreover, in order to further mitigate the issue of inaccurate ego-motion prediction, multiple photometric losses at different stages are used to train a deeper pose network with two residual pose blocks. Subsequent ablation study can validate the effectiveness of each new idea. Experiments on the NYUv2 benchmark demonstrate that our IndoorDepth outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.

Second, our visualization shows how different training methods matter: they lead to remarkable differences in hierarchical organization and scaling behavior, growing with more data or network capacity.

    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Neural parameter allocation search (NPAS) automates parameter sharing by obtaining weights for a network given an arbitrary, fixed parameter budget. Prior work has two major drawbacks we aim to address. First, there is a disconnect in the sharing pattern between the search and training steps, where weights are warped for layers of different sizes during the search to measure similarity, but not during training, resulting in reduced performance. To address this, we generate layer weights by learning to compose sets of SuperWeights, which represent a group of trainable parameters. These SuperWeights are created to be large enough so they can be used to represent any layer in the network, but small enough that they are computationally efficient. The second drawback we address is the method of measuring similarity between shared parameters. Whereas prior work compared the weights themselves, we argue this does not take into account the amount of conflict between the shared weights. Instead, we use gradient information to identify layers with shared weights that wish to diverge from each other. We demonstrate that our SuperWeight Networks consistently boost performance over the state-of-the-art on the ImageNet and CIFAR datasets in the NPAS setting. We further show that our approach can generate parameters for many network architectures using the same set of weights.

To the best of our knowledge, there exists no unified framework that simultaneously solves the downstream high-level understanding tasks including both segmentation and detection, especially when labels are extremely limited. This work presents a general and simple framework to tackle point cloud understanding when labels are limited. The first contribution is that we have done extensive methodology comparisons of traditional and learned 3D descriptors for the task of weakly supervised 3D scene understanding, and validated that our adapted traditional PFH-based 3D descriptors show excellent generalization ability across different domains. The second contribution is that we proposed a learning-based region merging strategy based on the affinity provided by both the traditional/learned 3D descriptors and learned semantics. The merging process takes both low-level geometric and high-level semantic feature correlations into consideration. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework has the best performance among the three most important weakly supervised point clouds understanding tasks including semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and object detection even when very limited number of points are labeled. Our method, termed Region Merging 3D (RM3D), has superior performance on ScanNet data-efficient learning online benchmarks and other four large-scale 3D understanding benchmarks under various experimental settings, outperforming current arts by a margin for various 3D understanding tasks without complicated learning strategies such as active learning",

In this paper, we propose a general approach to study and quantify a broad spectrum of biases, for any TTI model and for any prompt, using counterfactual reasoning. Unlike other works that evaluate generated images on a predefined set of bias axes, our approach automatically identifies potential biases that might be relevant to the given prompt, and measures those biases. In addition, our paper extends quantitative scores with post-hoc explanations in terms of semantic concepts in the images generated. We show that our method is uniquely capable of explaining complex multi-dimensional biases through semantic concepts, as well as the intersectionality between different biases for any given prompt.

    "abstract": "Diffusion-based image synthesis has attracted extensive attention recently. In particular, ControlNet that uses image-based prompts exhibits powerful capability in image tasks such as canny edge detection and generates images well aligned with these prompts. However, vanilla ControlNet generally requires extensive training of around 5000 steps to achieve a desirable control for a single task. Recent context-learning approaches have improved its adaptability, but mainly for edge-based tasks, and rely on paired examples. Thus, two important open issues are yet to be addressed to reach the full potential of ControlNet: (i) zero-shot control for certain tasks and (ii) faster adaptation for non-edge-based tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel Meta ControlNet method, which adopts the task-agnostic meta learning technique and features a new layer freezing design. Meta ControlNet significantly reduces learning steps to attain control ability from 5000 to 1000. Further, Meta ControlNet exhibits direct zero-shot adaptability in edge-based tasks without any finetuning, and achieves control within only 100 finetuning steps in more complex non-edge tasks such as Human Pose, outperforming all existing methods.

We first introduce the popular image classification datasets that influenced the design of models. Then, we present Vision Transformers models in chronological order, starting with early attempts at adapting attention mechanism to vision tasks followed by the adoption of vision transformers, as they have demonstrated success in capturing intricate patterns and long-range dependencies within images. Finally, we discuss open problems and shed light on opportunities for image classification to facilitate new research ideas",

    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Detecting objects in low-light scenarios presents a persistent challenge, as detectors trained on well-lit data exhibit significant performance degradation on low-light data due to the low visibility. Previous methods mitigate this issue by investigating image enhancement or object detection techniques using low-light image datasets. However, the progress is impeded by the inherent difficulties associated with collecting and annotating low-light images. To address this challenge, we propose to boost low-light object detection with zero-shot day-night domain adaptation, which aims to generalize a detector from well-lit scenarios to low-light ones without requiring real low-light data. We first design a reflectance representation learning module to learn Retinex-based illumination invariance in images with a carefully designed illumination invariance reinforcement strategy. Next, an interchange-redecomposition-coherence procedure is introduced to improve over the vanilla Retinex image decomposition process by performing two sequential image decompositions and introducing a redecomposition cohering loss. Extensive experiments on ExDark, DARK FACE and CODaN datasets show strong low-light generalizability of our method",

    "title": "A Comparative Analysis Towards Melanoma Classification Using Transfer Learning by Analyzing Dermoscopic Images",
    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Melanoma is a sort of skin cancer that starts in the cells known as melanocytes. It is more dangerous than other types of skin cancer because it can spread to other organs. Melanoma can be fatal if it spreads to other parts of the body. Early detection is the key to cure, but it requires the skills of skilled doctors to diagnose it. This paper presents a system that combines deep learning techniques with established transfer learning methods to enable skin lesions classification and diagnosis of melanoma skin lesions. Using Convolutional Neural Networks, it presents a method for categorizing melanoma images into benign and malignant images in this research (CNNs). Researchers used 'Deep Learning' techniques to train an expansive number of photos & essentially to get the expected result deep neural networks to need to be trained with a huge number of parameters as dermoscopic images are sensitive & very hard to classify. This paper, has been emphasized building models with less complexity and comparatively better accuracy with limited datasets & partially fewer deep networks so that the system can predict Melanoma at ease from input dermoscopic images as correctly as possible within devices with less computational power. The dataset has been obtained from ISIC Archive. Multiple pre-trained models ResNet101, DenseNet, EfficientNet, InceptionV3 have been implemented using transfer learning techniques to complete the comparative analysis & every model achieved good accuracy. Before training the models, the data has been augmented by multiple parameters to improve the accuracy. Moreover, the results are better than the previous state-of-the-art approaches & adequate to predict melanoma. Among these architectures, DenseNet performed better than the others which gives a validation accuracy of 96.64%, validation loss of 9.43% & test set accuracy of 99.63%",

    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Reconstructing dynamic objects from monocular videos is a severely underconstrained and challenging problem, and recent work has approached it in various directions. However, owing to the ill-posed nature of this problem, there has been no solution that can provide consistent, high-quality novel views from camera positions that are significantly different from the training views. In this work, we introduce Neural Parametric Gaussians (NPGs) to take on this challenge by imposing a two-stage approach: first, we fit a low-rank neural deformation model, which then is used as regularization for non-rigid reconstruction in the second stage. The first stage learns the object's deformations such that it preserves consistency in novel views. The second stage obtains high reconstruction quality by optimizing 3D Gaussians that are driven by the coarse model. To this end, we introduce a local 3D Gaussian representation, where temporally shared Gaussians are anchored in and deformed by local oriented volumes. The resulting combined model can be rendered as radiance fields, resulting in high-quality photo-realistic reconstructions of the non-rigidly deforming objects, maintaining 3D consistency across novel views. We demonstrate that NPGs achieve superior results compared to previous works, especially in challenging scenarios with few multi-view cues",

    "title": "Bootstrapping Interactive Image-Text Alignment for Remote Sensing Image Captioning",
    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Recently, remote sensing image captioning has gained significant attention in the remote sensing community. Due to the significant differences in spatial resolution of remote sensing images, existing methods in this field have predominantly concentrated on the fine-grained extraction of remote sensing image features, but they cannot effectively handle the semantic consistency between visual features and textual features. To efficiently align the image-text, we propose a novel two-stage vision-language pre-training-based approach to bootstrap interactive image-text alignment for remote sensing image captioning, called BITA, which relies on the design of a lightweight interactive Fourier Transformer to better align remote sensing image-text features. The Fourier layer in the interactive Fourier Transformer is capable of extracting multi-scale features of remote sensing images in the frequency domain, thereby reducing the redundancy of remote sensing visual features. Specifically, the first stage involves preliminary alignment through image-text contrastive learning, which aligns the learned multi-scale remote sensing features from the interactive Fourier Transformer with textual features. In the second stage, the interactive Fourier Transformer connects the frozen image encoder with a large language model. Then, prefix causal language modeling is utilized to guide the text generation process using visual features. Ultimately, across the UCM-caption, RSICD, and NWPU-caption datasets, the experimental results clearly demonstrate that BITA outperforms other advanced comparative approaches.

    "title": "Efficient Expansion and Gradient Based Task Inference for Replay Free Incremental Learning",
    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "This paper proposes a simple but highly efficient expansion-based model for continual learning. The recent feature transformation, masking and factorization-based methods are efficient, but they grow the model only over the global or shared parameter. Therefore, these approaches do not fully utilize the previously learned information because the same task-specific parameter forgets the earlier knowledge. Thus, these approaches show limited transfer learning ability. Moreover, most of these models have constant parameter growth for all tasks, irrespective of the task complexity. Our work proposes a simple filter and channel expansion based method that grows the model over the previous task parameters and not just over the global parameter. Therefore, it fully utilizes all the previously learned information without forgetting, which results in better knowledge transfer. The growth rate in our proposed model is a function of task complexity; therefore for a simple task, the model has a smaller parameter growth while for complex tasks, the model requires more parameters to adapt to the current task. Recent expansion based models show promising results for task incremental learning (TIL). However, for class incremental learning (CIL), prediction of task id is a crucial challenge; hence, their results degrade rapidly as the number of tasks increase. In this work, we propose a robust task prediction method that leverages entropy weighted data augmentations and the models gradient using pseudo labels. We evaluate our model on various datasets and architectures in the TIL, CIL and generative continual learning settings. The proposed approach shows state-of-the-art results in all these settings. Our extensive ablation studies show the efficacy of the proposed components",

While existing state-of-the-art augmentation pipelines incorporate a wide range of primitive transformations, these often disregard natural image structure. Thus, augmented samples can exhibit degraded semantic information and low stylistic diversity, affecting downstream performance of self-supervised representations. To overcome this, we propose SASSL: Style Augmentations for Self Supervised Learning, a novel augmentation technique based on Neural Style Transfer. The method decouples semantic and stylistic attributes in images and applies transformations exclusively to the style while preserving content, generating diverse augmented samples that better retain their semantic properties. Experimental results show our technique achieves a top-1 classification performance improvement of more than 2% on ImageNet compared to the well-established MoCo v2. We also measure transfer learning performance across five diverse datasets, observing significant improvements of up to 3.75%.

    "abstract": "Optical Character Recognition is a technique that converts document images into searchable and editable text, making it a valuable tool for processing scanned documents. While the Farsi language stands as a prominent and official language in Asia, efforts to develop efficient methods for recognizing Farsi printed text have been relatively limited. This is primarily attributed to the languages distinctive features, such as cursive form, the resemblance between certain alphabet characters, and the presence of numerous diacritics and dot placement. On the other hand, given the substantial training sample requirements of deep-based architectures for effective performance, the development of such datasets holds paramount significance. In light of these concerns, this paper aims to present a novel large-scale dataset, IDPL-PFOD2, tailored for Farsi printed text recognition. The dataset comprises 2003541 images featuring a wide variety of fonts, styles, and sizes. This dataset is an extension of the previously introduced IDPL-PFOD dataset, offering a substantial increase in both volume and diversity. Furthermore, the datasets effectiveness is assessed through the utilization of both CRNN-based and Vision Transformer architectures. The CRNN-based model achieves a baseline accuracy rate of 78.49% and a normalized edit distance of 97.72%, while the Vision Transformer architecture attains an accuracy of 81.32% and a normalized edit distance of 98.74%",

    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Due to the costliness of labelled data in real-world applications, semi-supervised learning, underpinned by pseudo labelling, is an appealing solution. However, handling confusing samples is nontrivial: discarding valuable confusing samples would compromise the model generalisation while using them for training would exacerbate the issue of confirmation bias caused by the resulting inevitable mislabelling. To solve this problem, this paper proposes to use confusing samples proactively without label correction. Specifically, a Virtual Category (VC) is assigned to each confusing sample in such a way that it can safely contribute to the model optimisation even without a concrete label. This provides an upper bound for inter-class information sharing capacity, which eventually leads to a better embedding space. Extensive experiments on two mainstream dense prediction tasks -- semantic segmentation and object detection, demonstrate that the proposed VC learning significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art, especially when only very few labels are available.

    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Zero-shot learning (ZSL) is a promising approach to generalizing a model to categories unseen during training by leveraging class attributes, but challenges remain. Recently, methods using generative models to combat bias towards classes seen during training have pushed state of the art, but these generative models can be slow or computationally expensive to train. Also, these generative models assume that the attribute vector of each unseen class is available a priori at training, which is not always practical. Additionally, while many previous ZSL methods assume a one-time adaptation to unseen classes, in reality, the world is always changing, necessitating a constant adjustment of deployed models. Models unprepared to handle a sequential stream of data are likely to experience catastrophic forgetting. We propose a Meta-learned Attribute self-Interaction Network (MAIN) for continual ZSL. By pairing attribute self-interaction trained using meta-learning with inverse regularization of the attribute encoder, we are able to outperform state-of-the-art results without leveraging the unseen class attributes while also being able to train our models substantially faster (>100x) than expensive generative-based approaches. We demonstrate this with experiments on five standard ZSL datasets (CUB, aPY, AWA1, AWA2, and SUN) in the generalized zero-shot learning and continual (fixed/dynamic) zero-shot learning settings.

    "title": "A New Learning Paradigm for Foundation Model-based Remote Sensing Change Detection",
    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Change detection (CD) is a critical task to observe and analyze dynamic processes of land cover. Although numerous deep learning-based CD models have performed excellently, their further performance improvements are constrained by the limited knowledge extracted from the given labelled data. On the other hand, the foundation models that emerged recently contain a huge amount of knowledge by scaling up across data modalities and proxy tasks. In this paper, we propose a Bi-Temporal Adapter Network (BAN), which is a universal foundation model-based CD adaptation framework aiming to extract the knowledge of foundation models for CD. The proposed BAN contains three parts, i.e. frozen foundation model (e.g., CLIP), bitemporal adapter branch (Bi-TAB), and bridging modules between them. Specifically, the Bi-TAB can be either an existing arbitrary CD model or some hand-crafted stacked blocks. The bridging modules are designed to align the general features with the task/domain-specific features and inject the selected general knowledge into the Bi-TAB. To our knowledge, this is the first universal framework to adapt the foundation model to the CD task. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our BAN in improving the performance of existing CD methods (e.g., up to 4.08\\% IoU improvement) with only a few additional learnable parameters. More importantly, these successful practices show us the potential of foundation models for remote sensing CD.

To bridge this gap, we introduce a large-scale benchmark with diversity and granularity of classes, Statistical Metric Learning Benchmark (SMLB) built upon ImageNet-21K and WordNet. SMLB is designed to rigorously evaluate the discriminative discernment and generalizability across more than 14M images, 20K classes, and 16K taxonomic nodes. Alongside, we propose novel evaluation metrics -- `overlap' for separability and `aSTD' for consistency -- to measure distance statistical information, which are efficient and robust to the change of class number. Our benchmark offers a novel perspective of evaluating the quality of representations beyond accuracy.

    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "To achieve strong real world performance, neural networks must be trained on large, diverse datasets; however, obtaining and annotating such datasets is costly and time-consuming, particularly for 3D point clouds. In this paper, we describe Paved2Paradise, a simple, cost-effective approach for generating fully labeled, diverse, and realistic lidar datasets from scratch, all while requiring minimal human annotation. Our key insight is that, by deliberately collecting separate \"background\" and \"object\" datasets (i.e., \"factoring the real world\"), we can intelligently combine them to produce a combinatorially large and diverse training set. The Paved2Paradise pipeline thus consists of four steps: (1) collecting copious background data, (2) recording individuals from the desired object class(es) performing different behaviors in an isolated environment (like a parking lot), (3) bootstrapping labels for the object dataset, and (4) generating samples by placing objects at arbitrary locations in backgrounds. To demonstrate the utility of Paved2Paradise, we generated synthetic datasets for two tasks: (1) human detection in orchards (a task for which no public data exists) and (2) pedestrian detection in urban environments. Qualitatively, we find that a model trained exclusively on Paved2Paradise synthetic data is highly effective at detecting humans in orchards, including when individuals are heavily occluded by tree branches. Quantitatively, a model trained on Paved2Paradise data that sources backgrounds from KITTI performs comparably to a model trained on the actual dataset. These results suggest the Paved2Paradise synthetic data pipeline can help accelerate point cloud model development in sectors where acquiring lidar datasets has previously been cost-prohibitive",

Geometric pseudo-labels from the teacher support the student network without the need for annotated real data. Dense appearance and geometric information of objects are obtained through a differentiable renderer with the predicted pose for self-supervised direct coupling. The student network additionally features our proposed invertible formulation of the physical shape priors that enables end-to-end self-supervised training through physical constraints of derived polarization characteristics compared against polarimetric input images. We specifically focus on photometrically challenging objects with texture-less or reflective surfaces and transparent materials for which the most prominent performance gain is reported",

    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Explicit pose prior models compress human poses into latent representations for using in pose-related downstream tasks. A desirable explicit pose prior model should satisfy three desirable abilities: 1) correctness, i.e. ensuring to generate physically possible poses; 2) expressiveness, i.e. ensuring to preserve details in generation; 3) controllability, meaning that generation from reference poses and explicit instructions should be convenient. Existing explicit pose prior models fail to achieve all of three properties, in special controllability. To break this situation, we propose QPoser, a highly controllable explicit pose prior model which guarantees correctness and expressiveness. In QPoser, a multi-head vector quantized autoencoder (MS-VQVAE) is proposed for obtaining expressive and distributed pose representations. Furthermore, a global-local feature integration mechanism (GLIF-AE) is utilized to disentangle the latent representation and integrate full-body information into local-joint features. Experimental results show that QPoser significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in representing expressive and correct poses, meanwhile is easily to be used for detailed conditional generation from reference poses and prompting instructions",

    "title": "Rethinking Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image Classification: A Bag-Level Classifier is a Good Instance-Level Teacher",
    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has demonstrated promise in Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification. However, a major challenge persists due to the high computational cost associated with processing these gigapixel images. Existing methods generally adopt a two-stage approach, comprising a non-learnable feature embedding stage and a classifier training stage. Though it can greatly reduce the memory consumption by using a fixed feature embedder pre-trained on other domains, such scheme also results in a disparity between the two stages, leading to suboptimal classification accuracy. To address this issue, we propose that a bag-level classifier can be a good instance-level teacher. Based on this idea, we design Iteratively Coupled Multiple Instance Learning (ICMIL) to couple the embedder and the bag classifier at a low cost. ICMIL initially fix the patch embedder to train the bag classifier, followed by fixing the bag classifier to fine-tune the patch embedder. The refined embedder can then generate better representations in return, leading to a more accurate classifier for the next iteration. To realize more flexible and more effective embedder fine-tuning, we also introduce a teacher-student framework to efficiently distill the category knowledge in the bag classifier to help the instance-level embedder fine-tuning. Thorough experiments were conducted on four distinct datasets to validate the effectiveness of ICMIL. The experimental results consistently demonstrate that our method significantly improves the performance of existing MIL backbones, achieving state-of-the-art results.

    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Task planning for embodied AI has been one of the most challenging problems where the community does not meet a consensus in terms of formulation. In this paper, we aim to tackle this problem with a unified framework consisting of an end-to-end trainable method and a planning algorithm. Particularly, we propose a task-agnostic method named 'planning as in-painting'. In this method, we use a Denoising Diffusion Model (DDM) for plan generation, conditioned on both language instructions and perceptual inputs under partially observable environments. Partial observation often leads to the model hallucinating the planning. Therefore, our diffusion-based method jointly models both state trajectory and goal estimation to improve the reliability of the generated plan, given the limited available information at each step. To better leverage newly discovered information along the plan execution for a higher success rate, we propose an on-the-fly planning algorithm to collaborate with the diffusion-based planner. The proposed framework achieves promising performances in various embodied AI tasks, including vision-language navigation, object manipulation, and task planning in a photorealistic virtual environment.

Instead of directly optimizing extrinsics, we leverage the consistency learning between LiDAR and camera to implement implicit re-calibartion. Specially, we introduce an appearance-consistency loss and a geometric-consistency loss to minimizing the inconsitency between the attrbutes (e.g., intensity and depth) of projected LiDAR points and the predicted ones. This design not only enhances adaptability to various scenarios but also enables a simple and efficient formulation during inference.

    "abstract": "Recently, few-shot action recognition has significantly progressed by learning the feature discriminability and designing suitable comparison methods. Still, there are the following restrictions. (a) Previous works are mainly based on visual mono-modal. Although some multi-modal works use labels as supplementary to construct prototypes of support videos, they can not use this information for query videos. The labels are not used efficiently. (b) Most of the works ignore the motion feature of video, although the motion features are essential for distinguishing. We proposed a Consistency Prototype and Motion Compensation Network(CLIP-CP$M^2$C) to address these issues. Firstly, we use the CLIP for multi-modal few-shot action recognition with the text-image comparison for domain adaption. Secondly, in order to make the amount of information between the prototype and the query more similar, we propose a novel method to compensate for the text(prompt) information of query videos when text(prompt) does not exist, which depends on a Consistency Loss. Thirdly, we use the differential features of the adjacent frames in two directions as the motion features, which explicitly embeds the network with motion dynamics. We also apply the Consistency Loss to the motion features. Extensive experiments on standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can compete with state-of-the-art results.

While recent volumetric head models, such as NPHMs, can now excel in representing high-fidelity head geometries, tracking and reconstruction heads from real-world single-view depth sequences remains very challenging, as the fitting to partial and noisy observations is underconstrained. To tackle these challenges, we propose a latent diffusion-based prior to regularize volumetric head reconstruction and tracking. This prior-based regularizer effectively constrains the identity and expression codes to lie on the underlying latent manifold which represents plausible head shapes. To evaluate the effectiveness of the diffusion-based prior, we collect a dataset of monocular Kinect sequences consisting of various complex facial expression motions and rapid transitions. We compare our method to state-of-the-art tracking methods, and demonstrate improved head identity reconstruction as well as robust expression tracking",

    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Coded Aperture Snapshot Spectral Imaging (CASSI) reconstruction aims to recover the 3D spatial-spectral signal from 2D measurement. Existing methods for reconstructing Hyperspectral Image (HSI) typically involve learning mappings from a 2D compressed image to a predetermined set of discrete spectral bands. However, this approach overlooks the inherent continuity of the spectral information. In this study, we propose an innovative method called Spectral-wise Implicit Neural Representation (SINR) as a pioneering step toward addressing this limitation. SINR introduces a continuous spectral amplification process for HSI reconstruction, enabling spectral super-resolution with customizable magnification factors. To achieve this, we leverage the concept of implicit neural representation. Specifically, our approach introduces a spectral-wise attention mechanism that treats individual channels as distinct tokens, thereby capturing global spectral dependencies. Additionally, our approach incorporates two components, namely a Fourier coordinate encoder and a spectral scale factor module. The Fourier coordinate encoder enhances the SINR's ability to emphasize high-frequency components, while the spectral scale factor module guides the SINR to adapt to the variable number of spectral channels. Notably, the SINR framework enhances the flexibility of CASSI reconstruction by accommodating an unlimited number of spectral bands in the desired output. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our SINR outperforms baseline methods. By enabling continuous reconstruction within the CASSI framework, we take the initial stride toward integrating implicit neural representation into the field",

    "abstract": "Hyperspectral salient object detection (HSOD) aims to detect spectrally salient objects in hyperspectral images (HSIs). However, existing methods inadequately utilize spectral information by either converting HSIs into false-color images or converging neural networks with clustering. We propose a novel approach that fully leverages the spectral characteristics by extracting two distinct frequency components from the spectrum: low-frequency Spectral Saliency and high-frequency Spectral Edge. The Spectral Saliency approximates the region of salient objects, while the Spectral Edge captures edge information of salient objects. These two complementary components, crucial for HSOD, are derived by computing from the inter-layer spectral angular distance of the Gaussian pyramid and the intra-neighborhood spectral angular gradients, respectively. To effectively utilize this dual-frequency information, we introduce a novel lightweight Spectrum-driven Mixed-frequency Network (SMN). SMN incorporates two parameter-free plug-and-play operators, namely Spectral Saliency Generator and Spectral Edge Operator, to extract the Spectral Saliency and Spectral Edge components from the input HSI independently. Subsequently, the Mixed-frequency Attention module, comprised of two frequency-dependent heads, intelligently combines the embedded features of edge and saliency information, resulting in a mixed-frequency feature representation. Furthermore, a saliency-edge-aware decoder progressively scales up the mixed-frequency feature while preserving rich detail and saliency information for accurate salient object prediction. Extensive experiments conducted on the HS-SOD benchmark and our custom dataset HSOD-BIT demonstrate that our SMN outperforms state-of-the-art methods regarding HSOD performance.

    "abstract": "Enhancing a low-light noisy RAW image into a well-exposed and clean sRGB image is a significant challenge in computational photography. Due to the limitation of large-scale paired data, prior approaches have difficulty in recovering fine details and true colors in extremely low-light regions. Meanwhile, recent advancements in generative diffusion models have shown promising generating capabilities, which inspires this work to explore generative priors from a diffusion model trained on a large-scale open-domain dataset to benefit the low-light image enhancement (LLIE) task. Based on this intention, we propose a novel diffusion-model-based LLIE method, dubbed LDM-SID. LDM-SID aims at inserting a set of proposed taming modules into a frozen pre-trained diffusion model to steer its generating process. Specifically, the taming module fed with low-light information serves to output a pair of affine transformation parameters to modulate the intermediate feature in the diffusion model. Additionally, based on the observation of dedicated generative priors across different portions of the diffusion model, we propose to apply 2D discrete wavelet transforms on the input RAW image, resulting in dividing the LLIE task into two essential parts: low-frequency content generation and high-frequency detail maintenance. This enables us to skillfully tame the diffusion model for optimized structural generation and detail enhancement. Extensive experiments demonstrate the proposed method not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in quantitative evaluations but also shows significant superiority in visual comparisons. These findings highlight the effectiveness of leveraging a pre-trained diffusion model as a generative prior to the LLIE task",

    "abstract": "Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as powerful backbones in computer vision, outperforming many traditional CNNs. However, their computational overhead, largely attributed to the self-attention mechanism, makes deployment on resource-constrained edge devices challenging. Multiple solutions rely on token pruning or token merging. In this paper, we introduce \"Token Fusion\" (ToFu), a method that amalgamates the benefits of both token pruning and token merging. Token pruning proves advantageous when the model exhibits sensitivity to input interpolations, while token merging is effective when the model manifests close to linear responses to inputs. We combine this to propose a new scheme called Token Fusion. Moreover, we tackle the limitations of average merging, which doesn't preserve the intrinsic feature norm, resulting in distributional shifts. To mitigate this, we introduce MLERP merging, a variant of the SLERP technique, tailored to merge multiple tokens while maintaining the norm distribution. ToFu is versatile, applicable to ViTs with or without additional training. Our empirical evaluations indicate that ToFu establishes new benchmarks in both classification and image generation tasks concerning computational efficiency and model accuracy",

This early fusion of audio and visual cues, demonstrated through cognitive psychology and neuroscience research, offers promising potential for developing multimodal perception models. However, training early fusion architectures poses significant challenges, as the increased model expressivity requires robust learning frameworks to harness their enhanced capabilities. In this paper, we address this challenge by leveraging the masked reconstruction framework, previously successful in unimodal settings, to train audio-visual encoders with early fusion. Additionally, we propose an attention-based fusion module that captures interactions between local audio and visual representations, enhancing the model's ability to capture fine-grained interactions. While effective, this procedure can become computationally intractable, as the number of local representations increases. Thus, to address the computational complexity, we propose an alternative procedure that factorizes the local representations before representing audio-visual interactions. Extensive evaluations on a variety of datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach in audio-event classification, visual sound localization, sound separation, and audio-visual segmentation. These contributions enable the efficient training of deeply integrated audio-visual models and significantly advance the usefulness of early fusion architectures",

We observe that due to the under-constrained nature of the task, solely using additional regularization is not enough to prevent the model from overfitting to sparse viewpoints. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, dubbed Self-Evolving Neural Radiance Fields (SE-NeRF), that applies a self-training framework to NeRF to address these problems. We formulate few-shot NeRF into a teacher-student framework to guide the network to learn a more robust representation of the scene by training the student with additional pseudo labels generated from the teacher. By distilling ray-level pseudo labels using distinct distillation schemes for reliable and unreliable rays obtained with our novel reliability estimation method, we enable NeRF to learn a more accurate and robust geometry of the 3D scene.

    "abstract": "Remote sensing technology has become a promising tool in yield prediction. Most prior work employs satellite imagery for county-level corn yield prediction by spatially aggregating all pixels within a county into a single value, potentially overlooking the detailed information and valuable insights offered by more granular data. To this end, this research examines each county at the pixel level and applies multiple instance learning to leverage detailed information within a county. In addition, our method addresses the \"mixed pixel\" issue caused by the inconsistent resolution between feature datasets and crop mask, which may introduce noise into the model and therefore hinder accurate yield prediction. Specifically, the attention mechanism is employed to automatically assign weights to different pixels, which can mitigate the influence of mixed pixels. The experimental results show that the developed model outperforms four other machine learning models over the past five years in the U.S. corn belt and demonstrates its best performance in 2022, achieving a coefficient of determination (R2) value of 0.84 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.83.

Thus, this paper explores the impact of generative attacks on DASV and proposes practical and interpretable countermeasures. We investigate the power of two prominent Deep Generative Models (DGMs), Variational Auto-encoders (VAE) and Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGAN), on their ability to generate signatures that would successfully deceive DASV. Additionally, we evaluate the quality of generated images using the Structural Similarity Index measure (SSIM) and use the same to explain the attack's success. Finally, we propose countermeasures that effectively reduce the impact of deep generative attacks on DASV. We first generated six synthetic datasets from three benchmark offline-signature datasets viz. CEDAR, BHSig260- Bengali, and BHSig260-Hindi using VAE and CGAN. Then, we built baseline DASVs using Xception, ResNet152V2, and DenseNet201. These DASVs achieved average (over the three datasets) False Accept Rates (FARs) of 2.55%, 3.17%, and 1.06%, respectively. Then, we attacked these baselines using the synthetic datasets. The VAE-generated signatures increased average FARs to 10.4%, 10.1%, and 7.5%, while CGAN-generated signatures to 32.5%, 30%, and 26.1%. The variation in the effectiveness of attack for VAE and CGAN was investigated further and explained by a strong (rho = -0.86) negative correlation between FARs and SSIMs. We created another set of synthetic datasets and used the same to retrain the DASVs. The retained baseline showed significant robustness to random, skilled, and generative attacks as the FARs shrank to less than 1% on average. The findings underscore the importance of studying generative attacks and potential countermeasures for DASV",

The core intuition here is that the large model provides a foundational backbone, while different lightweight experts residually learn specialized knowledge, either per-modality or multimodally.

    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Object 6D pose estimation methods can achieve high accuracy when trained and tested on the same objects. However, estimating the pose of objects that are absent at training time is still a challenge. In this work, we advance the state-of-the-art in zero-shot object 6D pose estimation by proposing the first method that fuses the contribution of pre-trained geometric and vision foundation models. Unlike state-of-the-art approaches that train their pipeline on data specifically crafted for the 6D pose estimation task, our method does not require task-specific finetuning. Instead, our method, which we name PoMZ, combines geometric descriptors learned from point cloud data with visual features learned from large-scale web images to produce distinctive 3D point-level descriptors. By applying an off-the-shelf registration algorithm, like RANSAC, PoMZ outperforms all state-of-the-art zero-shot object 6D pose estimation approaches. We extensively evaluate PoMZ across the seven core datasets of the BOP Benchmark, encompassing over a hundred objects and 20 thousand images captured in diverse scenarios. PoMZ ranks first in the BOP Benchmark under the category Task 4: 6D localization of unseen objects. We will release the source code publicly",

    "abstract": "While perspective is a well-studied topic in art, it is generally taken for granted in images. However, for the recent wave of high-quality image synthesis methods such as latent diffusion models, perspective accuracy is not an explicit requirement. Since these methods are capable of outputting a wide gamut of possible images, it is difficult for these synthesized images to adhere to the principles of linear perspective. We introduce a novel geometric constraint in the training process of generative models to enforce perspective accuracy. We show that outputs of models trained with this constraint both appear more realistic and improve performance of downstream models trained on generated images. Subjective human trials show that images generated with latent diffusion models trained with our constraint are preferred over images from the Stable Diffusion V2 model 70% of the time. SOTA monocular depth estimation models such as DPT and PixelFormer, fine-tuned on our images, outperform the original models trained on real images by up to 7.03% in RMSE and 19.3% in SqRel on the KITTI test set for zero-shot transfer",

    "abstract": "Online continual learning, the process of training models on streaming data, has gained increasing attention in recent years. However, a critical aspect often overlooked is the label delay, where new data may not be labeled due to slow and costly annotation processes. We introduce a new continual learning framework with explicit modeling of the label delay between data and label streams over time steps. In each step, the framework reveals both unlabeled data from the current time step $t$ and labels delayed with $d$ steps, from the time step $t-d$. In our extensive experiments amounting to 1060 GPU days, we show that merely augmenting the computational resources is insufficient to tackle this challenge. Our findings underline a notable performance decline when solely relying on labeled data when the label delay becomes significant. More surprisingly, when using state-of-the-art SSL and TTA techniques to utilize the newer, unlabeled data, they fail to surpass the performance of a na\\\"ive method that simply trains on the delayed supervised stream. To this end, we introduce a simple, efficient baseline that rehearses from the labeled memory samples that are most similar to the new unlabeled samples. This method bridges the accuracy gap caused by label delay without significantly increasing computational complexity. We show experimentally that our method is the least affected by the label delay factor and in some cases successfully recovers the accuracy of the non-delayed counterpart.

    "abstract": "Vision-language foundation models have shown remarkable performance in various zero-shot settings such as image retrieval, classification, or captioning. But so far, those models seem to fall behind when it comes to zero-shot localization of referential expressions and objects in images. As a result, they need to be fine-tuned for this task. In this paper, we show that pretrained vision-language (VL) models allow for zero-shot open-vocabulary object localization without any fine-tuning. To leverage those capabilities, we propose a Grounding Everything Module (GEM) that generalizes the idea of value-value attention introduced by CLIPSurgery to a self-self attention path. We show that the concept of self-self attention corresponds to clustering, thus enforcing groups of tokens arising from the same object to be similar while preserving the alignment with the language space. To further guide the group formation, we propose a set of regularizations that allows the model to finally generalize across datasets and backbones. We evaluate the proposed GEM framework on various benchmark tasks and datasets for semantic segmentation. It shows that GEM not only outperforms other training-free open-vocabulary localization methods, but also achieves state-of-the-art results on the recently proposed OpenImagesV7 large-scale segmentation benchmark",

It is especially important in content creation to be able to modify generated motion or to specify keyframes. To enable stochasticity as well as motion editing, we propose a lightweight audio-conditioned diffusion model for 3D facial motion. This diffusion model can be trained on a small 3D motion dataset, maintaining expressive lip motion output. In addition, it can be finetuned for specific subjects, requiring only a short video of the person.

    "abstract": "We propose a method to efficiently equip the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with the ability to generate regional captions. SAM presents strong generalizability to segment anything while is short for semantic understanding. By introducing a lightweight query-based feature mixer, we align the region-specific features with the embedding space of language models for later caption generation. As the number of trainable parameters is small (typically in the order of tens of millions), it costs less computation, less memory usage, and less communication bandwidth, resulting in both fast and scalable training. To address the scarcity problem of regional caption data, we propose to first pre-train our model on objection detection and segmentation tasks. We call this step weak supervision pretraining since the pre-training data only contains category names instead of full-sentence descriptions. The weak supervision pretraining allows us to leverage many publicly available object detection and segmentation datasets. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority of our method and validate each design choice. This work serves as a stepping stone towards scaling up regional captioning data and sheds light on exploring efficient ways to augment SAM with regional semantics.

    "abstract": "Recent approaches to point tracking are able to recover the trajectory of any scene point through a large portion of a video despite the presence of occlusions. They are, however, too slow in practice to track every point observed in a single frame in a reasonable amount of time. This paper introduces DOT, a novel, simple and efficient method for solving this problem. It first extracts a small set of tracks from key regions at motion boundaries using an off-the-shelf point tracking algorithm. Given source and target frames, DOT then computes rough initial estimates of a dense flow field and visibility mask through nearest-neighbor interpolation, before refining them using a learnable optical flow estimator that explicitly handles occlusions and can be trained on synthetic data with ground-truth correspondences. We show that DOT is significantly more accurate than current optical flow techniques, outperforms sophisticated \"universal\" trackers like OmniMotion, and is on par with, or better than, the best point tracking algorithms like CoTracker while being at least two orders of magnitude faster. Quantitative and qualitative experiments with synthetic and real videos validate the promise of the proposed approach.

However, merely using text prompts is not enough to depict the desired subject appearance that accurately aligns with users' intents, especially for customized content creation. In this paper, we study the task of video generation with image prompts, which provide more accurate and direct content control beyond the text prompts. Specifically, we propose a feed-forward framework VideoBooth, with two dedicated designs: 1) We propose to embed image prompts in a coarse-to-fine manner. Coarse visual embeddings from image encoder provide high-level encodings of image prompts, while fine visual embeddings from the proposed attention injection module provide multi-scale and detailed encoding of image prompts. These two complementary embeddings can faithfully capture the desired appearance. 2) In the attention injection module at fine level, multi-scale image prompts are fed into different cross-frame attention layers as additional keys and values. This extra spatial information refines the details in the first frame and then it is propagated to the remaining frames, which maintains temporal consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VideoBooth achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating customized high-quality videos with subjects specified in image prompts.

    "abstract": "We pursue the goal of developing robots that can interact zero-shot with generic unseen objects via a diverse repertoire of manipulation skills and show how passive human videos can serve as a rich source of data for learning such generalist robots. Unlike typical robot learning approaches which directly learn how a robot should act from interaction data, we adopt a factorized approach that can leverage large-scale human videos to learn how a human would accomplish a desired task (a human plan), followed by translating this plan to the robots embodiment. Specifically, we learn a human plan predictor that, given a current image of a scene and a goal image, predicts the future hand and object configurations. We combine this with a translation module that learns a plan-conditioned robot manipulation policy, and allows following humans plans for generic manipulation tasks in a zero-shot manner with no deployment-time training. Importantly, while the plan predictor can leverage large-scale human videos for learning, the translation module only requires a small amount of in-domain data, and can generalize to tasks not seen during training. We show that our learned system can perform over 16 manipulation skills that generalize to 40 objects, encompassing 100 real-world tasks for table-top manipulation and diverse in-the-wild manipulation. https://homangab.github.io/hopman/",

Existing approaches either retrain models from scratch or use several finetuning steps for every deletion request, often constrained by computational resource limitations and restricted access to the original training data. In this work, we introduce a novel class unlearning algorithm designed to strategically eliminate an entire class or a group of classes from the learned model. To that end, our algorithm first estimates the Retain Space and the Forget Space, representing the feature or activation spaces for samples from classes to be retained and unlearned, respectively. To obtain these spaces, we propose a novel singular value decomposition-based technique that requires layer wise collection of network activations from a few forward passes through the network. We then compute the shared information between these spaces and remove it from the forget space to isolate class-discriminatory feature space for unlearning. Finally, we project the model weights in the orthogonal direction of the class-discriminatory space to obtain the unlearned model. We demonstrate our algorithm's efficacy on ImageNet using a Vision Transformer with only $\\sim$1.5% drop in retain accuracy compared to the original model while maintaining under 1% accuracy on the unlearned class samples. Further, our algorithm consistently performs well when subject to Membership Inference Attacks showing 7.8% improvement on average across a variety of image classification datasets and network architectures, as compared to other baselines while being $\\sim$6x more computationally efficient",

To explain and analyze these issues, we revisit the derivation of Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) and decipher existing score distillation with the Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) paradigm. With the WGAN paradigm, we find that existing score distillation either employs a fixed sub-optimal discriminator or conducts incomplete discriminator optimization, resulting in the scale-sensitive issue. We propose the Adversarial Score Distillation (ASD), which maintains an optimizable discriminator and updates it using the complete optimization objective. Experiments show that the proposed ASD performs favorably in 2D distillation and text-to-3D tasks against existing methods.

Evaluation on existing benchmarks demonstrates that SAGA can achieve competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, SAGA achieves multi-granularity segmentation and accommodates various prompts, including points, scribbles, and 2D masks. Notably, SAGA can finish the 3D segmentation within milliseconds, achieving nearly 1000x acceleration compared to previous SOTA. The project page is at https://jumpat.github.io/SAGA",

    "title": "Gaussian Grouping: Segment and Edit Anything in 3D Scenes",
    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "The recent Gaussian Splatting achieves high-quality and real-time novel-view synthesis of the 3D scenes. However, it is solely concentrated on the appearance and geometry modeling, while lacking in fine-grained object-level scene understanding. To address this issue, we propose Gaussian Grouping, which extends Gaussian Splatting to jointly reconstruct and segment anything in open-world 3D scenes. We augment each Gaussian with a compact Identity Encoding, allowing the Gaussians to be grouped according to their object instance or stuff membership in the 3D scene. Instead of resorting to expensive 3D labels, we supervise the Identity Encodings during the differentiable rendering by leveraging the 2D mask predictions by SAM, along with introduced 3D spatial consistency regularization. Comparing to the implicit NeRF representation, we show that the discrete and grouped 3D Gaussians can reconstruct, segment and edit anything in 3D with high visual quality, fine granularity and efficiency. Based on Gaussian Grouping, we further propose a local Gaussian Editing scheme, which shows efficacy in versatile scene editing applications, including 3D object removal, inpainting, colorization and scene recomposition.

    "title": "DeepCache: Accelerating Diffusion Models for Free",
    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Diffusion models have recently gained unprecedented attention in the field of image synthesis due to their remarkable generative capabilities. Notwithstanding their prowess, these models often incur substantial computational costs, primarily attributed to the sequential denoising process and cumbersome model size. Traditional methods for compressing diffusion models typically involve extensive retraining, presenting cost and feasibility challenges. In this paper, we introduce DeepCache, a novel training-free paradigm that accelerates diffusion models from the perspective of model architecture. DeepCache capitalizes on the inherent temporal redundancy observed in the sequential denoising steps of diffusion models, which caches and retrieves features across adjacent denoising stages, thereby curtailing redundant computations. Utilizing the property of the U-Net, we reuse the high-level features while updating the low-level features in a very cheap way. This innovative strategy, in turn, enables a speedup factor of 2.3$\\times$ for Stable Diffusion v1.5 with only a 0.05 decline in CLIP Score, and 4.1$\\times$ for LDM-4-G with a slight decrease of 0.22 in FID on ImageNet. Our experiments also demonstrate DeepCache's superiority over existing pruning and distillation methods that necessitate retraining and its compatibility with current sampling techniques. Furthermore, we find that under the same throughput, DeepCache effectively achieves comparable or even marginally improved results with DDIM or PLMS.

    "title": "PointBeV: A Sparse Approach to BeV Predictions",
    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Bird's-eye View (BeV) representations have emerged as the de-facto shared space in driving applications, offering a unified space for sensor data fusion and supporting various downstream tasks. However, conventional models use grids with fixed resolution and range and face computational inefficiencies due to the uniform allocation of resources across all cells. To address this, we propose PointBeV, a novel sparse BeV segmentation model operating on sparse BeV cells instead of dense grids. This approach offers precise control over memory usage, enabling the use of long temporal contexts and accommodating memory-constrained platforms. PointBeV employs an efficient two-pass strategy for training, enabling focused computation on regions of interest. At inference time, it can be used with various memory/performance trade-offs and flexibly adjusts to new specific use cases. PointBeV achieves state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes dataset for vehicle, pedestrian, and lane segmentation, showcasing superior performance in static and temporal settings despite being trained solely with sparse signals. We will release our code along with two new efficient modules used in the architecture: Sparse Feature Pulling, designed for the effective extraction of features from images to BeV, and Submanifold Attention, which enables efficient temporal modeling.

    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "We present GIFT (Generative Interpretable Fine-tuning Transformers) for fine-tuning pretrained (often large) Transformer models at downstream tasks in a parameter-efficient way with built-in interpretability. Our GIFT is a deep parameter-residual learning method, which addresses two problems in fine-tuning a pretrained Transformer model: Where to apply the parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to be extremely lightweight yet sufficiently expressive, and How to learn the PEFT to better exploit the knowledge of the pretrained model in a direct way? For the former, we select the final projection (linear) layer in the multi-head self-attention of a Transformer model, and verify its effectiveness. For the latter, in contrast to the prior art that directly introduce new model parameters (often in low-rank approximation form) to be learned in fine-tuning with downstream data, we propose a method for learning to generate the fine-tuning parameters. Our GIFT is a hyper-Transformer which take as input the pretrained parameters of the projection layer to generate its fine-tuning parameters using a proposed Parameter-to-Cluster Attention (PaCa). The PaCa results in a simple clustering-based forward explainer that plays the role of semantic segmentation in testing. In experiments, our proposed GIFT is tested on the VTAB benchmark and the fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) benchmark. It obtains significantly better performance than the prior art.

    "title": "Rethinking Detection Based Table Structure Recognition for Visually Rich Documents",
    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Table Structure Recognition (TSR) aims at transforming unstructured table images into structured formats, such as HTML sequences. One type of popular solution is using detection models to detect components of a table, such as columns and rows, then applying a rule-based post-processing method to convert detection results into HTML sequences. However, existing detection-based studies often have the following limitations. First, these studies usually pay more attention to improving the detection performance, which does not necessarily lead to better performance regarding cell-level metrics, such as TEDS. Second, some solutions over-simplify the problem and can miss some critical information. Lastly, even though some studies defined the problem to detect more components to provide as much information as other types of solutions, these studies ignore the fact this problem definition is a multi-label detection because row, projected row header and column header can share identical bounding boxes. Besides, there is often a performance gap between two-stage and transformer-based detection models regarding the structure-only TEDS, even though they have similar performance regarding the COCO metrics. Therefore, we revisit the limitations of existing detection-based solutions, compare two-stage and transformer-based detection models, and identify the key design aspects for the success of a two-stage detection model for the TSR task, including the multi-class problem definition, the aspect ratio for anchor box generation, and the feature generation of the backbone network. We applied simple methods to improve these aspects of the Cascade R-CNN model, achieved state-of-the-art performance, and improved the baseline Cascade R-CNN model by 19.32%, 11.56% and 14.77% regarding the structure-only TEDS on SciTSR, FinTabNet, and PubTables1M datasets",

    "abstract": "To train well-performing generalizing neural networks, sufficiently large and diverse datasets are needed. Collecting data while adhering to privacy legislation becomes increasingly difficult and annotating these large datasets is both a resource-heavy and time-consuming task. An approach to overcome these difficulties is to use synthetic data since it is inherently scalable and can be automatically annotated. However, how training on synthetic data affects the layers of a neural network is still unclear. In this paper, we train the YOLOv3 object detector on real and synthetic images from city environments. We perform a similarity analysis using Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) to explore the effects of training on synthetic data on a layer-wise basis. The analysis captures the architecture of the detector while showing both different and similar patterns between different models. With this similarity analysis we want to give insights on how training synthetic data affects each layer and to give a better understanding of the inner workings of complex neural networks. The results show that the largest similarity between a detector trained on real data and a detector trained on synthetic data was in the early layers, and the largest difference was in the head part. The results also show that no major difference in performance or similarity could be seen between frozen and unfrozen backbone",

    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "We introduce the new setting of open-vocabulary object 6D pose estimation, in which a textual prompt is used to specify the object of interest. In contrast to existing approaches, in our setting (i) the object of interest is specified solely through the textual prompt, (ii) no object model (e.g. CAD or video sequence) is required at inference, (iii) the object is imaged from two different viewpoints of two different scenes, and (iv) the object was not observed during the training phase. To operate in this setting, we introduce a novel approach that leverages a Vision-Language Model to segment the object of interest from two distinct scenes and to estimate its relative 6D pose. The key of our approach is a carefully devised strategy to fuse object-level information provided by the prompt with local image features, resulting in a feature space that can generalize to novel concepts. We validate our approach on a new benchmark based on two popular datasets, REAL275 and Toyota-Light, which collectively encompass 39 object instances appearing in four thousand image pairs. The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms both a well-established hand-crafted method and a recent deep learning-based baseline in estimating the relative 6D pose of objects in different scenes.

    "title": "Unsupervised Adaptive Implicit Neural Representation Learning for Scan-Specific MRI Reconstruction",
    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "In recent studies on MRI reconstruction, advances have shown significant promise for further accelerating the MRI acquisition. Most state-of-the-art methods require a large amount of fully-sampled data to optimise reconstruction models, which is impractical and expensive under certain clinical settings. On the other hand, for unsupervised scan-specific reconstruction methods, overfitting is likely to happen due to insufficient supervision, while restrictions on acceleration rates and under-sampling patterns further limit their applicability. To this end, we propose an unsupervised, adaptive coarse-to-fine framework that enhances reconstruction quality without being constrained by the sparsity levels or patterns in under-sampling. The framework employs an implicit neural representation for scan-specific MRI reconstruction, learning a mapping from multi-dimensional coordinates to their corresponding signal intensities. Moreover, we integrate a novel learning strategy that progressively refines the use of acquired k-space signals for self-supervision. This approach effectively adjusts the proportion of supervising signals from unevenly distributed information across different frequency bands, thus mitigating the issue of overfitting while improving the overall reconstruction. Comprehensive evaluation on a public dataset, including both 2D and 3D data, has shown that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art scan-specific MRI reconstruction techniques, for up to 8-fold under-sampling",

    "abstract": "Vision-language pre-training like CLIP has shown promising performance on various downstream tasks such as zero-shot image classification and image-text retrieval. Most of the existing CLIP-alike works usually adopt relatively large image encoders like ResNet50 and ViT, while the lightweight counterparts are rarely discussed. In this paper, we propose a multi-level interaction paradigm for training lightweight CLIP models. Firstly, to mitigate the problem that some image-text pairs are not strictly one-to-one correspondence, we improve the conventional global instance-level alignment objective by softening the label of negative samples progressively. Secondly, a relaxed bipartite matching based token-level alignment objective is introduced for finer-grained alignment between image patches and textual words. Moreover, based on the observation that the accuracy of CLIP model does not increase correspondingly as the parameters of text encoder increase, an extra objective of masked language modeling (MLM) is leveraged for maximizing the potential of the shortened text encoder. In practice, an auxiliary fusion module injecting unmasked image embedding into masked text embedding at different network stages is proposed for enhancing the MLM. Extensive experiments show that without introducing additional computational cost during inference, the proposed method achieves a higher performance on multiple downstream tasks",

    "abstract": "Deep neural network models have achieved remarkable progress in 3D scene understanding while trained in the closed-set setting and with full labels. However, the major bottleneck for current 3D recognition approaches is that they do not have the capacity to recognize any unseen novel classes beyond the training categories in diverse kinds of real-world applications. In the meantime, current state-of-the-art 3D scene understanding approaches primarily require high-quality labels to train neural networks, which merely perform well in a fully supervised manner. This work presents a generalized and simple framework for dealing with 3D scene understanding when the labeled scenes are quite limited. To extract knowledge for novel categories from the pre-trained vision-language models, we propose a hierarchical feature-aligned pre-training and knowledge distillation strategy to extract and distill meaningful information from large-scale vision-language models, which helps benefit the open-vocabulary scene understanding tasks. To leverage the boundary information, we propose a novel energy-based loss with boundary awareness benefiting from the region-level boundary predictions. To encourage latent instance discrimination and to guarantee efficiency, we propose the unsupervised region-level semantic contrastive learning scheme for point clouds, using confident predictions of the neural network to discriminate the intermediate feature embeddings at multiple stages.

    "abstract": "Purpose: To develop an efficient dual-domain reconstruction framework for multi-contrast MRI, with the focus on minimising cross-contrast misalignment in both the image and the frequency domains to enhance optimisation. Theory and Methods: Our proposed framework, based on deep learning, facilitates the optimisation for under-sampled target contrast using fully-sampled reference contrast that is quicker to acquire. The method consists of three key steps: 1) Learning to synthesise data resembling the target contrast from the reference contrast; 2) Registering the multi-contrast data to reduce inter-scan motion; and 3) Utilising the registered data for reconstructing the target contrast. These steps involve learning in both domains with regularisation applied to ensure their consistency. We also compare the reconstruction performance with existing deep learning-based methods using a dataset of brain MRI scans. Results: Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework, for up to an 8-fold acceleration rate, compared to state-of-the-art algorithms. Comprehensive analysis and ablation studies further present the effectiveness of the proposed components.

For the first time, we demonstrate that the generated video sequences can be utilized for training multi-object tracking (MOT) systems, leading to significant improvement in tracker performance. Experimental results show that our model significantly enhances instance consistency in generated video sequences, leading to improved perceptual metrics.

    "title": "A Recent Survey of Vision Transformers for Medical Image Segmentation",
    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in various healthcare applications, enabling accurate diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring. In recent years, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as a promising technique for addressing the challenges in medical image segmentation. In medical images, structures are usually highly interconnected and globally distributed. ViTs utilize their multi-scale attention mechanism to model the long-range relationships in the images. However, they do lack image-related inductive bias and translational invariance, potentially impacting their performance. Recently, researchers have come up with various ViT-based approaches that incorporate CNNs in their architectures, known as Hybrid Vision Transformers (HVTs) to capture local correlation in addition to the global information in the images. This survey paper provides a detailed review of the recent advancements in ViTs and HVTs for medical image segmentation. Along with the categorization of ViT and HVT-based medical image segmentation approaches we also present a detailed overview of their real-time applications in several medical image modalities. This survey may serve as a valuable resource for researchers, healthcare practitioners, and students in understanding the state-of-the-art approaches for ViT-based medical image segmentation",

    "title": "Towards Efficient 3D Object Detection in Bird's-Eye-View Space for Autonomous Driving: A Convolutional-Only Approach",
    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "3D object detection in Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) space has recently emerged as a prevalent approach in the field of autonomous driving. Despite the demonstrated improvements in accuracy and velocity estimation compared to perspective view methods, the deployment of BEV-based techniques in real-world autonomous vehicles remains challenging. This is primarily due to their reliance on vision-transformer (ViT) based architectures, which introduce quadratic complexity with respect to the input resolution. To address this issue, we propose an efficient BEV-based 3D detection framework called BEVENet, which leverages a convolutional-only architectural design to circumvent the limitations of ViT models while maintaining the effectiveness of BEV-based methods. Our experiments show that BEVENet is 3$\\times$ faster than contemporary state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches on the NuScenes challenge, achieving a mean average precision (mAP) of 0.456 and a nuScenes detection score (NDS) of 0.555 on the NuScenes validation dataset, with an inference speed of 47.6 frames per second. To the best of our knowledge, this study stands as the first to achieve such significant efficiency improvements for BEV-based methods, highlighting their enhanced feasibility for real-world autonomous driving applications",

    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Heterogeneous face recognition (HFR) involves the intricate task of matching face images across the visual domains of visible (VIS) and near-infrared (NIR). While much of the existing literature on HFR identifies the domain gap as a primary challenge and directs efforts towards bridging it at either the input or feature level, our work deviates from this trend. We observe that large neural networks, unlike their smaller counterparts, when pre-trained on large scale homogeneous VIS data, demonstrate exceptional zero-shot performance in HFR, suggesting that the domain gap might be less pronounced than previously believed. By approaching the HFR problem as one of low-data fine-tuning, we introduce a straightforward framework: comprehensive pre-training, succeeded by a regularized fine-tuning strategy, that matches or surpasses the current state-of-the-art on four publicly available benchmarks.

    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Real-world low-resolution (LR) videos have diverse and complex degradations, imposing great challenges on video super-resolution (VSR) algorithms to reproduce their high-resolution (HR) counterparts with high quality. Recently, the diffusion models have shown compelling performance in generating realistic details for image restoration tasks. However, the diffusion process has randomness, making it hard to control the contents of restored images. This issue becomes more serious when applying diffusion models to VSR tasks because temporal consistency is crucial to the perceptual quality of videos. In this paper, we propose an effective real-world VSR algorithm by leveraging the strength of pre-trained latent diffusion models. To ensure the content consistency among adjacent frames, we exploit the temporal dynamics in LR videos to guide the diffusion process by optimizing the latent sampling path with a motion-guided loss, ensuring that the generated HR video maintains a coherent and continuous visual flow. To further mitigate the discontinuity of generated details, we insert temporal module to the decoder and fine-tune it with an innovative sequence-oriented loss. The proposed motion-guided latent diffusion (MGLD) based VSR algorithm achieves significantly better perceptual quality than state-of-the-arts on real-world VSR benchmark datasets, validating the effectiveness of the proposed model design and training strategies",

    "title": "Beyond First-Order Tweedie: Solving Inverse Problems using Latent Diffusion",
    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Sampling from the posterior distribution poses a major computational challenge in solving inverse problems using latent diffusion models. Common methods rely on Tweedie's first-order moments, which are known to induce a quality-limiting bias. Existing second-order approximations are impractical due to prohibitive computational costs, making standard reverse diffusion processes intractable for posterior sampling. This paper introduces Second-order Tweedie sampler from Surrogate Loss (STSL), a novel sampler that offers efficiency comparable to first-order Tweedie with a tractable reverse process using second-order approximation. Our theoretical results reveal that the second-order approximation is lower bounded by our surrogate loss that only requires $O(1)$ compute using the trace of the Hessian, and by the lower bound we derive a new drift term to make the reverse process tractable. Our method surpasses SoTA solvers PSLD and P2L, achieving 4X and 8X reduction in neural function evaluations, respectively, while notably enhancing sampling quality on FFHQ, ImageNet, and COCO benchmarks. In addition, we show STSL extends to text-guided image editing and addresses residual distortions present from corrupted images in leading text-guided image editing methods. To our best knowledge, this is the first work to offer an efficient second-order approximation in solving inverse problems using latent diffusion and editing real-world images with corruptions",

Our framework allows us to do a first deep dive into the topic and includes a collection of streams and tasks composed from two existing video datasets, plus methodology for performance evaluation that considers both adaptation and generalization. We employ pixel-to-pixel modelling as a practical and flexible way to switch between pre-training and single-stream evaluation as well as between arbitrary tasks, without ever requiring changes to models and always using the same pixel loss. Equipped with this framework we obtained large single-stream learning gains from pre-training with a novel family of future prediction tasks, found that momentum hurts, and that the pace of weight updates matters. The combination of these insights leads to matching the performance of IID learning with batch size 1, when using the same architecture and without costly replay buffers",

The dataset created for this research sheds light on Budgerigars' takeoff, flying, and landing techniques, emphasizing their ability to control speed across different situations and surfaces.

    "abstract": "Normalization techniques have been widely used in the field of deep learning due to their capability of enabling higher learning rates and are less careful in initialization. However, the effectiveness of popular normalization technologies is typically limited to specific areas. Unlike the standard Batch Normalization (BN) and Layer Normalization (LN), where BN computes the mean and variance along the (N,H,W) dimensions and LN computes the mean and variance along the (C,H,W) dimensions (N, C, H and W are the batch, channel, spatial height and width dimension, respectively), this paper presents a novel normalization technique called Batch Channel Normalization (BCN). To exploit both the channel and batch dependence and adaptively and combine the advantages of BN and LN based on specific datasets or tasks, BCN separately normalizes inputs along the (N, H, W) and (C, H, W) axes, then combines the normalized outputs based on adaptive parameters. As a basic block, BCN can be easily integrated into existing models for various applications in the field of computer vision. Empirical results show that the proposed technique can be seamlessly applied to various versions of CNN or Vision Transformer architecture.

Identifying crucial events within these videos is a significant prerequisite in a majority of these applications. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive dataset tailored for relevant event recognition in laparoscopic gynecology videos. Our dataset includes annotations for critical events associated with major intra-operative challenges and post-operative complications. To validate the precision of our annotations, we assess event recognition performance using several CNN-RNN architectures. Furthermore, we introduce and evaluate a hybrid transformer architecture coupled with a customized training-inference framework to recognize four specific events in laparoscopic surgery videos. Leveraging the Transformer networks, our proposed architecture harnesses inter-frame dependencies to counteract the adverse effects of relevant content occlusion, motion blur, and surgical scene variation, thus significantly enhancing event recognition accuracy. Moreover, we present a frame sampling strategy designed to manage variations in surgical scenes and the surgeons' skill level, resulting in event recognition with high temporal resolution. We empirically demonstrate the superiority of our proposed methodology in event recognition compared to conventional CNN-RNN architectures through a series of extensive experiments",

    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) for robot control typically requires a detailed representation of the environment state, including information about task-relevant objects not directly measurable. Keypoint detectors, such as spatial autoencoders (SAEs), are a common approach to extracting a low-dimensional representation from high-dimensional image data. SAEs aim at spatial features such as object positions, which are often useful representations in robotic RL. However, whether an SAE is actually able to track objects in the scene and thus yields a spatial state representation well suited for RL tasks has rarely been examined due to a lack of established metrics. In this paper, we propose to assess the performance of an SAE instance by measuring how well keypoints track ground truth objects in images. We present a computationally lightweight metric and use it to evaluate common baseline SAE architectures on image data from a simulated robot task. We find that common SAEs differ substantially in their spatial extraction capability. Furthermore, we validate that SAEs that perform well in our metric achieve superior performance when used in downstream RL. Thus, our metric is an effective and lightweight indicator of RL performance before executing expensive RL training. Building on these insights, we identify three key modifications of SAE architectures to improve tracking performance. We make our code available at anonymous.4open.science/r/sae-rl",

    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Image Quality Assessment (IQA) with reference images have achieved great success by imitating the human vision system, in which the image quality is effectively assessed by comparing the query image with its pristine reference image. However, for the images in the wild, it is quite difficult to access accurate reference images. We argue that it is possible to learn reference knowledge under the No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) setting, which is effective and efficient empirically. Concretely, by innovatively introducing a novel feature distillation method in IQA, we propose a new framework to learn comparative knowledge from non-aligned reference images. And then, to achieve fast convergence and avoid overfitting, we further propose an inductive bias regularization. Such a framework not only solves the congenital defects of NR-IQA but also improves the feature extraction framework, enabling it to express more abundant quality information. Surprisingly, our method utilizes less input while obtaining a more significant improvement compared to the teacher models. Extensive experiments on eight standard NR-IQA datasets demonstrate the superior performance to the state-of-the-art NR-IQA methods, i.e., achieving the PLCC values of 0.917 (vs. 0.884 in LIVEC) and 0.686 (vs. 0.661 in LIVEFB)",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel application of Generative Adverserial Networks (GANs) to study visual aspects of social processes. I train a a StyleGAN2-model on a custom dataset of 14,564 images of London, sourced from Google Streetview taken in London. After training, I invert the images in the training set, finding points in the model's latent space that correspond to them, and compare results from three inversion techniques. I connect each data point with metadata from the Indices of Multiple Deprivation, describing income, health and environmental quality in the area where the photographs were taken. It is then possible to map which parts of the model's latent space encode visual features that are distinctive for health, income and environmental quality, and condition the synthesis of new images based on these factors. The synthetic images created reflect visual features of social processes that were previously unknown and difficult to study, describing recurring visual differences between deprived and privileged areas in London. GANs are known for their capability to produce a continuous range of images that exhibit visual differences. The paper tests how to exploit this ability through visual comparisons in still images as well as through an interactive website where users can guide image synthesis with sliders. Though conditioned synthesis has its limitations and the results are difficult to validate, the paper points to the potential for generative models to be repurposed to be parts of social scientific methods",

    "abstract": "Pruning-quantization joint learning always facilitates the deployment of deep neural networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained edge devices. However, most existing methods do not jointly learn a global criterion for pruning and quantization in an interpretable way. In this paper, we propose a novel physics inspired criterion for pruning-quantization joint learning (PIC-PQ), which is explored from an analogy we first draw between elasticity dynamics (ED) and model compression (MC). Specifically, derived from Hooke's law in ED, we establish a linear relationship between the filters' importance distribution and the filter property (FP) by a learnable deformation scale in the physics inspired criterion (PIC). Furthermore, we extend PIC with a relative shift variable for a global view. To ensure feasibility and flexibility, available maximum bitwidth and penalty factor are introduced in quantization bitwidth assignment. Experiments on benchmarks of image classification demonstrate that PIC-PQ yields a good trade-off between accuracy and bit-operations (BOPs) compression ratio e.g., 54.96X BOPs compression ratio in ResNet56 on CIFAR10 with 0.10% accuracy drop and 53.24X in ResNet18 on ImageNet with 0.61% accuracy drop).

Annotated data are necessary for developing and validating an AD function. However, the number of public datasets with annotated point cloud curbs is scarce. This paper presents a method for detecting 3D curbs in a sequence of point clouds captured from a LiDAR sensor, which consists of two main steps. First, our approach detects the curbs at each scan using a segmentation deep neural network. Then, a sequence-level processing step estimates the 3D curbs in the reconstructed point cloud using the odometry of the vehicle. From these 3D points of the curb, we obtain polylines structured following ASAM OpenLABEL standard. These detections can be used as pre-annotations in labelling pipelines to efficiently generate curb-related ground truth data. We validate our approach through an experiment in which different human annotators were required to annotate curbs in a group of LiDAR-based sequences with and without our automatically generated pre-annotations. The results show that the manual annotation time is reduced by 50.99% thanks to our detections, keeping the data quality level",

Recent research in the field of diabetic retinopathy diagnosis is using advanced technologies, such as analysis of images obtained by ophthalmoscopy. Automatic methods for analyzing eye images based on neural networks, deep learning and image analysis algorithms can improve the efficiency of diagnosis. This paper describes an automatic DR diagnosis method that includes processing and analysis of ophthalmoscopic images of the eye. It uses morphological algorithms to identify the optic disc and lesions characteristic of DR, such as microaneurysms, hemorrhages and exudates. Automated DR diagnosis has the potential to improve the efficiency of early detection of this disease and contribute to reducing the number of cases of diabetes-related visual impairment. The final step was to create an application with a graphical user interface that allowed retinal images taken at cooperating ophthalmology offices to be uploaded to the server.

    "title": "RLHF-V: Towards Trustworthy MLLMs via Behavior Alignment from Fine-grained Correctional Human Feedback",
    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in multimodal understanding, reasoning, and interaction. However, existing MLLMs prevalently suffer from serious hallucination problems, generating text that is not factually grounded in associated images. The problem makes existing MLLMs untrustworthy and thus impractical in real-world (especially high-stakes) applications. To address the challenge, we present RLHF-V, which enhances MLLM trustworthiness via behavior alignment from fine-grained correctional human feedback. Specifically, RLHF-V collects human preference in the form of segment-level corrections on hallucinations, and performs dense direct preference optimization over the human feedback. Comprehensive experiments on five benchmarks in both automatic and human evaluation show that, RLHF-V can enable substantially more trustworthy MLLM behaviors with promising data and computation efficiency. Remarkably, using 1.4k annotated data samples, RLHF-V significantly reduces the hallucination rate of the base MLLM by 34.8%, outperforming the concurrent LLaVA-RLHF trained on 10k annotated data. The final model achieves state-of-the-art performance in trustworthiness among open-source MLLMs, and shows better robustness than GPT-4V in preventing hallucinations aroused from over-generalization.

    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Re-localizing a camera from a single image in a previously mapped area is vital for many computer vision applications in robotics and augmented/virtual reality. In this work, we address the problem of estimating the 6 DoF camera pose relative to a global frame from a single image. We propose to leverage a novel network of relative spatial and temporal geometric constraints to guide the training of a Deep Network for localization. We employ simultaneously spatial and temporal relative pose constraints that are obtained not only from adjacent camera frames but also from camera frames that are distant in the spatio-temporal space of the scene. We show that our method, through these constraints, is capable of learning to localize when little or very sparse ground-truth 3D coordinates are available. In our experiments, this is less than 1% of available ground-truth data. We evaluate our method on 3 common visual localization datasets and show that it outperforms other direct pose estimation methods",

    "title": "Explainable AI in Diagnosing and Anticipating Leukemia Using Transfer Learning Method",
    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "This research paper focuses on Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL), a form of blood cancer prevalent in children and teenagers, characterized by the rapid proliferation of immature white blood cells (WBCs). These atypical cells can overwhelm healthy cells, leading to severe health consequences. Early and accurate detection of ALL is vital for effective treatment and improving survival rates. Traditional diagnostic methods are time-consuming, costly, and prone to errors. The paper proposes an automated detection approach using computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) models, leveraging deep learning techniques to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of leukemia diagnosis. The study utilizes various transfer learning models like ResNet101V2, VGG19, InceptionV3, and InceptionResNetV2 for classifying ALL. The methodology includes using the Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) for ensuring the validity and reliability of the AI system's predictions. This approach is critical for overcoming the \"black box\" nature of AI, where decisions made by models are often opaque and unaccountable. The paper highlights that the proposed method using the InceptionV3 model achieved an impressive 98.38% accuracy, outperforming other tested models. The results, verified by the LIME algorithm, showcase the potential of this method in accurately identifying ALL, providing a valuable tool for medical practitioners. The research underscores the impact of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) in medical diagnostics, paving the way for more transparent and trustworthy AI applications in healthcare",

    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Presentation of folded documents is not an uncommon case in modern society. Digitizing such documents by capturing them with a smartphone camera can be tricky since a crease can divide the document contents into separate planes. To unfold the document, one could hold the edges potentially obscuring it in a captured image. While there are many geometrical rectification methods, they were usually developed for arbitrary bends and folds. We consider such algorithms and propose a novel approach Unfolder developed specifically for images of documents with a crease from folding in half. Unfolder is robust to projective distortions of the document image and does not fragment the image in the vicinity of a crease after rectification. A new Folded Document Images dataset was created to investigate the rectification accuracy of folded (2, 3, 4, and 8 folds) documents. The dataset includes 1600 images captured when document placed on a table and when held in hand. The Unfolder algorithm allowed for a recognition error rate of 0.33, which is better than the advanced neural network methods DocTr (0.44) and DewarpNet (0.57). The average runtime for Unfolder was only 0.25 s/image on an iPhone XR",

    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Estimating 3D rotations is a common procedure for 3D computer vision. The accuracy depends heavily on the rotation representation. One form of representation -- rotation matrices -- is popular due to its continuity, especially for pose estimation tasks. The learning process usually incorporates orthogonalization to ensure orthonormal matrices. Our work reveals, through gradient analysis, that common orthogonalization procedures based on the Gram-Schmidt process and singular value decomposition will slow down training efficiency. To this end, we advocate removing orthogonalization from the learning process and learning unorthogonalized `Pseudo' Rotation Matrices (PRoM). An optimization analysis shows that PRoM converges faster and to a better solution. By replacing the orthogonalization incorporated representation with our proposed PRoM in various rotation-related tasks, we achieve state-of-the-art results on large-scale benchmarks for human pose estimation",

    "abstract": "Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) is a brain-inspired and light-weight machine learning method. It has received significant attention in the literature as a candidate to be applied in the wearable internet of things, near-sensor artificial intelligence applications and on-device processing. HDC is computationally less complex than traditional deep learning algorithms and typically achieves moderate to good classification performance. A key aspect that determines the performance of HDC is the encoding of the input data to the hyperdimensional (HD) space. This article proposes a novel light-weight approach relying only on native HD arithmetic vector operations to encode binarized images that preserves similarity of patterns at nearby locations by using point of interest selection and local linear mapping. The method reaches an accuracy of 97.35% on the test set for the MNIST data set and 84.12% for the Fashion-MNIST data set. These results outperform other studies using baseline HDC with different encoding approaches and are on par with more complex hybrid HDC models. The proposed encoding approach also demonstrates a higher robustness to noise and blur compared to the baseline encoding",

    "abstract": "Referring image segmentation (RIS) aims to segment objects in an image conditioning on free-from text descriptions. Despite the overwhelming progress, it still remains challenging for current approaches to perform well on cases with various text expressions or with unseen visual entities, limiting its further application. In this paper, we present a novel RIS approach, which substantially improves the generalization ability by addressing the two dilemmas mentioned above. Specially, to deal with unconstrained texts, we propose to boost a given expression with an explicit and crucial prompt, which complements the expression in a unified context, facilitating target capturing in the presence of linguistic style changes. Furthermore, we introduce a multi-modal fusion aggregation module with visual guidance from a powerful pretrained model to leverage spatial relations and pixel coherences to handle the incomplete target masks and false positive irregular clumps which often appear on unseen visual entities. Extensive experiments are conducted in the zero-shot cross-dataset settings and the proposed approach achieves consistent gains compared to the state-of-the-art, e.g., 4.15\\%, 5.45\\%, and 4.64\\% mIoU increase on RefCOCO, RefCOCO+ and ReferIt respectively, demonstrating its effectiveness.

    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Novel view synthesis from limited observations remains an important and persistent task. However, high efficiency in existing NeRF-based few-shot view synthesis is often compromised to obtain an accurate 3D representation. To address this challenge, we propose a few-shot view synthesis framework based on 3D Gaussian Splatting that enables real-time and photo-realistic view synthesis with as few as three training views. The proposed method, dubbed FSGS, handles the extremely sparse initialized SfM points with a thoughtfully designed Gaussian Unpooling process. Our method iteratively distributes new Gaussians around the most representative locations, subsequently infilling local details in vacant areas. We also integrate a large-scale pre-trained monocular depth estimator within the Gaussians optimization process, leveraging online augmented views to guide the geometric optimization towards an optimal solution. Starting from sparse points observed from limited input viewpoints, our FSGS can accurately grow into unseen regions, comprehensively covering the scene and boosting the rendering quality of novel views. Overall, FSGS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and rendering efficiency across diverse datasets, including LLFF, Mip-NeRF360, and Blender.

Building upon the open-sourced pretrained Vision-Language Model, OpenFlamingo, we first enhance Dolphins's reasoning capabilities through an innovative Grounded Chain of Thought (GCoT) process. Then we tailored Dolphins to the driving domain by constructing driving-specific instruction data and conducting instruction tuning. Through the utilization of the BDD-X dataset, we designed and consolidated four distinct AV tasks into Dolphins to foster a holistic understanding of intricate driving scenarios. As a result, the distinctive features of Dolphins are characterized into two dimensions: (1) the ability to provide a comprehensive understanding of complex and long-tailed open-world driving scenarios and solve a spectrum of AV tasks, and (2) the emergence of human-like capabilities including gradient-free instant adaptation via in-context learning and error recovery via reflection",

The framework integrates a directly trained Spiking Neuron Network (SNN) regression model and leverages a state-of-the-art low power edge neuromorphic processor - Speck, collectively aiming to advance the precision and efficiency of eye-tracking systems. First, we introduce a representative event-based eye-tracking dataset, \"Ini-30\", which was collected with two glass-mounted DVS cameras from thirty volunteers. Then,a SNN model, based on Integrate And Fire (IAF) neurons, named \"Retina\", is described , featuring only 64k parameters (6.63x fewer than the latest) and achieving pupil tracking error of only 3.24 pixels in a 64x64 DVS input. The continous regression output is obtained by means of convolution using a non-spiking temporal 1D filter slided across the output spiking layer. Finally, we evaluate Retina on the neuromorphic processor, showing an end-to-end power between 2.89-4.8 mW and a latency of 5.57-8.01 mS dependent on the time window. We also benchmark our model against the latest event-based eye-tracking method, \"3ET\", which was built upon event frames. Results show that Retina achieves superior precision with 1.24px less pupil centroid error and reduced computational complexity with 35 times fewer MAC operations. We hope this work will open avenues for further investigation of close-loop neuromorphic solutions and true event-based training pursuing edge performance",

    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an efficient and high-performance method for partially relevant video retrieval (PRVR), which aims to retrieve untrimmed long videos that contain at least one relevant moment to the input text query. In terms of both efficiency and performance, the overlooked bottleneck of previous studies is the visual encoding of dense frames. This guides researchers to choose lightweight visual backbones, yielding sub-optimal retrieval performance due to their limited capabilities of learned visual representations. However, it is undesirable to simply replace them with high-performance large-scale vision-and-language models (VLMs) due to their low efficiency. To address these issues, instead of dense frames, we focus on super images, which are created by rearranging the video frames in a $N \\times N$ grid layout. This reduces the number of visual encodings to $\\frac{1}{N^2}$ and compensates for the low efficiency of large-scale VLMs, allowing us to adopt them as powerful encoders. Surprisingly, we discover that with a simple query-image attention trick, VLMs generalize well to super images effectively and demonstrate promising zero-shot performance against SOTA methods efficiently. In addition, we propose a fine-tuning approach by incorporating a few trainable modules into the VLM backbones. The experimental results demonstrate that our approaches efficiently achieve the best performance on ActivityNet Captions and TVR",

    "title": "SCHEME: Scalable Channer Mixer for Vision Transformers",
    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Vision Transformers have received significant attention due to their impressive performance in many vision tasks. While the token mixer or attention block has been studied in great detail, the channel mixer or feature mixing block (FFN or MLP) has not been explored in depth albeit it accounts for a bulk of the parameters and computation in a model. In this work, we study whether sparse feature mixing can replace the dense connections and confirm this with a block diagonal MLP structure that improves the accuracy by supporting larger expansion ratios. To improve the feature clusters formed by this structure and thereby further improve the accuracy, a lightweight, parameter-free, channel covariance attention (CCA) mechanism is introduced as a parallel branch during training. This design of CCA enables gradual feature mixing across channel groups during training whose contribution decays to zero as the training progresses to convergence. This allows the CCA block to be discarded during inference, thus enabling enhanced performance with no additional computational cost. The resulting $\\textit{Scalable CHannEl MixEr}$ (SCHEME) can be plugged into any ViT architecture to obtain a gamut of models with different trade-offs between complexity and performance by controlling the block diagonal structure size in the MLP. This is shown by the introduction of a new family of SCHEMEformer models. Experiments on image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation, with different ViT backbones, consistently demonstrate substantial accuracy gains over existing designs, especially under lower FLOPs regimes. For example, the SCHEMEformer establishes a new SOTA of 79.7% accuracy for ViTs using pure attention mixers on ImageNet-1K at 1.77G FLOPs",

    "abstract": "Multi-contrast magnetic resonance imaging is a significant and essential medical imaging technique.However, multi-contrast imaging has longer acquisition time and is easy to cause motion artifacts. In particular, the acquisition time for a T2-weighted image is prolonged due to its longer repetition time (TR). On the contrary, T1-weighted image has a shorter TR. Therefore,utilizing complementary information across T1 and T2-weighted image is a way to decrease the overall imaging time. Previous T1-assisted T2 reconstruction methods have mostly focused on image domain using whole-based image fusion approaches. The image domain reconstruction method has the defects of high computational complexity and limited flexibility. To address this issue, we propose a novel multi-contrast imaging method called partition-based k-space synthesis (PKS) which can achieve super reconstruction quality of T2-weighted image by feature fusion. Concretely, we first decompose fully-sampled T1 k-space data and under-sampled T2 k-space data into two sub-data, separately. Then two new objects are constructed by combining the two sub-T1/T2 data. After that, the two new objects as the whole data to realize the reconstruction of T2-weighted image. Finally, the objective T2 is synthesized by extracting the sub-T2 data of each part. Experimental results showed that our combined technique can achieve comparable or better results than using traditional k-space parallel imaging(SAKE) that processes each contrast independently",

Unrolled approaches, which rely on end-to-end training of convolutional neural network (CNN) blocks within iterative reconstruction algorithms, offer state-of-the-art performance. These algorithms require a large amount of memory during training, making them difficult to employ in high-dimensional applications. Deep equilibrium (DEQ) models and the recent monotone operator learning (MOL) approach were introduced to eliminate the need for unrolling, thus reducing the memory demand during training. Both approaches require a Lipschitz constraint on the network to ensure that the forward and backpropagation iterations converge. Unfortunately, the constraint often results in reduced performance compared to unrolled methods. The main focus of this work is to relax the constraint on the CNN block in two different ways. Inspired by convex-non-convex regularization strategies, we now impose the monotone constraint on the sum of the gradient of the data term and the CNN block, rather than constrain the CNN itself to be a monotone operator. This approach enables the CNN to learn possibly non-monotone score functions, which can translate to improved performance. In addition, we only restrict the operator to be monotone in a local neighborhood around the image manifold. Our theoretical results show that the proposed algorithm is guaranteed to converge to the fixed point and that the solution is robust to input perturbations, provided that it is initialized close to the true solution. Our empirical results show that the relaxed constraints translate to improved performance and that the approach enjoys robustness to input perturbations similar to MOL",

    "title": "NeuSG: Neural Implicit Surface Reconstruction with 3D Gaussian Splatting Guidance",
    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Existing neural implicit surface reconstruction methods have achieved impressive performance in multi-view 3D reconstruction by leveraging explicit geometry priors such as depth maps or point clouds as regularization. However, the reconstruction results still lack fine details because of the over-smoothed depth map or sparse point cloud. In this work, we propose a neural implicit surface reconstruction pipeline with guidance from 3D Gaussian Splatting to recover highly detailed surfaces. The advantage of 3D Gaussian Splatting is that it can generate dense point clouds with detailed structure. Nonetheless, a naive adoption of 3D Gaussian Splatting can fail since the generated points are the centers of 3D Gaussians that do not necessarily lie on the surface. We thus introduce a scale regularizer to pull the centers close to the surface by enforcing the 3D Gaussians to be extremely thin. Moreover, we propose to refine the point cloud from 3D Gaussians Splatting with the normal priors from the surface predicted by neural implicit models instead of using a fixed set of points as guidance. Consequently, the quality of surface reconstruction improves from the guidance of the more accurate 3D Gaussian splatting. By jointly optimizing the 3D Gaussian Splatting and the neural implicit model, our approach benefits from both representations and generates complete surfaces with intricate details. Experiments on Tanks and Temples verify the effectiveness of our proposed method",

    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Text-to-video diffusion models have advanced video generation significantly. However, customizing these models to generate videos with tailored motions presents a substantial challenge. In specific, they encounter hurdles in (a) accurately reproducing motion from a target video, and (b) creating diverse visual variations. For example, straightforward extensions of static image customization methods to video often lead to intricate entanglements of appearance and motion data. To tackle this, here we present the Video Motion Customization (VMC) framework, a novel one-shot tuning approach crafted to adapt temporal attention layers within video diffusion models. Our approach introduces a novel motion distillation objective using residual vectors between consecutive frames as a motion reference. The diffusion process then preserves low-frequency motion trajectories while mitigating high-frequency motion-unrelated noise in image space. We validate our method against state-of-the-art video generative models across diverse real-world motions and contexts.

    "abstract": "Text-guided 3D face synthesis has achieved remarkable results by leveraging text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models. However, most existing works focus solely on the direct generation, ignoring the editing, restricting them from synthesizing customized 3D faces through iterative adjustments. In this paper, we propose a unified text-guided framework from face generation to editing. In the generation stage, we propose a geometry-texture decoupled generation to mitigate the loss of geometric details caused by coupling. Besides, decoupling enables us to utilize the generated geometry as a condition for texture generation, yielding highly geometry-texture aligned results. We further employ a fine-tuned texture diffusion model to enhance texture quality in both RGB and YUV space. In the editing stage, we first employ a pre-trained diffusion model to update facial geometry or texture based on the texts. To enable sequential editing, we introduce a UV domain consistency preservation regularization, preventing unintentional changes to irrelevant facial attributes. Besides, we propose a self-guided consistency weight strategy to improve editing efficacy while preserving consistency. Through comprehensive experiments, we showcase our method's superiority in face synthesis. Project page: https://faceg2e.github.io/",

    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "It is widely believed that the dense supervision is better than the sparse supervision in the field of depth completion, but the underlying reasons for this are rarely discussed. In this paper, we find that the challenge of using sparse supervision for training Radar-Camera depth prediction models is the Projection Transformation Collapse (PTC). The PTC implies that sparse supervision leads the model to learn unexpected collapsed projection transformations between Image/Radar/LiDAR spaces. Building on this insight, we propose a novel ``Disruption-Compensation\" framework to handle the PTC, thereby relighting the use of sparse supervision in depth completion tasks. The disruption part deliberately discards position correspondences among Image/Radar/LiDAR, while the compensation part leverages 3D spatial and 2D semantic information to compensate for the discarded beneficial position correspondence.

Our investigation reveals that the temporal information is usually not well learned during distillation , and the temporal dimension of synthetic data contributes little. The observations motivate our unified framework of disentangling the dynamic and static information in the videos.

    "title": "Efficient Multimodal Semantic Segmentation via Dual-Prompt Learning",
    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Multimodal (e.g., RGB-Depth/RGB-Thermal) fusion has shown great potential for improving semantic segmentation in complex scenes (e.g., indoor/low-light conditions). Existing approaches often fully fine-tune a dual-branch encoder-decoder framework with a complicated feature fusion strategy for achieving multimodal semantic segmentation, which is training-costly due to the massive parameter updates in feature extraction and fusion. To address this issue, we propose a surprisingly simple yet effective dual-prompt learning network (dubbed DPLNet) for training-efficient multimodal (e.g., RGB-D/T) semantic segmentation. The core of DPLNet is to directly adapt a frozen pre-trained RGB model to multimodal semantic segmentation, reducing parameter updates. For this purpose, we present two prompt learning modules, comprising multimodal prompt generator (MPG) and multimodal feature adapter (MFA). MPG works to fuse the features from different modalities in a compact manner and is inserted from shadow to deep stages to generate the multi-level multimodal prompts that are injected into the frozen backbone, while MPG adapts prompted multimodal features in the frozen backbone for better multimodal semantic segmentation. Since both the MPG and MFA are lightweight, only a few trainable parameters (3.88M, 4.4% of the pre-trained backbone parameters) are introduced for multimodal feature fusion and learning. Using a simple decoder (3.27M parameters), DPLNet achieves new state-of-the-art performance or is on a par with other complex approaches on four RGB-D/T semantic segmentation datasets while satisfying parameter efficiency. Moreover, we show that DPLNet is general and applicable to other multimodal tasks such as salient object detection and video semantic segmentation. Without special design, DPLNet outperforms many complicated models. Our code will be available at github.com/ShaohuaDong2021/DPLNet",

This paper implements and compares both CNNs and QCNNs by testing losses and prediction accuracy on three commonly used datasets. The datasets include the MNIST hand-written digits, Fashion MNIST and cat/dog face images. Additionally, data augmentation (DA), a technique commonly used in CNNs to improve the performance of classification by generating similar images based on original inputs, is also implemented in QCNNs. Surprisingly, the results showed that data augmentation didn't improve QCNNs performance.

    "abstract": "After pre-training by generating the next word conditional on previous words, the Language Model (LM) acquires the ability of In-Context Learning (ICL) that can learn a new task conditional on the context of the given in-context examples (ICEs). Similarly, visually-conditioned Language Modelling is also used to train Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with ICL ability. However, such VLMs typically exhibit weaker classification abilities compared to contrastive learning-based models like CLIP, since the Language Modelling objective does not directly contrast whether an object is paired with a text. To improve the ICL of classification, using more ICEs to provide more knowledge is a straightforward way. However, this may largely increase the selection time, and more importantly, the inclusion of additional in-context images tends to extend the length of the in-context sequence beyond the processing capacity of a VLM. To alleviate these limitations, we propose to manipulate the label space of each ICE to increase its knowledge density, allowing for fewer ICEs to convey as much information as a larger set would. Specifically, we propose two strategies which are Label Distribution Enhancement and Visual Descriptions Enhancement to improve In-context classification performance on diverse datasets, including the classic ImageNet and more fine-grained datasets like CUB-200. Specifically, using our approach on ImageNet, we increase accuracy from 74.70\\% in a 4-shot setting to 76.21\\% with just 2 shots. surpassing CLIP by 0.67\\%.

Considering the scarcity of stylized video datasets, we propose to first train a style control adapter using style-rich image datasets, then transfer the learned stylization ability to video generation through a tailor-made finetuning paradigm. To promote content-style disentanglement, we remove style descriptions from the text prompt and extract style information solely from the reference image using a decoupling learning strategy. Additionally, we design a scale-adaptive fusion module to balance the influences of text-based content features and image-based style features, which helps generalization across various text and style combinations.

To address this, the James-Stein estimator proposes an enhancement by steering the sample means toward a more centralized mean vector. In this paper, first, we establish that normalization layers in deep learning use inadmissible estimators for mean and variance. Next, we introduce a novel method to employ the James-Stein estimator to improve the estimation of mean and variance within normalization layers. We evaluate our method on different computer vision tasks: image classification, semantic segmentation, and 3D object classification. Through these evaluations, it is evident that our improved normalization layers consistently yield superior accuracy across all tasks without extra computational burden. Moreover, recognizing that a plethora of shrinkage estimators surpass the traditional estimator in performance, we study two other prominent shrinkage estimators: Ridge and LASSO. Additionally, we provide visual representations to intuitively demonstrate the impact of shrinkage on the estimated layer statistics. Finally, we study the effect of regularization and batch size on our modified batch normalization. The studies show that our method is less sensitive to batch size and regularization, improving accuracy under various setups",

    "title": "Segment Anything Model-guided Collaborative Learning Network for Scribble-supervised Polyp Segmentation",
    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Polyp segmentation plays a vital role in accurately locating polyps at an early stage, which holds significant clinical importance for the prevention of colorectal cancer. Various polyp segmentation methods have been developed using fully-supervised deep learning techniques. However, pixel-wise annotation for polyp images by physicians during the diagnosis is both time-consuming and expensive. Moreover, visual foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) have shown remarkable performance. Nevertheless, directly applying SAM to medical segmentation may not produce satisfactory results due to the inherent absence of medical knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel SAM-guided Collaborative Learning Network (SAM-CLNet) for scribble-supervised polyp segmentation, enabling a collaborative learning process between our segmentation network and SAM to boost the model performance. Specifically, we first propose a Cross-level Enhancement and Aggregation Network (CEA-Net) for weakly-supervised polyp segmentation. Within CEA-Net, we propose a Cross-level Enhancement Module (CEM) that integrates the adjacent features to enhance the representation capabilities of different resolution features. Additionally, a Feature Aggregation Module (FAM) is employed to capture richer features across multiple levels. Moreover, we present a box-augmentation strategy that combines the segmentation maps generated by CEA-Net with scribble annotations to create more precise prompts. These prompts are then fed into SAM, generating segmentation SAM-guided masks, which can provide additional supervision to train CEA-Net effectively. Furthermore, we present an Image-level Filtering Mechanism to filter out unreliable SAM-guided masks. Extensive experimental results show that our SAM-CLNet outperforms state-of-the-art weakly-supervised segmentation methods",

    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "3D Morphable Models (3DMMs) provide promising 3D face reconstructions in various applications. However, existing methods struggle to reconstruct faces with extreme expressions due to deficiencies in supervisory signals, such as sparse or inaccurate landmarks. Segmentation information contains effective geometric contexts for face reconstruction. Certain attempts intuitively depend on differentiable renderers to compare the rendered silhouettes of reconstruction with segmentation, which is prone to issues like local optima and gradient instability. In this paper, we fully utilize the facial part segmentation geometry by introducing Part Re-projection Distance Loss (PRDL). Specifically, PRDL transforms facial part segmentation into 2D points and re-projects the reconstruction onto the image plane. Subsequently, by introducing grid anchors and computing different statistical distances from these anchors to the point sets, PRDL establishes geometry descriptors to optimize the distribution of the point sets for face reconstruction. PRDL exhibits a clear gradient compared to the renderer-based methods and presents state-of-the-art reconstruction performance in extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments.

In order to effectively utilize high-resolution geostationary observations, a knowledge-based data-driven (KBDD) framework for all-day identification of cloud types based on spectral information from Himawari-8/9 satellite sensors is designed. And a novel, simple and efficient network, named CldNet, is proposed. Compared with widely used semantic segmentation networks, including SegNet, PSPNet, DeepLabV3+, UNet, and ResUnet, our proposed model CldNet with an accuracy of 80.89+-2.18% is state-of-the-art in identifying cloud types and has increased by 32%, 46%, 22%, 2%, and 39%, respectively. With the assistance of auxiliary information (e.g., satellite zenith/azimuth angle, solar zenith/azimuth angle), the accuracy of CldNet-W using visible and near-infrared bands and CldNet-O not using visible and near-infrared bands on the test dataset is 82.23+-2.14% and 73.21+-2.02%, respectively. Meanwhile, the total parameters of CldNet are only 0.46M, making it easy for edge deployment. More importantly, the trained CldNet without any fine-tuning can predict cloud types with higher spatial resolution using satellite spectral data with spatial resolution 0.02{\\deg}*0.02{\\deg}, which indicates that CldNet possesses a strong generalization ability. In aggregate, the KBDD framework using CldNet is a highly effective cloud-type identification system capable of providing a high-fidelity, all-day, spatiotemporal cloud-type database for many climate assessment fields",

In order to estimate GHI with high spatial resolution, a quantitative irradiance estimation network, named QIENet, is proposed. Specifically, the temporal and spatial characteristics of remote sensing data of the satellite Himawari-8 are extracted and fused by recurrent neural network (RNN) and convolution operation, respectively. Not only remote sensing data, but also GHI-related time information (hour, day, and month) and geographical information (altitude, longitude, and latitude), are used as the inputs of QIENet. The satellite spectral channels B07 and B11 - B15 and time are recommended as model inputs for QIENet according to the spatial distributions of annual solar energy. Meanwhile, QIENet is able to capture the impact of various clouds on hourly GHI estimates. More importantly, QIENet does not overestimate ground observations and can also reduce RMSE by 27.51%/18.00%, increase R2 by 20.17%/9.42%, and increase r by 8.69%/3.54% compared with ERA5/NSRDB.

Parameter isolation addresses this challenge by masking a sub-network for each task to mitigate interference with old tasks. However, these sub-networks are constructed relying on weight magnitude, which does not necessarily correspond to the importance of weights, resulting in maintaining unimportant weights and constructing redundant sub-networks. To overcome this limitation, inspired by information bottleneck, which removes redundancy between adjacent network layers, we propose \\textbf{\\underline{I}nformation \\underline{B}ottleneck \\underline{M}asked sub-network (IBM)} to eliminate redundancy within sub-networks. Specifically, IBM accumulates valuable information into essential weights to construct redundancy-free sub-networks, not only effectively mitigating CF by freezing the sub-networks but also facilitating new tasks training through the transfer of valuable knowledge. Additionally, IBM decomposes hidden representations to automate the construction process and make it flexible. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IBM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "We propose an adaptive training scheme for unsupervised medical image registration. Existing methods rely on image reconstruction as the primary supervision signal. However, nuisance variables (e.g. noise and covisibility) often cause the loss of correspondence between medical images, violating the Lambertian assumption in physical waves (e.g. ultrasound) and consistent imaging acquisition. As the unsupervised learning scheme relies on intensity constancy to establish correspondence between images for reconstruction, this introduces spurious error residuals that are not modeled by the typical training objective. To mitigate this, we propose an adaptive framework that re-weights the error residuals with a correspondence scoring map during training, preventing the parametric displacement estimator from drifting away due to noisy gradients, which leads to performance degradations. To illustrate the versatility and effectiveness of our method, we tested our framework on three representative registration architectures across three medical image datasets along with other baselines. Our proposed adaptive framework consistently outperforms other methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. Paired t-tests show that our improvements are statistically significant.

CV systems leverage Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms to help visualize and interpret the environment, enhancing situational awareness. However, the adaptability of CV systems at the tactical edge remains challenging due to rapidly changing environments and objects which can confuse the deployed models. A CV model leveraged in this environment can become uncertain in its predictions, as the environment and the objects existing in the environment begin to change. Additionally, mission objectives can rapidly change leading to adjustments in technology, camera angles, and image resolutions. All of which can negatively affect the performance of and potentially introduce uncertainty into the system. When the training environment and/or technology differs from the deployment environment, CV models can perform unexpectedly. Unfortunately, most scenarios at the tactical edge do not incorporate Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) into their deployed C2 and CV systems. This concept paper explores the idea of synchronizing robust data operations and model fine-tuning driven by UQ all at the tactical edge. Specifically, curating datasets and training child models based on the residuals of predictions, using these child models to calculate prediction intervals (PI), and then using these PI to calibrate the deployed models. By incorporating UQ into the core operations surrounding C2 and CV systems at the tactical edge, we can help drive purposeful adaptability on the battlefield",

Existing methods rely on objectives (e.g. mean-squared error) that assume a uniform noise level across the image, disregarding the heteroscedastic and input-dependent characteristics of noise distribution in real-world medical images. This further introduces noisy gradients due to undesired penalization on outliers, causing unnatural deformation and performance degradation. To mitigate this, we propose an adaptive weighting scheme with a relative $\\gamma$-exponentiated signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the displacement estimator after modeling the heteroscedastic noise using a separate variance estimator to prevent the model from being driven away by spurious gradients from error residuals, leading to more accurate displacement estimation.

We propose Lasagna, a method that enables intuitive text-guided relighting control. Lasagna learns a lighting prior by using score distillation sampling to distill the prior of a diffusion model, which has been finetuned on synthetic relighting data. To train Lasagna, we curate a new synthetic dataset ReLiT, which contains 3D object assets re-lit from multiple light source locations. Despite training on synthetic images, quantitative results show that Lasagna relights real-world images while preserving other aspects of the input image, outperforming state-of-the-art text-guided image editing methods. Lasagna enables realistic and controlled results on natural images and digital art pieces and is preferred by humans over other methods in over 91% of cases.

Exploring how the human brain works in the visual system facilitates bridging the gap between human visual perception and computer vision models. However, neuroscientists study the brain via Neuroimaging, i.e., Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), to discover the brain's functions. These approaches face interpretation challenges where fMRI data can be complex and require expertise. Therefore, neuroscientists make inferences about cognitive processes based on patterns of brain activities, which can lead to potential misinterpretation or limited functional understanding. In this work, we first present a simple yet effective Brainformer approach, a novel Transformer-based framework, to analyze the patterns of fMRI in the human perception system from the machine learning perspective. Secondly, we introduce a novel mechanism incorporating fMRI, which represents the human brain activities, as the supervision for the machine vision model. This work also introduces a novel perspective on transferring knowledge from human perception to neural networks.

    "abstract": "In this study, we propose a novel motif-based approach for unsupervised textile anomaly detection that combines the benefits of traditional convolutional neural networks with those of an unsupervised learning paradigm. It consists of five main steps: preprocessing, automatic pattern period extraction, patch extraction, features selection and anomaly detection. This proposed approach uses a new dynamic and heuristic method for feature selection which avoids the drawbacks of initialization of the number of filters (neurons) and their weights, and those of the backpropagation mechanism such as the vanishing gradients, which are common practice in the state-of-the-art methods. The design and training of the network are performed in a dynamic and input domain-based manner and, thus, no ad-hoc configurations are required. Before building the model, only the number of layers and the stride are defined. We do not initialize the weights randomly nor do we define the filter size or number of filters as conventionally done in CNN-based approaches. This reduces effort and time spent on hyperparameter initialization and fine-tuning. Only one defect-free sample is required for training and no further labeled data is needed. The trained network is then used to detect anomalies on defective fabric samples. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the Patterned Fabrics benchmark dataset. Our algorithm yields reliable and competitive results (on recall, precision, accuracy and f1- measure) compared to state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches, in less time, with efficient training in a single epoch and a lower computational cost",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is the most common form of mesothelioma. To assess response to treatment, tumor measurements are acquired and evaluated based on a patient's longitudinal computed tomography (CT) scans. Tumor volume, however, is the more accurate metric for assessing tumor burden and response. Automated segmentation methods using deep learning can be employed to acquire volume, which otherwise is a tedious task performed manually. The deep learning-based tumor volume and contours can then be compared with a standard reference to assess the robustness of the automated segmentations. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of probability map threshold on MPM tumor delineations generated using a convolutional neural network (CNN). Eighty-eight CT scans from 21 MPM patients were segmented by a VGG16/U-Net CNN. A radiologist modified the contours generated at a 0.5 probability threshold. Percent difference of tumor volume and overlap using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) were compared between the standard reference provided by the radiologist and CNN outputs for thresholds ranging from 0.001 to 0.9. CNN annotations consistently yielded smaller tumor volumes than radiologist contours. Reducing the probability threshold from 0.5 to 0.1 decreased the absolute percent volume difference, on average, from 43.96% to 24.18%. Median and mean DSC ranged from 0.58 to 0.60, with a peak at a threshold of 0.5; no distinct threshold was found for percent volume difference. No single output threshold in the CNN probability maps was optimal for both tumor volume and DSC. This work underscores the need to assess tumor volume and spatial overlap when evaluating CNN performance. While automated segmentations may yield comparable tumor volumes to that of the reference standard, the spatial region delineated by the CNN at a specific threshold is equally important",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Video topic segmentation unveils the coarse-grained semantic structure underlying videos and is essential for other video understanding tasks. Given the recent surge in multi-modal, relying solely on a single modality is arguably insufficient. On the other hand, prior solutions for similar tasks like video scene/shot segmentation cater to short videos with clear visual shifts but falter for long videos with subtle changes, such as livestreams. In this paper, we introduce a multi-modal video topic segmenter that utilizes both video transcripts and frames, bolstered by a cross-modal attention mechanism. Furthermore, we propose a dual-contrastive learning framework adhering to the unsupervised domain adaptation paradigm, enhancing our model's adaptability to longer, more semantically complex videos. Experiments on short and long video corpora demonstrate that our proposed solution, significantly surpasses baseline methods in terms of both accuracy and transferability, in both intra- and cross-domain settings",

DREAM features two components: diffusion rectification, which adjusts training to reflect the sampling process, and estimation adaptation, which balances perception against distortion. When applied to image super-resolution (SR), DREAM adeptly navigates the tradeoff between minimizing distortion and preserving high image quality. Experiments demonstrate DREAM's superiority over standard diffusion-based SR methods, showing a $2$ to $3\\times $ faster training convergence and a $10$ to $20\\times$ reduction in necessary sampling steps to achieve comparable or superior results.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The problem of novel view synthesis has grown significantly in popularity recently with the introduction of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) and other implicit scene representation methods. A recent advance, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), leverages an explicit representation to achieve real-time rendering with high-quality results. However, 3DGS still requires an abundance of training views to generate a coherent scene representation. In few shot settings, similar to NeRF, 3DGS tends to overfit to training views, causing background collapse and excessive floaters, especially as the number of training views are reduced. We propose a method to enable training coherent 3DGS-based radiance fields of 360 scenes from sparse training views. We find that using naive depth priors is not sufficient and integrate depth priors with generative and explicit constraints to reduce background collapse, remove floaters, and enhance consistency from unseen viewpoints. Experiments show that our method outperforms base 3DGS by up to 30.5% and NeRF-based methods by up to 15.6% in LPIPS on the MipNeRF-360 dataset with substantially less training and inference cost",

Relying only on 2D semantic priors, we propose the first semantic neural SLAM method that trains class-wise scene representations while providing stable camera tracking at the same time. Our method integrates multi-view geometry constraints with image-based feature extraction to improve appearance details and to output color, density, and semantic class information, enabling many downstream applications. To further enable real-time tracking, we introduce a lightweight coarse scene representation which is trained in a self-supervised manner in latent space. Our experimental results achieve state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic data and real-world data tracking while maintaining a commendable operational speed on off-the-shelf hardware.

We develop a lightweight detection strategy based on CLIP features and study its performance in a wide variety of challenging scenarios. We find that, unlike previous belief, it is neither necessary nor convenient to use a large domain-specific dataset for training. On the contrary, by using only a handful of example images from a single generative model, a CLIP-based detector exhibits a surprising generalization ability and high robustness across several different architectures, including recent commercial tools such as Dalle-3, Midjourney v5, and Firefly. We match the SoTA on in-distribution data, and improve largely above it in terms of generalization to out-of-distribution data (+6% in terms of AUC) and robustness to impaired/laundered data (+13%).

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Concept bottleneck models (CBMs) are interpretable models that first predict a set of semantically meaningful features, i.e., concepts, from observations that are subsequently used to condition a downstream task. However, the model's performance strongly depends on the engineered features and can severely suffer from incomplete sets of concepts. Prior works have proposed a side channel -- a residual -- that allows for unconstrained information flow to the downstream task, thus improving model performance but simultaneously introducing information leakage, which is undesirable for interpretability. This work proposes three novel approaches to mitigate information leakage by disentangling concepts and residuals, investigating the critical balance between model performance and interpretability. Through extensive empirical analysis on the CUB, OAI, and CIFAR 100 datasets, we assess the performance of each disentanglement method and provide insights into when they work best. Further, we show how each method impacts the ability to intervene over the concepts and their subsequent impact on task performance",

With the arrival of large-scale astronomical surveys, such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), astronomers now have access to images of a vast number of galaxies. However, the visual inspection of these images is an impossible task for humans due to the sheer number of galaxies to be analyzed. To solve this problem, the Galaxy Zoo project was created to engage thousands of citizen scientists to classify the galaxies based on their visual features. In this paper, we present a machine learning model for galaxy classification using numerical data from the Galaxy Zoo[5] project. Our model utilizes a convolutional neural network architecture to extract features from galaxy images and classify them into spirals or ellipticals. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model by comparing its performance with that of human classifiers using a subset of the Galaxy Zoo dataset. Our results show that our model achieves high accuracy in classifying galaxies and has the potential to significantly enhance our understanding of the formation and evolution of galaxies",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Adversarial patches exemplify the tangible manifestation of the threat posed by adversarial attacks on Machine Learning (ML) models in real-world scenarios. Robustness against these attacks is of the utmost importance when designing computer vision applications, especially for safety-critical domains such as CCTV systems. In most practical situations, monitoring open spaces requires multi-view systems to overcome acquisition challenges such as occlusion handling. Multiview object systems are able to combine data from multiple views, and reach reliable detection results even in difficult environments. Despite its importance in real-world vision applications, the vulnerability of multiview systems to adversarial patches is not sufficiently investigated. In this paper, we raise the following question: Does the increased performance and information sharing across views offer as a by-product robustness to adversarial patches? We first conduct a preliminary analysis showing promising robustness against off-the-shelf adversarial patches, even in an extreme setting where we consider patches applied to all views by all persons in Wildtrack benchmark. However, we challenged this observation by proposing two new attacks: (i) In the first attack, targeting a multiview CNN, we maximize the global loss by proposing gradient projection to the different views and aggregating the obtained local gradients. (ii) In the second attack, we focus on a Transformer-based multiview framework. In addition to the focal loss, we also maximize the transformer-specific loss by dissipating its attention blocks. Our results show a large degradation in the detection performance of victim multiview systems with our first patch attack reaching an attack success rate of 73% , while our second proposed attack reduced the performance of its target detector by 62%",

    "abstract": "Web-scraped datasets are vulnerable to data poisoning, which can be used for backdooring deep image classifiers during training. Since training on large datasets is expensive, a model is trained once and re-used many times. Unlike adversarial examples, backdoor attacks often target specific classes rather than any class learned by the model. One might expect that targeting many classes through a naive composition of attacks vastly increases the number of poison samples. We show this is not necessarily true and more efficient, universal data poisoning attacks exist that allow controlling misclassifications from any source class into any target class with a small increase in poison samples. Our idea is to generate triggers with salient characteristics that the model can learn. The triggers we craft exploit a phenomenon we call inter-class poison transferability, where learning a trigger from one class makes the model more vulnerable to learning triggers for other classes. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our universal backdoor attacks by controlling models with up to 6,000 classes while poisoning only 0.15% of the training dataset",

This collaboration structure offers advantages such as discriminating hard negatives and preserving genuinely clean labels that might be suspiciously noisy. Our experiments on four datasets, featuring three types of noise and different combinations of each block, demonstrate the efficacy of these components' collaboration. Our collaborative structure methods achieve up to a 10% increase in top-1 classification accuracy in synthesized noise datasets and 3-5% in real-world noisy datasets. The results also suggest that these components make distinct contributions to overall performance across various noise scenarios. These findings provide valuable insights for designing noisy label learning methods customized for specific noise scenarios in the future. Our code is accessible to the public",

In this work we ask the following question -- to what degree are spatial and directional language cues informing the navigation model's decisions?

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "As pretrained text-to-image diffusion models become increasingly powerful, recent efforts have been made to distill knowledge from these text-to-image pretrained models for optimizing a text-guided 3D model. Most of the existing methods generate a holistic 3D model from a plain text input. This can be problematic when the text describes a complex scene with multiple objects, because the vectorized text embeddings are inherently unable to capture a complex description with multiple entities and relationships. Holistic 3D modeling of the entire scene further prevents accurate grounding of text entities and concepts. To address this limitation, we propose GraphDreamer, a novel framework to generate compositional 3D scenes from scene graphs, where objects are represented as nodes and their interactions as edges. By exploiting node and edge information in scene graphs, our method makes better use of the pretrained text-to-image diffusion model and is able to fully disentangle different objects without image-level supervision. To facilitate modeling of object-wise relationships, we use signed distance fields as representation and impose a constraint to avoid inter-penetration of objects. To avoid manual scene graph creation, we design a text prompt for ChatGPT to generate scene graphs based on text inputs. We conduct both qualitative and quantitative experiments to validate the effectiveness of GraphDreamer in generating high-fidelity compositional 3D scenes with disentangled object entities",

    "abstract": "Video transformers have become the de facto standard for human action recognition, yet their exclusive reliance on the RGB modality still limits their adoption in certain domains. One such domain is Activities of Daily Living (ADL), where RGB alone is not sufficient to distinguish between visually similar actions, or actions observed from multiple viewpoints. To facilitate the adoption of video transformers for ADL, we hypothesize that the augmentation of RGB with human pose information, known for its sensitivity to fine-grained motion and multiple viewpoints, is essential. Consequently, we introduce the first Pose Induced Video Transformer: PI-ViT (or $\\pi$-ViT), a novel approach that augments the RGB representations learned by video transformers with 2D and 3D pose information. The key elements of $\\pi$-ViT are two plug-in modules, 2D Skeleton Induction Module and 3D Skeleton Induction Module, that are responsible for inducing 2D and 3D pose information into the RGB representations. These modules operate by performing pose-aware auxiliary tasks, a design choice that allows $\\pi$-ViT to discard the modules during inference. Notably, $\\pi$-ViT achieves the state-of-the-art performance on three prominent ADL datasets, encompassing both real-world and large-scale RGB-D datasets, without requiring poses or additional computational overhead at inference",

Our work is motivated by the human ability to intuitively understand postures from a single image or a brief description, a process that intertwines image interpretation, world knowledge, and an understanding of body language. Traditional human pose estimation methods, whether image-based or text-based, often lack holistic scene comprehension and nuanced reasoning, leading to a disconnect between visual data and its real-world implications. PoseGPT addresses these limitations by embedding SMPL poses as a distinct signal token within a multi-modal LLM, enabling direct generation of 3D body poses from both textual and visual inputs. This approach not only simplifies pose prediction but also empowers LLMs to apply their world knowledge in reasoning about human poses, fostering two advanced tasks: speculative pose generation and reasoning about pose estimation. These tasks involve reasoning about humans to generate 3D poses from subtle text queries, possibly accompanied by images. We establish benchmarks for these tasks, moving beyond traditional 3D pose generation and estimation methods. Our results show that PoseGPT outperforms existing multimodal LLMs and task-sepcific methods on these newly proposed tasks. Furthermore, PoseGPT's ability to understand and generate 3D human poses based on complex reasoning opens new directions in human pose analysis",

In this work, we introduce InstructSeq, an instruction-conditioned multi-modal modeling framework that unifies diverse vision tasks through flexible natural language control and handling of both visual and textual data. InstructSeq employs a multimodal transformer architecture encompassing visual, language, and sequential modeling. We utilize a visual encoder to extract image features and a text encoder to encode instructions. An autoregressive transformer fuses the representations and generates sequential task outputs. By training with LLM-generated natural language instructions, InstructSeq acquires a strong comprehension of free-form instructions for specifying visual tasks. This provides an intuitive interface for directing capabilities using flexible natural instructions. Without any task-specific tuning, InstructSeq achieves compelling performance on semantic segmentation, referring expression segmentation/comprehension, and image captioning. The flexible control and multi-task unification empower the model with more human-like versatility and generalizability for computer vision.

    "title": "S2ST: Image-to-Image Translation in the Seed Space of Latent Diffusion",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Image-to-image translation (I2IT) refers to the process of transforming images from a source domain to a target domain while maintaining a fundamental connection in terms of image content. In the past few years, remarkable advancements in I2IT were achieved by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which nevertheless struggle with translations requiring high precision. Recently, Diffusion Models have established themselves as the engine of choice for image generation. In this paper we introduce S2ST, a novel framework designed to accomplish global I2IT in complex photorealistic images, such as day-to-night or clear-to-rain translations of automotive scenes. S2ST operates within the seed space of a Latent Diffusion Model, thereby leveraging the powerful image priors learned by the latter. We show that S2ST surpasses state-of-the-art GAN-based I2IT methods, as well as diffusion-based approaches, for complex automotive scenes, improving fidelity while respecting the target domain's appearance across a variety of domains. Notably, S2ST obviates the necessity for training domain-specific translation networks",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "We present ART$\\boldsymbol{\\cdot}$V, an efficient framework for auto-regressive video generation with diffusion models. Unlike existing methods that generate entire videos in one-shot, ART$\\boldsymbol{\\cdot}$V generates a single frame at a time, conditioned on the previous ones. The framework offers three distinct advantages. First, it only learns simple continual motions between adjacent frames, therefore avoiding modeling complex long-range motions that require huge training data. Second, it preserves the high-fidelity generation ability of the pre-trained image diffusion models by making only minimal network modifications. Third, it can generate arbitrarily long videos conditioned on a variety of prompts such as text, image or their combinations, making it highly versatile and flexible. To combat the common drifting issue in AR models, we propose masked diffusion model which implicitly learns which information can be drawn from reference images rather than network predictions, in order to reduce the risk of generating inconsistent appearances that cause drifting. Moreover, we further enhance generation coherence by conditioning it on the initial frame, which typically contains minimal noise. This is particularly useful for long video generation. When trained for only two weeks on four GPUs, ART$\\boldsymbol{\\cdot}$V already can generate videos with natural motions, rich details and a high level of aesthetic quality. Besides, it enables various appealing applications, e.g., composing a long video from multiple text prompts",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Existing long video retrieval systems are trained and tested in the paragraph-to-video retrieval regime, where every long video is described by a single long paragraph. This neglects the richness and variety of possible valid descriptions of a video, which could be described in moment-by-moment detail, or in a single phrase summary, or anything in between. To provide a more thorough evaluation of the capabilities of long video retrieval systems, we propose a pipeline that leverages state-of-the-art large language models to carefully generate a diverse set of synthetic captions for long videos. We validate this pipeline's fidelity via rigorous human inspection. We then benchmark a representative set of video language models on these synthetic captions using a few long video datasets, showing that they struggle with the transformed data, especially the shortest captions. We also propose a lightweight fine-tuning method, where we use a contrastive loss to learn a hierarchical embedding loss based on the differing levels of information among the various captions. Our method improves performance both on the downstream paragraph-to-video retrieval task (+1.1% R@1 on ActivityNet), as well as for the various long video retrieval metrics we compute using our synthetic data (+3.6% R@1 for short descriptions on ActivityNet).

    "abstract": "Existing diffusion-based video editing models have made gorgeous advances for editing attributes of a source video over time but struggle to manipulate the motion information while preserving the original protagonist's appearance and background. To address this, we propose MotionEditor, a diffusion model for video motion editing. MotionEditor incorporates a novel content-aware motion adapter into ControlNet to capture temporal motion correspondence. While ControlNet enables direct generation based on skeleton poses, it encounters challenges when modifying the source motion in the inverted noise due to contradictory signals between the noise (source) and the condition (reference). Our adapter complements ControlNet by involving source content to transfer adapted control signals seamlessly. Further, we build up a two-branch architecture (a reconstruction branch and an editing branch) with a high-fidelity attention injection mechanism facilitating branch interaction. This mechanism enables the editing branch to query the key and value from the reconstruction branch in a decoupled manner, making the editing branch retain the original background and protagonist appearance. We also propose a skeleton alignment algorithm to address the discrepancies in pose size and position.

Because of these properties, they are well-suited for processing fast motions that require rapid reactions. Although event cameras have recently shown competitive performance in unsupervised optical flow estimation, performance in detecting independently moving objects (IMOs) is lacking behind, although event-based methods would be suited for this task based on their low latency and HDR properties. Previous approaches to event-based IMO segmentation have been heavily dependent on labeled data. However, biological vision systems have developed the ability to avoid moving objects through daily tasks without being given explicit labels. In this work, we propose the first event framework that generates IMO pseudo-labels using geometric constraints. Due to its unsupervised nature, our method can handle an arbitrary number of not predetermined objects and is easily scalable to datasets where expensive IMO labels are not readily available.

    "abstract": "We present MicroCinema, a straightforward yet effective framework for high-quality and coherent text-to-video generation. Unlike existing approaches that align text prompts with video directly, MicroCinema introduces a Divide-and-Conquer strategy which divides the text-to-video into a two-stage process: text-to-image generation and image\\&text-to-video generation. This strategy offers two significant advantages. a) It allows us to take full advantage of the recent advances in text-to-image models, such as Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, and DALLE, to generate photorealistic and highly detailed images. b) Leveraging the generated image, the model can allocate less focus to fine-grained appearance details, prioritizing the efficient learning of motion dynamics. To implement this strategy effectively, we introduce two core designs. First, we propose the Appearance Injection Network, enhancing the preservation of the appearance of the given image. Second, we introduce the Appearance Noise Prior, a novel mechanism aimed at maintaining the capabilities of pre-trained 2D diffusion models. These design elements empower MicroCinema to generate high-quality videos with precise motion, guided by the provided text prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework. Concretely, MicroCinema achieves SOTA zero-shot FVD of 342.86 on UCF-101 and 377.40 on MSR-VTT.

Conventional cameras struggle with high-speed motion capture due to bandwidth and dynamic range limitations. Event cameras are ideal sensors to solve this problem because they encode compressed change information at high temporal resolution. In this work, we propose a novel task called event-based continuous color video decompression, pairing single static color frames and events to reconstruct temporally continuous videos. Our approach combines continuous long-range motion modeling with a feature-plane-based synthesis neural integration model, enabling frame prediction at arbitrary times within the events. Our method does not rely on additional frames except for the initial image, increasing, thus, the robustness to sudden light changes, minimizing the prediction latency, and decreasing the bandwidth requirement. We introduce a novel single objective beamsplitter setup that acquires aligned images and events and a novel and challenging Event Extreme Decompression Dataset (E2D2) that tests the method in various lighting and motion profiles. We thoroughly evaluate our method through benchmarking reconstruction as well as various downstream tasks.

The score functions are parameterized as two diffusion models trained separately on each distribution.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Accurately and efficiently modeling dynamic scenes and motions is considered so challenging a task due to temporal dynamics and motion complexity. To address these challenges, we propose DynMF, a compact and efficient representation that decomposes a dynamic scene into a few neural trajectories. We argue that the per-point motions of a dynamic scene can be decomposed into a small set of explicit or learned trajectories. Our carefully designed neural framework consisting of a tiny set of learned basis queried only in time allows for rendering speed similar to 3D Gaussian Splatting, surpassing 120 FPS, while at the same time, requiring only double the storage compared to static scenes. Our neural representation adequately constrains the inherently underconstrained motion field of a dynamic scene leading to effective and fast optimization. This is done by biding each point to motion coefficients that enforce the per-point sharing of basis trajectories. By carefully applying a sparsity loss to the motion coefficients, we are able to disentangle the motions that comprise the scene, independently control them, and generate novel motion combinations that have never been seen before. We can reach state-of-the-art render quality within just 5 minutes of training and in less than half an hour, we can synthesize novel views of dynamic scenes with superior photorealistic quality. Our representation is interpretable, efficient, and expressive enough to offer real-time view synthesis of complex dynamic scene motions, in monocular and multi-view scenarios",

    "abstract": "When watching a video, humans can naturally extract human actions from the surrounding scene context, even when action-scene combinations are unusual. However, unlike humans, video action recognition models often learn scene-biased action representations from the spurious correlation in training data, leading to poor performance in out-of-context scenarios. While scene-debiased models achieve improved performance in out-of-context scenarios, they often overlook valuable scene information in the data. Addressing this challenge, we propose Disentangled VIdeo representations of Action and Scene (DEVIAS), which aims to achieve holistic video understanding. Disentangled action and scene representations with our method could provide flexibility to adjust the emphasis on action or scene information depending on downstream task and dataset characteristics. Disentangled action and scene representations could be beneficial for both in-context and out-of-context video understanding. To this end, we employ slot attention to learn disentangled action and scene representations with a single model, along with auxiliary tasks that further guide slot attention. We validate the proposed method on both in-context datasets: UCF-101 and Kinetics-400, and out-of-context datasets: SCUBA and HAT.

    "abstract": "With the recent development of generative models, Text-to-3D generations have also seen significant growth. Nonetheless, achieving precise control over 3D generation continues to be an arduous task, as using text to control often leads to missing objects and imprecise locations. Contemporary strategies for enhancing controllability in 3D generation often entail the introduction of additional parameters, such as customized diffusion models. This often induces hardness in adapting to different diffusion models or creating distinct objects. In this paper, we present LucidDreaming as an effective pipeline capable of fine-grained control over 3D generation. It requires only minimal input of 3D bounding boxes, which can be deduced from a simple text prompt using a Large Language Model. Specifically, we propose clipped ray sampling to separately render and optimize objects with user specifications. We also introduce object-centric density blob bias, fostering the separation of generated objects. With individual rendering and optimizing of objects, our method excels not only in controlled content generation from scratch but also within the pre-trained NeRF scenes. In such scenarios, existing generative approaches often disrupt the integrity of the original scene, and current editing methods struggle to synthesize new content in empty spaces. We show that our method exhibits remarkable adaptability across a spectrum of mainstream Score Distillation Sampling-based 3D generation frameworks, and achieves superior alignment of 3D content when compared to baseline approaches.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Underwater object detection is a crucial and challenging problem in marine engineering and aquatic robot. The difficulty is partly because of the degradation of underwater images caused by light selective absorption and scattering. Intuitively, enhancing underwater images can benefit high-level applications like underwater object detection. However, it is still unclear whether all object detectors need underwater image enhancement as pre-processing. We therefore pose the questions \"Does underwater image enhancement really improve underwater object detection?\" and \"How does underwater image enhancement contribute to underwater object detection?\". With these two questions, we conduct extensive studies. Specifically, we use 18 state-of-the-art underwater image enhancement algorithms, covering traditional, CNN-based, and GAN-based algorithms, to pre-process underwater object detection data. Then, we retrain 7 popular deep learning-based object detectors using the corresponding results enhanced by different algorithms, obtaining 126 underwater object detection models. Coupled with 7 object detection models retrained using raw underwater images, we employ these 133 models to comprehensively analyze the effect of underwater image enhancement on underwater object detection. We expect this study can provide sufficient exploration to answer the aforementioned questions and draw more attention of the community to the joint problem of underwater image enhancement and underwater object detection. The pre-trained models and results are publicly available and will be regularly updated.

We introduce MD-Splatting, an approach for simultaneous 3D tracking and novel view synthesis, using video captures of a dynamic scene from various camera poses. MD-Splatting builds on recent advances in Gaussian splatting, a method that learns the properties of a large number of Gaussians for state-of-the-art and fast novel view synthesis. MD-Splatting learns a deformation function to project a set of Gaussians with non-metric, thus canonical, properties into metric space. The deformation function uses a neural-voxel encoding and a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to infer Gaussian position, rotation, and a shadow scalar. We enforce physics-inspired regularization terms based on local rigidity, conservation of momentum, and isometry, which leads to trajectories with smaller trajectory errors. MD-Splatting achieves high-quality 3D tracking on highly deformable scenes with shadows and occlusions. Compared to state-of-the-art, we improve 3D tracking by an average of 23.9 %, while simultaneously achieving high-quality novel view synthesis. With sufficient texture such as in scene 6, MD-Splatting achieves a median tracking error of 3.39 mm on a cloth of 1 x 1 meters in size. Project website: https://md-splatting.github.io/",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Plug-and-Play Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (PnP-ADMM) is a widely-used algorithm for solving inverse problems by integrating physical measurement models and convolutional neural network (CNN) priors. PnP-ADMM has been theoretically proven to converge for convex data-fidelity terms and nonexpansive CNNs. It has however been observed that PnP-ADMM often empirically converges even for expansive CNNs. This paper presents a theoretical explanation for the observed stability of PnP-ADMM based on the interpretation of the CNN prior as a minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) denoiser. Our explanation parallels a similar argument recently made for the iterative shrinkage/thresholding algorithm variant of PnP (PnP-ISTA) and relies on the connection between MMSE denoisers and proximal operators. We also numerically evaluate the performance gap between PnP-ADMM using a nonexpansive DnCNN denoiser and expansive DRUNet denoiser, thus motivating the use of expansive CNNs",

    "title": "FoundPose: Unseen Object Pose Estimation with Foundation Features",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "We propose FoundPose, a method for 6D pose estimation of unseen rigid objects from a single RGB image. The method assumes that 3D models of the objects are available but does not require any object-specific training. This is achieved by building upon DINOv2, a recent vision foundation model with impressive generalization capabilities. An online pose estimation stage is supported by a minimal object representation that is built during a short onboarding stage from DINOv2 patch features extracted from rendered object templates. Given a query image with an object segmentation mask, FoundPose first rapidly retrieves a handful of similarly looking templates by a DINOv2-based bag-of-words approach. Pose hypotheses are then generated from 2D-3D correspondences established by matching DINOv2 patch features between the query image and a retrieved template, and finally optimized by featuremetric refinement. The method can handle diverse objects, including challenging ones with symmetries and without any texture, and noticeably outperforms existing RGB methods for coarse pose estimation in both accuracy and speed on the standard BOP benchmark. With the featuremetric and additional MegaPose refinement, which are demonstrated complementary, the method outperforms all RGB competitors. Source code is at: evinpinar.github.io/foundpose",

    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Images of the natural world, collected by a variety of cameras, from drones to individual phones, are increasingly abundant sources of biological information. There is an explosion of computational methods and tools, particularly computer vision, for extracting biologically relevant information from images for science and conservation. Yet most of these are bespoke approaches designed for a specific task and are not easily adaptable or extendable to new questions, contexts, and datasets. A vision model for general organismal biology questions on images is of timely need. To approach this, we curate and release TreeOfLife-10M, the largest and most diverse ML-ready dataset of biology images. We then develop BioCLIP, a foundation model for the tree of life, leveraging the unique properties of biology captured by TreeOfLife-10M, namely the abundance and variety of images of plants, animals, and fungi, together with the availability of rich structured biological knowledge. We rigorously benchmark our approach on diverse fine-grained biology classification tasks, and find that BioCLIP consistently and substantially outperforms existing baselines (by 17% to 20% absolute). Intrinsic evaluation reveals that BioCLIP has learned a hierarchical representation conforming to the tree of life, shedding light on its strong generalizability.

    "abstract": "While initial approaches to Structure-from-Motion (SfM) revolved around both global and incremental methods, most recent applications rely on incremental systems to estimate camera poses due to their superior robustness. Though there has been tremendous progress in SfM `front-ends' powered by deep models learned from data, the state-of-the-art (incremental) SfM pipelines still rely on classical SIFT features, developed in 2004. In this work, we investigate whether leveraging the developments in feature extraction and matching helps global SfM perform on par with the SOTA incremental SfM approach (COLMAP). To do so, we design a modular SfM framework that allows us to easily combine developments in different stages of the SfM pipeline. Our experiments show that while developments in deep-learning based two-view correspondence estimation do translate to improvements in point density for scenes reconstructed with global SfM, none of them outperform SIFT when comparing with incremental SfM results on a range of datasets. Our SfM system is designed from the ground up to leverage distributed computation, enabling us to parallelize computation on multiple machines and scale to large scenes",

Furthermore, our approach demonstrates cross-modal reasoning abilities across two or more input modalities, despite each modality projection being trained individually.

    "abstract": "Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect and the leading cause of neonate death in China. Clinical diagnosis can be based on the selected 2D key-frames from five views. Limited by the availability of multi-view data, most methods have to rely on the insufficient single view analysis. This study proposes to automatically analyze the multi-view echocardiograms with a practical end-to-end framework. We collect the five-view echocardiograms video records of 1308 subjects (including normal controls, ventricular septal defect (VSD) patients and atrial septal defect (ASD) patients) with both disease labels and standard-view key-frame labels. Depthwise separable convolution-based multi-channel networks are adopted to largely reduce the network parameters. We also approach the imbalanced class problem by augmenting the positive training samples. Our 2D key-frame model can diagnose CHD or negative samples with an accuracy of 95.4\\%, and in negative, VSD or ASD classification with an accuracy of 92.3\\%. To further alleviate the work of key-frame selection in real-world implementation, we propose an adaptive soft attention scheme to directly explore the raw video data. Four kinds of neural aggregation methods are systematically investigated to fuse the information of an arbitrary number of frames in a video. Moreover, with a view detection module, the system can work without the view records. Our video-based model can diagnose with an accuracy of 93.9\\% (binary classification), and 92.1\\% (3-class classification) in a collected 2D video testing set, which does not need key-frame selection and view annotation in testing.

    "abstract": "While vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable performance improvements recently, there is growing evidence that these models also posses harmful biases with respect to social attributes such as gender and race. Prior studies have primarily focused on probing such bias attributes individually while ignoring biases associated with intersections between social attributes. This could be due to the difficulty of collecting an exhaustive set of image-text pairs for various combinations of social attributes. To address this challenge, we employ text-to-image diffusion models to produce counterfactual examples for probing intserctional social biases at scale. Our approach utilizes Stable Diffusion with cross attention control to produce sets of counterfactual image-text pairs that are highly similar in their depiction of a subject (e.g., a given occupation) while differing only in their depiction of intersectional social attributes (e.g., race & gender). Through our over-generate-then-filter methodology, we produce SocialCounterfactuals, a high-quality dataset containing over 171k image-text pairs for probing intersectional biases related to gender, race, and physical characteristics. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the usefulness of our generated dataset for probing and mitigating intersectional social biases in state-of-the-art VLMs",

CoDi-2 demonstrates a wide range of zero-shot capabilities for multimodal generation, such as in-context learning, reasoning, and compositionality of any-to-any modality generation through multi-round interactive conversation.

Then, we introduce CLIP-QDA, a classifier that only uses statistical values to infer labels from the concepts. In addition, this formalism allows for both local and global explanations. These explanations come from the inner design of our architecture, our work is part of a new family of greybox models, combining performances of opaque foundation models and the interpretability of transparent models.

    "abstract": "Learning from videos is an emerging research area that enables robots to acquire skills from human demonstrations, such as procedural videos. To do this, video-language models must be able to obtain structured understandings, such as the temporal segmentation of a demonstration into sequences of actions and skills, and to generalize the understandings to novel domains. In pursuit of this goal, we introduce Spacewalk-18, a benchmark containing two tasks: (1) step recognition and (2) intra-video retrieval over a dataset of temporally segmented and labeled tasks in International Space Station spacewalk recordings. In tandem, the two tasks quantify a model's ability to make use of: (1) out-of-domain visual information; (2) a high temporal context window; and (3) multimodal (text + video) domains. This departs from existing benchmarks for procedural video understanding, which typically deal with short context lengths and can be solved with a single modality. Spacewalk-18, with its inherent multimodal and long-form complexity, exposes the high difficulty of task recognition and segmentation. We find that state-of-the-art methods perform poorly on our benchmark, demonstrating that the goal of generalizable procedural video understanding models is far out and underscoring the need to develop new approaches to these tasks.

This setting is known as continual diffusion. Here, we ask the question: Can we scale these methods to longer concept sequences without forgetting? Although prior work mitigates the forgetting of previously learned concepts, we show that its capacity to learn new tasks reaches saturation over longer sequences. We address this challenge by introducing a novel method, STack-And-Mask INcremental Adapters (STAMINA), which is composed of low-ranked attention-masked adapters and customized MLP tokens. STAMINA is designed to enhance the robust fine-tuning properties of LoRA for sequential concept learning via learnable hard-attention masks parameterized with low rank MLPs, enabling precise, scalable learning via sparse adaptation. Notably, all introduced trainable parameters can be folded back into the model after training, inducing no additional inference parameter costs. We show that STAMINA outperforms the prior SOTA for the setting of text-to-image continual customization on a 50-concept benchmark composed of landmarks and human faces, with no stored replay data. Additionally, we extended our method to the setting of continual learning for image classification, demonstrating that our gains also translate to state-of-the-art performance in this standard benchmark",

Consequently, the resulting model becomes less robust to significant view changes, texture-less area and lighting effects. We introduce Scaffold-GS, which uses anchor points to distribute local 3D Gaussians, and predicts their attributes on-the-fly based on viewing direction and distance within the view frustum. Anchor growing and pruning strategies are developed based on the importance of neural Gaussians to reliably improve the scene coverage.

To address this issue, we introduce the integration of future modeling into the existing learning frameworks of MLLMs. By utilizing the subject trajectory, a highly structured representation of a consecutive frame sequence, as a learning objective, we aim to bridge the gap between the past and the future. We propose two innovative methods to empower MLLMs with foresight minds, Foresight Pre-Training (FPT) and Foresight Instruction-Tuning (FIT), which are inspired by the modern learning paradigm of LLMs. Specifically, FPT jointly training various tasks centered on trajectories, enabling MLLMs to learn how to attend and predict entire trajectories from a given initial observation. Then, FIT requires MLLMs to first predict trajectories of related objects and then reason about potential future events based on them. Aided by FPT and FIT, we build a novel and unified MLLM named Merlin that supports multi-images input and analysis about potential actions of multiple objects for the future reasoning.

We first tackle the limitation of deterministic quantization to fixed ``bins'' by introducing a differentiable Stochastic Quantizer (SQ). We explore the hypothesis that different quantizations may collectively be more robust than each quantized DNN. We formulate a training objective to encourage different quantized DNNs to learn different representations of the input image. The training objective captures diversity and accuracy via mutual information between ensemble members. Through experimentation, we demonstrate substantial improvement in robustness against $L_\\infty$ attacks even if the attacker is allowed to backpropagate through SQ (e.g., > 50\\% accuracy to PGD(5/255) on CIFAR10 without adversarial training), compared to vanilla DNNs as well as existing ensembles of quantized DNNs. We extend the method to detect attacks and generate robustness profiles in the adversarial information plane (AIP), towards a unified analysis of different threat models by correlating the MI and accuracy",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Deep neural networks have become a foundational tool for addressing imaging inverse problems. They are typically trained for a specific task, with a supervised loss to learn a mapping from the observations to the image to recover. However, real-world imaging challenges often lack ground truth data, rendering traditional supervised approaches ineffective. Moreover, for each new imaging task, a new model needs to be trained from scratch, wasting time and resources. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel approach based on meta-learning. Our method trains a meta-model on a diverse set of imaging tasks that allows the model to be efficiently fine-tuned for specific tasks with few fine-tuning steps. We show that the proposed method extends to the unsupervised setting, where no ground truth data is available. In its bilevel formulation, the outer level uses a supervised loss, that evaluates how well the fine-tuned model performs, while the inner loss can be either supervised or unsupervised, relying only on the measurement operator. This allows the meta-model to leverage a few ground truth samples for each task while being able to generalize to new imaging tasks. We show that in simple settings, this approach recovers the Bayes optimal estimator, illustrating the soundness of our approach. We also demonstrate our method's effectiveness on various tasks, including image processing and magnetic resonance imaging",

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art single-view 360-degree room layout reconstruction methods formulate the problem as a high-level 1D (per-column) regression task. On the other hand, traditional low-level 2D layout segmentation is simpler to learn and can represent occluded regions, but it requires complex post-processing for the targeting layout polygon and sacrifices accuracy. We present Seg2Reg to render 1D layout depth regression from the 2D segmentation map in a differentiable and occlusion-aware way, marrying the merits of both sides. Specifically, our model predicts floor-plan density for the input equirectangular 360-degree image. Formulating the 2D layout representation as a density field enables us to employ `flattened' volume rendering to form 1D layout depth regression. In addition, we propose a novel 3D warping augmentation on layout to improve generalization. Finally, we re-implement recent room layout reconstruction methods into our codebase for benchmarking and explore modern backbones and training techniques to serve as the strong baseline. Our model significantly outperforms previous arts. The code will be made available upon publication",

However, automatic action recognition in laparoscopic surgeries involves numerous challenges such as (I) cross-action and intra-action duration variation, (II) relevant content distortion due to smoke, blood accumulation, fast camera motions, organ movements, object occlusion, and (III) surgical scene variations due to different illuminations and viewpoints. Besides, action annotations in laparoscopy surgeries are limited and expensive due to requiring expert knowledge. In this study, we design and evaluate a CNN-RNN architecture as well as a customized training-inference framework to deal with the mentioned challenges in laparoscopic surgery action recognition. Using stacked recurrent layers, our proposed network takes advantage of inter-frame dependencies to negate the negative effect of content distortion and variation in action recognition. Furthermore, our proposed frame sampling strategy effectively manages the duration variations in surgical actions to enable action recognition with high temporal resolution.

    "abstract": "Aircraft Ship Integrated Secure and Traverse (ASIST) is a system designed to arrest helicopters safely and efficiently on ships. Originally, a precision Helicopter Position Sensing Equipment (HPSE) tracked and monitored the position of the helicopter relative to the Rapid Securing Device (RSD). However, using the HPSE component was determined to be infeasible in the transition of the ASIST system due to the hardware installation requirements. As a result, sailors track the position of the helicopters with their eyes with no sensor or artificially intelligent decision aid. Manually tracking the helicopter takes additional time and makes recoveries more difficult, especially at high sea states. Performing recoveries without the decision aid leads to higher uncertainty and cognitive load. PETA (Pose Estimation and Tracking for ASIST) is a research effort to create a helicopter tracking system prototype without hardware installation requirements for ASIST system operators. Its overall goal is to improve situational awareness and reduce operator uncertainty with respect to the aircrafts position relative to the RSD, and consequently increase the allowable landing area. The authors produced a prototype system capable of tracking helicopters with respect to the RSD. The software included a helicopter pose estimation component, camera pose estimation component, and a user interface component. PETA demonstrated the potential for state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms Faster R-CNN and HRNet (High-Resolution Network) to be used to estimate the pose of helicopters in real-time, returning ASIST to its originally intended capability. PETA also demonstrated that traditional methods of encoder-decoders could be used to estimate the orientation of the helicopter and could be used to confirm the output from HRNet",

    "abstract": "Colonoscopy screening is the gold standard procedure for assessing abnormalities in the colon and rectum, such as ulcers and cancerous polyps. Measuring the abnormal mucosal area and its 3D reconstruction can help quantify the surveyed area and objectively evaluate disease burden. However, due to the complex topology of these organs and variable physical conditions, for example, lighting, large homogeneous texture, and image modality estimating distance from the camera aka depth) is highly challenging. Moreover, most colonoscopic video acquisition is monocular, making the depth estimation a non-trivial problem. While methods in computer vision for depth estimation have been proposed and advanced on natural scene datasets, the efficacy of these techniques has not been widely quantified on colonoscopy datasets. As the colonic mucosa has several low-texture regions that are not well pronounced, learning representations from an auxiliary task can improve salient feature extraction, allowing estimation of accurate camera depths. In this work, we propose to develop a novel multi-task learning (MTL) approach with a shared encoder and two decoders, namely a surface normal decoder and a depth estimator decoder. Our depth estimator incorporates attention mechanisms to enhance global context awareness. We leverage the surface normal prediction to improve geometric feature extraction. Also, we apply a cross-task consistency loss among the two geometrically related tasks, surface normal and camera depth. We demonstrate an improvement of 14.17% on relative error and 10.4% improvement on $\\delta_{1}$ accuracy over the most accurate baseline state-of-the-art BTS approach.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Semantic part segmentation provides an intricate and interpretable understanding of an object, thereby benefiting numerous downstream tasks. However, the need for exhaustive annotations impedes its usage across diverse object types. This paper focuses on learning part segmentation from synthetic animals, leveraging the Skinned Multi-Animal Linear (SMAL) models to scale up existing synthetic data generated by computer-aided design (CAD) animal models. Compared to CAD models, SMAL models generate data with a wider range of poses observed in real-world scenarios. As a result, our first contribution is to construct a synthetic animal dataset of tigers and horses with more pose diversity, termed Synthetic Animal Parts (SAP). We then benchmark Syn-to-Real animal part segmentation from SAP to PartImageNet, namely SynRealPart, with existing semantic segmentation domain adaptation methods and further improve them as our second contribution. Concretely, we examine three Syn-to-Real adaptation methods but observe relative performance drop due to the innate difference between the two tasks. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective method called Class-Balanced Fourier Data Mixing (CB-FDM). Fourier Data Mixing aligns the spectral amplitudes of synthetic images with real images, thereby making the mixed images have more similar frequency content to real images. We further use Class-Balanced Pseudo-Label Re-Weighting to alleviate the imbalanced class distribution. We demonstrate the efficacy of CB-FDM on SynRealPart over previous methods with significant performance improvements. Remarkably, our third contribution is to reveal that the learned parts from synthetic tiger and horse are transferable across all quadrupeds in PartImageNet, further underscoring the utility and potential applications of animal part segmentation",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised representation learning aims at finding methods that learn representations from data without annotation-based signals. Abstaining from annotations not only leads to economic benefits but may - and to some extent already does - result in advantages regarding the representation's structure, robustness, and generalizability to different tasks. In the long run, unsupervised methods are expected to surpass their supervised counterparts due to the reduction of human intervention and the inherently more general setup that does not bias the optimization towards an objective originating from specific annotation-based signals. While major advantages of unsupervised representation learning have been recently observed in natural language processing, supervised methods still dominate in vision domains for most tasks. In this dissertation, we contribute to the field of unsupervised (visual) representation learning from three perspectives: (i) Learning representations: We design unsupervised, backpropagation-free Convolutional Self-Organizing Neural Networks (CSNNs) that utilize self-organization- and Hebbian-based learning rules to learn convolutional kernels and masks to achieve deeper backpropagation-free models. (ii) Evaluating representations: We build upon the widely used (non-)linear evaluation protocol to define pretext- and target-objective-independent metrics for measuring and investigating the objective function mismatch between various unsupervised pretext tasks and target tasks. (iii) Transferring representations: We contribute CARLANE, the first 3-way sim-to-real domain adaptation benchmark for 2D lane detection, and a method based on prototypical self-supervised learning.

This limitation severely constrains the potential of semantics in few-shot learning. In this paper, we design an automatic way called Semantic Evolution to generate high-quality semantics. The incorporation of high-quality semantics alleviates the need for complex network structures and learning algorithms used in previous works. Hence, we employ a simple two-layer network termed Semantic Alignment Network to transform semantics and visual features into robust class prototypes with rich discriminative features for few-shot classification.

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning is one of the most promising approaches to acquiring knowledge from limited labeled data. Despite the substantial advancements made in recent years, self-supervised models have posed a challenge to practitioners, as they do not readily provide insight into the model's confidence and uncertainty. Tackling this issue is no simple feat, primarily due to the complexity involved in implementing techniques that can make use of the latent representations learned during pre-training without relying on explicit labels. Motivated by this, we introduce a new stochastic vision transformer that integrates uncertainty and distance awareness into self-supervised learning (SSL) pipelines. Instead of the conventional deterministic vector embedding, our novel stochastic vision transformer encodes image patches into elliptical Gaussian distributional embeddings. Notably, the attention matrices of these stochastic representational embeddings are computed using Wasserstein distance-based attention, effectively capitalizing on the distributional nature of these embeddings. Additionally, we propose a regularization term based on Wasserstein distance for both pre-training and fine-tuning processes, thereby incorporating distance awareness into latent representations. We perform extensive experiments across different tasks such as in-distribution generalization, out-of-distribution detection, dataset corruption, semi-supervised settings, and transfer learning to other datasets and tasks.

    "abstract": "Unsupervised semantic segmentation aims to label each pixel of an image to a corresponding class without the use of annotated data. It is a widely researched area as obtaining labeled datasets are expensive. While previous works in the field demonstrated a gradual improvement in segmentation performance, most of them required neural network training. This made segmentation equally expensive, especially when dealing with large-scale datasets. We thereby propose a lightweight clustering framework for unsupervised semantic segmentation. Attention features of the self-supervised vision transformer exhibit strong foreground-background differentiability. By clustering these features into a small number of clusters, we could separate foreground and background image patches into distinct groupings. In our clustering framework, we first obtain attention features from the self-supervised vision transformer. Then we extract Dataset-level, Category-level and Image-level masks by clustering features within the same dataset, category and image. We further ensure multilevel clustering consistency across the three levels and this allows us to extract patch-level binary pseudo-masks. Finally, the pseudo-mask is upsampled, refined and class assignment is performed according to the CLS token of object regions.

To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to leverage conditioning for synthesis of prostate cancer imaging. Experimental results show that the proposed strategy, which we call Cancer-Net PCa-Gen, enhances synthesis of diverse prostate images through controllable tumour locations and better anatomical and textural fidelity. These crucial features make it well-suited for augmenting real patient data, enabling neural networks to be trained on a more diverse and comprehensive data distribution. The Cancer-Net PCa-Gen framework and sample images have been made publicly available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deetsadi/cancer-net-pca-gen-dataset as a part of a global open-source initiative dedicated to accelerating advancement in machine learning to aid clinicians in the fight against cancer",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Perceiving 3D structures from RGB images based on CAD model primitives can enable an effective, efficient 3D object-based representation of scenes. However, current approaches rely on supervision from expensive annotations of CAD models associated with real images, and encounter challenges due to the inherent ambiguities in the task -- both in depth-scale ambiguity in monocular perception, as well as inexact matches of CAD database models to real observations. We thus propose DiffCAD, the first weakly-supervised probabilistic approach to CAD retrieval and alignment from an RGB image. We formulate this as a conditional generative task, leveraging diffusion to learn implicit probabilistic models capturing the shape, pose, and scale of CAD objects in an image. This enables multi-hypothesis generation of different plausible CAD reconstructions, requiring only a few hypotheses to characterize ambiguities in depth/scale and inexact shape matches. Our approach is trained only on synthetic data, leveraging monocular depth and mask estimates to enable robust zero-shot adaptation to various real target domains. Despite being trained solely on synthetic data, our multi-hypothesis approach can even surpass the supervised state-of-the-art on the Scan2CAD dataset by 5.9% with 8 hypotheses",

    "title": "Contrastive Denoising Score for Text-guided Latent Diffusion Image Editing",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "With the remarkable advent of text-to-image diffusion models, image editing methods have become more diverse and continue to evolve. A promising recent approach in this realm is Delta Denoising Score (DDS) - an image editing technique based on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) framework that leverages the rich generative prior of text-to-image diffusion models. However, relying solely on the difference between scoring functions is insufficient for preserving specific structural elements from the original image, a crucial aspect of image editing. Inspired by the similarity and importance differences between DDS and the contrastive learning for unpaired image-to-image translation (CUT), here we present an embarrassingly simple yet very powerful modification of DDS, called Contrastive Denoising Score (CDS), for latent diffusion models (LDM). Specifically, to enforce structural correspondence between the input and output while maintaining the controllability of contents, we introduce a straightforward approach to regulate structural consistency using CUT loss within the DDS framework. To calculate this loss, instead of employing auxiliary networks, we utilize the intermediate features of LDM, in particular, those from the self-attention layers, which possesses rich spatial information. Our approach enables zero-shot image-to-image translation and neural radiance field (NeRF) editing, achieving a well-balanced interplay between maintaining the structural details and transforming content. Qualitative results and comparisons demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method. Project page with code is available at https://hyelinnam.github.io/CDS/",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Pattern recognition through the fusion of RGB frames and Event streams has emerged as a novel research area in recent years. Current methods typically employ backbone networks to individually extract the features of RGB frames and event streams, and subsequently fuse these features for pattern recognition. However, we posit that these methods may suffer from key issues like sematic gaps and small-scale backbone networks. In this study, we introduce a novel pattern recognition framework that consolidates the semantic labels, RGB frames, and event streams, leveraging pre-trained large-scale vision-language models. Specifically, given the input RGB frames, event streams, and all the predefined semantic labels, we employ a pre-trained large-scale vision model (CLIP vision encoder) to extract the RGB and event features. To handle the semantic labels, we initially convert them into language descriptions through prompt engineering, and then obtain the semantic features using the pre-trained large-scale language model (CLIP text encoder). Subsequently, we integrate the RGB/Event features and semantic features using multimodal Transformer networks. The resulting frame and event tokens are further amplified using self-attention layers. Concurrently, we propose to enhance the interactions between text tokens and RGB/Event tokens via cross-attention. Finally, we consolidate all three modalities using self-attention and feed-forward layers for recognition. Comprehensive experiments on the HARDVS and PokerEvent datasets fully substantiate the efficacy of our proposed SAFE model.

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is the state-of-the-art approach for learning from decentralized data in privacy-constrained scenarios. As the current literature reports, the main problems associated with FL refer to system and statistical challenges: the former ones demand for efficient learning from edge devices, including lowering communication bandwidth and frequency, while the latter require algorithms robust to non-iidness. State-of-art approaches either guarantee convergence at increased communication cost or are not sufficiently robust to handle extreme heterogeneous local distributions. In this work we propose a novel generalization of the heavy-ball momentum, and present FedHBM to effectively address statistical heterogeneity in FL without introducing any communication overhead. We conduct extensive experimentation on common FL vision and NLP datasets, showing that our FedHBM algorithm empirically yields better model quality and higher convergence speed w.r.t. the state-of-art, especially in pathological non-iid scenarios. While being designed for cross-silo settings, we show how FedHBM is applicable in moderate-to-high cross-device scenarios, and how good model initializations (e.g. pre-training) can be exploited for prompt acceleration. Extended experimentation on large-scale real-world federated datasets further corroborates the effectiveness of our approach for real-world FL applications",

    "title": "Fingerprint Matching with Localized Deep Representation",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Compared to minutia-based fingerprint representations, fixed-length representations are attractive due to simple and efficient matching. However, fixed-length fingerprint representations are limited in accuracy when matching fingerprints with different visible areas, which can occur due to different finger poses or acquisition methods. To address this issue, we propose a localized deep representation of fingerprint, named LDRF. By focusing on the discriminative characteristics within local regions, LDRF provides a more robust and accurate fixed-length representation for fingerprints with variable visible areas. LDRF can be adapted to retain information within any valid area, making it highly flexible. The matching scores produced by LDRF also exhibit intuitive statistical characteristics, which led us to propose a matching score normalization technique to mitigate the uncertainty in the cases of very small overlapping area. With this new technique, we can maintain a high level of accuracy and reliability in our fingerprint matching, even as the size of the database grows rapidly. Our experimental results on 21 datasets containing over 140K fingerprints of various finger poses and impression types show that LDRF outperforms other fixed-length representations and is robust to sensing technologies and impression types. Besides, the proposed matching score normalization effectively reduces the false match rate (FMR) in large-scale identification experiments comprising over 5.11 million fingerprints. Specifically, this technique results in a reduction of two orders of magnitude compared to matching without matching score normalization and five orders of magnitude compared to prior works",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Despite the progress seen in classification methods, current approaches for handling videos with distribution shifts in source and target domains remain source-dependent as they require access to the source data during the adaptation stage. In this paper, we present a self-training based source-free video domain adaptation approach to address this challenge by bridging the gap between the source and the target domains. We use the source pre-trained model to generate pseudo-labels for the target domain samples, which are inevitably noisy. Thus, we treat the problem of source-free video domain adaptation as learning from noisy labels and argue that the samples with correct pseudo-labels can help us in adaptation. To this end, we leverage the cross-entropy loss as an indicator of the correctness of the pseudo-labels and use the resulting small-loss samples from the target domain for fine-tuning the model. We further enhance the adaptation performance by implementing a teacher-student framework, in which the teacher, which is updated gradually, produces reliable pseudo-labels. Meanwhile, the student undergoes fine-tuning on the target domain videos using these generated pseudo-labels to improve its performance.

    "abstract": "Seam-cutting methods have been proven effective in the composition step of image stitching, especially for images with parallax. However, the effectiveness of seam-cutting usually depends on that images can be roughly aligned such that there exists a local region where a plausible seam can be found. For images with large parallax, current alignment methods often fall short of expectations. In this paper, we propose a local alignment and stitching method guided by seam quality evaluation. First, we use existing image alignment and seam-cutting methods to calculate an initial seam and evaluate the quality of pixels along the seam. Then, for pixels with low qualities, we separate their enclosing patches in the aligned images and locally align them by extracting modified dense correspondences via SIFT flow. Finally, we composite the aligned patches via seam-cutting and merge them into the original aligned result to generate the final mosaic. Experiments show that compared with the state-of-the-art seam-cutting methods, our result is more plausible and with fewer artifacts.

    "abstract": "Modeling dynamic, large-scale urban scenes is challenging due to their highly intricate geometric structures and unconstrained dynamics in both space and time. Prior methods often employ high-level architectural priors, separating static and dynamic elements, resulting in suboptimal capture of their synergistic interactions. To address this challenge, we present a unified representation model, called Periodic Vibration Gaussian (PVG). PVG builds upon the efficient 3D Gaussian splatting technique, originally designed for static scene representation, by introducing periodic vibration-based temporal dynamics. This innovation enables PVG to elegantly and uniformly represent the characteristics of various objects and elements in dynamic urban scenes. To enhance temporally coherent representation learning with sparse training data, we introduce a novel flow-based temporal smoothing mechanism and a position-aware adaptive control strategy. Extensive experiments on Waymo Open Dataset and KITTI benchmarks demonstrate that PVG surpasses state-of-the-art alternatives in both reconstruction and novel view synthesis for both dynamic and static scenes. Notably, PVG achieves this without relying on manually labeled object bounding boxes or expensive optical flow estimation. Moreover, PVG exhibits 50/6000-fold acceleration in training/rendering over the best alternative",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Personalized federated learning (pFL) enables collaborative training among multiple clients to enhance the capability of customized local models. In pFL, clients may have heterogeneous (also known as non-IID) data, which poses a key challenge in how to decouple the data knowledge into generic knowledge for global sharing and personalized knowledge for preserving local personalization. A typical way of pFL focuses on label distribution skew, and they adopt a decoupling scheme where the model is split into a common feature extractor and two prediction heads (generic and personalized). However, such a decoupling scheme cannot solve the essential problem of feature skew heterogeneity, because a common feature extractor cannot decouple the generic and personalized features. Therefore, in this paper, we rethink the architecture decoupling design for feature-skew pFL and propose an effective pFL method called FediOS. In FediOS, we reformulate the decoupling into two feature extractors (generic and personalized) and one shared prediction head. Orthogonal projections are used for clients to map the generic features into one common subspace and scatter the personalized features into different subspaces to achieve decoupling for them. In addition, a shared prediction head is trained to balance the importance of generic and personalized features during inference. Extensive experiments on four vision datasets demonstrate our method reaches state-of-the-art pFL performances under feature skew heterogeneity",

Vector-based approaches have recently shown to achieve among the best performances on trajectory prediction benchmarks. These methods model simple interactions between traffic agents but don't distinguish between relation-type and attributes like their distance along the road. Furthermore, they represent lanes only by sequences of vectors representing center lines and ignore context information like lane dividers and other road elements. We present a novel approach for vector-based trajectory prediction that addresses these shortcomings by leveraging three crucial sources of information: First, we model interactions between traffic agents by a semantic scene graph, that accounts for the nature and important features of their relation. Second, we extract agent-centric image-based map features to model the local map context. Finally, we generate anchor paths to enforce the policy in multi-modal prediction to permitted trajectories only. Each of these three enhancements shows advantages over the baseline model HoliGraph",

In this work, we prioritize the refinement of text knowledge to facilitate generalizable video recognition. To address the limitations of the less distinct semantic space of category names, we prompt a large language model (LLM) to augment action class names into Spatio-Temporal Descriptors thus bridging the textual discrepancy and serving as a knowledge base for general recognition. Moreover, to assign the best descriptors with different video instances, we propose Optimal Descriptor Solver, forming the video recognition problem as solving the optimal matching flow across frame-level representations and descriptors.

    "abstract": "Video panoptic segmentation requires consistently segmenting (for both `thing' and `stuff' classes) and tracking objects in a video over time. In this work, we present MaXTron, a general framework that exploits Mask XFormer with Trajectory Attention to tackle the task. MaXTron enriches an off-the-shelf mask transformer by leveraging trajectory attention. The deployed mask transformer takes as input a short clip consisting of only a few frames and predicts the clip-level segmentation. To enhance the temporal consistency, MaXTron employs within-clip and cross-clip tracking modules, efficiently utilizing trajectory attention. Originally designed for video classification, trajectory attention learns to model the temporal correspondences between neighboring frames and aggregates information along the estimated motion paths. However, it is nontrivial to directly extend trajectory attention to the per-pixel dense prediction tasks due to its quadratic dependency on input size. To alleviate the issue, we propose to adapt the trajectory attention for both the dense pixel features and object queries, aiming to improve the short-term and long-term tracking results, respectively. Particularly, in our within-clip tracking module, we propose axial-trajectory attention that effectively computes the trajectory attention for tracking dense pixels sequentially along the height- and width-axes. The axial decomposition significantly reduces the computational complexity for dense pixel features. In our cross-clip tracking module, since the object queries in mask transformer are learned to encode the object information, we are able to capture the long-term temporal connections by applying trajectory attention to object queries, which learns to track each object across different clips. Without bells and whistles, MaXTron demonstrates state-of-the-art performances on video segmentation benchmarks",

However, these numerical methods inherently result in certain approximation errors, which significantly degrades sample quality with extremely small NFE (e.g., around 5). In contrast, based on the geometric observation that each sampling trajectory almost lies in a two-dimensional subspace embedded in the ambient space, we propose Approximate MEan-Direction Solver (AMED-Solver) that eliminates truncation errors by directly learning the mean direction for fast diffusion sampling. Besides, our method can be easily used as a plugin to further improve existing ODE-based samplers. Extensive experiments on image synthesis with the resolution ranging from 32 to 256 demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. With only 5 NFE, we achieve 7.14 FID on CIFAR-10, 13.75 FID on ImageNet 64$\\times$64, and 12.79 FID on LSUN Bedroom. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhyzhouu/amed-solver",

    "title": "Color-Emotion Associations in Art: Fuzzy Approach",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Art objects can evoke certain emotions. Color is a fundamental element of visual art and plays a significant role in how art is perceived. This paper introduces a novel approach to classifying emotions in art using Fuzzy Sets. We employ a fuzzy approach because it aligns well with human judgments' imprecise and subjective nature. Extensive fuzzy colors (n=120) and a broad emotional spectrum (n=10) allow for a more human-consistent and context-aware exploration of emotions inherent in paintings. First, we introduce the fuzzy color representation model. Then, at the fuzzification stage, we process the Wiki Art Dataset of paintings tagged with emotions, extracting fuzzy dominant colors linked to specific emotions. This results in fuzzy color distributions for ten emotions. Finally, we convert them back to a crisp domain, obtaining a knowledge base of color-emotion associations in primary colors. Our findings reveal strong associations between specific emotions and colors; for instance, gratitude strongly correlates with green, brown, and orange. Other noteworthy associations include brown and anger, orange with shame, yellow with happiness, and gray with fear. Using these associations and Jaccard similarity, we can find the emotions in the arbitrary untagged image. We conducted a 2AFC experiment involving human subjects to evaluate the proposed method. The average hit rate of 0.77 indicates a significant correlation between the method's predictions and human perception. The proposed method is simple to adapt to art painting retrieval systems. The study contributes to the theoretical understanding of color-emotion associations in art, offering valuable insights for various practical applications besides art, like marketing, design, and psychology",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "This paper revisits the pipeline for detecting objects in images with proposals. For any object detector, the obtained box proposals or queries need to be classified and regressed towards ground truth boxes. The common solution for the final predictions is to directly maximize the overlap between each proposal and the ground truth box, followed by a winner-takes-all ranking or non-maximum suppression. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective alternative. For proposal regression, we solve a simpler problem where we regress to the area of intersection between proposal and ground truth. In this way, each proposal only specifies which part contains the object, avoiding a blind inpainting problem where proposals need to be regressed beyond their visual scope. In turn, we replace the winner-takes-all strategy and obtain the final prediction by taking the union over the regressed intersections of a proposal group surrounding an object. Our revisited approach comes with minimal changes to the detection pipeline and can be plugged into any existing method. We show that our approach directly improves canonical object detection and instance segmentation architectures, highlighting the utility of intersection-based regression and grouping",

    "abstract": "It is well known the adversarial optimization of GAN-based image super-resolution (SR) methods makes the preceding SR model generate unpleasant and undesirable artifacts, leading to large distortion. We attribute the cause of such distortions to the poor calibration of the discriminator, which hampers its ability to provide meaningful feedback to the generator for learning high-quality images. To address this problem, we propose a simple but non-travel diffusion-style data augmentation scheme for current GAN-based SR methods, known as DifAugGAN. It involves adapting the diffusion process in generative diffusion models for improving the calibration of the discriminator during training motivated by the successes of data augmentation schemes in the field to achieve good calibration. Our DifAugGAN can be a Plug-and-Play strategy for current GAN-based SISR methods to improve the calibration of the discriminator and thus improve SR performance.

    "abstract": "Optic disc and cup segmentation play a crucial role in automating the screening and diagnosis of optic glaucoma. While data-driven convolutional neural networks (CNNs) show promise in this area, the inherent ambiguity of segmenting object and background boundaries in the task of optic disc and cup segmentation leads to noisy annotations that impact model performance. To address this, we propose an innovative label-denoising method of Multiple Pseudo-labels Noise-aware Network (MPNN) for accurate optic disc and cup segmentation. Specifically, the Multiple Pseudo-labels Generation and Guided Denoising (MPGGD) module generates pseudo-labels by multiple different initialization networks trained on true labels, and the pixel-level consensus information extracted from these pseudo-labels guides to differentiate clean pixels from noisy pixels. The training framework of the MPNN is constructed by a teacher-student architecture to learn segmentation from clean pixels and noisy pixels. Particularly, such a framework adeptly leverages (i) reliable and fundamental insights from clean pixels and (ii) the supplementary knowledge within noisy pixels via multiple perturbation-based unsupervised consistency. Compared to other label-denoising methods, comprehensive experimental results on the RIGA dataset demonstrate our method's excellent performance and significant denoising ability",

Despite significant progress in implicit shape reconstruction, state-of-the-art mesh extraction methods often produce aliased, perceptually distorted surfaces and lack scalability to high-resolution 3D shapes. We present a data-driven approach for automatic feature detection and remeshing that requires only a coarse, aliased mesh as input and scales to arbitrary resolution reconstructions. We define and learn a collection of surface-based fields to (1) capture sharp geometric features in the shape with an implicit vertexwise model and (2) approximate improvements in normals alignment obtained by applying edge-flips with an edgewise model. To support scaling to arbitrary complexity shapes, we learn our fields using local triangulated patches, fusing estimates on complete surface meshes. Our feature remeshing algorithm integrates the learned fields as sharp feature priors and optimizes vertex placement and mesh connectivity for maximum expected surface improvement. On a challenging collection of high-resolution shape reconstructions in the ABC dataset, our algorithm improves over state-of-the-art by 26% normals F-score and 42% perceptual $\\text{RMSE}_{\\text{v}}$",

In this paper, we propose an adaptive multi-modality prompt learning to address the above issues. To do this, we employ previous text prompt learning and propose a new image prompt learning. The image prompt learning achieves in-sample and out-of-sample generalization, by first masking meaningless patches and then padding them with the learnable parameters and the information from texts. Moreover, each of the prompts provides auxiliary information to each other, further strengthening these two kinds of generalization.

This paper proposes ZeST-NeRF, a new approach that can produce temporal NeRFs for new scenes without retraining. We can accurately reconstruct novel views using multi-view synthesis techniques and scene flow-field estimation, trained only with unrelated scenes.

    "abstract": "Open-vocabulary querying in 3D space is challenging but essential for scene understanding tasks such as object localization and segmentation. Language-embedded scene representations have made progress by incorporating language features into 3D spaces. However, their efficacy heavily depends on neural networks that are resource-intensive in training and rendering. Although recent 3D Gaussians offer efficient and high-quality novel view synthesis, directly embedding language features in them leads to prohibitive memory usage and decreased performance. In this work, we introduce Language Embedded 3D Gaussians, a novel scene representation for open-vocabulary query tasks. Instead of embedding high-dimensional raw semantic features on 3D Gaussians, we propose a dedicated quantization scheme that drastically alleviates the memory requirement, and a novel embedding procedure that achieves smoother yet high accuracy query, countering the multi-view feature inconsistencies and the high-frequency inductive bias in point-based representations. Our comprehensive experiments show that our representation achieves the best visual quality and language querying accuracy across current language-embedded representations, while maintaining real-time rendering frame rates on a single desktop GPU",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Prototypical-part interpretable methods, e.g., ProtoPNet, enhance interpretability by connecting classification predictions to class-specific training prototypes, thereby offering an intuitive insight into their decision-making. Current methods rely on a discriminative classifier trained with point-based learning techniques that provide specific values for prototypes. Such prototypes have relatively low representation power due to their sparsity and potential redundancy, with each prototype containing no variability measure. In this paper, we present a new generative learning of prototype distributions, named Mixture of Gaussian-distributed Prototypes (MGProto), which are represented by Gaussian mixture models (GMM). Such an approach enables the learning of more powerful prototype representations since each learned prototype will own a measure of variability, which naturally reduces the sparsity given the spread of the distribution around each prototype, and we also integrate a prototype diversity objective function into the GMM optimisation to reduce redundancy. Incidentally, the generative nature of MGProto offers a new and effective way for detecting out-of-distribution samples. To improve the compactness of MGProto, we further propose to prune Gaussian-distributed prototypes with a low prior. Experiments on CUB-200-2011, Stanford Cars, Stanford Dogs, and Oxford-IIIT Pets datasets show that MGProto achieves state-of-the-art classification and OoD detection performances with encouraging interpretability results",

We develop a compositional articulated implicit model that can reconstruct disentangled 3D hand and object from 2D images.

The LRDiff framework constructs an image-rendering process with multiple layers, each of which applies the vision guidance to instructively estimate the denoising direction for a single object. Such a layered rendering strategy effectively prevents issues like unintended conceptual blending or mismatches, while allowing for more coherent and contextually accurate image synthesis. The proposed method provides a more efficient and accurate means of synthesising images that align with specific spatial and contextual requirements.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Event cameras have emerged as a promising vision sensor in recent years due to their unparalleled temporal resolution and dynamic range. While registration of 2D RGB images to 3D point clouds is a long-standing problem in computer vision, no prior work studies 2D-3D registration for event cameras. To this end, we propose E2PNet, the first learning-based method for event-to-point cloud registration. The core of E2PNet is a novel feature representation network called Event-Points-to-Tensor (EP2T), which encodes event data into a 2D grid-shaped feature tensor. This grid-shaped feature enables matured RGB-based frameworks to be easily used for event-to-point cloud registration, without changing hyper-parameters and the training procedure. EP2T treats the event input as spatio-temporal point clouds. Unlike standard 3D learning architectures that treat all dimensions of point clouds equally, the novel sampling and information aggregation modules in EP2T are designed to handle the inhomogeneity of the spatial and temporal dimensions. Experiments on the MVSEC and VECtor datasets demonstrate the superiority of E2PNet over hand-crafted and other learning-based methods. Compared to RGB-based registration, E2PNet is more robust to extreme illumination or fast motion due to the use of event data. Beyond 2D-3D registration, we also show the potential of EP2T for other vision tasks such as flow estimation, event-to-image reconstruction and object recognition.

    "abstract": "Enhancing the domain generalization performance of Face Anti-Spoofing (FAS) techniques has emerged as a research focus. Existing methods are dedicated to extracting domain-invariant features from various training domains. Despite the promising performance, the extracted features inevitably contain residual style feature bias (e.g., illumination, capture device), resulting in inferior generalization performance. In this paper, we propose an alternative and effective solution, the Textually Guided Domain Generalization (TeG-DG) framework, which can effectively leverage text information for cross-domain alignment. Our core insight is that text, as a more abstract and universal form of expression, can capture the commonalities and essential characteristics across various attacks, bridging the gap between different image domains. Contrary to existing vision-language models, the proposed framework is elaborately designed to enhance the domain generalization ability of the FAS task. Concretely, we first design a Hierarchical Attention Fusion (HAF) module to enable adaptive aggregation of visual features at different levels; Then, a Textual-Enhanced Visual Discriminator (TEVD) is proposed for not only better alignment between the two modalities but also to regularize the classifier with unbiased text features. TeG-DG significantly outperforms previous approaches, especially in situations with extremely limited source domain data (~14% and ~12% improvements on HTER and AUC respectively), showcasing impressive few-shot performance",

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) dominate the research field in image-based virtual try-on, but have not resolved problems such as unnatural deformation of garments and the blurry generation quality. Recently, diffusion models have emerged with surprising performance across various image generation tasks. While the generative quality of diffusion models is impressive, achieving controllability poses a significant challenge when applying it to virtual try-on tasks and multiple denoising iterations limit its potential for real-time applications. In this paper, we propose Controllable Accelerated virtual Try-on with Diffusion Model called CAT-DM. To enhance the controllability, a basic diffusion-based virtual try-on network is designed, which utilizes ControlNet to introduce additional control conditions and improves the feature extraction of garment images. In terms of acceleration, CAT-DM initiates a reverse denoising process with an implicit distribution generated by a pre-trained GAN-based model. Compared with previous try-on methods based on diffusion models, CAT-DM not only retains the pattern and texture details of the in-shop garment but also reduces the sampling steps without compromising generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of CAT-DM against both GAN-based and diffusion-based methods in producing more realistic images and accurately reproducing garment patterns.

    "title": "Corrupting Convolution-based Unlearnable Datasets with Pixel-based Image Transformations",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Unlearnable datasets lead to a drastic drop in the generalization performance of models trained on them by introducing elaborate and imperceptible perturbations into clean training sets. Many existing defenses, e.g., JPEG compression and adversarial training, effectively counter UDs based on norm-constrained additive noise. However, a fire-new type of convolution-based UDs have been proposed and render existing defenses all ineffective, presenting a greater challenge to defenders. To address this, we express the convolution-based unlearnable sample as the result of multiplying a matrix by a clean sample in a simplified scenario, and formalize the intra-class matrix inconsistency as $\\Theta_{imi}$, inter-class matrix consistency as $\\Theta_{imc}$ to investigate the working mechanism of the convolution-based UDs. We conjecture that increasing both of these metrics will mitigate the unlearnability effect. Through validation experiments that commendably support our hypothesis, we further design a random matrix to boost both $\\Theta_{imi}$ and $\\Theta_{imc}$, achieving a notable degree of defense effect. Hence, by building upon and extending these facts, we first propose a brand-new image COrruption that employs randomly multiplicative transformation via INterpolation operation to successfully defend against convolution-based UDs. Our approach leverages global pixel random interpolations, effectively suppressing the impact of multiplicative noise in convolution-based UDs. Additionally, we have also designed two new forms of convolution-based UDs, and find that our defense is the most effective against them",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Large-scale pre-trained models have demonstrated impressive performance in vision and language tasks within open-world scenarios. Due to the lack of comparable pre-trained models for 3D shapes, recent methods utilize language-image pre-training to realize zero-shot 3D shape recognition. However, due to the modality gap, pretrained language-image models are not confident enough in the generalization to 3D shape recognition. Consequently, this paper aims to improve the confidence with view selection and hierarchical prompts. Leveraging the CLIP model as an example, we employ view selection on the vision side by identifying views with high prediction confidence from multiple rendered views of a 3D shape. On the textual side, the strategy of hierarchical prompts is proposed for the first time. The first layer prompts several classification candidates with traditional class-level descriptions, while the second layer refines the prediction based on function-level descriptions or further distinctions between the candidates. Remarkably, without the need for additional training, our proposed method achieves impressive zero-shot 3D classification accuracies of 84.44\\%, 91.51\\%, and 66.17\\% on ModelNet40, ModelNet10, and ShapeNet Core55, respectively.

    "abstract": "Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) are a key component in modern generative models. DPM-solvers have achieved reduced latency and enhanced quality significantly, but have posed challenges to find the exact inverse (i.e., finding the initial noise from the given image). Here we investigate the exact inversions for DPM-solvers and propose algorithms to perform them when samples are generated by the first-order as well as higher-order DPM-solvers. For each explicit denoising step in DPM-solvers, we formulated the inversions using implicit methods such as gradient descent or forward step method to ensure the robustness to large classifier-free guidance unlike the prior approach using fixed-point iteration. Experimental results demonstrated that our proposed exact inversion methods significantly reduced the error of both image and noise reconstructions, greatly enhanced the ability to distinguish invisible watermarks and well prevented unintended background changes consistently during image editing.

    "abstract": "Early detection and assessment of polyps play a crucial role in the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC). Polyp segmentation provides an effective solution to assist clinicians in accurately locating and segmenting polyp regions. In the past, people often relied on manually extracted lower-level features such as color, texture, and shape, which often had issues capturing global context and lacked robustness to complex scenarios. With the advent of deep learning, more and more outstanding medical image segmentation algorithms based on deep learning networks have emerged, making significant progress in this field. This paper provides a comprehensive review of polyp segmentation algorithms. We first review some traditional algorithms based on manually extracted features and deep segmentation algorithms, then detail benchmark datasets related to the topic. Specifically, we carry out a comprehensive evaluation of recent deep learning models and results based on polyp sizes, considering the pain points of research topics and differences in network structures. Finally, we discuss the challenges of polyp segmentation and future trends in this field.

    "title": "Each Test Image Deserves A Specific Prompt: Continual Test-Time Adaptation for 2D Medical Image Segmentation",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Distribution shift widely exists in medical images acquired from different medical centres and poses a significant obstacle to deploying the pre-trained semantic segmentation model in real-world applications. Test-time adaptation has proven its effectiveness in tackling the cross-domain distribution shift during inference. However, most existing methods achieve adaptation by updating the pre-trained models, rendering them susceptible to error accumulation and catastrophic forgetting when encountering a series of distribution shifts (i.e., under the continual test-time adaptation setup). To overcome these challenges caused by updating the models, in this paper, we freeze the pre-trained model and propose the Visual Prompt-based Test-Time Adaptation (VPTTA) method to train a specific prompt for each test image to align the statistics in the batch normalization layers. Specifically, we present the low-frequency prompt, which is lightweight with only a few parameters and can be effectively trained in a single iteration. To enhance prompt initialization, we equip VPTTA with a memory bank to benefit the current prompt from previous ones. Additionally, we design a warm-up mechanism, which mixes source and target statistics to construct warm-up statistics, thereby facilitating the training process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our VPTTA over other state-of-the-art methods on two medical image segmentation benchmark tasks.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Few-shot object detection (FSOD) aims to extract semantic knowledge from limited object instances of novel categories within a target domain. Recent advances in FSOD focus on fine-tuning the base model based on a few objects via meta-learning or data augmentation. Despite their success, the majority of them are grounded with parametric readjustment to generalize on novel objects, which face considerable challenges in Industry 5.0, such as (i) a certain amount of fine-tuning time is required, and (ii) the parameters of the constructed model being unavailable due to the privilege protection, making the fine-tuning fail. Such constraints naturally limit its application in scenarios with real-time configuration requirements or within black-box settings. To tackle the challenges mentioned above, we formalize a novel FSOD task, referred to as Test TIme Few Shot DEtection (TIDE), where the model is un-tuned in the configuration procedure. To that end, we introduce an asymmetric architecture for learning a support-instance-guided dynamic category classifier. Further, a cross-attention module and a multi-scale resizer are provided to enhance the model performance. Experimental results on multiple few-shot object detection platforms reveal that the proposed TIDE significantly outperforms existing contemporary methods.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Anomaly detection (AD) is a fundamental task in computer vision. It aims to identify incorrect image data patterns which deviate from the normal ones. Conventional methods generally address AD by preparing augmented negative samples to enforce self-supervised learning. However, these techniques typically do not consider semantics during augmentation, leading to the generation of unrealistic or invalid negative samples. Consequently, the feature extraction network can be hindered from embedding critical features. In this study, inspired by visual attention learning approaches, we propose CutSwap, which leverages saliency guidance to incorporate semantic cues for augmentation. Specifically, we first employ LayerCAM to extract multilevel image features as saliency maps and then perform clustering to obtain multiple centroids. To fully exploit saliency guidance, on each map, we select a pixel pair from the cluster with the highest centroid saliency to form a patch pair. Such a patch pair includes highly similar context information with dense semantic correlations. The resulting negative sample is created by swapping the locations of the patch pair. Compared to prior augmentation methods, CutSwap generates more subtle yet realistic negative samples to facilitate quality feature learning. Extensive experimental and ablative evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art AD performance on two mainstream AD benchmark datasets",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Deep neural networks have shown exemplary performance on semantic scene understanding tasks on source domains, but due to the absence of style diversity during training, enhancing performance on unseen target domains using only single source domain data remains a challenging task. Generation of simulated data is a feasible alternative to retrieving large style-diverse real-world datasets as it is a cumbersome and budget-intensive process. However, the large domain-specific inconsistencies between simulated and real-world data pose a significant generalization challenge in semantic segmentation. In this work, to alleviate this problem, we propose a novel MultiResolution Feature Perturbation (MRFP) technique to randomize domain-specific fine-grained features and perturb style of coarse features. Our experimental results on various urban-scene segmentation datasets clearly indicate that, along with the perturbation of style-information, perturbation of fine-feature components is paramount to learn domain invariant robust feature maps for semantic segmentation models. MRFP is a simple and computationally efficient, transferable module with no additional learnable parameters or objective functions, that helps state-of-the-art deep neural networks to learn robust domain invariant features for simulation-to-real semantic segmentation",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) have achieved impressive view synthesis results by learning an implicit volumetric representation from multi-view images. To project the implicit representation into an image, NeRF employs volume rendering that approximates the continuous integrals of rays as an accumulation of the colors and densities of the sampled points. Although this approximation enables efficient rendering, it ignores the direction information in point intervals, resulting in ambiguous features and limited reconstruction quality. In this paper, we propose an anisotropic neural representation learning method that utilizes learnable view-dependent features to improve scene representation and reconstruction. We model the volumetric function as spherical harmonic (SH)-guided anisotropic features, parameterized by multilayer perceptrons, facilitating ambiguity elimination while preserving the rendering efficiency. To achieve robust scene reconstruction without anisotropy overfitting, we regularize the energy of the anisotropic features during training. Our method is flexiable and can be plugged into NeRF-based frameworks. Extensive experiments show that the proposed representation can boost the rendering quality of various NeRFs and achieve state-of-the-art rendering performance on both synthetic and real-world scenes",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In recent times, automatic text-to-3D content creation has made significant progress, driven by the development of pretrained 2D diffusion models. Existing text-to-3D methods typically optimize the 3D representation to ensure that the rendered image aligns well with the given text, as evaluated by the pretrained 2D diffusion model. Nevertheless, a substantial domain gap exists between 2D images and 3D assets, primarily attributed to variations in camera-related attributes and the exclusive presence of foreground objects. Consequently, employing 2D diffusion models directly for optimizing 3D representations may lead to suboptimal outcomes. To address this issue, we present X-Dreamer, a novel approach for high-quality text-to-3D content creation that effectively bridges the gap between text-to-2D and text-to-3D synthesis. The key components of X-Dreamer are two innovative designs: Camera-Guided Low-Rank Adaptation (CG-LoRA) and Attention-Mask Alignment (AMA) Loss. CG-LoRA dynamically incorporates camera information into the pretrained diffusion models by employing camera-dependent generation for trainable parameters. This integration enhances the alignment between the generated 3D assets and the camera's perspective. AMA loss guides the attention map of the pretrained diffusion model using the binary mask of the 3D object, prioritizing the creation of the foreground object. This module ensures that the model focuses on generating accurate and detailed foreground objects.

Some recent fine-tuning methods have made it feasible for individuals to implant personalized concepts onto the basic Stable Diffusion model with minimal computational costs on small datasets. However, these innovations have also given rise to issues like facial privacy forgery and artistic copyright infringement. In recent studies, researchers have explored the addition of imperceptible adversarial perturbations to images to prevent potential unauthorized exploitation and infringements when personal data is used for fine-tuning Stable Diffusion. Although these studies have demonstrated the ability to protect images, it is essential to consider that these methods may not be entirely applicable in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the use of perturbations to protect images within a practical threat model. The results suggest that these approaches may not be sufficient to safeguard image privacy and copyright effectively. Furthermore, we introduce a purification method capable of removing protected perturbations while preserving the original image structure to the greatest extent possible.

    "abstract": "Temporal sentence grounding aims to localize moments relevant to a language description. Recently, DETR-like approaches have shown notable progress by decoding the center and length of a target moment from learnable queries. However, they suffer from the issue of center misalignment raised by the inherent ambiguity of moment centers, leading to inaccurate predictions. To remedy this problem, we introduce a novel boundary-oriented moment formulation. In our paradigm, the model no longer needs to find the precise center but instead suffices to predict any anchor point within the interval, from which the onset and offset are directly estimated. Based on this idea, we design a Boundary-Aligned Moment Detection Transformer (BAM-DETR), equipped with a dual-pathway decoding process. Specifically, it refines the anchor and boundaries within parallel pathways using global and boundary-focused attention, respectively. This separate design allows the model to focus on desirable regions, enabling precise refinement of moment predictions. Further, we propose a quality-based ranking method, ensuring that proposals with high localization qualities are prioritized over incomplete ones.

We jointly train motion autoencoders for both animal and human motions and at the same time optimize through the similarity scores among human motion encoding, animal motion encoding, and text CLIP embedding. Presenting the first solution to this problem, we are able to generate animal motions with high diversity and fidelity, quantitatively and qualitatively outperforming the results of training human motion generation baselines on animal data.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Human visual recognition system shows astonishing capability of compressing visual information into a set of tokens containing rich representations without label supervision. One critical driving principle behind it is perceptual grouping. Despite being widely used in computer vision in the early 2010s, it remains a mystery whether perceptual grouping can be leveraged to derive a neural visual recognition backbone that generates as powerful representations. In this paper, we propose the Perceptual Group Tokenizer, a model that entirely relies on grouping operations to extract visual features and perform self-supervised representation learning, where a series of grouping operations are used to iteratively hypothesize the context for pixels or superpixels to refine feature representations. We show that the proposed model can achieve competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art vision architectures, and inherits desirable properties including adaptive computation without re-training, and interpretability. Specifically, Perceptual Group Tokenizer achieves 80.3% on ImageNet-1K self-supervised learning benchmark with linear probe evaluation, marking a new progress under this paradigm",

    "title": "TLDR: Text Based Last-layer Retraining for Debiasing Image Classifiers",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "A classifier may depend on incidental features stemming from a strong correlation between the feature and the classification target in the training dataset. Recently, Last Layer Retraining (LLR) with group-balanced datasets is known to be efficient in mitigating the spurious correlation of classifiers. However, the acquisition of group-balanced datasets is costly, which hinders the applicability of the LLR method. In this work, we propose to perform LLR based on text datasets built with large language models for a general image classifier. We demonstrate that text can be a proxy for its corresponding image beyond the image-text joint embedding space, such as CLIP. Based on this, we use generated texts to train the final layer in the embedding space of the arbitrary image classifier. In addition, we propose a method of filtering the generated words to get rid of noisy, imprecise words, which reduces the effort of inspecting each word. We dub these procedures as TLDR (\\textbf{T}ext-based \\textbf{L}ast layer retraining for \\textbf{D}ebiasing image classifie\\textbf{R}s) and show our method achieves the performance that is comparable to those of the LLR methods that also utilize group-balanced image dataset for retraining. Furthermore, TLDR outperforms other baselines that involve training the last linear layer without a group annotated dataset",

However, existing methods still struggle to maintain consistency across time, expression, and view or require specific data prerequisites. To solve these challenging problems, we propose CosAvatar, a high-quality and user-friendly framework for portrait tuning. With only monocular video and text instructions as input, we can produce animatable portraits with both temporal and 3D consistency. Different from methods that directly edit in the 2D domain, we employ a dynamic NeRF-based 3D portrait representation to model both the head and torso. We alternate between editing the video frames' dataset and updating the underlying 3D portrait until the edited frames reach 3D consistency. Additionally, we integrate the semantic portrait priors to enhance the edited results, allowing precise modifications in specified semantic areas. Extensive results demonstrate that our proposed method can not only accurately edit portrait styles or local attributes based on text instructions but also support expressive animation driven by a source video",

DSL modifies a traditional projector-camera system by placing a sub-millimeter thick diffraction grating film front of the projector. The grating disperses structured light based on light wavelength. To utilize the dispersed structured light, we devise a model for dispersive projection image formation and a per-pixel hyperspectral 3D reconstruction method. We validate DSL by instantiating a compact experimental prototype. DSL achieves spectral accuracy of 18.8nm full-width half-maximum (FWHM) and depth error of 1mm. We demonstrate that DSL outperforms prior work on practical hyperspectral 3D imaging.

    "title": "SimulFlow: Simultaneously Extracting Feature and Identifying Target for Unsupervised Video Object Segmentation",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Unsupervised video object segmentation (UVOS) aims at detecting the primary objects in a given video sequence without any human interposing. Most existing methods rely on two-stream architectures that separately encode the appearance and motion information before fusing them to identify the target and generate object masks. However, this pipeline is computationally expensive and can lead to suboptimal performance due to the difficulty of fusing the two modalities properly. In this paper, we propose a novel UVOS model called SimulFlow that simultaneously performs feature extraction and target identification, enabling efficient and effective unsupervised video object segmentation. Concretely, we design a novel SimulFlow Attention mechanism to bridege the image and motion by utilizing the flexibility of attention operation, where coarse masks predicted from fused feature at each stage are used to constrain the attention operation within the mask area and exclude the impact of noise. Because of the bidirectional information flow between visual and optical flow features in SimulFlow Attention, no extra hand-designed fusing module is required and we only adopt a light decoder to obtain the final prediction. We evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets and achieve state-of-the-art results. Our proposed approach not only outperforms existing methods but also addresses the computational complexity and fusion difficulties caused by two-stream architectures. Our models achieve 87.4% J & F on DAVIS-16 with the highest speed (63.7 FPS on a 3090) and the lowest parameters (13.7 M).

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) present a promising alternative to CNNs and transformers in certain image processing applications due to their parameter-efficiency in modeling spatial relationships. Currently, a major area of research involves the converting non-graph input data for GNN-based models, notably in scenarios where the data originates from images. One approach involves converting images into nodes by identifying significant keypoints within them. Super-Retina, a semi-supervised technique, has been utilized for detecting keypoints in retinal images. However, its limitations lie in the dependency on a small initial set of ground truth keypoints, which is progressively expanded to detect more keypoints. Having encountered difficulties in detecting consistent initial keypoints in brain images using SIFT and LoFTR, we proposed a new approach: radiomic feature-based keypoint detection. Demonstrating the anatomical significance of the detected keypoints was achieved by showcasing their efficacy in improving registration processes guided by these keypoints. Subsequently, these keypoints were employed as the ground truth for the keypoint detection method (LK-SuperRetina). Furthermore, the study showcases the application of GNNs in image matching, highlighting their superior performance in terms of both the number of good matches and confidence scores. This research sets the stage for expanding GNN applications into various other applications, including but not limited to image classification, segmentation, and registration",

Our system consists of the following key components: (1) Gloss matching: a pretrained bi-encoder model is used to match contexts with proper senses of the target words; (2) Prompting: matched glosses and other textual information, such as synonyms, are incorporated using a prompting template; (3) Image retrieval: semantically matching images are retrieved from large open datasets using prompts as queries; (4) Modality fusion: contextual information from different modalities are fused and used for prediction. Although our system does not produce the most competitive results at SemEval-2023 Task 1, we are still able to beat nearly half of the teams.

    "abstract": "Continual test-time adaptation (cTTA) methods are designed to facilitate the continual adaptation of models to dynamically changing real-world environments where computational resources are limited. Due to this inherent limitation, existing approaches fail to simultaneously achieve accuracy and efficiency. In detail, when using a single image, the instability caused by batch normalization layers and entropy loss significantly destabilizes many existing methods in real-world cTTA scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we present BESTTA, a novel single image continual test-time adaptation method guided by style transfer, which enables stable and efficient adaptation to the target environment by transferring the style of the input image to the source style. To implement the proposed method, we devise BeIN, a simple yet powerful normalization method, along with the style-guided losses. We demonstrate that BESTTA effectively adapts to the continually changing target environment, leveraging only a single image on both semantic segmentation and image classification tasks. Remarkably, despite training only two parameters in a BeIN layer consuming the least memory, BESTTA outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of performance",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Replay-based methods in class-incremental learning (CIL) have attained remarkable success, as replaying the exemplars of old classes can significantly mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Despite their effectiveness, the inherent memory restrictions of CIL result in saving a limited number of exemplars with poor diversity, leading to data imbalance and overfitting issues. In this paper, we introduce a novel exemplar super-compression and regeneration method, ESCORT, which substantially increases the quantity and enhances the diversity of exemplars. Rather than storing past images, we compress images into visual and textual prompts, e.g., edge maps and class tags, and save the prompts instead, reducing the memory usage of each exemplar to 1/24 of the original size. In subsequent learning phases, diverse high-resolution exemplars are generated from the prompts by a pre-trained diffusion model, e.g., ControlNet. To minimize the domain gap between generated exemplars and real images, we propose partial compression and diffusion-based data augmentation, allowing us to utilize an off-the-shelf diffusion model without fine-tuning it on the target dataset. Therefore, the same diffusion model can be downloaded whenever it is needed, incurring no memory consumption. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves model performance across multiple CIL benchmarks, e.g., 5.0 percentage points higher than the previous state-of-the-art on 10-phase Caltech-256 dataset",

In this study, we consider 6 brain networks spanning over 160 ROIs derived from Dosenbach template, where each network consists of 25-30 ROIs. Recurrence plot, extensively used to understand evolution of time series, is employed. Representative time series at each ROI is converted to its corresponding recurrence plot visualization, which is subsequently condensed to low-dimensional feature embeddings through Autoencoders. The performance of the proposed method is shown on fMRI volumes of 100 subjects (balanced data), taken from publicly available ADNI dataset.

    "abstract": "Radiology reports are an instrumental part of modern medicine, informing key clinical decisions such as diagnosis and treatment. The worldwide shortage of radiologists, however, restricts access to expert care and imposes heavy workloads, contributing to avoidable errors and delays in report delivery. While recent progress in automated report generation with vision-language models offer clear potential in ameliorating the situation, the path to real-world adoption has been stymied by the challenge of evaluating the clinical quality of AI-generated reports. In this study, we build a state-of-the-art report generation system for chest radiographs, Flamingo-CXR, by fine-tuning a well-known vision-language foundation model on radiology data. To evaluate the quality of the AI-generated reports, a group of 16 certified radiologists provide detailed evaluations of AI-generated and human written reports for chest X-rays from an intensive care setting in the United States and an inpatient setting in India. At least one radiologist (out of two per case) preferred the AI report to the ground truth report in over 60$\\%$ of cases for both datasets. Amongst the subset of AI-generated reports that contain errors, the most frequently cited reasons were related to the location and finding, whereas for human written reports, most mistakes were related to severity and finding. This disparity suggested potential complementarity between our AI system and human experts, prompting us to develop an assistive scenario in which Flamingo-CXR generates a first-draft report, which is subsequently revised by a clinician. This is the first demonstration of clinician-AI collaboration for report writing, and the resultant reports are assessed to be equivalent or preferred by at least one radiologist to reports written by experts alone in 80$\\%$ of in-patient cases and 66$\\%$ of intensive care cases",

However, their application at high resolutions presents significant computational challenges. Current methods, such as patchifying, expedite processes in UNet and Transformer architectures but at the expense of representational capacity. Addressing this, we introduce the Diffusion State Space Model (DiffuSSM), an architecture that supplants attention mechanisms with a more scalable state space model backbone. This approach effectively handles higher resolutions without resorting to global compression, thus preserving detailed image representation throughout the diffusion process. Our focus on FLOP-efficient architectures in diffusion training marks a significant step forward. Comprehensive evaluations on both ImageNet and LSUN datasets at two resolutions demonstrate that DiffuSSMs are on par or even outperform existing diffusion models with attention modules in FID and Inception Score metrics while significantly reducing total FLOP usage",

By incorporating few-shot domain adaptation and class-incremental learning, the network's ability to adapt to new users and extend to new task-specific classes is significantly enhanced. Results from experiments conducted on both the proposed dataset and the SPG dataset illustrate the superior performance of the proposed architecture.

    "abstract": "The aging population of the U.S. drives the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease. Brookmeyer et al. forecasts approximately 15 million Americans will have either clinical AD or mild cognitive impairment by 2060. In response to this urgent call, methods for early detection of Alzheimer's disease have been developed for prevention and pre-treatment. Notably, literature on the application of deep learning in the automatic detection of the disease has been proliferating. This study builds upon previous literature and maintains a focus on leveraging multi-modal information to enhance automatic detection. We aim to predict the stage of the disease - Cognitively Normal (CN), Mildly Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's Disease (AD), based on two different types of brain MRI scans. We design an AlexNet-based deep learning model that learns the synergy of complementary information from both T1 and FLAIR MRI scans",

    "abstract": "Image steganography, the practice of concealing information within another image, traditionally faces security challenges when its methods become publicly known. To counteract this, we introduce a novel private key-based image steganography technique. This approach ensures the security of hidden information, requiring a corresponding private key for access, irrespective of the public knowledge of the steganography method. We present experimental evidence demonstrating our method's effectiveness, showcasing its real-world applicability. Additionally, we identified a critical challenge in the invertible image steganography process: the transfer of non-essential, or `garbage', information from the secret to the host pipeline. To address this, we introduced the decay weight to control the information transfer, filtering out irrelevant data and enhancing the performance of image steganography.

    "abstract": "Large Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) pretrained on massive datasets exhibit impressive performance on various downstream tasks, especially with limited labeled target data. However, due to their high memory and compute requirements, these models cannot be deployed in resource constrained settings. This raises an important question: How can we utilize the knowledge from a large VFM to train a small task-specific model for a new target task with limited labeled training data? In this work, we answer this question by proposing a simple and highly effective task-oriented knowledge transfer approach to leverage pretrained VFMs for effective training of small task-specific models. Our experimental results on four target tasks under limited labeled data settings show that the proposed knowledge transfer approach outperforms task-agnostic VFM distillation, web-scale CLIP pretraining and supervised ImageNet pretraining by 1-10.5%, 2-22% and 2-14%, respectively. We also show that the dataset used for transferring knowledge has a significant effect on the final target task performance, and propose an image retrieval-based approach for curating effective transfer sets",

    "abstract": "Prompt tuning represents a valuable technique for adapting pre-trained visual-language models (VLM) to various downstream tasks. Recent advancements in CoOp-based methods propose a set of learnable domain-shared or image-conditional textual tokens to facilitate the generation of task-specific textual classifiers. However, those textual tokens have a limited generalization ability regarding unseen domains, as they cannot dynamically adjust to the distribution of testing classes. To tackle this issue, we present a novel Textual-based Class-aware Prompt tuning(TCP) that explicitly incorporates prior knowledge about classes to enhance their discriminability. The critical concept of TCP involves leveraging Textual Knowledge Embedding (TKE) to map the high generalizability of class-level textual knowledge into class-aware textual tokens. By seamlessly integrating these class-aware prompts into the Text Encoder, a dynamic class-aware classifier is generated to enhance discriminability for unseen domains. During inference, TKE dynamically generates class-aware prompts related to the unseen classes. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that TKE serves as a plug-and-play module effortlessly combinable with existing methods. Furthermore, TCP consistently achieves superior performance while demanding less training time",

    "abstract": "Vision language models (VLM) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various downstream tasks. However, understanding fine-grained visual-linguistic concepts, such as attributes and inter-object relationships, remains a significant challenge. While several benchmarks aim to evaluate VLMs in finer granularity, their primary focus remains on the linguistic aspect, neglecting the visual dimension. Here, we highlight the importance of evaluating VLMs from both a textual and visual perspective. We introduce a progressive pipeline to synthesize images that vary in a specific attribute while ensuring consistency in all other aspects. Utilizing this data engine, we carefully design a benchmark, SPEC, to diagnose the comprehension of object size, position, existence, and count. Subsequently, we conduct a thorough evaluation of four leading VLMs on SPEC. Surprisingly, their performance is close to random guess, revealing significant limitations. With this in mind, we propose a simply yet effective approach to optimize VLMs in fine-grained understanding, achieving significant improvements on SPEC without compromising the zero-shot performance. Results on two additional fine-grained benchmarks also show consistent improvements, further validating the transferability of our approach",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Sky survey telescopes play a critical role in modern astronomy, but misalignment of their optical elements can introduce significant variations in point spread functions, leading to reduced data quality. To address this, we need a method to obtain misalignment states, aiding in the reconstruction of accurate point spread functions for data processing methods or facilitating adjustments of optical components for improved image quality. Since sky survey telescopes consist of many optical elements, they result in a vast array of potential misalignment states, some of which are intricately coupled, posing detection challenges. However, by continuously adjusting the misalignment states of optical elements, we can disentangle coupled states. Based on this principle, we propose a deep neural network to extract misalignment states from continuously varying point spread functions in different field of views. To ensure sufficient and diverse training data, we recommend employing a digital twin to obtain data for neural network training. Additionally, we introduce the state graph to store misalignment data and explore complex relationships between misalignment states and corresponding point spread functions, guiding the generation of training data from experiments. Once trained, the neural network estimates misalignment states from observation data, regardless of the impacts caused by atmospheric turbulence, noise, and limited spatial sampling rates in the detector. The method proposed in this paper could be used to provide prior information for the active optics system and the optical system alignment",

    "abstract": "Generative adversarial networks (GANs) usually struggle in learning from highly diverse data, whose underlying manifold is complex. In this work, we revisit the mathematical foundations of GANs, and theoretically reveal that the native adversarial loss for GAN training is insufficient to fix the problem of subsets with positive Lebesgue measure of the generated data manifold lying out of the real data manifold. Instead, we find that score matching serves as a valid solution to this issue thanks to its capability of persistently pushing the generated data points towards the real data manifold. We thereby propose to improve the optimization of GANs with score matching regularity (SMaRt). Regarding the empirical evidences, we first design a toy example to show that training GANs by the aid of a ground-truth score function can help reproduce the real data distribution more accurately, and then confirm that our approach can consistently boost the synthesis performance of various state-of-the-art GANs on real-world datasets with pre-trained diffusion models acting as the approximate score function. For instance, when training Aurora on the ImageNet 64x64 dataset, we manage to improve FID from 8.87 to 7.11, on par with the performance of one-step consistency model.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Hyperspectral object tracking has recently emerged as a topic of great interest in the remote sensing community. The hyperspectral image, with its many bands, provides a rich source of material information of an object that can be effectively used for object tracking. While most hyperspectral trackers are based on detection-based techniques, no one has yet attempted to employ YOLO for detecting and tracking the object. This is due to the presence of multiple spectral bands, the scarcity of annotated hyperspectral videos, and YOLO's performance limitation in managing occlusions, and distinguishing object in cluttered backgrounds. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel framework called Hy-Tracker, which aims to bridge the gap between hyperspectral data and state-of-the-art object detection methods to leverage the strengths of YOLOv7 for object tracking in hyperspectral videos. Hy-Tracker not only introduces YOLOv7 but also innovatively incorporates a refined tracking module on top of YOLOv7. The tracker refines the initial detections produced by YOLOv7, leading to improved object-tracking performance. Furthermore, we incorporate Kalman-Filter into the tracker, which addresses the challenges posed by scale variation and occlusion. The experimental results on hyperspectral benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of Hy-Tracker in accurately tracking objects across frames",

While previous approaches have made significant strides in generating versatile scenes based on text descriptions and a few input images, challenges persist in maintaining the subject fidelity within the generated images. In this work, we introduce an innovative algorithm named HiFi Tuner to enhance the appearance preservation of objects during personalized image generation. Our proposed method employs a parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework, comprising a denoising process and a pivotal inversion process. Key enhancements include the utilization of mask guidance, a novel parameter regularization technique, and the incorporation of step-wise subject representations to elevate the sample fidelity. Additionally, we propose a reference-guided generation approach that leverages the pivotal inversion of a reference image to mitigate unwanted subject variations and artifacts. We further extend our method to a novel image editing task: substituting the subject in an image through textual manipulations. Experimental evaluations conducted on the DreamBooth dataset using the Stable Diffusion model showcase promising results. Fine-tuning solely on textual embeddings improves CLIP-T score by 3.6 points and improves DINO score by 9.6 points over Textual Inversion. When fine-tuning all parameters, HiFi Tuner improves CLIP-T score by 1.2 points and improves DINO score by 1.2 points over DreamBooth, establishing a new state of the art",

This study aims to examine the error accumulation of TTA models when they are repeatedly exposed to previous testing environments, proposing a novel testing setting called episodic TTA. To study this phenomenon, we design a simulation of TTA process on a simple yet representative $\\epsilon$-perturbed Gaussian Mixture Model Classifier and derive the theoretical findings revealing the dataset- and algorithm-dependent factors that contribute to the gradual degeneration of TTA methods through time. Our investigation has led us to propose a method, named persistent TTA (PeTTA). PeTTA senses the model divergence towards a collapsing and adjusts the adaptation strategy of TTA, striking a balance between two primary objectives: adaptation and preventing model collapse. The stability of PeTTA in the face of episodic TTA scenarios has been demonstrated through a set of comprehensive experiments on various benchmarks",

    "abstract": "Decreased myocardial capillary density has been reported as an important histopathological feature associated with various heart disorders. Quantitative assessment of cardiac capillarization typically involves double immunostaining of cardiomyocytes (CMs) and capillaries in myocardial slices. In contrast, single immunostaining of basement membrane components is a straightforward approach to simultaneously label CMs and capillaries, presenting fewer challenges in background staining. However, subsequent image analysis always requires manual work in identifying and segmenting CMs and capillaries. Here, we developed an image analysis tool, AutoQC, to automatically identify and segment CMs and capillaries in immunofluorescence images of collagen type IV, a predominant basement membrane protein within the myocardium. In addition, commonly used capillarization-related measurements can be derived from segmentation masks. AutoQC features a weakly supervised instance segmentation algorithm by leveraging the power of a pre-trained segmentation model via prompt engineering. AutoQC outperformed YOLOv8-Seg, a state-of-the-art instance segmentation model, in both instance segmentation and capillarization assessment. Furthermore, the training of AutoQC required only a small dataset with bounding box annotations instead of pixel-wise annotations, leading to a reduced workload during network training. AutoQC provides an automated solution for quantifying cardiac capillarization in basement-membrane-immunostained myocardial slices, eliminating the need for manual image analysis once it is trained",

Recent works try to maintain a pre-defined correspondence to preserve the content, however, the diversity is still not enough and it may affect style adaptation. In this work, we propose a paired image reconstruction approach for content preservation.

    "abstract": "We consider the task of animating 3D facial geometry from speech signal. Existing works are primarily deterministic, focusing on learning a one-to-one mapping from speech signal to 3D face meshes on small datasets with limited speakers. While these models can achieve high-quality lip articulation for speakers in the training set, they are unable to capture the full and diverse distribution of 3D facial motions that accompany speech in the real world. Importantly, the relationship between speech and facial motion is one-to-many, containing both inter-speaker and intra-speaker variations and necessitating a probabilistic approach. In this paper, we identify and address key challenges that have so far limited the development of probabilistic models: lack of datasets and metrics that are suitable for training and evaluating them, as well as the difficulty of designing a model that generates diverse results while remaining faithful to a strong conditioning signal as speech. We first propose large-scale benchmark datasets and metrics suitable for probabilistic modeling. Then, we demonstrate a probabilistic model that achieves both diversity and fidelity to speech, outperforming other methods across the proposed benchmarks. Finally, we showcase useful applications of probabilistic models trained on these large-scale datasets: we can generate diverse speech-driven 3D facial motion that matches unseen speaker styles extracted from reference clips; and our synthetic meshes can be used to improve the performance of downstream audio-visual models",

Given its challenging nature, the paper focuses on helping architects on the Scan-to-BIM process, instead of replacing them.

    "title": "HiPA: Enabling One-Step Text-to-Image Diffusion Models via High-Frequency-Promoting Adaptation",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Diffusion models have revolutionized text-to-image generation, but their real-world applications are hampered by the extensive time needed for hundreds of diffusion steps. Although progressive distillation has been proposed to speed up diffusion sampling to 2-8 steps, it still falls short in one-step generation, and necessitates training multiple student models, which is highly parameter-extensive and time-consuming. To overcome these limitations, we introduce High-frequency-Promoting Adaptation (HiPA), a parameter-efficient approach to enable one-step text-to-image diffusion. Grounded in the insight that high-frequency information is essential but highly lacking in one-step diffusion, HiPA focuses on training one-step, low-rank adaptors to specifically enhance the under-represented high-frequency abilities of advanced diffusion models. The learned adaptors empower these diffusion models to generate high-quality images in just a single step. Compared with progressive distillation, HiPA achieves much better performance in one-step text-to-image generation (37.3 $\\rightarrow$ 23.8 in FID-5k on MS-COCO 2017) and 28.6x training speed-up (108.8 $\\rightarrow$ 3.8 A100 GPU days), requiring only 0.04% training parameters (7,740 million $\\rightarrow$ 3.3 million). We also demonstrate HiPA's effectiveness in text-guided image editing, inpainting and super-resolution tasks, where our adapted models consistently deliver high-quality outputs in just one diffusion step. The source code will be released",

    "title": "Accelerating Neural Field Training via Soft Mining",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "We present an approach to accelerate Neural Field training by efficiently selecting sampling locations. While Neural Fields have recently become popular, it is often trained by uniformly sampling the training domain, or through handcrafted heuristics. We show that improved convergence and final training quality can be achieved by a soft mining technique based on importance sampling: rather than either considering or ignoring a pixel completely, we weigh the corresponding loss by a scalar. To implement our idea we use Langevin Monte-Carlo sampling. We show that by doing so, regions with higher error are being selected more frequently, leading to more than 2x improvement in convergence speed.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Trajectory prediction is a challenging task that aims to predict the future trajectory of vehicles or pedestrians over a short time horizon based on their historical positions. The main reason is that the trajectory is a kind of complex data, including spatial and temporal information, which is crucial for accurate prediction. Intuitively, the more information the model can capture, the more precise the future trajectory can be predicted. However, previous works based on deep learning methods processed spatial and temporal information separately, leading to inadequate spatial information capture, which means they failed to capture the complete spatial information. Therefore, it is of significance to capture information more fully and effectively on vehicle interactions. In this study, we introduced an integrated 3D graph that incorporates both spatial and temporal edges. Based on this, we proposed the integrated 3D graph, which considers the cross-time interaction information. In specific, we design a Spatial-Temporal Fusion (STF) model including Multi-layer perceptions (MLP) and Graph Attention (GAT) to capture the spatial and temporal information historical trajectories simultaneously on the 3D graph. Our experiment on the ApolloScape Trajectory Datasets shows that the proposed STF outperforms several baseline methods, especially on the long-time-horizon trajectory prediction",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Modern machine learning models are able to outperform humans on a variety of non-trivial tasks. However, as the complexity of the models increases, they consume significant amounts of power and still struggle to generalize effectively to unseen data. Local learning, which focuses on updating subsets of a model's parameters at a time, has emerged as a promising technique to address these issues. Recently, a novel local learning algorithm, called Forward-Forward, has received widespread attention due to its innovative approach to learning. Unfortunately, its application has been limited to smaller datasets due to scalability issues. To this end, we propose The Trifecta, a collection of three simple techniques that synergize exceptionally well and drastically improve the Forward-Forward algorithm on deeper networks. Our experiments demonstrate that our models are on par with similarly structured, backpropagation-based models in both training speed and test accuracy on simple datasets. This is achieved by the ability to learn representations that are informative locally, on a layer-by-layer basis, and retain their informativeness when propagated to deeper layers in the architecture. This leads to around 84\\% accuracy on CIFAR-10, a notable improvement (25\\%) over the original FF algorithm. These results highlight the potential of Forward-Forward as a genuine competitor to backpropagation and as a promising research avenue",

    "abstract": "The first layer of a deep CNN backbone applies filters to an image to extract the basic features available to later layers. During training, some filters may go inactive, mean ing all weights in the filter approach zero. An inactive fil ter in the final model represents a missed opportunity to extract a useful feature. This phenomenon is especially prevalent in specialized CNNs such as for face recogni tion (as opposed to, e.g., ImageNet). For example, in one the most widely face recognition model (ArcFace), about half of the convolution filters in the first layer are inactive. We propose a novel approach designed and tested specif ically for face recognition networks, known as \"CRAFT: Contextual Re-Activation of Filters for Face Recognition Training\". CRAFT identifies inactive filters during training and reinitializes them based on the context of strong filters at that stage in training. We show that CRAFT reduces fraction of inactive filters from 44% to 32% on average and discovers filter patterns not found by standard training. Compared to standard training without reactivation, CRAFT demonstrates enhanced model accuracy on standard face-recognition benchmark datasets including AgeDB-30, CPLFW, LFW, CALFW, and CFP-FP, as well as on more challenging datasets like IJBB and IJBC",

In this work, we propose to explore foundation models for the task of keypoint detection on 3D shapes. A unique characteristic of keypoint detection is that it requires semantic and geometric awareness while demanding high localization accuracy. To address this problem, we propose, first, to back-project features from large pre-trained 2D vision models onto 3D shapes and employ them for this task. We show that we obtain robust 3D features that contain rich semantic information and analyze multiple candidate features stemming from different 2D foundation models. Second, we employ a keypoint candidate optimization module which aims to match the average observed distribution of keypoints on the shape and is guided by the back-projected features. The resulting approach achieves a new state of the art for few-shot keypoint detection on the KeyPointNet dataset, almost doubling the performance of the previous best methods",

    "abstract": "Background: Pose estimation of rigid objects is a practical challenge in optical metrology and computer vision. In this paper a novel stochastic-geometrical modeling framework for object pose estimation is presented based on observing multiple feature points. Methods: This stochastic-geometrical framework utilizes mixture models for the feature point densities in object space as well as for interpreting real measurements. Direct advantages of this approach are the avoidance to resolve individual feature correspondences and to incorporate correct stochastic dependencies in multi-view applications. First, the general modeling framework is presented, second, a general algorithm for pose estimation is derived, and third, two example models for a camera setup as well as a lateration setup are presented. Results: The numerical experiments show the effectiveness of this modeling and general algorithm by investigating four simulation scenarios for three different observation systems, including the dependence on measurement resolution, object deformations as well as strong measurement noise. It can be concluded that the probabilistic modeling of pose estimation based on mixture models can lead to accurate and robust pose estimations",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In the framework of learned image compression, the context model plays a pivotal role in capturing the dependencies among latent representations. To reduce the decoding time resulting from the serial autoregressive context model, the parallel context model has been proposed as an alternative that necessitates only two passes during the decoding phase, thus facilitating efficient image compression in real-world scenarios. However, performance degradation occurs due to its incomplete casual context. To tackle this issue, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the performance degradation observed in existing parallel context models, focusing on two aspects: the Quantity and Quality of information utilized for context prediction and decoding. Based on such analysis, we propose the \\textbf{Corner-to-Center transformer-based Context Model (C$^3$M)} designed to enhance context and latent predictions and improve rate-distortion performance. Specifically, we leverage the logarithmic-based prediction order to predict more context features from corner to center progressively. In addition, to enlarge the receptive field in the analysis and synthesis transformation, we use the Long-range Crossing Attention Module (LCAM) in the encoder/decoder to capture the long-range semantic information by assigning the different window shapes in different channels. Extensive experimental evaluations show that the proposed method is effective and outperforms the state-of-the-art parallel methods. Finally, according to the subjective analysis, we suggest that improving the detailed representation in transformer-based image compression is a promising direction to be explored",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Due to an alarming trend related to obesity affecting 93.3 million adults in the United States alone, body mass index (BMI) and body weight have drawn significant interest in various health monitoring applications. Consequently, several studies have proposed self-diagnostic facial image-based BMI prediction methods for healthy weight monitoring. These methods have mostly used convolutional neural network (CNN) based regression baselines, such as VGG19, ResNet50, and Efficient-NetB0, for BMI prediction from facial images. However, the high computational requirement of these heavy-weight CNN models limits their deployment to resource-constrained mobile devices, thus deterring weight monitoring using smartphones. This paper aims to develop a lightweight facial patch-based ensemble (PatchBMI-Net) for BMI prediction to facilitate the deployment and weight monitoring using smartphones. Extensive experiments on BMI-annotated facial image datasets suggest that our proposed PatchBMI-Net model can obtain Mean Absolute Error (MAE) in the range [3.58, 6.51] with a size of about 3.3 million parameters. On cross-comparison with heavyweight models, such as ResNet-50 and Xception, trained for BMI prediction from facial images, our proposed PatchBMI-Net obtains equivalent MAE along with the model size reduction of about 5.4x and the average inference time reduction of about 3x when deployed on Apple-14 smartphone. Thus, demonstrating performance efficiency as well as low latency for on-device deployment and weight monitoring using smartphone applications",

Despite greater access to earth observation data in agriculture, there is a scarcity of curated and labelled datasets, which limits the potential of its use in training ML models for remote sensing (RS) in agriculture. To this end, we introduce a first-of-its-kind dataset called SICKLE, which constitutes a time-series of multi-resolution imagery from 3 distinct satellites: Landsat-8, Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2. Our dataset constitutes multi-spectral, thermal and microwave sensors during January 2018 - March 2021 period. We construct each temporal sequence by considering the cropping practices followed by farmers primarily engaged in paddy cultivation in the Cauvery Delta region of Tamil Nadu, India; and annotate the corresponding imagery with key cropping parameters at multiple resolutions (i.e. 3m, 10m and 30m). Our dataset comprises 2,370 season-wise samples from 388 unique plots, having an average size of 0.38 acres, for classifying 21 crop types across 4 districts in the Delta, which amounts to approximately 209,000 satellite images. Out of the 2,370 samples, 351 paddy samples from 145 plots are annotated with multiple crop parameters; such as the variety of paddy, its growing season and productivity in terms of per-acre yields. Ours is also one among the first studies that consider the growing season activities pertinent to crop phenology (spans sowing, transplanting and harvesting dates) as parameters of interest. We benchmark SICKLE on three tasks: crop type, crop phenology (sowing, transplanting, harvesting), and yield prediction",

    "abstract": "In many practical computer vision scenarios unlabeled data is plentiful, but labels are scarce and difficult to obtain. As a result, semi-supervised learning which leverages unlabeled data to boost the performance of supervised classifiers have received significant attention in recent literature. One major class of semi-supervised algorithms is co-training. In co-training two different models leverage different independent and sufficient \"views\" of the data to jointly make better predictions. During co-training each model creates pseudo labels on unlabeled points which are used to improve the other model. We show that in the common case when independent views are not available we can construct such views inexpensively using pre-trained models. Co-training on the constructed views yields a performance improvement over any of the individual views we construct and performance comparable with recent approaches in semi-supervised learning, but has some undesirable properties. To alleviate the issues present with co-training we present Meta Co-Training which is an extension of the successful Meta Pseudo Labels approach to multiple views.

    "abstract": "Super-Resolution for remote sensing has the potential for huge impact on planet monitoring by producing accurate and realistic high resolution imagery on a frequent basis and a global scale. Despite a lot of attention, several inconsistencies and challenges have prevented it from being deployed in practice. These include the lack of effective metrics, fragmented and relatively small-scale datasets for training, insufficient comparisons across a suite of methods, and unclear evidence for the use of super-resolution outputs for machine consumption. This work presents a new metric for super-resolution, CLIPScore, that corresponds far better with human judgments than previous metrics on an extensive study. We use CLIPScore to evaluate four standard methods on a new large-scale dataset, S2-NAIP, and three existing benchmark datasets, and find that generative adversarial networks easily outperform more traditional L2 loss-based models and are more semantically accurate than modern diffusion models. We also find that using CLIPScore as an auxiliary loss can speed up the training of GANs by 18x and lead to improved outputs, resulting in an effective model in diverse geographies across the world which we will release publicly.

    "abstract": "Sparse LiDAR point clouds cause severe loss of detail of static structures and reduce the density of static points available for navigation. Reduced density can be detrimental to navigation under several scenarios. We observe that despite high sparsity, in most cases, the global topology of LiDAR outlining the static structures can be inferred. We utilize this property to obtain a backbone skeleton of a static LiDAR scan in the form of a single connected component that is a proxy to its global topology. We utilize the backbone to augment new points along static structures to overcome sparsity. Newly introduced points could correspond to existing static structures or to static points that were earlier obstructed by dynamic objects. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to use this strategy for sparse LiDAR point clouds. Existing solutions close to our approach fail to identify and preserve the global static LiDAR topology and generate sub-optimal points. We propose GLiDR, a Graph Generative network that is topologically regularized using 0-dimensional Persistent Homology (PH) constraints. This enables GLiDR to introduce newer static points along a topologically consistent global static LiDAR backbone. GLiDR generates precise static points using 32x sparser dynamic scans and performs better than the baselines across three datasets. The newly introduced static points allow GLiDR to outperform LiDAR-based navigation using SLAM in several settings. GLiDR generates a valuable byproduct - an accurate binary segmentation mask of static and dynamic objects that is helpful for navigation planning and safety in constrained environments",

However, conventional camera-based approaches may leak users' personally identifiable features, jeopardizing user's privacy, which limits its application. In this work, we investigate using affordable light detection and ranging (LiDAR) technology to perform outdoor crowd management leveraging edge computing. Specifically, we aim to count the number of people on a walkway of a university campus. Besides privacy protection, LiDAR sensors are superior to cameras since their performance will not be compromised when the campus is not well-illuminated. We deploy LiDAR sensors on light poles to collect data from the crowd on the campus and leverage edge accelerators to process data locally. We proposed two different methodologies in this work: 1) a non-convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approach, using clustering and autoencoder, and 2) a CNN-based approach that first projects point clouds to 2D planes and then processes the projection with conventional CNNs. Our first approach relies on careful feature engineering, whereas our second approach does not require such effort. However, the CNN-based approach requires more computational power than our non-CNN-based approach. We evaluate both approaches comprehensively with our hand-labeled real-life data collected from campus. Our evaluation results show that the first method achieves an accuracy of 85.4%, whereas the second method achieves 95.8%. Our CNN-based method outperforms existing solutions significantly.

Typically, this is either done by updating the parameters of the model (model adaptation) using inputs from the target domain or by modifying the inputs themselves (input adaptation). However, methods that modify the model suffer from the issue of compounding noisy updates whereas methods that modify the input need to adapt to every new data point from scratch while also struggling with certain domain shifts. We introduce an approach that leverages a pre-trained diffusion model to project the target domain images closer to the source domain and iteratively updates the model via pseudo-label ensembling. Our method combines the advantages of model and input adaptations while mitigating their shortcomings.

    "abstract": "We propose an online 3D semantic segmentation method that incrementally reconstructs a 3D semantic map from a stream of RGB-D frames. Unlike offline methods, ours is directly applicable to scenarios with real-time constraints, such as robotics or mixed reality. To overcome the inherent challenges of online methods, we make two main contributions. First, to effectively extract information from the input RGB-D video stream, we jointly estimate geometry and semantic labels per frame in 3D. A key focus of our approach is to reason about semantic entities both in the 2D input and the local 3D domain to leverage differences in spatial context and network architectures. Our method predicts 2D features using an off-the-shelf segmentation network. The extracted 2D features are refined by a lightweight 3D network to enable reasoning about the local 3D structure. Second, to efficiently deal with an infinite stream of input RGB-D frames, a subsequent network serves as a temporal expert predicting the incremental scene updates by leveraging 2D, 3D, and past information in a learned manner. These updates are then integrated into a global scene representation. Using these main contributions, our method can enable scenarios with real-time constraints and can scale to arbitrary scene sizes by processing and updating the scene only in a local region defined by the new measurement. Our experiments demonstrate improved results compared to existing online methods that purely operate in local regions and show that complementary sources of information can boost the performance. We provide a thorough ablation study on the benefits of different architectural as well as algorithmic design decisions.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Bias analysis is a crucial step in the process of creating fair datasets for training and evaluating computer vision models. The bottleneck in dataset analysis is annotation, which typically requires: (1) specifying a list of attributes relevant to the dataset domain, and (2) classifying each image-attribute pair. While the second step has made rapid progress in automation, the first has remained human-centered, requiring an experimenter to compile lists of in-domain attributes. However, an experimenter may have limited foresight leading to annotation \"blind spots,\" which in turn can lead to flawed downstream dataset analyses. To combat this, we propose GELDA, a nearly automatic framework that leverages large generative language models (LLMs) to propose and label various attributes for a domain. GELDA takes a user-defined domain caption (e.g., \"a photo of a bird,\" \"a photo of a living room\") and uses an LLM to hierarchically generate attributes. In addition, GELDA uses the LLM to decide which of a set of vision-language models (VLMs) to use to classify each attribute in images. Results on real datasets show that GELDA can generate accurate and diverse visual attribute suggestions, and uncover biases such as confounding between class labels and background features. Results on synthetic datasets demonstrate that GELDA can be used to evaluate the biases of text-to-image diffusion models and generative adversarial networks. Overall, we show that while GELDA is not accurate enough to replace human annotators, it can serve as a complementary tool to help humans analyze datasets in a cheap, low-effort, and flexible manner",

    "title": "Predicting breast cancer with AI for individual risk-adjusted MRI screening and early detection",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Women with an increased life-time risk of breast cancer undergo supplemental annual screening MRI. We propose to predict the risk of developing breast cancer within one year based on the current MRI, with the objective of reducing screening burden and facilitating early detection. An AI algorithm was developed on 53,858 breasts from 12,694 patients who underwent screening or diagnostic MRI and accrued over 12 years, with 2,331 confirmed cancers. A first U-Net was trained to segment lesions and identify regions of concern. A second convolutional network was trained to detect malignant cancer using features extracted by the U-Net. This network was then fine-tuned to estimate the risk of developing cancer within a year in cases that radiologists considered normal or likely benign. Risk predictions from this AI were evaluated with a retrospective analysis of 9,183 breasts from a high-risk screening cohort, which were not used for training. Statistical analysis focused on the tradeoff between number of omitted exams versus negative predictive value, and number of potential early detections versus positive predictive value. The AI algorithm identified regions of concern that coincided with future tumors in 52% of screen-detected cancers. Upon directed review, a radiologist found that 71.3% of cancers had a visible correlate on the MRI prior to diagnosis, 65% of these correlates were identified by the AI model. Reevaluating these regions in 10% of all cases with higher AI-predicted risk could have resulted in up to 33% early detections by a radiologist. Additionally, screening burden could have been reduced in 16% of lower-risk cases by recommending a later follow-up without compromising current interval cancer rate. With increasing datasets and improving image quality we expect this new AI-aided, adaptive screening to meaningfully reduce screening burden and improve early detection",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Unsupervised learning of keypoints and landmarks has seen significant progress with the help of modern neural network architectures, but performance is yet to match the supervised counterpart, making their practicability questionable. We leverage the emergent knowledge within text-to-image diffusion models, towards more robust unsupervised keypoints. Our core idea is to find text embeddings that would cause the generative model to consistently attend to compact regions in images (i.e. keypoints). To do so, we simply optimize the text embedding such that the cross-attention maps within the denoising network are localized as Gaussians with small standard deviations. We validate our performance on multiple datasets: the CelebA, CUB-200-2011, Tai-Chi-HD, DeepFashion, and Human3.6m datasets. We achieve significantly improved accuracy, sometimes even outperforming supervised ones, particularly for data that is non-aligned and less curated.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Recently, in-context learning (ICL) on large language models (LLMs) has received great attention, and this technique can also be applied to vision-language models (VLMs) built upon LLMs. These VLMs can respond to queries by conditioning responses on a series of multimodal demonstrations, which comprise images, queries, and answers. Though ICL has been extensively studied on LLMs, its research on VLMs remains limited. The inclusion of additional visual information in the demonstrations motivates the following research questions: which of the two modalities in the demonstration is more significant? How can we select effective multimodal demonstrations to enhance ICL performance? This study investigates the significance of both visual and language information. Our findings indicate that ICL in VLMs is predominantly driven by the textual information in the demonstrations whereas the visual information in the demonstrations barely affects the ICL performance. Subsequently, we provide an understanding of the findings by analyzing the model information flow and comparing model inner states given different ICL settings. Motivated by our analysis, we propose a simple yet effective approach, termed Mixed Modality In-Context Example Selection (MMICES), which considers both visual and language modalities when selecting demonstrations and shows better ICL performance. Extensive experiments are conducted to support our findings, understanding, and improvement of the ICL performance of VLMs",

    "title": "MoMask: Generative Masked Modeling of 3D Human Motions",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "We introduce MoMask, a novel masked modeling framework for text-driven 3D human motion generation. In MoMask, a hierarchical quantization scheme is employed to represent human motion as multi-layer discrete motion tokens with high-fidelity details. Starting at the base layer, with a sequence of motion tokens obtained by vector quantization, the residual tokens of increasing orders are derived and stored at the subsequent layers of the hierarchy. This is consequently followed by two distinct bidirectional transformers. For the base-layer motion tokens, a Masked Transformer is designated to predict randomly masked motion tokens conditioned on text input at training stage. During generation (i.e. inference) stage, starting from an empty sequence, our Masked Transformer iteratively fills up the missing tokens; Subsequently, a Residual Transformer learns to progressively predict the next-layer tokens based on the results from current layer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoMask outperforms the state-of-art methods on the text-to-motion generation task, with an FID of 0.045 (vs e.g. 0.141 of T2M-GPT) on the HumanML3D dataset, and 0.228 (vs 0.514) on KIT-ML, respectively. MoMask can also be seamlessly applied in related tasks without further model fine-tuning, such as text-guided temporal inpainting",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "We address the problem of synthesizing multi-view optical illusions: images that change appearance upon a transformation, such as a flip or rotation. We propose a simple, zero-shot method for obtaining these illusions from off-the-shelf text-to-image diffusion models. During the reverse diffusion process, we estimate the noise from different views of a noisy image. We then combine these noise estimates together and denoise the image. A theoretical analysis suggests that this method works precisely for views that can be written as orthogonal transformations, of which permutations are a subset. This leads to the idea of a visual anagram--an image that changes appearance under some rearrangement of pixels. This includes rotations and flips, but also more exotic pixel permutations such as a jigsaw rearrangement. Our approach also naturally extends to illusions with more than two views. We provide both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrating the effectiveness and flexibility of our method.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "While many unsupervised learning models focus on one family of tasks, either generative or discriminative, we explore the possibility of a unified representation learner: a model which addresses both families of tasks simultaneously. We identify diffusion models, a state-of-the-art method for generative tasks, as a prime candidate. Such models involve training a U-Net to iteratively predict and remove noise, and the resulting model can synthesize high-fidelity, diverse, novel images. We find that the intermediate feature maps of the U-Net are diverse, discriminative feature representations. We propose a novel attention mechanism for pooling feature maps and further leverage this mechanism as DifFormer, a transformer feature fusion of features from different diffusion U-Net blocks and noise steps. We also develop DifFeed, a novel feedback mechanism tailored to diffusion. We find that diffusion models are better than GANs, and, with our fusion and feedback mechanisms, can compete with state-of-the-art unsupervised image representation learning methods for discriminative tasks - image classification with full and semi-supervision, transfer for fine-grained classification, object detection and segmentation, and semantic segmentation.

Existing generalization techniques necessitate substantial data augmentation, potentially sourced from external datasets, and aim at learning invariant representations by imposing various alignment constraints. Large-scale pretraining has recently shown promising generalization capabilities, along with the potential of bridging different modalities. For instance, the recent advent of vision-language models like CLIP has opened the doorway for vision models to exploit the textual modality. In this paper, we introduce a simple framework for generalizing semantic segmentation networks by employing language as the source of randomization. Our recipe comprises three key ingredients: i) the preservation of the intrinsic CLIP robustness through minimal fine-tuning, ii) language-driven local style augmentation, and iii) randomization by locally mixing the source and augmented styles during training.

Existing text-to-avatar methods are either limited to static avatars which cannot be animated or struggle to generate animatable avatars with promising quality and precise pose control. To address these limitations, we propose AvatarStudio, a coarse-to-fine generative model that generates explicit textured 3D meshes for animatable human avatars. Specifically, AvatarStudio begins with a low-resolution NeRF-based representation for coarse generation, followed by incorporating SMPL-guided articulation into the explicit mesh representation to support avatar animation and high resolution rendering. To ensure view consistency and pose controllability of the resulting avatars, we introduce a 2D diffusion model conditioned on DensePose for Score Distillation Sampling supervision. By effectively leveraging the synergy between the articulated mesh representation and the DensePose-conditional diffusion model, AvatarStudio can create high-quality avatars from text that are ready for animation, significantly outperforming previous methods. Moreover, it is competent for many applications, e.g., multimodal avatar animations and style-guided avatar creation.

    "abstract": "Recent breakthroughs in text-to-4D generation rely on pre-trained text-to-image and text-to-video models to generate dynamic 3D scenes. However, current text-to-4D methods face a three-way tradeoff between the quality of scene appearance, 3D structure, and motion. For example, text-to-image models and their 3D-aware variants are trained on internet-scale image datasets and can be used to produce scenes with realistic appearance and 3D structure -- but no motion. Text-to-video models are trained on relatively smaller video datasets and can produce scenes with motion, but poorer appearance and 3D structure. While these models have complementary strengths, they also have opposing weaknesses, making it difficult to combine them in a way that alleviates this three-way tradeoff. Here, we introduce hybrid score distillation sampling, an alternating optimization procedure that blends supervision signals from multiple pre-trained diffusion models and incorporates benefits of each for high-fidelity text-to-4D generation. Using hybrid SDS, we demonstrate synthesis of 4D scenes with compelling appearance, 3D structure, and motion",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Hallucination, posed as a pervasive challenge of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs), has significantly impeded their real-world usage that demands precise judgment. Existing methods mitigate this issue with either training with specific designed data or inferencing with external knowledge from other sources, incurring inevitable additional costs. In this paper, we present OPERA, a novel MLLM decoding method grounded in an Over-trust Penalty and a Retrospection-Allocation strategy, serving as a nearly free lunch to alleviate the hallucination issue without additional data, knowledge, or training. Our approach begins with an interesting observation that, most hallucinations are closely tied to the knowledge aggregation patterns manifested in the self-attention matrix, i.e., MLLMs tend to generate new tokens by focusing on a few summary tokens, but not all the previous tokens. Such partial over-trust inclination results in the neglecting of image tokens and describes the image content with hallucination. Statistically, we observe an 80%$\\sim$95% co-currency rate between hallucination contents and such knowledge aggregation patterns. Based on the observation, OPERA introduces a penalty term on the model logits during the beam-search decoding to mitigate the over-trust issue, along with a rollback strategy that retrospects the presence of summary tokens in the previously generated tokens, and re-allocate the token selection if necessary. With extensive experiments, OPERA shows significant hallucination-mitigating performance on different MLLMs and metrics, proving its effectiveness and generality.

While these methods demonstrate state-of-the-art quality and speed, they are designed for photogrammetry of static scenes and do not generalize well to freely moving humans in the environment. In this work, we introduce Human Gaussian Splats (HUGS) that represents an animatable human together with the scene using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Our method takes only a monocular video with a small number of (50-100) frames, and it automatically learns to disentangle the static scene and a fully animatable human avatar within 30 minutes. We utilize the SMPL body model to initialize the human Gaussians. To capture details that are not modeled by SMPL (e.g. cloth, hairs), we allow the 3D Gaussians to deviate from the human body model. Utilizing 3D Gaussians for animated humans brings new challenges, including the artifacts created when articulating the Gaussians. We propose to jointly optimize the linear blend skinning weights to coordinate the movements of individual Gaussians during animation. Our approach enables novel-pose synthesis of human and novel view synthesis of both the human and the scene.

To the best of our knowledge, SODA is the first diffusion model to succeed at ImageNet linear-probe classification, and, at the same time, it accomplishes reconstruction, editing and synthesis tasks across a wide range of datasets. Further investigation reveals the disentangled nature of its emergent latent space, that serves as an effective interface to control and manipulate the model's produced images.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Hallucinations and unfaithful synthesis due to inaccurate prompts with insufficient semantic details are widely observed in multimodal generative models. A prevalent strategy to align multiple modalities is to fine-tune the generator with a large number of annotated text-image pairs. However, such a procedure is labor-consuming and resource-draining. The key question we ask is: can we enhance the quality and faithfulness of text-driven generative models beyond extensive text-image pair annotations? To address this question, we propose Knowledge Pursuit Prompting (KPP), a zero-shot framework that iteratively incorporates external knowledge to help generators produce reliable visual content. Instead of training generators to handle generic prompts, KPP employs a recursive knowledge query process to gather informative external facts from the knowledge base, instructs a language model to compress the acquired knowledge for prompt refinement, and utilizes text-driven generators for visual synthesis. The entire process is zero-shot, without accessing the architectures and parameters of generative models.

    "title": "Improving Faithfulness for Vision Transformers",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance for various vision tasks. One reason behind the success lies in their ability to provide plausible innate explanations for the behavior of neural architectures. However, ViTs suffer from issues with explanation faithfulness, as their focal points are fragile to adversarial attacks and can be easily changed with even slight perturbations on the input image. In this paper, we propose a rigorous approach to mitigate these issues by introducing Faithful ViTs (FViTs). Briefly speaking, an FViT should have the following two properties: (1) The top-$k$ indices of its self-attention vector should remain mostly unchanged under input perturbation, indicating stable explanations; (2) The prediction distribution should be robust to perturbations. To achieve this, we propose a new method called Denoised Diffusion Smoothing (DDS), which adopts randomized smoothing and diffusion-based denoising. We theoretically prove that processing ViTs directly with DDS can turn them into FViTs. We also show that Gaussian noise is nearly optimal for both $\\ell_2$ and $\\ell_\\infty$-norm cases. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through comprehensive experiments and evaluations. Specifically, we compare our FViTs with other baselines through visual interpretation and robustness accuracy under adversarial attacks. Results show that FViTs are more robust against adversarial attacks while maintaining the explainability of attention, indicating higher faithfulness",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective approach for self-supervised video object segmentation (VOS). Our key insight is that the inherent structural dependencies present in DINO-pretrained Transformers can be leveraged to establish robust spatio-temporal correspondences in videos. Furthermore, simple clustering on this correspondence cue is sufficient to yield competitive segmentation results. Previous self-supervised VOS techniques majorly resort to auxiliary modalities or utilize iterative slot attention to assist in object discovery, which restricts their general applicability and imposes higher computational requirements. To deal with these challenges, we develop a simplified architecture that capitalizes on the emerging objectness from DINO-pretrained Transformers, bypassing the need for additional modalities or slot attention. Specifically, we first introduce a single spatio-temporal Transformer block to process the frame-wise DINO features and establish spatio-temporal dependencies in the form of self-attention. Subsequently, utilizing these attention maps, we implement hierarchical clustering to generate object segmentation masks. To train the spatio-temporal block in a fully self-supervised manner, we employ semantic and dynamic motion consistency coupled with entropy normalization. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across multiple unsupervised VOS benchmarks and particularly excels in complex real-world multi-object video segmentation tasks such as DAVIS-17-Unsupervised and YouTube-VIS-19.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Traditional 2D pose estimation models are limited by their category-specific design, making them suitable only for predefined object categories. This restriction becomes particularly challenging when dealing with novel objects due to the lack of relevant training data. To address this limitation, category-agnostic pose estimation (CAPE) was introduced. CAPE aims to enable keypoint localization for arbitrary object categories using a single model, requiring minimal support images with annotated keypoints. This approach not only enables object pose generation based on arbitrary keypoint definitions but also significantly reduces the associated costs, paving the way for versatile and adaptable pose estimation applications. We present a novel approach to CAPE that leverages the inherent geometrical relations between keypoints through a newly designed Graph Transformer Decoder. By capturing and incorporating this crucial structural information, our method enhances the accuracy of keypoint localization, marking a significant departure from conventional CAPE techniques that treat keypoints as isolated entities. We validate our approach on the MP-100 benchmark, a comprehensive dataset comprising over 20,000 images spanning more than 100 categories. Our method outperforms the prior state-of-the-art by substantial margins, achieving remarkable improvements of 2.16% and 1.82% under 1-shot and 5-shot settings, respectively. Furthermore, our method's end-to-end training demonstrates both scalability and efficiency compared to previous CAPE approaches",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Multi-view neural surface reconstruction has exhibited impressive results. However, a notable limitation is the prohibitively slow inference time when compared to traditional techniques, primarily attributed to the dense sampling, required to maintain the rendering quality. This paper introduces a novel approach that substantially reduces the number of samplings by incorporating the Truncated Signed Distance Field (TSDF) of the scene. While prior works have proposed importance sampling, their dependence on initial uniform samples over the entire space makes them unable to avoid performance degradation when trying to use less number of samples. In contrast, our method leverages the TSDF volume generated only by the trained views, and it proves to provide a reasonable bound on the sampling from upcoming novel views. As a result, we achieve high rendering quality by fully exploiting the continuous neural SDF estimation within the bounds given by the TSDF volume. Notably, our method is the first approach that can be robustly plug-and-play into a diverse array of neural surface field models, as long as they use the volume rendering technique. Our empirical results show an 11-fold increase in inference speed without compromising performance. The result videos are available at our project page: https://tsdf-sampling.github.io/",

    "abstract": "Efficient generation of 3D digital humans is important in several industries, including virtual reality, social media, and cinematic production. 3D generative adversarial networks (GANs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art (SOTA) quality and diversity for generated assets. Current 3D GAN architectures, however, typically rely on volume representations, which are slow to render, thereby hampering the GAN training and requiring multi-view-inconsistent 2D upsamplers. Here, we introduce Gaussian Shell Maps (GSMs) as a framework that connects SOTA generator network architectures with emerging 3D Gaussian rendering primitives using an articulable multi shell--based scaffold. In this setting, a CNN generates a 3D texture stack with features that are mapped to the shells. The latter represent inflated and deflated versions of a template surface of a digital human in a canonical body pose. Instead of rasterizing the shells directly, we sample 3D Gaussians on the shells whose attributes are encoded in the texture features. These Gaussians are efficiently and differentiably rendered. The ability to articulate the shells is important during GAN training and, at inference time, to deform a body into arbitrary user-defined poses. Our efficient rendering scheme bypasses the need for view-inconsistent upsamplers and achieves high-quality multi-view consistent renderings at a native resolution of $512 \\times 512$ pixels. We demonstrate that GSMs successfully generate 3D humans when trained on single-view datasets, including SHHQ and DeepFashion",

We present a method to marginalize over any factors varied across VLM queries, utilizing the VLM's scores for sampled responses. We first show that this probabilistic aggregation can outperform a language model (e.g., GPT4) for summarization, for instance avoiding hallucinations when there are contrasting details between responses. Secondly, we show that aggregated annotations are useful for prompt-chaining; they help improve downstream VLM predictions (e.g., of object material when the object's type is specified as an auxiliary input in the prompt). Such auxiliary inputs allow ablating and measuring the contribution of visual reasoning over language-only reasoning.

ViLa directly integrates perceptual data into its reasoning and planning process, enabling a profound understanding of commonsense knowledge in the visual world, including spatial layouts and object attributes.

In this work, we present SPiC-E - a neural network that adds structural guidance to 3D diffusion models, extending their usage beyond text-conditional generation. At its core, our framework introduces a cross-entity attention mechanism that allows for multiple entities (in particular, paired input and guidance 3D shapes) to interact via their internal representations within the denoising network. We utilize this mechanism for learning task-specific structural priors in 3D diffusion models from auxiliary guidance shapes. We show that our approach supports a variety of applications, including 3D stylization, semantic shape editing and text-conditional abstraction-to-3D, which transforms primitive-based abstractions into highly-expressive shapes.

In this paper, we address these problems by generating images that optimize a classifier-derived objective using a framework for guided image generation. We analyze the behavior and decisions of image classifiers by visual counterfactual explanations (VCEs), detection of systematic mistakes by analyzing images where classifiers maximally disagree, and visualization of neurons to verify potential spurious features. In this way, we validate existing observations, e.g. the shape bias of adversarially robust models, as well as novel failure modes, e.g. systematic errors of zero-shot CLIP classifiers, or identify harmful spurious features.

A graphical interface allows for and assists with manual validation. We demonstrate the benefits of this approach by collecting a range of shapes and numerical attributes from richly-illustrated archaeological catalogues, and benchmark it in a real-world experiment with ten users.

To address the problem, we propose a novel and model-agnostic domain-aware prompt learning (DAP) framework. For equipping the pretrained models with specific object-level and scene-level cross-modal alignment in VLN tasks, DAP applies a low-cost prompt tuning paradigm to learn soft visual prompts for extracting in-domain image semantics. Specifically, we first generate a set of in-domain image-text pairs with the help of the CLIP model. Then we introduce soft visual prompts in the input space of the visual encoder in a pretrained model. DAP injects in-domain visual knowledge into the visual encoder of the pretrained model in an efficient way.

We leverage dense point clouds as a geometric prior and introduce a color appearance embedding loss to recover the color of the building given limited available color images.

However, vision transformers still struggle with geometric variations prevalent in video data. This paper proposes a novel approach, GeoDeformer, designed to capture the variations inherent in action video by integrating geometric comprehension directly into the ViT architecture. Specifically, at the core of GeoDeformer is the Geometric Deformation Predictor, a module designed to identify and quantify potential spatial and temporal geometric deformations within the given video. Spatial deformations adjust the geometry within individual frames, while temporal deformations capture the cross-frame geometric dynamics, reflecting motion and temporal progression. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we incorporate it into the established MViTv2 framework, replacing the standard self-attention blocks with GeoDeformer blocks. Our experiments at UCF101, HMDB51, and Mini-K200 achieve significant increases in both Top-1 and Top-5 accuracy, establishing new state-of-the-art results with only a marginal increase in computational cost. Additionally, visualizations affirm that GeoDeformer effectively manifests explicit geometric deformations and minimizes geometric variations. Codes and checkpoints will be released",

    "title": "Aggregation Model Hyperparameters Matter in Digital Pathology",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Digital pathology has significantly advanced disease detection and pathologist efficiency through the analysis of gigapixel whole-slide images (WSI). In this process, WSIs are first divided into patches, for which a feature extractor model is applied to obtain feature vectors, which are subsequently processed by an aggregation model to predict the respective WSI label. With the rapid evolution of representation learning, numerous new feature extractor models, often termed foundational models, have emerged. Traditional evaluation methods, however, rely on fixed aggregation model hyperparameters, a framework we identify as potentially biasing the results. Our study uncovers a co-dependence between feature extractor models and aggregation model hyperparameters, indicating that performance comparability can be skewed based on the chosen hyperparameters. By accounting for this co-dependency, we find that the performance of many current feature extractor models is notably similar. We support this insight by evaluating seven feature extractor models across three different datasets with 162 different aggregation model configurations. This comprehensive approach provides a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between feature extractors and aggregation models, leading to a fairer and more accurate assessment of feature extractor models in digital pathology",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce U-Net v2, a new robust and efficient U-Net variant for medical image segmentation. It aims to augment the infusion of semantic information into low-level features while simultaneously refining high-level features with finer details. For an input image, we begin by extracting multi-level features with a deep neural network encoder. Next, we enhance the feature map of each level by infusing semantic information from higher-level features and integrating finer details from lower-level features through Hadamard product. Our novel skip connections empower features of all the levels with enriched semantic characteristics and intricate details. The improved features are subsequently transmitted to the decoder for further processing and segmentation. Our method can be seamlessly integrated into any Encoder-Decoder network. We evaluate our method on several public medical image segmentation datasets for skin lesion segmentation and polyp segmentation, and the experimental results demonstrate the segmentation accuracy of our new method over state-of-the-art methods, while preserving memory and computational efficiency.

To handle this issue, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of existing foundation models, to explore their inherent understanding of affordances and assess the potential for data-limited affordance learning. We then propose a vision-language framework with simple and effective designs that boost the alignment between visual features and affordance text embeddings.

To show the scaling-up capacity in point clouds, we introduce the dense ConvNet pretrained on large-scale image datasets (e.g., ImageNet) as the 2D backbone of pillar-based detectors. The ConvNets are adaptively designed based on the model size according to the specific features of point clouds, such as sparsity and irregularity.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Banding, also known as staircase-like contours, frequently occurs in flat areas of images/videos processed by the compression or quantization algorithms. As undesirable artifacts, banding destroys the original image structure, thus degrading users' quality of experience (QoE). In this paper, we systematically investigate the banding image quality assessment (IQA) problem, aiming to detect the image banding artifacts and evaluate their perceptual visual quality. Considering that the existing image banding databases only contain limited content sources and banding generation methods, and lack perceptual quality labels (i.e. mean opinion scores), we first build the largest banding IQA database so far, named Banding Artifact Noticeable Database (BAND-2k), which consists of 2,000 banding images generated by 15 compression and quantization schemes. A total of 23 workers participated in the subjective IQA experiment, yielding over 214,000 patch-level banding class labels and 44,371 reliable image-level quality ratings. Subsequently, we develop an effective no-reference (NR) banding evaluator for banding detection and quality assessment by leveraging frequency characteristics of banding artifacts. A dual convolutional neural network is employed to concurrently learn the feature representation from the high-frequency and low-frequency maps, thereby enhancing the ability to discern banding artifacts. The quality score of a banding image is generated by pooling the banding detection maps masked by the spatial frequency filters. Experiments demonstrate that our banding evaluator achieves a remarkably high accuracy in banding detection and also exhibits high SRCC and PLCC results with the perceptual quality labels. These findings unveil the strong correlations between the intensity of banding artifacts and the perceptual visual quality, thus validating the necessity of banding quality assessment",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Regularization of inverse problems is of paramount importance in computational imaging. The ability of neural networks to learn efficient image representations has been recently exploited to design powerful data-driven regularizers. While state-of-the-art plug-and-play methods rely on an implicit regularization provided by neural denoisers, alternative Bayesian approaches consider Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation in the latent space of a generative model, thus with an explicit regularization. However, state-of-the-art deep generative models require a huge amount of training data compared to denoisers. Besides, their complexity hampers the optimization of the latent MAP. In this work, we propose to use compressive autoencoders for latent estimation. These networks, which can be seen as variational autoencoders with a flexible latent prior, are smaller and easier to train than state-of-the-art generative models. We then introduce the Variational Bayes Latent Estimation (VBLE) algorithm, which performs this estimation within the framework of variational inference. This allows for fast and easy (approximate) posterior sampling. Experimental results on image datasets BSD and FFHQ demonstrate that VBLE reaches similar performance than state-of-the-art plug-and-play methods, while being able to quantify uncertainties faster than other existing posterior sampling techniques",

    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Text-to-3D generation by distilling pretrained large-scale text-to-image diffusion models has shown great promise but still suffers from inconsistent 3D geometric structures (Janus problems) and severe artifacts. The aforementioned problems mainly stem from 2D diffusion models lacking 3D awareness during the lifting. In this work, we present GeoDream, a novel method that incorporates explicit generalized 3D priors with 2D diffusion priors to enhance the capability of obtaining unambiguous 3D consistent geometric structures without sacrificing diversity or fidelity. Specifically, we first utilize a multi-view diffusion model to generate posed images and then construct cost volume from the predicted image, which serves as native 3D geometric priors, ensuring spatial consistency in 3D space. Subsequently, we further propose to harness 3D geometric priors to unlock the great potential of 3D awareness in 2D diffusion priors via a disentangled design. Notably, disentangling 2D and 3D priors allows us to refine 3D geometric priors further. We justify that the refined 3D geometric priors aid in the 3D-aware capability of 2D diffusion priors, which in turn provides superior guidance for the refinement of 3D geometric priors. Our numerical and visual comparisons demonstrate that GeoDream generates more 3D consistent textured meshes with high-resolution realistic renderings (i.e., 1024 $\\times$ 1024) and adheres more closely to semantic coherence",

We propose GenZI, the first zero-shot approach to generating 3D human-scene interactions. Key to GenZI is our distillation of interaction priors from large vision-language models (VLMs), which have learned a rich semantic space of 2D human-scene compositions. Given a natural language description and a coarse point location of the desired interaction in a 3D scene, we first leverage VLMs to imagine plausible 2D human interactions inpainted into multiple rendered views of the scene. We then formulate a robust iterative optimization to synthesize the pose and shape of a 3D human model in the scene, guided by consistency with the 2D interaction hypotheses. In contrast to existing learning-based approaches, GenZI circumvents the conventional need for captured 3D interaction data, and allows for flexible control of the 3D interaction synthesis with easy-to-use text prompts. Extensive experiments show that our zero-shot approach has high flexibility and generality, making it applicable to diverse scene types, including both indoor and outdoor environments",

Given the 3D point cloud and multiple posed 2D frames of 3D scenes, our approach segments 3D scenes by applying the pretrained Segment Anything Model (SAM) to 2D frames. Our key idea involves locating 3D points in scenes as natural 3D prompts to align their projected pixel prompts across frames, ensuring frame-consistency in both pixel prompts and their SAM-predicted masks. Moreover, we suggest filtering out low-quality 3D prompts based on feedback from all 2D frames, for enhancing segmentation quality. We also propose to consolidate different 3D prompts if they are segmenting the same object, bringing a more comprehensive segmentation. Notably, our method does not require any additional training on domain-specific data, enabling us to preserve the zero-shot power of SAM. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results show that our method consistently achieves higher quality and more diverse segmentation than previous zero-shot or fully supervised approaches, and in many cases even surpasses human-level annotations.

These models often struggle to disentangle the target language context from sociocultural biases, resulting in biased image generation. To overcome this challenge, we propose Fair Mapping, a general, model-agnostic, and lightweight approach that modifies a pre-trained text-to-image model by controlling the prompt to achieve fair image generation. One key advantage of our approach is its high efficiency. The training process only requires updating a small number of parameters in an additional linear mapping network. This not only reduces the computational cost but also accelerates the optimization process. We first demonstrate the issue of bias in generated results caused by language biases in text-guided diffusion models. By developing a mapping network that projects language embeddings into an unbiased space, we enable the generation of relatively balanced demographic results based on a keyword specified in the prompt. With comprehensive experiments on face image generation, we show that our method significantly improves image generation performance when prompted with descriptions related to human faces. By effectively addressing the issue of bias, we produce more fair and diverse image outputs.

    "abstract": "Robotic-assisted surgical systems have demonstrated significant potential in enhancing surgical precision and minimizing human errors. However, existing systems lack the ability to accommodate the unique preferences and requirements of individual surgeons. Additionally, they primarily focus on general surgeries (e.g., laparoscopy) and are not suitable for highly precise microsurgeries, such as ophthalmic procedures. Thus, we propose a simulation-based image-guided approach for surgeon-centered autonomous agents that can adapt to the individual surgeon's skill level and preferred surgical techniques during ophthalmic cataract surgery. Our approach utilizes a simulated environment to train reinforcement and imitation learning agents guided by image data to perform all tasks of the incision phase of cataract surgery. By integrating the surgeon's actions and preferences into the training process with the surgeon-in-the-loop, our approach enables the robot to implicitly learn and adapt to the individual surgeon's unique approach through demonstrations. This results in a more intuitive and personalized surgical experience for the surgeon. Simultaneously, it ensures consistent performance for the autonomous robotic apprentice. We define and evaluate the effectiveness of our approach using our proposed metrics; and highlight the trade-off between a generic agent and a surgeon-centered adapted agent. Moreover, our approach has the potential to extend to other ophthalmic surgical procedures, opening the door to a new generation of surgeon-in-the-loop autonomous surgical robots.

Recent occupancy estimation techniques using only camera images as input can provide dense occupancy representations of large-scale scenes based on the current observation. However, they are mostly limited to representing the current 3D space and do not consider the future state of surrounding objects along the time axis. To extend camera-only occupancy estimation into spatiotemporal prediction, we propose Cam4DOcc, a new benchmark for camera-only 4D occupancy forecasting, evaluating the surrounding scene changes in a near future. We build our benchmark based on multiple publicly available datasets, including nuScenes, nuScenes-Occupancy, and Lyft-Level5, which provides sequential occupancy states of general movable and static objects, as well as their 3D backward centripetal flow. To establish this benchmark for future research with comprehensive comparisons, we introduce four baseline types from diverse camera-based perception and prediction implementations, including a static-world occupancy model, voxelization of point cloud prediction, 2D-3D instance-based prediction, and our proposed novel end-to-end 4D occupancy forecasting network. Furthermore, the standardized evaluation protocol for preset multiple tasks is also provided to compare the performance of all the proposed baselines on present and future occupancy estimation with respect to objects of interest in autonomous driving scenarios.

Several publicly available databases of fake synthetic video and speech were built to aid the development of detection methods. However, existing databases typically focus on visual or voice modalities and provide no proof that their deepfakes can in fact impersonate any real person. In this paper, we present the first realistic audio-visual database of deepfakes SWAN-DF, where lips and speech are well synchronized and video have high visual and audio qualities. We took the publicly available SWAN dataset of real videos with different identities to create audio-visual deepfakes using several models from DeepFaceLab and blending techniques for face swapping and HiFiVC, DiffVC, YourTTS, and FreeVC models for voice conversion. From the publicly available speech dataset LibriTTS, we also created a separate database of only audio deepfakes LibriTTS-DF using several latest text to speech methods: YourTTS, Adaspeech, and TorToiSe. We demonstrate the vulnerability of a state of the art speaker recognition system, such as ECAPA-TDNN-based model from SpeechBrain, to the synthetic voices. Similarly, we tested face recognition system based on the MobileFaceNet architecture to several variants of our visual deepfakes. The vulnerability assessment show that by tuning the existing pretrained deepfake models to specific identities, one can successfully spoof the face and speaker recognition systems in more than 90% of the time and achieve a very realistic looking and sounding fake video of a given person",

    "abstract": "We introduce VISUAL EMBEDDED INSTRUCTION (VIM), a new framework designed to evaluate the visual instruction following capability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). As illustrated in Figure 2, VIM challenges the MLLMs by embedding the instructions into the visual scenes, demanding strong visual interpretative skills for instruction following. We adapt VIM to various benchmarks, including VQAv2, MME, MM-Vet, and RefCOCO series, compose a VIM bench, and probe diverse MLLMs across three distinct in-context learning settings: Zero Shot, One Shot, and Pair Shot. We observe that there is a significant performance disparity between the open-source MLLMs and GPT-4V, implying that their proficiency in visual instruction comprehension is not up to par. Our results highlight a promising direction for the enhancement of MLLMs capabilities on instruction following. We aim VIM to serve as a useful norm for advancing the state of the art and driving further progress in the field",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Recent approaches for arbitrary-scale single image super-resolution (ASSR) have used local neural fields to represent continuous signals that can be sampled at different rates. However, in such formulation, the point-wise query of field values does not naturally match the point spread function (PSF) of a given pixel. In this work we present a novel way to design neural fields such that points can be queried with a Gaussian PSF, which serves as anti-aliasing when moving across resolutions for ASSR. We achieve this using a novel activation function derived from Fourier theory and the heat equation. This comes at no additional cost: querying a point with a Gaussian PSF in our framework does not affect computational cost, unlike filtering in the image domain. Coupled with a hypernetwork, our method not only provides theoretically guaranteed anti-aliasing, but also sets a new bar for ASSR while also being more parameter-efficient than previous methods",

    "abstract": "Object instances in remote sensing images often distribute with multi-orientations, varying scales, and dense distribution. These issues bring challenges to end-to-end oriented object detectors including multi-scale features alignment and a large number of queries. To address these limitations, we propose an end-to-end oriented detector equipped with an efficient decoder, which incorporates two technologies, Rotated RoI attention (RRoI attention) and Selective Distinct Queries (SDQ). Specifically, RRoI attention effectively focuses on oriented regions of interest through a cross-attention mechanism and aligns multi-scale features. SDQ collects queries from intermediate decoder layers and then filters similar queries to obtain distinct queries. The proposed SDQ can facilitate the optimization of one-to-one label assignment, without introducing redundant initial queries or extra auxiliary branches. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Notably, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on DIOR-R (67.31% mAP), DOTA-v1.5 (67.43% mAP), and DOTA-v2.0 (53.28% mAP) with the ResNet50 backbone",

    "abstract": "Few-shot segmentation (FSS) aims to segment objects of new categories given only a handful of annotated samples. Previous works focus their efforts on exploring the support information while paying less attention to the mining of the critical query branch. In this paper, we rethink the importance of support information and propose a new query-centric FSS model Adversarial Mining Transformer (AMFormer), which achieves accurate query image segmentation with only rough support guidance or even weak support labels. The proposed AMFormer enjoys several merits. First, we design an object mining transformer (G) that can achieve the expansion of incomplete region activated by support clue, and a detail mining transformer (D) to discriminate the detailed local difference between the expanded mask and the ground truth. Second, we propose to train G and D via an adversarial process, where G is optimized to generate more accurate masks approaching ground truth to fool D. We conduct extensive experiments on commonly used Pascal-5i and COCO-20i benchmarks and achieve state-of-the-art results across all settings. In addition, the decent performance with weak support labels in our query-centric paradigm may inspire the development of more general FSS models.

    "abstract": "The advent of large language models, enabling flexibility through instruction-driven approaches, has revolutionized many traditional generative tasks, but large models for 3D data, particularly in comprehensively handling 3D shapes with other modalities, are still under-explored. By achieving instruction-based shape generations, versatile multimodal generative shape models can significantly benefit various fields like 3D virtual construction and network-aided design. In this work, we present ShapeGPT, a shape-included multi-modal framework to leverage strong pre-trained language models to address multiple shape-relevant tasks. Specifically, ShapeGPT employs a word-sentence-paragraph framework to discretize continuous shapes into shape words, further assembles these words for shape sentences, as well as integrates shape with instructional text for multi-modal paragraphs. To learn this shape-language model, we use a three-stage training scheme, including shape representation, multimodal alignment, and instruction-based generation, to align shape-language codebooks and learn the intricate correlations among these modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ShapeGPT achieves comparable performance across shape-relevant tasks, including text-to-shape, shape-to-text, shape completion, and shape editing",

In this study, we put forward a novel adversarial robust memory-based continual learner that adjusts data logits to mitigate the forgetting of pasts caused by adversarial samples. Furthermore, we devise a gradient-based data selection mechanism to overcome the gradient obfuscation caused by limited stored data.

The security concerns surrounding Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively explored, yet the safety of Large Multi-Modal Models (LMMs) remains understudied. In our study, we present a novel visual prompt attack that exploits query-relevant images to jailbreak the open-source LMMs. Our method creates a composite image from one image generated by diffusion models and another that displays the text as typography, based on keywords extracted from a malicious query. We show LLMs can be easily attacked by our approach, even if the employed Large Language Models are safely aligned. To evaluate the extent of this vulnerability in open-source LMMs, we have compiled a substantial dataset encompassing 13 scenarios with a total of 5,040 text-image pairs, using our presented attack technique. Our evaluation of 12 cutting-edge LMMs using this dataset shows the vulnerability of existing multi-modal models on adversarial attacks. This finding underscores the need for a concerted effort to strengthen and enhance the safety measures of open-source LMMs against potential malicious exploits.

    "title": "Continual Self-supervised Learning: Towards Universal Multi-modal Medical Data Representation Learning",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning is an efficient pre-training method for medical image analysis. However, current research is mostly confined to specific-modality data pre-training, consuming considerable time and resources without achieving universality across different modalities. A straightforward solution is combining all modality data for joint self-supervised pre-training, which poses practical challenges. Firstly, our experiments reveal conflicts in representation learning as the number of modalities increases. Secondly, multi-modal data collected in advance cannot cover all real-world scenarios. In this paper, we reconsider versatile self-supervised learning from the perspective of continual learning and propose MedCoSS, a continuous self-supervised learning approach for multi-modal medical data. Unlike joint self-supervised learning, MedCoSS assigns different modality data to different training stages, forming a multi-stage pre-training process. To balance modal conflicts and prevent catastrophic forgetting, we propose a rehearsal-based continual learning method. We introduce the k-means sampling strategy to retain data from previous modalities and rehearse it when learning new modalities. Instead of executing the pretext task on buffer data, a feature distillation strategy and an intra-modal mixup strategy are applied to these data for knowledge retention. We conduct continuous self-supervised pre-training on a large-scale multi-modal unlabeled dataset, including clinical reports, X-rays, CT scans, MRI scans, and pathological images. Experimental results demonstrate MedCoSS's exceptional generalization ability across nine downstream datasets and its significant scalability in integrating new modality data.

However, experiments on visual control tasks have revealed that state-of-the-art reinforcement learning models struggle with out-of-distribution generalization.

Building upon recent success of the large language models, our main objective is to improve the state abstraction technique in reinforcement learning by leveraging language for robust action selection. Specifically, we focus on learning language-grounded visual features to enhance the world model learning, a model-based reinforcement learning technique. To enforce our hypothesis explicitly, we mask out the bounding boxes of a few objects in the image observation and provide the text prompt as descriptions for these masked objects. Subsequently, we predict the masked objects along with the surrounding regions as pixel reconstruction, similar to the transformer-based masked autoencoder approach.

    "abstract": "Achieving high synchronization in the synthesis of realistic, speech-driven talking head videos presents a significant challenge. Traditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) struggle to maintain consistent facial identity, while Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) methods, although they can address this issue, often produce mismatched lip movements, inadequate facial expressions, and unstable head poses. A lifelike talking head requires synchronized coordination of subject identity, lip movements, facial expressions, and head poses. The absence of these synchronizations is a fundamental flaw, leading to unrealistic and artificial outcomes. To address the critical issue of synchronization, identified as the \"devil\" in creating realistic talking heads, we introduce SyncTalk. This NeRF-based method effectively maintains subject identity, enhancing synchronization and realism in talking head synthesis. SyncTalk employs a Face-Sync Controller to align lip movements with speech and innovatively uses a 3D facial blendshape model to capture accurate facial expressions. Our Head-Sync Stabilizer optimizes head poses, achieving more natural head movements. The Portrait-Sync Generator restores hair details and blends the generated head with the torso for a seamless visual experience. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate that SyncTalk outperforms state-of-the-art methods in synchronization and realism.

    "abstract": "Face recognition technology is widely used in the financial field, and various types of liveness attack behaviors need to be addressed. Existing liveness detection algorithms are trained on specific training datasets and tested on testing datasets, but their performance and robustness in transferring to unseen datasets are relatively poor. To tackle this issue, we propose a face liveness detection method based on image-text pairs and contrastive learning, dividing liveness attack problems in the financial field into eight categories and using text information to describe the images of these eight types of attacks. The text encoder and image encoder are used to extract feature vector representations for the classification description text and face images, respectively. By maximizing the similarity of positive samples and minimizing the similarity of negative samples, the model learns shared representations between images and texts. The proposed method is capable of effectively detecting specific liveness attack behaviors in certain scenarios, such as those occurring in dark environments or involving the tampering of ID card photos. Additionally, it is also effective in detecting traditional liveness attack methods, such as printing photo attacks and screen remake attacks. The zero-shot capabilities of face liveness detection on five public datasets, including NUAA, CASIA-FASD, Replay-Attack, OULU-NPU and MSU-MFSD also reaches the level of commercial algorithms. The detection capability of proposed algorithm was verified on 5 types of testing datasets, and the results show that the method outperformed commercial algorithms, and the detection rates reached 100% on multiple datasets.

Capturing local and global features simultaneously is an important way to mitigate such an issue but recent transformer-based decoders were still stuck in the issues that CNN-based encoders only extract local features and the transformers lack locality. Inspired by the locality and implicit positional encoding of convolutions, a novel convolutional transformer is proposed to capture both local contexts and global structures more sufficiently for detector-free matching. Firstly, a universal FPN-like framework captures global structures in self-encoder as well as cross-decoder by transformers and compensates local contexts as well as implicit positional encoding by convolutions. Secondly, a novel convolutional transformer module explores multi-scale long range dependencies by a novel multi-scale attention and further aggregates local information inside dependencies for enhancing locality. Finally, a novel regression-based sub-pixel refinement module exploits the whole fine-grained window features for fine-level positional deviation regression.

To bridge this gap, we introduce ChatIllusion, an advanced Generative multimodal large language model (MLLM) that combines the capabilities of LLM with not only visual comprehension but also creativity. Specifically, ChatIllusion integrates Stable Diffusion XL and Llama, which have been fine-tuned on modest image-caption data, to facilitate multiple rounds of illustrated chats. The central component of ChatIllusion is the \"GenAdapter,\" an efficient approach that equips the multimodal language model with capabilities for visual representation, without necessitating modifications to the foundational model. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of our approach, showcasing its ability to produce diverse and superior-quality image outputs Simultaneously, it preserves semantic consistency and control over the dialogue, significantly enhancing the overall user's quality of experience (QoE).

    "title": "VINNA for Neonates -- Orientation Independence through Latent Augmentations",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Fast and accurate segmentation of neonatal brain images is highly desired to better understand and detect changes during development and disease. Yet, the limited availability of ground truth datasets, lack of standardized acquisition protocols, and wide variations of head positioning pose challenges for method development. A few automated image analysis pipelines exist for newborn brain MRI segmentation, but they often rely on time-consuming procedures and require resampling to a common resolution, subject to loss of information due to interpolation and down-sampling. Without registration and image resampling, variations with respect to head positions and voxel resolutions have to be addressed differently. In deep-learning, external augmentations are traditionally used to artificially expand the representation of spatial variability, increasing the training dataset size and robustness. However, these transformations in the image space still require resampling, reducing accuracy specifically in the context of label interpolation. We recently introduced the concept of resolution-independence with the Voxel-size Independent Neural Network framework, VINN. Here, we extend this concept by additionally shifting all rigid-transforms into the network architecture with a four degree of freedom (4-DOF) transform module, enabling resolution-aware internal augmentations (VINNA). In this work we show that VINNA (i) significantly outperforms state-of-the-art external augmentation approaches, (ii) effectively addresses the head variations present specifically in newborn datasets, and (iii) retains high segmentation accuracy across a range of resolutions (0.5-1.0 mm). The 4-DOF transform module is a powerful, general approach to implement spatial augmentation without requiring image or label interpolation. The specific network application to newborns will be made publicly available as VINNA4neonates",

    "abstract": "Cell segmentation in histopathological images plays a crucial role in understanding, diagnosing, and treating many diseases. However, data annotation for this is expensive since there can be a large number of cells per image, and expert pathologists are needed for labelling images. Instead, our paper focuses on using weak supervision -- annotation from related tasks -- to induce a segmenter. Recent foundation models, such as Segment Anything (SAM), can use prompts to leverage additional supervision during inference. SAM has performed remarkably well in natural image segmentation tasks; however, its applicability to cell segmentation has not been explored. In response, we investigate guiding the prompting procedure in SAM for weakly supervised cell segmentation when only bounding box supervision is available. We develop two workflows: (1) an object detector's output as a test-time prompt to SAM (D-SAM), and (2) SAM as pseudo mask generator over training data to train a standalone segmentation model (SAM-S). On finding that both workflows have some complementary strengths, we develop an integer programming-based approach to reconcile the two sets of segmentation masks, achieving yet higher performance. We experiment on three publicly available cell segmentation datasets namely, ConSep, MoNuSeg, and TNBC, and find that all SAM-based solutions hugely outperform existing weakly supervised image segmentation models, obtaining 9-15 pt Dice gains",

    "abstract": "Recent one-shot video tuning methods, which fine-tune the network on a specific video based on pre-trained text-to-image models (e.g., Stable Diffusion), are popular in the community because of the flexibility. However, these methods often produce videos marred by incoherence and inconsistency. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a simple yet effective noise constraint across video frames. This constraint aims to regulate noise predictions across their temporal neighbors, resulting in smooth latents. It can be simply included as a loss term during the training phase. By applying the loss to existing one-shot video tuning methods, we significantly improve the overall consistency and smoothness of the generated videos. Furthermore, we argue that current video evaluation metrics inadequately capture smoothness. To address this, we introduce a novel metric that considers detailed features and their temporal dynamics. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach in producing smoother videos on various one-shot video tuning baselines.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Generating vivid and emotional 3D co-speech gestures is crucial for virtual avatar animation in human-machine interaction applications. While the existing methods enable generating the gestures to follow a single emotion label, they overlook that long gesture sequence modeling with emotion transition is more practical in real scenes. In addition, the lack of large-scale available datasets with emotional transition speech and corresponding 3D human gestures also limits the addressing of this task. To fulfill this goal, we first incorporate the ChatGPT-4 and an audio inpainting approach to construct the high-fidelity emotion transition human speeches. Considering obtaining the realistic 3D pose annotations corresponding to the dynamically inpainted emotion transition audio is extremely difficult, we propose a novel weakly supervised training strategy to encourage authority gesture transitions. Specifically, to enhance the coordination of transition gestures w.r.t different emotional ones, we model the temporal association representation between two different emotional gesture sequences as style guidance and infuse it into the transition generation. We further devise an emotion mixture mechanism that provides weak supervision based on a learnable mixed emotion label for transition gestures. Last, we present a keyframe sampler to supply effective initial posture cues in long sequences, enabling us to generate diverse gestures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art models constructed by adapting single emotion-conditioned counterparts on our newly defined emotion transition task and datasets",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "We introduce HiDiffusion, a tuning-free framework comprised of Resolution-Aware U-Net (RAU-Net) and Modified Shifted Window Multi-head Self-Attention (MSW-MSA) to enable pretrained large text-to-image diffusion models to efficiently generate high-resolution images (e.g. 1024$\\times$1024) that surpass the training image resolution. Pretrained diffusion models encounter unreasonable object duplication in generating images beyond the training image resolution. We attribute it to the mismatch between the feature map size of high-resolution images and the receptive field of U-Net's convolution. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet scalable method named RAU-Net. RAU-Net dynamically adjusts the feature map size to match the convolution's receptive field in the deep block of U-Net. Another obstacle in high-resolution synthesis is the slow inference speed of U-Net. Our observations reveal that the global self-attention in the top block, which exhibits locality, however, consumes the majority of computational resources. To tackle this issue, we propose MSW-MSA. Unlike previous window attention mechanisms, our method uses a much larger window size and dynamically shifts windows to better accommodate diffusion models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our HiDiffusion can scale diffusion models to generate 1024$\\times$1024, 2048$\\times$2048, or even 4096$\\times$4096 resolution images, while simultaneously reducing inference time by 40\\%-60\\%, achieving state-of-the-art performance on high-resolution image synthesis. The most significant revelation of our work is that a pretrained diffusion model on low-resolution images is scalable for high-resolution generation without further tuning. We hope this revelation can provide insights for future research on the scalability of diffusion models",

While there are many trained networks readily available for retinal vessel segmentation in colour fundus photographs, none cater to IRSLO images.

Materials and Methods: We used 23 expertly annotated IRSLO images from the RAVIR dataset, combined with 7 additional images annotated in-house. We trained a U-Net (convolutional neural network) to label pixels as 'vessel' or 'background'. Results: On an unseen test set (4 images), our model achieved an AUC of 0.981, and an AUPRC of 0.815. Upon thresholding, it achieved a sensitivity of 0.844, a specificity of 0.983, and an F1 score of 0.857.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "State-of-the-art models for pixel-wise prediction tasks such as image restoration, image segmentation, or disparity estimation, involve several stages of data resampling, in which the resolution of feature maps is first reduced to aggregate information and then sequentially increased to generate a high-resolution output. Several previous works have investigated the effect of artifacts that are invoked during downsampling and diverse cures have been proposed that facilitate to improve prediction stability and even robustness for image classification. However, equally relevant, artifacts that arise during upsampling have been less discussed. This is significantly relevant as upsampling and downsampling approaches face fundamentally different challenges. While during downsampling, aliases and artifacts can be reduced by blurring feature maps, the emergence of fine details is crucial during upsampling. Blurring is therefore not an option and dedicated operations need to be considered. In this work, we are the first to explore the relevance of context during upsampling by employing convolutional upsampling operations with increasing kernel size while keeping the encoder unchanged. We find that increased kernel sizes can in general improve the prediction stability in tasks such as image restoration or image segmentation, while a block that allows for a combination of small-size kernels for fine details and large-size kernels for artifact removal and increased context yields the best results",

To this end, we introduce an evaluation protocol based on dynamic vocabulary generation to test whether models detect, discern, and assign the correct fine-grained description to objects in the presence of hard-negative classes. We contribute with a benchmark suite of increasing difficulty and probing different properties like color, pattern, and material.

Such a localized rewriting process enables probabilistic modeling of ambiguous structures and robust generalization across object categories.

As a common practice for model compression, network pruning consists of two major categories: unstructured and structured pruning, where unstructured pruning constantly performs better. However, unstructured pruning presents a structured pattern at high pruning rates, which limits its performance. To this end, we propose a Rank-based PruninG (RPG) method to maintain the ranks of sparse weights in an adversarial manner. In each step, we minimize the low-rank approximation error for the weight matrices using singular value decomposition, and maximize their distance by pushing the weight matrices away from its low rank approximation. This rank-based optimization objective guides sparse weights towards a high-rank topology. The proposed method is conducted in a gradual pruning fashion to stabilize the change of rank during training. Experimental results on various datasets and different tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in high sparsity. The proposed RPG outperforms the state-of-the-art performance by 1.13% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet in ResNet-50 with 98% sparsity.

Recently, many works project the point cloud onto the 2D image and adopt the 2D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or vision transformer for LiDAR point cloud semantic segmentation. However, since more than one point can be projected onto the same 2D position but only one point can be preserved, the previous 2D image-based segmentation methods suffer from inevitable quantized information loss. To avoid quantized information loss, in this paper, we propose a novel spherical frustum structure. The points projected onto the same 2D position are preserved in the spherical frustums. Moreover, we propose a memory-efficient hash-based representation of spherical frustums. Through the hash-based representation, we propose the Spherical Frustum sparse Convolution (SFC) and Frustum Fast Point Sampling (F2PS) to convolve and sample the points stored in spherical frustums respectively. Finally, we present the Spherical Frustum sparse Convolution Network (SFCNet) to adopt 2D CNNs for LiDAR point cloud semantic segmentation without quantized information loss. Extensive experiments on the SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that our SFCNet outperforms the 2D image-based semantic segmentation methods based on conventional spherical projection.

Due to the inherent challenges in capturing satellite data, acquiring ample SAR training samples is infeasible. For instance, for a particular category of ship in the open sea, we can collect only few-shot SAR images which are too limited to derive effective ship recognition models. If large-scale models pre-trained with regular images can be adapted to generating novel SAR images, the problem is solved. In preliminary study, we found that fine-tuning these models with few-shot SAR images is not working, as the models can not capture the two primary differences between SAR and regular images: structure and modality. To address this, we propose a 2-stage low-rank adaptation method, and we call it 2LoRA. In the first stage, the model is adapted using aerial-view regular image data (whose structure matches SAR), followed by the second stage where the base model from the first stage is further adapted using SAR modality data. Particularly in the second stage, we introduce a novel prototype LoRA (pLoRA), as an improved version of 2LoRA, to resolve the class imbalance problem in SAR datasets. For evaluation, we employ the resulting generation model to synthesize additional SAR data. This augmentation, when integrated into the training process of SAR classification as well as segmentation models, yields notably improved performance for minor classes",

    "abstract": "Clouds in optical satellite images are a major concern since their presence hinders the ability to carry accurate analysis as well as processing. Presence of clouds also affects the image tasking schedule and results in wastage of valuable storage space on ground as well as space-based systems. Due to these reasons, deriving accurate cloud masks from optical remote-sensing images is an important task. Traditional methods such as threshold-based, spatial filtering for cloud detection in satellite images suffer from lack of accuracy. In recent years, deep learning algorithms have emerged as a promising approach to solve image segmentation problems as it allows pixel-level classification and semantic-level segmentation. In this paper, we introduce a deep-learning model based on hybrid transformer architecture for effective cloud mask generation named CLiSA - Cloud segmentation via Lipschitz Stable Attention network. In this context, we propose an concept of orthogonal self-attention combined with hierarchical cross attention model, and we validate its Lipschitz stability theoretically and empirically. We design the whole setup under adversarial setting in presence of Lov\\'asz-Softmax loss. We demonstrate both qualitative and quantitative outcomes for multiple satellite image datasets including Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, and Cartosat-2s.

    "abstract": "Whole slide image (WSI) classification requires repetitive zoom-in and out for pathologists, as only small portions of the slide may be relevant to detecting cancer. Due to the lack of patch-level labels, multiple instance learning (MIL) is a common practice for training a WSI classifier. One of the challenges in MIL for WSIs is the weak supervision coming only from the slide-level labels, often resulting in severe overfitting. In response, researchers have considered adopting patch-level augmentation or applying mixup augmentation, but their applicability remains unverified. Our approach augments the training dataset by sampling a subset of patches in the WSI without significantly altering the underlying semantics of the original slides. Additionally, we introduce an efficient model (Slot-MIL) that organizes patches into a fixed number of slots, the abstract representation of patches, using an attention mechanism. We empirically demonstrate that the subsampling augmentation helps to make more informative slots by restricting the over-concentration of attention and to improve interpretability. Finally, we illustrate that combining our attention-based aggregation model with subsampling and mixup, which has shown limited compatibility in existing MIL methods, can enhance both generalization and calibration.

    "title": "DSText V2: A Comprehensive Video Text Spotting Dataset for Dense and Small Text",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Recently, video text detection, tracking, and recognition in natural scenes are becoming very popular in the computer vision community. However, most existing algorithms and benchmarks focus on common text cases (e.g., normal size, density) and single scenario, while ignoring extreme video text challenges, i.e., dense and small text in various scenarios. In this paper, we establish a video text reading benchmark, named DSText V2, which focuses on Dense and Small text reading challenges in the video with various scenarios. Compared with the previous datasets, the proposed dataset mainly include three new challenges: 1) Dense video texts, a new challenge for video text spotters to track and read. 2) High-proportioned small texts, coupled with the blurriness and distortion in the video, will bring further challenges. 3) Various new scenarios, e.g., Game, Sports, etc. The proposed DSText V2 includes 140 video clips from 7 open scenarios, supporting three tasks, i.e., video text detection (Task 1), video text tracking (Task 2), and end-to-end video text spotting (Task 3). In this article, we describe detailed statistical information of the dataset, tasks, evaluation protocols, and the results summaries. Most importantly, a thorough investigation and analysis targeting three unique challenges derived from our dataset are provided, aiming to provide new insights. Moreover, we hope the benchmark will promise video text research in the community. DSText v2 is built upon DSText v1, which was previously introduced to organize the ICDAR 2023 competition for dense and small video text",

    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "In this study, our goal is to create interactive avatar agents that can autonomously plan and animate nuanced facial movements realistically, from both visual and behavioral perspectives. Given high-level inputs about the environment and agent profile, our framework harnesses LLMs to produce a series of detailed text descriptions of the avatar agents' facial motions. These descriptions are then processed by our task-agnostic driving engine into motion token sequences, which are subsequently converted into continuous motion embeddings that are further consumed by our standalone neural-based renderer to generate the final photorealistic avatar animations. These streamlined processes allow our framework to adapt to a variety of non-verbal avatar interactions, both monadic and dyadic. Our extensive study, which includes experiments on both newly compiled and existing datasets featuring two types of agents -- one capable of monadic interaction with the environment, and the other designed for dyadic conversation -- validates the effectiveness and versatility of our approach. To our knowledge, we advanced a leap step by combining LLMs and neural rendering for generalized non-verbal prediction and photo-realistic rendering of avatar agents",

    "title": "When StyleGAN Meets Stable Diffusion: a $\\mathscr{W}_+$ Adapter for Personalized Image Generation",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Text-to-image diffusion models have remarkably excelled in producing diverse, high-quality, and photo-realistic images. This advancement has spurred a growing interest in incorporating specific identities into generated content. Most current methods employ an inversion approach to embed a target visual concept into the text embedding space using a single reference image. However, the newly synthesized faces either closely resemble the reference image in terms of facial attributes, such as expression, or exhibit a reduced capacity for identity preservation. Text descriptions intended to guide the facial attributes of the synthesized face may fall short, owing to the intricate entanglement of identity information with identity-irrelevant facial attributes derived from the reference image. To address these issues, we present the novel use of the extended StyleGAN embedding space $\\mathcal{W}_+$, to achieve enhanced identity preservation and disentanglement for diffusion models. By aligning this semantically meaningful human face latent space with text-to-image diffusion models, we succeed in maintaining high fidelity in identity preservation, coupled with the capacity for semantic editing. Additionally, we propose new training objectives to balance the influences of both prompt and identity conditions, ensuring that the identity-irrelevant background remains unaffected during facial attribute modifications. Extensive experiments reveal that our method adeptly generates personalized text-to-image outputs that are not only compatible with prompt descriptions but also amenable to common StyleGAN editing directions in diverse settings.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "For a long time, in the field of reconstructing 3D human bodies from monocular images, most methods opted to simplify the task by minimizing the influence of the camera. Using a coarse focal length setting results in the reconstructed bodies not aligning well with distorted images. Ignoring camera rotation leads to an unrealistic reconstructed body pose in world space. Consequently, existing methods' application scenarios are confined to controlled environments. And they struggle to achieve accurate and reasonable reconstruction in world space when confronted with complex and diverse in-the-wild images. To address the above issues, we propose W-HMR, which decouples global body recovery into camera calibration, local body recovery and global body orientation correction. We design the first weak-supervised camera calibration method for body distortion, eliminating dependence on focal length labels and achieving finer mesh-image alignment. We propose a novel orientation correction module to allow the reconstructed human body to remain normal in world space. Decoupling body orientation and body pose enables our model to consider the accuracy in camera coordinate and the reasonableness in world coordinate simultaneously, expanding the range of applications. As a result, W-HMR achieves high-quality reconstruction in dual coordinate systems, particularly in challenging scenes. Codes will be released on https://yw0208.github.io/ after publication",

    "abstract": "Scene flow estimation, which aims to predict per-point 3D displacements of dynamic scenes, is a fundamental task in the computer vision field. However, previous works commonly suffer from unreliable correlation caused by locally constrained searching ranges, and struggle with accumulated inaccuracy arising from the coarse-to-fine structure. To alleviate these problems, we propose a novel uncertainty-aware scene flow estimation network (DifFlow3D) with the diffusion probabilistic model. Iterative diffusion-based refinement is designed to enhance the correlation robustness and resilience to challenging cases, e.g., dynamics, noisy inputs, repetitive patterns, etc. To restrain the generation diversity, three key flow-related features are leveraged as conditions in our diffusion model. Furthermore, we also develop an uncertainty estimation module within diffusion to evaluate the reliability of estimated scene flow. Our DifFlow3D achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 6.7\\% and 19.1\\% EPE3D reduction respectively on FlyingThings3D and KITTI 2015 datasets. Notably, our method achieves an unprecedented millimeter-level accuracy (0.0089m in EPE3D) on the KITTI dataset. Additionally, our diffusion-based refinement paradigm can be readily integrated as a plug-and-play module into existing scene flow networks, significantly increasing their estimation accuracy.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating realistic images but suffer from generating accurate human hands, such as incorrect finger counts or irregular shapes. This difficulty arises from the complex task of learning the physical structure and pose of hands from training images, which involves extensive deformations and occlusions. For correct hand generation, our paper introduces a lightweight post-processing solution called $\\textbf{HandRefiner}$. HandRefiner employs a conditional inpainting approach to rectify malformed hands while leaving other parts of the image untouched. We leverage the hand mesh reconstruction model that consistently adheres to the correct number of fingers and hand shape, while also being capable of fitting the desired hand pose in the generated image. Given a generated failed image due to malformed hands, we utilize ControlNet modules to re-inject such correct hand information. Additionally, we uncover a phase transition phenomenon within ControlNet as we vary the control strength. It enables us to take advantage of more readily available synthetic data without suffering from the domain gap between realistic and synthetic hands. Experiments demonstrate that HandRefiner can significantly improve the generation quality quantitatively and qualitatively. The code is available at https://github.com/wenquanlu/HandRefiner",

Extensive experiments on three datasets for two tasks (i.e., continual semantic and instance segmentation are conducted to demonstrate that CISDQ achieves the state-of-the-art performance, specifically, obtaining 4.4% and 2.9% mIoU improvements for the ADE 100-10 (6 steps) setting and ADE 100-5 (11 steps) setting",

    "abstract": "Recent progress in computer vision-oriented neural network designs is mostly driven by capturing high-order neural interactions among inputs and features. And there emerged a variety of approaches to accomplish this, such as Transformers and its variants. However, these interactions generate a large amount of intermediate state and/or strong data dependency, leading to considerable memory consumption and computing cost, and therefore compromising the overall runtime performance. To address this challenge, we rethink the high-order interactive neural network design with a quadratic computing approach. Specifically, we propose QuadraNet -- a comprehensive model design methodology from neuron reconstruction to structural block and eventually to the overall neural network implementation. Leveraging quadratic neurons' intrinsic high-order advantages and dedicated computation optimization schemes, QuadraNet could effectively achieve optimal cognition and computation performance. Incorporating state-of-the-art hardware-aware neural architecture search and system integration techniques, QuadraNet could also be well generalized in different hardware constraint settings and deployment scenarios. The experiment shows thatQuadraNet achieves up to 1.5$\\times$ throughput, 30% less memory footprint, and similar cognition performance, compared with the state-of-the-art high-order approaches",

However, these models often require large datasets labeled with bounding box annotations which are expensive to curate, prohibiting the development of models for new tasks and geographies. To address this challenge, we develop weakly-semi-supervised object detection (WSSOD) models on remotely sensed imagery which can leverage a small amount of bounding boxes together with a large amount of point labels that are easy to acquire at scale in geospatial data. We train WSSOD models which use large amounts of point-labeled images with varying fractions of bounding box labeled images in FAIR1M and a wind turbine detection dataset, and demonstrate that they substantially outperform fully supervised models trained with the same amount of bounding box labeled images on both datasets. Furthermore, we find that the WSSOD models trained with 2-10x fewer bounding box labeled images can perform similarly to or outperform fully supervised models trained on the full set of bounding-box labeled images. We believe that the approach can be extended to other remote sensing tasks to reduce reliance on bounding box labels and increase development of models for impactful applications",

    "abstract": "We present MM-Narrator, a novel system leveraging GPT-4 with multimodal in-context learning for the generation of audio descriptions (AD). Unlike previous methods that primarily focused on downstream fine-tuning with short video clips, MM-Narrator excels in generating precise audio descriptions for videos of extensive lengths, even beyond hours, in an autoregressive manner. This capability is made possible by the proposed memory-augmented generation process, which effectively utilizes both the short-term textual context and long-term visual memory through an efficient register-and-recall mechanism. These contextual memories compile pertinent past information, including storylines and character identities, ensuring an accurate tracking and depicting of story-coherent and character-centric audio descriptions. Maintaining the training-free design of MM-Narrator, we further propose a complexity-based demonstration selection strategy to largely enhance its multi-step reasoning capability via few-shot multimodal in-context learning (MM-ICL). Experimental results on MAD-eval dataset demonstrate that MM-Narrator consistently outperforms both the existing fine-tuning-based approaches and LLM-based approaches in most scenarios, as measured by standard evaluation metrics. Additionally, we introduce the first segment-based evaluator for recurrent text generation.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Sparse adversarial attacks fool deep neural networks (DNNs) through minimal pixel perturbations, typically regularized by the $\\ell_0$ norm. Recent efforts have replaced this norm with a structural sparsity regularizer, such as the nuclear group norm, to craft group-wise sparse adversarial attacks. The resulting perturbations are thus explainable and hold significant practical relevance, shedding light on an even greater vulnerability of DNNs than previously anticipated. However, crafting such attacks poses an optimization challenge, as it involves computing norms for groups of pixels within a non-convex objective. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by presenting an algorithm that simultaneously generates group-wise sparse attacks within semantically meaningful areas of an image. In each iteration, the core operation of our algorithm involves the optimization of a quasinorm adversarial loss. This optimization is achieved by employing the $1/2$-quasinorm proximal operator for some iterations, a method tailored for nonconvex programming. Subsequently, the algorithm transitions to a projected Nesterov's accelerated gradient descent with $2$-norm regularization applied to perturbation magnitudes. We rigorously evaluate the efficacy of our novel attack in both targeted and non-targeted attack scenarios, on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. When compared to state-of-the-art methods, our attack consistently results in a remarkable increase in group-wise sparsity, e.g., an increase of $48.12\\%$ on CIFAR-10 and $40.78\\%$ on ImageNet (average case, targeted attack), all while maintaining lower perturbation magnitudes. Notably, this performance is complemented by a significantly faster computation time and a $100\\%$ attack success rate",

    "abstract": "Scene text image super-resolution (STISR) aims at simultaneously increasing the resolution and readability of low-resolution scene text images, thus boosting the performance of the downstream recognition task. Two factors in scene text images, semantic information and visual structure, affect the recognition performance significantly. To mitigate the effects from these factors, this paper proposes a Prior-Enhanced Attention Network (PEAN). Specifically, a diffusion-based module is developed to enhance the text prior, hence offering better guidance for the SR network to generate SR images with higher semantic accuracy. Meanwhile, the proposed PEAN leverages an attention-based modulation module to understand scene text images by neatly perceiving the local and global dependence of images, despite the shape of the text. A multi-task learning paradigm is employed to optimize the network, enabling the model to generate legible SR images. As a result, PEAN establishes new SOTA results on the TextZoom benchmark. Experiments are also conducted to analyze the importance of the enhanced text prior as a means of improving the performance of the SR network.

    "abstract": "Over the past decade, significant advances have been made in the field of image search for e-commerce applications. Traditional image-to-image retrieval models, which focus solely on image details such as texture, tend to overlook useful semantic information contained within the images. As a result, the retrieved products might possess similar image details, but fail to fulfil the user's search goals. Moreover, the use of image-to-image retrieval models for products containing multiple images results in significant online product feature storage overhead and complex mapping implementations. In this paper, we report the design and deployment of the proposed Multi-modal Item Embedding Model (MIEM) to address these limitations. It is capable of utilizing both textual information and multiple images about a product to construct meaningful product features. By leveraging semantic information from images, MIEM effectively supplements the image search process, improving the overall accuracy of retrieval results. MIEM has become an integral part of the Shopee image search platform.

    "abstract": "Multi-modal human action segmentation is a critical and challenging task with a wide range of applications. Nowadays, the majority of approaches concentrate on the fusion of dense signals (i.e., RGB, optical flow, and depth maps). However, the potential contributions of sparse IoT sensor signals, which can be crucial for achieving accurate recognition, have not been fully explored. To make up for this, we introduce a Sparse signalguided Transformer (SigFormer) to combine both dense and sparse signals. We employ mask attention to fuse localized features by constraining cross-attention within the regions where sparse signals are valid. However, since sparse signals are discrete, they lack sufficient information about the temporal action boundaries. Therefore, in SigFormer, we propose to emphasize the boundary information at two stages to alleviate this problem. In the first feature extraction stage, we introduce an intermediate bottleneck module to jointly learn both category and boundary features of each dense modality through the inner loss functions. After the fusion of dense modalities and sparse signals, we then devise a two-branch architecture that explicitly models the interrelationship between action category and temporal boundary. Experimental results demonstrate that SigFormer outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on a multi-modal action segmentation dataset from real industrial environments, reaching an outstanding F1 score of 0.958.

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of generating whole-body motion from speech. Despite great successes, prior methods still struggle to produce reasonable and diverse whole-body motions from speech. This is due to their reliance on suboptimal representations and a lack of strategies for generating diverse results. To address these challenges, we present a novel hybrid point representation to achieve accurate and continuous motion generation, e.g., avoiding foot skating, and this representation can be transformed into an easy-to-use representation, i.e., SMPL-X body mesh, for many applications. To generate whole-body motion from speech, for facial motion, closely tied to the audio signal, we introduce an encoder-decoder architecture to achieve deterministic outcomes. However, for the body and hands, which have weaker connections to the audio signal, we aim to generate diverse yet reasonable motions. To boost diversity in motion generation, we propose a contrastive motion learning method to encourage the model to produce more distinctive representations. Specifically, we design a robust VQ-VAE to learn a quantized motion codebook using our hybrid representation. Then, we regress the motion representation from the audio signal by a translation model employing our contrastive motion learning method. Experimental results validate the superior performance and the correctness of our model.

Various recent RIS models have achieved state-of-the-art performance by generating contextual tokens to model multimodal features from pretrained encoders and effectively fusing them using transformer-based cross-modal attention. While these methods match language features with image features to effectively identify likely target objects, they often struggle to correctly understand contextual information in complex and ambiguous sentences and scenes. To address this issue, we propose a novel bidirectional token-masking autoencoder (BTMAE) inspired by the masked autoencoder (MAE). The proposed model learns the context of image-to-language and language-to-image by reconstructing missing features in both image and language features at the token level. In other words, this approach involves mutually complementing across the features of images and language, with a focus on enabling the network to understand interconnected deep contextual information between the two modalities. This learning method enhances the robustness of RIS performance in complex sentences and scenes.

    "title": "Talking Head(?) Anime from a Single Image 4: Improved Model and Its Distillation",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "We study the problem of creating a character model that can be controlled in real time from a single image of an anime character. A solution to this problem would greatly reduce the cost of creating avatars, computer games, and other interactive applications. Talking Head Anime 3 (THA3) is an open source project that attempts to directly addresses the problem. It takes as input (1) an image of an anime character's upper body and (2) a 45-dimensional pose vector and outputs a new image of the same character taking the specified pose. The range of possible movements is expressive enough for personal avatars and certain types of game characters. However, the system is too slow to generate animations in real time on common PCs, and its image quality can be improved. In this paper, we improve THA3 in two ways. First, we propose new architectures for constituent networks that rotate the character's head and body based on U-Nets with attention that are widely used in modern generative models. The new architectures consistently yield better image quality than the THA3 baseline. Nevertheless, they also make the whole system much slower: it takes up to 150 milliseconds to generate a frame. Second, we propose a technique to distill the system into a small network (less than 2 MB) that can generate 512x512 animation frames in real time (under 30 FPS) using consumer gaming GPUs while keeping the image quality close to that of the full system. This improvement makes the whole system practical for real-time applications",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) which typically follows a neural message passing framework to model dependencies among skeletal joints has achieved high success in skeleton-based human motion prediction task. Nevertheless, how to construct a graph from a skeleton sequence and how to perform message passing on the graph are still open problems, which severely affect the performance of GCN. To solve both problems, this paper presents a Dynamic Dense Graph Convolutional Network (DD-GCN), which constructs a dense graph and implements an integrated dynamic message passing. More specifically, we construct a dense graph with 4D adjacency modeling as a comprehensive representation of motion sequence at different levels of abstraction. Based on the dense graph, we propose a dynamic message passing framework that learns dynamically from data to generate distinctive messages reflecting sample-specific relevance among nodes in the graph. Extensive experiments on benchmark Human 3.6M and CMU Mocap datasets verify the effectiveness of our DD-GCN which obviously outperforms state-of-the-art GCN-based methods, especially when using long-term and our proposed extremely long-term protocol",

    "abstract": "The ability to perceive how objects change over time is a crucial ingredient in human intelligence.

To remedy this issue, we present VITATECS, a diagnostic VIdeo-Text dAtaset for the evaluation of TEmporal Concept underStanding. Specifically, we first introduce a fine-grained taxonomy of temporal concepts in natural language in order to diagnose the capability of VidLMs to comprehend different temporal aspects. Furthermore, to disentangle the correlation between static and temporal information, we generate counterfactual video descriptions that differ from the original one only in the specified temporal aspect. We employ a semi-automatic data collection framework using large language models and human-in-the-loop annotation to obtain high-quality counterfactual descriptions efficiently. Evaluation of representative video-language understanding models confirms their deficiency in temporal understanding, revealing the need for greater emphasis on the temporal elements in video-language research",

Most existing image datasets focus on trichromatic intensity images to mimic human vision. However, polarization and spectrum, the wave properties of light that animals in harsh environments and with limited brain capacity often rely on, remain underrepresented in existing datasets. Although spectro-polarimetric datasets exist, these datasets have insufficient object diversity, limited illumination conditions, linear-only polarization data, and inadequate image count. Here, we introduce two spectro-polarimetric datasets: trichromatic Stokes images and hyperspectral Stokes images. These novel datasets encompass both linear and circular polarization; they introduce multiple spectral channels; and they feature a broad selection of real-world scenes. With our dataset in hand, we analyze the spectro-polarimetric image statistics, develop efficient representations of such high-dimensional data, and evaluate spectral dependency of shape-from-polarization methods. As such, the proposed dataset promises a foundation for data-driven spectro-polarimetric imaging and vision research. Dataset and code will be publicly available",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Portable 360$^\\circ$ cameras are becoming a cheap and efficient tool to establish large visual databases. By capturing omnidirectional views of a scene, these cameras could expedite building environment models that are essential for visual localization. However, such an advantage is often overlooked due to the lack of valuable datasets. This paper introduces a new benchmark dataset, 360Loc, composed of 360$^\\circ$ images with ground truth poses for visual localization. We present a practical implementation of 360$^\\circ$ mapping combining 360$^\\circ$ images with lidar data to generate the ground truth 6DoF poses. 360Loc is the first dataset and benchmark that explores the challenge of cross-device visual positioning, involving 360$^\\circ$ reference frames, and query frames from pinhole, ultra-wide FoV fisheye, and 360$^\\circ$ cameras. We propose a virtual camera approach to generate lower-FoV query frames from 360$^\\circ$ images, which ensures a fair comparison of performance among different query types in visual localization tasks. We also extend this virtual camera approach to feature matching-based and pose regression-based methods to alleviate the performance loss caused by the cross-device domain gap, and evaluate its effectiveness against state-of-the-art baselines. We demonstrate that omnidirectional visual localization is more robust in challenging large-scale scenes with symmetries and repetitive structures. These results provide new insights into 360-camera mapping and omnidirectional visual localization with cross-device queries",

    "abstract": "The lightweight \"local-match-global\" matching introduced by SRe2L successfully creates a distilled dataset with comprehensive information on the full 224x224 ImageNet-1k. However, this one-sided approach is limited to a particular backbone, layer, and statistics, which limits the improvement of the generalization of a distilled dataset. We suggest that sufficient and various \"local-match-global\" matching are more precise and effective than a single one and has the ability to create a distilled dataset with richer information and better generalization. We call this perspective \"generalized matching\" and propose Generalized Various Backbone and Statistical Matching (G-VBSM) in this work, which aims to create a synthetic dataset with densities, ensuring consistency with the complete dataset across various backbones, layers, and statistics. As experimentally demonstrated, G-VBSM is the first algorithm to obtain strong performance across both small-scale and large-scale datasets. Specifically, G-VBSM achieves a performance of 38.7% on CIFAR-100 with 128-width ConvNet, 47.6% on Tiny-ImageNet with ResNet18, and 31.4% on the full 224x224 ImageNet-1k with ResNet18, under images per class (IPC) 10, 50, and 10, respectively.

    "abstract": "Monitoring wildfires is an essential step in minimizing their impact on the planet, understanding the many negative environmental, economic, and social consequences. Recent advances in remote sensing technology combined with the increasing application of artificial intelligence methods have improved real-time, high-resolution fire monitoring. This study explores two proposed approaches based on the U-Net model for automating and optimizing the burned-area mapping process. Denoted 128 and AllSizes (AS), they are trained on datasets with a different class balance by cropping input images to different sizes. They are then applied to Landsat imagery and time-series data from two fire-prone regions in Chile. The results obtained after enhancement of model performance by hyperparameter optimization demonstrate the effectiveness of both approaches. Tests based on 195 representative images of the study area show that increasing dataset balance using the AS model yields better performance. More specifically, AS exhibited a Dice Coefficient (DC) of 0.93, an Omission Error (OE) of 0.086, and a Commission Error (CE) of 0.045, while the 128 model achieved a DC of 0.86, an OE of 0.12, and a CE of 0.12.

We propose to retrieve useful data from the Web at test time based on test cases that the model is uncertain about. Different from existing retrieval-augmented approaches, we then update the model to address this underlying uncertainty.

While previous works focus on either recognition or prediction, we propose a generative Transformer VAE architecture to jointly capture both aspects, facilitating realistic motion prediction by leveraging the short-term hand motion and long-term action consistency observed across timestamps.To ensure faithful representation of the semantic dependency and different temporal granularity of hand pose and action, our framework is decomposed into two cascaded VAE blocks. The lower pose block models short-span poses, while the upper action block models long-span action. These are connected by a mid-level feature that represents sub-second series of hand poses.Our framework is trained across multiple datasets, where pose and action blocks are trained separately to fully utilize pose-action annotations of different qualities. Evaluations show that on multiple datasets, the joint modeling of recognition and prediction improves over separate solutions, and the semantic and temporal hierarchy enables long-term pose and action modeling",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we study multi-label atomic activity recognition. Despite the notable progress in action recognition, it is still challenging to recognize atomic activities due to a deficiency in a holistic understanding of both multiple road users' motions and their contextual information. In this paper, we introduce Action-slot, a slot attention-based approach that learns visual action-centric representations, capturing both motion and contextual information. Our key idea is to design action slots that are capable of paying attention to regions where atomic activities occur, without the need for explicit perception guidance. To further enhance slot attention, we introduce a background slot that competes with action slots, aiding the training process in avoiding unnecessary focus on background regions devoid of activities. Yet, the imbalanced class distribution in the existing dataset hampers the assessment of rare activities. To address the limitation, we collect a synthetic dataset called TACO, which is four times larger than OATS and features a balanced distribution of atomic activities. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct comprehensive experiments and ablation studies against various action recognition baselines. We also show that the performance of multi-label atomic activity recognition on real-world datasets can be improved by pretraining representations on TACO. We will release our source code and dataset. See the videos of visualization on the project page: https://hcis-lab.github.io/Action-slot/",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Human reasoning can be understood as a cooperation between the intuitive, associative \"System-1\" and the deliberative, logical \"System-2\". For existing System-1-like methods in visual activity understanding, it is crucial to integrate System-2 processing to improve explainability, generalization, and data efficiency. One possible path of activity reasoning is building a symbolic system composed of symbols and rules, where one rule connects multiple symbols, implying human knowledge and reasoning abilities. Previous methods have made progress, but are defective with limited symbols from handcraft and limited rules from visual-based annotations, failing to cover the complex patterns of activities and lacking compositional generalization. To overcome the defects, we propose a new symbolic system with two ideal important properties: broad-coverage symbols and rational rules. Collecting massive human knowledge via manual annotations is expensive to instantiate this symbolic system. Instead, we leverage the recent advancement of LLMs (Large Language Models) as an approximation of the two ideal properties, i.e., Symbols from Large Language Models (Symbol-LLM). Then, given an image, visual contents from the images are extracted and checked as symbols and activity semantics are reasoned out based on rules via fuzzy logic calculation. Our method shows superiority in extensive activity understanding tasks. Code and data are available at https://mvig-rhos.com/symbol_llm",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The Attention Restoration Theory (ART) presents a theoretical framework with four essential indicators (being away, extent, fascinating, and compatibility) for comprehending urban and natural restoration quality. However, previous studies relied on non-sequential data and non-spatial dependent methods, which overlooks the impact of spatial structure defined here as the positional relationships between scene entities on restoration quality. The past methods also make it challenging to measure restoration quality on an urban scale. In this work, a spatial-dependent graph neural networks (GNNs) approach is proposed to reveal the relation between spatial structure and restoration quality on an urban scale. Specifically, we constructed two different types of graphs at the street and city levels. The street-level graphs, using sequential street view images (SVIs) of road segments to capture position relationships between entities, were used to represent spatial structure. The city-level graph, modeling the topological relationships of roads as non-Euclidean data structures and embedding urban features (including Perception-features, Spatial-features, and Socioeconomic-features), was used to measure restoration quality. The results demonstrate that: 1) spatial-dependent GNNs model outperforms traditional methods (Acc = 0.735, F1 = 0.732); 2) spatial structure portrayed through sequential SVIs data significantly influences restoration quality; 3) spaces with the same restoration quality exhibited distinct spatial structures patterns. This study clarifies the association between spatial structure and restoration quality, providing a new perspective to improve urban well-being in the future",

    "abstract": "In the past decade, using Street View images and machine learning to measure human perception has become a mainstream research approach in urban science. However, this approach using only image-shallow information makes it difficult to comprehensively understand the deep semantic features of human perception of a scene. In this study, we proposed a new framework based on a pre-train natural language model to understand the relationship between human perception and the sense of a scene. Firstly, Place Pulse 2.0 was used as our base dataset, which contains a variety of human-perceived labels, namely, beautiful, safe, wealthy, depressing, boring, and lively. An image captioning network was used to extract the description information of each street view image. Secondly, a pre-trained BERT model was finetuning and added a regression function for six human perceptual dimensions. Furthermore, we compared the performance of five traditional regression methods with our approach and conducted a migration experiment in Hong Kong. Our results show that human perception scoring by deep semantic features performed better than previous studies by machine learning methods with shallow features. The use of deep scene semantic features provides new ideas for subsequent human perception research, as well as better explanatory power in the face of spatial heterogeneity",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The paradigm of pre-training and fine-tuning has laid the foundation for deploying deep learning models. However, most fine-tuning methods are designed to meet a specific resource budget. Recently, considering diverse deployment scenarios with various resource budgets, stitchable neural network (SN-Net) is introduced to quickly obtain numerous new networks (stitches) from the pre-trained models (anchors) in a model family via model stitching. Although promising, SN-Net confronts new challenges when adapting it to new target domains, including huge memory and storage requirements and a long and sub-optimal multistage adaptation process. In this work, we present a novel framework, Efficient Stitchable Task Adaptation (ESTA), to efficiently produce a palette of fine-tuned models that adhere to diverse resource constraints. Specifically, we first tailor parameter-efficient fine-tuning to share low-rank updates among the stitches while maintaining independent bias terms. In this way, we largely reduce fine-tuning memory burdens and mitigate the interference among stitches that arises in task adaptation. Furthermore, we streamline a simple yet effective one-stage deployment pipeline, which estimates the important stitches to deploy with training-time gradient statistics. By assigning higher sampling probabilities to important stitches, we also get a boosted Pareto frontier. Extensive experiments on 25 downstream visual recognition tasks demonstrate that our ESTA is capable of generating stitches with smooth accuracy-efficiency trade-offs and surpasses the direct SN-Net adaptation by remarkable margins with significantly lower training time and fewer trainable parameters. Furthermore, we demonstrate the flexibility and scalability of our ESTA framework by stitching LLMs from LLaMA family, obtaining chatbot stitches of assorted sizes",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "With the increasing consumption of 3D displays and virtual reality, multi-view video has become a promising format. However, its high resolution and multi-camera shooting result in a substantial increase in data volume, making storage and transmission a challenging task. To tackle these difficulties, we propose an implicit-explicit integrated representation for multi-view video compression. Specifically, we first use the explicit representation-based 2D video codec to encode one of the source views. Subsequently, we propose employing the implicit neural representation (INR)-based codec to encode the remaining views. The implicit codec takes the time and view index of multi-view video as coordinate inputs and generates the corresponding implicit reconstruction frames.To enhance the compressibility, we introduce a multi-level feature grid embedding and a fully convolutional architecture into the implicit codec. These components facilitate coordinate-feature and feature-RGB mapping, respectively. To further enhance the reconstruction quality from the INR codec, we leverage the high-quality reconstructed frames from the explicit codec to achieve inter-view compensation. Finally, the compensated results are fused with the implicit reconstructions from the INR to obtain the final reconstructed frames. Our proposed framework combines the strengths of both implicit neural representation and explicit 2D codec. Extensive experiments conducted on public datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework can achieve comparable or even superior performance to the latest multi-view video compression standard MIV and other INR-based schemes in terms of view compression and scene modeling",

We introduce DreamSync, a model-agnostic training algorithm by design that improves T2I models to be faithful to the text input. DreamSync builds off a recent insight from TIFA's evaluation framework -- that large vision-language models (VLMs) can effectively identify the fine-grained discrepancies between generated images and the text inputs. DreamSync uses this insight to train T2I models without any labeled data; it improves T2I models using its own generations. First, it prompts the model to generate several candidate images for a given input text. Then, it uses two VLMs to select the best generation: a Visual Question Answering model that measures the alignment of generated images to the text, and another that measures the generation's aesthetic quality. After selection, we use LoRA to iteratively finetune the T2I model to guide its generation towards the selected best generations. DreamSync does not need any additional human annotation. model architecture changes, or reinforcement learning. Despite its simplicity, DreamSync improves both the semantic alignment and aesthetic appeal of two diffusion-based T2I models, evidenced by multiple benchmarks (+1.7% on TIFA, +2.9% on DSG1K, +3.4% on VILA aesthetic) and human evaluation",

    "title": "Cross-Scope Spatial-Spectral Information Aggregation for Hyperspectral Image Super-Resolution",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Hyperspectral image super-resolution has attained widespread prominence to enhance the spatial resolution of hyperspectral images. However, convolution-based methods have encountered challenges in harnessing the global spatial-spectral information. The prevailing transformer-based methods have not adequately captured the long-range dependencies in both spectral and spatial dimensions. To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel cross-scope spatial-spectral Transformer (CST) to efficiently investigate long-range spatial and spectral similarities for single hyperspectral image super-resolution. Specifically, we devise cross-attention mechanisms in spatial and spectral dimensions to comprehensively model the long-range spatial-spectral characteristics. By integrating global information into the rectangle-window self-attention, we first design a cross-scope spatial self-attention to facilitate long-range spatial interactions. Then, by leveraging appropriately characteristic spatial-spectral features, we construct a cross-scope spectral self-attention to effectively capture the intrinsic correlations among global spectral bands. Finally, we elaborate a concise feed-forward neural network to enhance the feature representation capacity in the Transformer structure. Extensive experiments over three hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that the proposed CST is superior to other state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and visually.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Face recognition (FR) systems powered by deep learning have become widely used in various applications. However, they are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, especially those based on local adversarial patches that can be physically applied to real-world objects. In this paper, we propose RADAP, a robust and adaptive defense mechanism against diverse adversarial patches in both closed-set and open-set FR systems. RADAP employs innovative techniques, such as FCutout and F-patch, which use Fourier space sampling masks to improve the occlusion robustness of the FR model and the performance of the patch segmenter. Moreover, we introduce an edge-aware binary cross-entropy (EBCE) loss function to enhance the accuracy of patch detection. We also present the split and fill (SAF) strategy, which is designed to counter the vulnerability of the patch segmenter to complete white-box adaptive attacks. We conduct comprehensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of RADAP, which shows significant improvements in defense performance against various adversarial patches, while maintaining clean accuracy higher than that of the undefended Vanilla model",

    "title": "VideoAssembler: Identity-Consistent Video Generation with Reference Entities using Diffusion Model",
    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Identity-consistent video generation seeks to synthesize videos that are guided by both textual prompts and reference images of entities. Current approaches typically utilize cross-attention layers to integrate the appearance of the entity, which predominantly captures semantic attributes, resulting in compromised fidelity of entities. Moreover, these methods necessitate iterative fine-tuning for each new entity encountered, thereby limiting their applicability. To address these challenges, we introduce VideoAssembler, a novel end-to-end framework for identity-consistent video generation that can conduct inference directly when encountering new entities. VideoAssembler is adept at producing videos that are not only flexible with respect to the input reference entities but also responsive to textual conditions. Additionally, by modulating the quantity of input images for the entity, VideoAssembler enables the execution of tasks ranging from image-to-video generation to sophisticated video editing. VideoAssembler comprises two principal components: the Reference Entity Pyramid (REP) encoder and the Entity-Prompt Attention Fusion (EPAF) module. The REP encoder is designed to infuse comprehensive appearance details into the denoising stages of the stable diffusion model. Concurrently, the EPAF module is utilized to integrate text-aligned features effectively. Furthermore, to mitigate the challenge of scarce data, we present a methodology for the preprocessing of training data. Our evaluation of the VideoAssembler framework on the UCF-101, MSR-VTT, and DAVIS datasets indicates that it achieves good performances in both quantitative and qualitative analyses (346.84 in FVD and 48.01 in IS on UCF-101).

    "title": "Contrastive Vision-Language Alignment Makes Efficient Instruction Learner",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "We study the task of extending the large language model (LLM) into a vision-language instruction-following model. This task is crucial but challenging since the LLM is trained on text modality only, making it hard to effectively digest the visual modality. To address this, existing methods typically train a visual adapter to align the representation between a pre-trained vision transformer (ViT) and the LLM by a generative image captioning loss. However, we find that the generative objective can only produce weak alignment for vision and language, making the aligned vision-language model very hungry for the instruction fine-tuning data. In this paper, we propose CG-VLM that applies both Contrastive and Generative alignment objectives to effectively align the representation of ViT and LLM. Different from image level and sentence level alignment in common contrastive learning settings, CG-VLM aligns the image-patch level features and text-token level embeddings, which, however, is very hard to achieve as no explicit grounding patch-token relation provided in standard image captioning datasets. To address this issue, we propose to maximize the averaged similarity between pooled image-patch features and text-token embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed CG-VLM produces strong vision-language alignment and is an efficient instruction learner. For example, using only 10% instruction tuning data, we reach 95% performance of state-of-the-art method LLaVA [29] on the zero-shot ScienceQA-Image benchmark",

    "title": "eMotions: A Large-Scale Dataset for Emotion Recognition in Short Videos",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Nowadays, short videos (SVs) are essential to information acquisition and sharing in our life. The prevailing use of SVs to spread emotions leads to the necessity of emotion recognition in SVs. Considering the lack of SVs emotion data, we introduce a large-scale dataset named eMotions, comprising 27,996 videos. Meanwhile, we alleviate the impact of subjectivities on labeling quality by emphasizing better personnel allocations and multi-stage annotations. In addition, we provide the category-balanced and test-oriented variants through targeted data sampling. Some commonly used videos (e.g., facial expressions and postures) have been well studied. However, it is still challenging to understand the emotions in SVs. Since the enhanced content diversity brings more distinct semantic gaps and difficulties in learning emotion-related features, and there exists information gaps caused by the emotion incompleteness under the prevalently audio-visual co-expressions. To tackle these problems, we present an end-to-end baseline method AV-CPNet that employs the video transformer to better learn semantically relevant representations. We further design the two-stage cross-modal fusion module to complementarily model the correlations of audio-visual features. The EP-CE Loss, incorporating three emotion polarities, is then applied to guide model optimization. Extensive experimental results on nine datasets verify the effectiveness of AV-CPNet.

    "abstract": "Chest X-rays (CXR) often reveal rare diseases, demanding precise diagnosis. However, current computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) methods focus on common diseases, leading to inadequate detection of rare conditions due to the absence of comprehensive datasets. To overcome this, we present a novel benchmark for long-tailed multi-label classification in CXRs, encapsulating both common and rare thoracic diseases. Our approach includes developing the \"LTML-MIMIC-CXR\" dataset, an augmentation of MIMIC-CXR with 26 additional rare diseases. We propose a baseline method for this classification challenge, integrating adaptive negative regularization to address negative logits' over-suppression in tail classes, and a large loss reconsideration strategy for correcting noisy labels from automated annotations. Our evaluation on LTML-MIMIC-CXR demonstrates significant advancements in rare disease detection. This work establishes a foundation for robust CAD methods, achieving a balance in identifying a spectrum of thoracic diseases in CXRs.

Leveraging NeRF-based 3D-GAN, we generate new view face images for the source and target subjects to enhance transferability of adversarial patches. We introduce a style consistency loss to ensure the visual similarity between the adversarial UV map and the target UV map under a 0-1 mask, enhancing the effectiveness and naturalness of the generated adversarial face images.

    "title": "Towards Top-Down Reasoning: An Explainable Multi-Agent Approach for Visual Question Answering",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Recently, Vision Language Models (VLMs) have gained significant attention, exhibiting notable advancements across various tasks by leveraging extensive image-text paired data. However, prevailing VLMs often treat Visual Question Answering (VQA) as perception tasks, employing black-box models that overlook explicit modeling of relationships between different questions within the same visual scene. Moreover, the existing VQA methods that rely on Knowledge Bases (KBs) might frequently encounter biases from limited data and face challenges in relevant information indexing. Attempt to overcome these limitations, this paper introduces an explainable multi-agent collaboration framework by tapping into knowledge embedded in Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on extensive corpora. Inspired by human cognition, our framework uncovers latent information within the given question by employing three agents, i.e., Seeker, Responder, and Integrator, to perform a top-down reasoning process. The Seeker agent generates relevant issues related to the original question. The Responder agent, based on VLM, handles simple VQA tasks and provides candidate answers. The Integrator agent combines information from the Seeker agent and the Responder agent to produce the final VQA answer. Through the above collaboration mechanism, our framework explicitly constructs a multi-view knowledge base for a specific image scene, reasoning answers in a top-down processing manner. We extensively evaluate our method on diverse VQA datasets and VLMs, demonstrating its broad applicability and interpretability with comprehensive experimental results",

    "abstract": "Semi-supervised medical image segmentation studies have shown promise in training models with limited labeled data. However, current dominant teacher-student based approaches can suffer from the confirmation bias. To address this challenge, we propose AD-MT, an alternate diverse teaching approach in a teacher-student framework. It involves a single student model and two non-trainable teacher models that are momentum-updated periodically and randomly in an alternate fashion. To mitigate the confirmation bias from the diverse supervision, the core of AD-MT lies in two proposed modules: the Random Periodic Alternate (RPA) Updating Module and the Conflict-Combating Module (CCM). The RPA schedules the alternating diverse updating process with complementary data batches, distinct data augmentation, and random switching periods to encourage diverse reasoning from different teaching perspectives. The CCM employs an entropy-based ensembling strategy to encourage the model to learn from both the consistent and conflicting predictions between the teachers. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our AD-MT on the 2D and 3D medical segmentation benchmarks across various semi-supervised settings",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "This research focuses on the issue of single-image reflection removal (SIRR) in real-world conditions, examining it from two angles: the collection pipeline of real reflection pairs and the perception of real reflection locations. We devise an advanced reflection collection pipeline that is highly adaptable to a wide range of real-world reflection scenarios and incurs reduced costs in collecting large-scale aligned reflection pairs. In the process, we develop a large-scale, high-quality reflection dataset named Reflection Removal in the Wild (RRW). RRW contains over 14,950 high-resolution real-world reflection pairs, a dataset forty-five times larger than its predecessors. Regarding perception of reflection locations, we identify that numerous virtual reflection objects visible in reflection images are not present in the corresponding ground-truth images. This observation, drawn from the aligned pairs, leads us to conceive the Maximum Reflection Filter (MaxRF). The MaxRF could accurately and explicitly characterize reflection locations from pairs of images. Building upon this, we design a reflection location-aware cascaded framework, specifically tailored for SIRR. Powered by these innovative techniques, our solution achieves superior performance than current leading methods across multiple real-world benchmarks. Codes and datasets will be publicly available",

    "abstract": "Understanding human activity is a crucial yet intricate task in egocentric vision, a field that focuses on capturing visual perspectives from the camera wearer's viewpoint. While traditional methods heavily rely on representation learning trained on extensive video data, there exists a significant limitation: obtaining effective video representations proves challenging due to the inherent complexity and variability in human activities.Furthermore, exclusive dependence on video-based learning may constrain a model's capability to generalize across long-tail classes and out-of-distribution scenarios. In this study, we introduce a novel approach for long-term action anticipation using language models (LALM), adept at addressing the complex challenges of long-term activity understanding without the need for extensive training. Our method incorporates an action recognition model to track previous action sequences and a vision-language model to articulate relevant environmental details. By leveraging the context provided by these past events, we devise a prompting strategy for action anticipation using large language models (LLMs). Moreover, we implement Maximal Marginal Relevance for example selection to facilitate in-context learning of the LLMs. Our experimental results demonstrate that LALM surpasses the state-of-the-art methods in the task of long-term action anticipation on the Ego4D benchmark. We further validate LALM on two additional benchmarks, affirming its capacity for generalization across intricate activities with different sets of taxonomies.

    "abstract": "Large multi-modal models (LMMs) hold the potential to usher in a new era of automated visual assistance for people who are blind or low vision (BLV). Yet, these models have not been systematically evaluated on data captured by BLV users. We address this by empirically assessing CLIP, a widely-used LMM likely to underpin many assistive technologies. Testing 25 CLIP variants in a zero-shot classification task, we find that their accuracy is 15 percentage points lower on average for images captured by BLV users than web-crawled images. This disparity stems from CLIP's sensitivities to 1) image content (e.g. not recognizing disability objects as well as other objects); 2) image quality (e.g. not being robust to lighting variation); and 3) text content (e.g. not recognizing objects described by tactile adjectives as well as visual ones). We delve deeper with a textual analysis of three common pre-training datasets: LAION-400M, LAION-2B and DataComp-1B, showing that disability content is rarely mentioned. We then provide three examples that illustrate how the performance disparities extend to three downstream models underpinned by CLIP: OWL-ViT, CLIPSeg and DALL-E2. We find that few-shot learning with as few as 5 images can mitigate CLIP's quality-of-service disparities for BLV users in some scenarios, which we discuss alongside a set of other possible mitigations",

However, these approaches fail to harness the characteristics of FMs, with their large number of parameters still posing a challenge to communication efficiency, even at these bitrate regimes. In this work, we present DeltaMask, a novel method that efficiently fine-tunes FMs in FL at an ultra-low bitrate, well below 1 bpp. DeltaMask employs stochastic masking to detect highly effective subnetworks within FMs and leverage stochasticity and sparsity in client masks to compress updates into a compact grayscale image using probabilistic filters, deviating from traditional weight training approaches. Our comprehensive evaluations across various datasets and architectures demonstrate DeltaMask efficiently achieves bitrates as low as 0.09 bpp, enhancing communication efficiency while maintaining FMs performance, as measured on 8 datasets and 5 pre-trained models of various network architectures",

However, labeling event streams with high temporal resolutions for supervised training is costly. We address this issue with LEOD, the first framework for label-efficient event-based detection. Our method unifies weakly- and semi-supervised object detection with a self-training mechanism. We first utilize a detector pre-trained on limited labels to produce pseudo ground truth on unlabeled events, and then re-train the detector with both real and generated labels. Leveraging the temporal consistency of events, we run bi-directional inference and apply tracking-based post-processing to enhance the quality of pseudo labels. To stabilize training, we further design a soft anchor assignment strategy to mitigate the noise in labels. We introduce new experimental protocols to evaluate the task of label-efficient event-based detection on Gen1 and 1Mpx datasets. LEOD consistently outperforms supervised baselines across various labeling ratios. For example, on Gen1, it improves mAP by 8.6% and 7.8% for RVT-S trained with 1% and 2% labels. On 1Mpx, RVT-S with 10% labels even surpasses its fully-supervised counterpart using 100% labels. LEOD maintains its effectiveness even when all labeled data are available, reaching new state-of-the-art results. Finally, we show that our method readily scales to improve larger detectors as well",

    "abstract": "To build scalable models for challenging real-world tasks, it is important to learn from diverse, multi-modal data in various forms (e.g., videos, text, and images). Among the existing works, a plethora of them have focused on leveraging large but cumbersome cross-modal architectures. Regardless of their effectiveness, larger architectures unavoidably prevent the models from being extended to real-world applications, so building a lightweight VL architecture and an efficient learning schema is of great practical value. In this paper, we propose an Efficient Video-Language Model (dubbed as E-ViLM) and a masked video modeling (MVM) schema, assisted with a semantic vector-quantized tokenizer. In particular, our E-ViLM learns to reconstruct the semantic labels of masked video regions, produced by the pre-trained vector-quantized tokenizer, which discretizes the continuous visual signals into labels. We show that with our simple MVM task and regular VL pre-training modelings, our E-ViLM, despite its compactness, is able to learn expressive representations from Video-Language corpus and generalize well to extensive Video-Language tasks including video question answering, text-to-video retrieval, etc. In particular, our E-ViLM obtains obvious efficiency improvements by reaching competing performances with faster inference speed, i.e., our model reaches $39.3$% Top-$1$ accuracy on the MSRVTT benchmark, retaining $91.4$% of the accuracy of state-of-the-art larger VL architecture with only $15%$ parameters and $94.8%$ fewer GFLOPs.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "We propose SceneTex, a novel method for effectively generating high-quality and style-consistent textures for indoor scenes using depth-to-image diffusion priors. Unlike previous methods that either iteratively warp 2D views onto a mesh surface or distillate diffusion latent features without accurate geometric and style cues, SceneTex formulates the texture synthesis task as an optimization problem in the RGB space where style and geometry consistency are properly reflected. At its core, SceneTex proposes a multiresolution texture field to implicitly encode the mesh appearance. We optimize the target texture via a score-distillation-based objective function in respective RGB renderings. To further secure the style consistency across views, we introduce a cross-attention decoder to predict the RGB values by cross-attending to the pre-sampled reference locations in each instance. SceneTex enables various and accurate texture synthesis for 3D-FRONT scenes, demonstrating significant improvements in visual quality and prompt fidelity over the prior texture generation methods",

    "title": "Pattern retrieval of traffic congestion using graph-based associations of traffic domain-specific features",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The fast-growing amount of traffic data brings many opportunities for revealing more insightful information about traffic dynamics. However, it also demands an effective database management system in which information retrieval is arguably an important feature. The ability to locate similar patterns in big datasets potentially paves the way for further valuable analyses in traffic management. This paper proposes a content-based retrieval system for spatiotemporal patterns of highway traffic congestion. There are two main components in our framework, namely pattern representation and similarity measurement. To effectively interpret retrieval outcomes, the paper proposes a graph-based approach (relation-graph) for the former component, in which fundamental traffic phenomena are encoded as nodes and their spatiotemporal relationships as edges. In the latter component, the similarities between congestion patterns are customizable with various aspects according to user expectations. We evaluated the proposed framework by applying it to a dataset of hundreds of patterns with various complexities (temporally and spatially). The example queries indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method, i.e. the obtained patterns present similar traffic phenomena as in the given examples. In addition, the success of the proposed approach directly derives a new opportunity for semantic retrieval, in which expected patterns are described by adopting the relation-graph notion to associate fundamental traffic phenomena",

    "title": "Scene Summarization: Clustering Scene Videos into Spatially Diverse Frames",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "We propose scene summarization as a new video-based scene understanding task. It aims to summarize a long video walkthrough of a scene into a small set of frames that are spatially diverse in the scene, which has many impotant applications, such as in surveillance, real estate, and robotics. It stems from video summarization but focuses on long and continuous videos from moving cameras, instead of user-edited fragmented video clips that are more commonly studied in existing video summarization works. Our solution to this task is a two-stage self-supervised pipeline named SceneSum. Its first stage uses clustering to segment the video sequence. Our key idea is to combine visual place recognition (VPR) into this clustering process to promote spatial diversity. Its second stage needs to select a representative keyframe from each cluster as the summary while respecting resource constraints such as memory and disk space limits. Additionally, if the ground truth image trajectory is available, our method can be easily augmented with a supervised loss to enhance the clustering and keyframe selection. Extensive experiments on both real-world and simulated datasets show our method outperforms common video summarization baselines by 50%",

    "title": "LightGaussian: Unbounded 3D Gaussian Compression with 15x Reduction and 200+ FPS",
    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Recent advancements in real-time neural rendering using point-based techniques have paved the way for the widespread adoption of 3D representations. However, foundational approaches like 3D Gaussian Splatting come with a substantial storage overhead caused by growing the SfM points to millions, often demanding gigabyte-level disk space for a single unbounded scene, posing significant scalability challenges and hindering the splatting efficiency. To address this challenge, we introduce LightGaussian, a novel method designed to transform 3D Gaussians into a more efficient and compact format. Drawing inspiration from the concept of Network Pruning, LightGaussian identifies Gaussians that are insignificant in contributing to the scene reconstruction and adopts a pruning and recovery process, effectively reducing redundancy in Gaussian counts while preserving visual effects. Additionally, LightGaussian employs distillation and pseudo-view augmentation to distill spherical harmonics to a lower degree, allowing knowledge transfer to more compact representations while maintaining reflectance. Furthermore, we propose a hybrid scheme, VecTree Quantization, to quantize all attributes, resulting in lower bitwidth representations with minimal accuracy losses. In summary, LightGaussian achieves an averaged compression rate over 15x while boosting the FPS from 139 to 215, enabling an efficient representation of complex scenes on Mip-NeRF 360, Tank and Temple datasets.

In this paper, we propose a persistent homology guided approach (PHG-Net) that explores topological features of objects for medical image classification. For an input image, we first compute its cubical persistence diagram and extract topological features into a vector representation using a small neural network (called the PH module). The extracted topological features are then incorporated into the feature map generated by CNN or Transformer for feature fusion. The PH module is lightweight and capable of integrating topological features into any CNN or Transformer architectures in an end-to-end fashion.

    "abstract": "Recently, temporal action detection (TAD) has seen significant performance improvement with end-to-end training. However, due to the memory bottleneck, only models with limited scales and limited data volumes can afford end-to-end training, which inevitably restricts TAD performance. In this paper, we reduce the memory consumption for end-to-end training, and manage to scale up the TAD backbone to 1 billion parameters and the input video to 1,536 frames, leading to significant detection performance. The key to our approach lies in our proposed temporal-informative adapter (TIA), which is a novel lightweight module that reduces training memory. Using TIA, we free the humongous backbone from learning to adapt to the TAD task by only updating the parameters in TIA. TIA also leads to better TAD representation by temporally aggregating context from adjacent frames throughout the backbone. We evaluate our model across four representative datasets. Owing to our efficient design, we are able to train end-to-end on VideoMAEv2-giant and achieve 75.4% mAP on THUMOS14, being the first end-to-end model to outperform the best feature-based methods",

    "abstract": "Computational models trained on a large amount of natural images are the state-of-the-art to study human vision - usually adult vision. Computational models of infant vision and its further development are gaining more and more attention in the community. In this work we aim at the very beginning of our visual experience - pre- and post-natal retinal waves which suggest to be a pre-training mechanism for the primate visual system at a very early stage of development. We see this approach as an instance of biologically plausible data driven inductive bias through pre-training. We built a computational model that mimics this development mechanism by pre-training different artificial convolutional neural networks with simulated retinal wave images. The resulting features of this biologically plausible pre-training closely match the V1 features of the primate visual system. We show that the performance gain by pre-training with retinal waves is similar to a state-of-the art pre-training pipeline. Our framework contains the retinal wave generator, as well as a training strategy, which can be a first step in a curriculum learning based training diet for various models of development. We release code, data and trained networks to build the basis for future work on visual development and based on a curriculum learning approach including prenatal development to support studies of innate vs. learned properties of the primate visual system.

Contrasted with other training paradigms like supervised learning and unsupervised contrastive learning, masked image modeling (MIM) pretraining typically demands significant computational resources in order to manage large training data batches (e.g., 4096). The significant memory and computation requirements pose a considerable challenge to its broad adoption. To mitigate this, we introduce a novel learning framework, termed~\\textit{Block-Wise Masked Image Modeling} (BIM). This framework involves decomposing the MIM tasks into several sub-tasks with independent computation patterns, resulting in block-wise back-propagation operations instead of the traditional end-to-end approach. Our proposed BIM maintains superior performance compared to conventional MIM while greatly reducing peak memory consumption. Moreover, BIM naturally enables the concurrent training of numerous DNN backbones of varying depths. This leads to the creation of multiple trained DNN backbones, each tailored to different hardware platforms with distinct computing capabilities. This approach significantly reduces computational costs in comparison with training each DNN backbone individually. Our framework offers a promising solution for resource constrained training of MIM",

Previous work interprets vectors in an interpretable latent space of diffusion models as semantic concepts. However, existing approaches cannot discover directions for arbitrary concepts, such as those related to inappropriate concepts. In this work, we propose a novel self-supervised approach to find interpretable latent directions for a given concept.

    "abstract": "Active recognition, which allows intelligent agents to explore observations for better recognition performance, serves as a prerequisite for various embodied AI tasks, such as grasping, navigation and room arrangements. Given the evolving environment and the multitude of object classes, it is impractical to include all possible classes during the training stage. In this paper, we aim at advancing active open-vocabulary recognition, empowering embodied agents to actively perceive and classify arbitrary objects. However, directly adopting recent open-vocabulary classification models, like Contrastive Language Image Pretraining (CLIP), poses its unique challenges. Specifically, we observe that CLIP's performance is heavily affected by the viewpoint and occlusions, compromising its reliability in unconstrained embodied perception scenarios. Further, the sequential nature of observations in agent-environment interactions necessitates an effective method for integrating features that maintains discriminative strength for open-vocabulary classification. To address these issues, we introduce a novel agent for active open-vocabulary recognition. The proposed method leverages inter-frame and inter-concept similarities to navigate agent movements and to fuse features, without relying on class-specific knowledge. Compared to baseline CLIP model with 29.6% accuracy on ShapeNet dataset, the proposed agent could achieve 53.3% accuracy for open-vocabulary recognition, without any fine-tuning to the equipped CLIP model.

Trained location encoders provide vector embeddings summarizing the characteristics of any given location for convenient usage in diverse downstream tasks. We show that SatCLIP embeddings, pretrained on globally sampled multi-spectral Sentinel-2 satellite data, can be used in various predictive tasks that depend on location information but not necessarily satellite imagery, including temperature prediction, animal recognition in imagery, and population density estimation. Across tasks, SatCLIP embeddings consistently outperform embeddings from existing pretrained location encoders, ranging from models trained on natural images to models trained on semantic context. SatCLIP embeddings also help to improve geographic generalization. This demonstrates the potential of general-purpose location encoders and opens the door to learning meaningful representations of our planet from the vast, varied, and largely untapped modalities of geospatial data",

Second, we benefit from a separate network to decompose the generated textures into Spatially Varying BRDFs (SVBRDFs), providing us with materials ready to be used in rendering applications. Our approach builds on existing synthetic material libraries with SVBRDF ground truth, but also exploits a diffusion-generated RGB texture dataset to allow generalization to new samples using unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). Our contributions are thoroughly evaluated on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Existing methods optimize 3D representations like mesh or neural fields via score distillation sampling (SDS), which suffers from inadequate fine details or excessive training time. In this paper, we propose an efficient yet effective framework, HumanGaussian, that generates high-quality 3D humans with fine-grained geometry and realistic appearance. Our key insight is that 3D Gaussian Splatting is an efficient renderer with periodic Gaussian shrinkage or growing, where such adaptive density control can be naturally guided by intrinsic human structures. Specifically, 1) we first propose a Structure-Aware SDS that simultaneously optimizes human appearance and geometry. The multi-modal score function from both RGB and depth space is leveraged to distill the Gaussian densification and pruning process. 2) Moreover, we devise an Annealed Negative Prompt Guidance by decomposing SDS into a noisier generative score and a cleaner classifier score, which well addresses the over-saturation issue. The floating artifacts are further eliminated based on Gaussian size in a prune-only phase to enhance generation smoothness. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior efficiency and competitive quality of our framework, rendering vivid 3D humans under diverse scenarios.

Thus, training involves differentiating through a pretrained optical flow network. Since our model is self-supervised, we can further improve its performance through test-time adaptation, by finetuning it on the input video. It can also be easily extended to magnify the motions of only user-selected objects. Our approach avoids the need for synthetic magnification datasets that have been used to train prior learning-based approaches. Instead, it leverages the existing capabilities of off-the-shelf motion estimators.

    "title": "Rethinking Directional Integration in Neural Radiance Fields",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Recent works use the Neural radiance field (NeRF) to perform multi-view 3D reconstruction, providing a significant leap in rendering photorealistic scenes. However, despite its efficacy, NeRF exhibits limited capability of learning view-dependent effects compared to light field rendering or image-based view synthesis. To that end, we introduce a modification to the NeRF rendering equation which is as simple as a few lines of code change for any NeRF variations, while greatly improving the rendering quality of view-dependent effects. By swapping the integration operator and the direction decoder network, we only integrate the positional features along the ray and move the directional terms out of the integration, resulting in a disentanglement of the view-dependent and independent components. The modified equation is equivalent to the classical volumetric rendering in ideal cases on object surfaces with Dirac densities. Furthermore, we prove that with the errors caused by network approximation and numerical integration, our rendering equation exhibits better convergence properties with lower error accumulations compared to the classical NeRF. We also show that the modified equation can be interpreted as light field rendering with learned ray embeddings. Experiments on different NeRF variations show consistent improvements in the quality of view-dependent effects with our simple modification",

    "title": "No Representation Rules Them All in Category Discovery",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In this paper we tackle the problem of Generalized Category Discovery (GCD). Specifically, given a dataset with labelled and unlabelled images, the task is to cluster all images in the unlabelled subset, whether or not they belong to the labelled categories. Our first contribution is to recognize that most existing GCD benchmarks only contain labels for a single clustering of the data, making it difficult to ascertain whether models are using the available labels to solve the GCD task, or simply solving an unsupervised clustering problem. As such, we present a synthetic dataset, named 'Clevr-4', for category discovery. Clevr-4 contains four equally valid partitions of the data, i.e based on object shape, texture, color or count. To solve the task, models are required to extrapolate the taxonomy specified by the labelled set, rather than simply latching onto a single natural grouping of the data. We use this dataset to demonstrate the limitations of unsupervised clustering in the GCD setting, showing that even very strong unsupervised models fail on Clevr-4. We further use Clevr-4 to examine the weaknesses of existing GCD algorithms, and propose a new method which addresses these shortcomings, leveraging consistent findings from the representation learning literature to do so. Our simple solution, which is based on 'mean teachers' and termed $\\mu$GCD, substantially outperforms implemented baselines on Clevr-4. Finally, when we transfer these findings to real data on the challenging Semantic Shift Benchmark (SSB), we find that $\\mu$GCD outperforms all prior work, setting a new state-of-the-art.

    "abstract": "Generative models can produce impressively realistic images. This paper demonstrates that generated images have geometric features different from those of real images. We build a set of collections of generated images, prequalified to fool simple, signal-based classifiers into believing they are real. We then show that prequalified generated images can be identified reliably by classifiers that only look at geometric properties. We use three such classifiers. All three classifiers are denied access to image pixels, and look only at derived geometric features. The first classifier looks at the perspective field of the image, the second looks at lines detected in the image, and the third looks at relations between detected objects and shadows. Our procedure detects generated images more reliably than SOTA local signal based detectors, for images from a number of distinct generators. Saliency maps suggest that the classifiers can identify geometric problems reliably. We conclude that current generators cannot reliably reproduce geometric properties of real images",

It is natural to suspect that they implicitly learn to model some image intrinsics such as surface normals, depth, or shadows. In this paper, we present compelling evidence that generative models indeed internally produce high-quality scene intrinsic maps. We introduce Intrinsic LoRA (I LoRA), a universal, plug-and-play approach that transforms any generative model into a scene intrinsic predictor, capable of extracting intrinsic scene maps directly from the original generator network without needing additional decoders or fully fine-tuning the original network. Our method employs a Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) of key feature maps, with newly learned parameters that make up less than 0.6% of the total parameters in the generative model. Optimized with a small set of labeled images, our model-agnostic approach adapts to various generative architectures, including Diffusion models, GANs, and Autoregressive models. We show that the scene intrinsic maps produced by our method compare well with, and in some cases surpass those generated by leading supervised techniques",

Co-optimization of artificial creatures' morphology and control in silico shows promise for applications in physical soft robotics and virtual character creation; such approaches, however, require developing new learning algorithms that can reason about function atop pure structure. In this paper, we present DiffuseBot, a physics-augmented diffusion model that generates soft robot morphologies capable of excelling in a wide spectrum of tasks.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we present Surf-D, a novel method for generating high-quality 3D shapes as Surfaces with arbitrary topologies using Diffusion models. Specifically, we adopt Unsigned Distance Field (UDF) as the surface representation, as it excels in handling arbitrary topologies, enabling the generation of complex shapes. While the prior methods explored shape generation with different representations, they suffer from limited topologies and geometry details. Moreover, it's non-trivial to directly extend prior diffusion models to UDF because they lack spatial continuity due to the discrete volume structure. However, UDF requires accurate gradients for mesh extraction and learning. To tackle the issues, we first leverage a point-based auto-encoder to learn a compact latent space, which supports gradient querying for any input point through differentiation to effectively capture intricate geometry at a high resolution. Since the learning difficulty for various shapes can differ, a curriculum learning strategy is employed to efficiently embed various surfaces, enhancing the whole embedding process. With pretrained shape latent space, we employ a latent diffusion model to acquire the distribution of various shapes. Our approach demonstrates superior performance in shape generation across multiple modalities and conducts extensive experiments in unconditional generation, category conditional generation, 3D reconstruction from images, and text-to-shape tasks",

The proposed training approach leverages knowledge transfer from an image captioning model and an ensemble of strong CLIP encoders to improve the accuracy of efficient models.

Unfortunately, existing large vision-language alignment (VLA) models, e.g., CLIP, struggle with both aspects so cannot be directly used for this task. To mitigate this gap, we leverage large foundation models to disentangle both images and texts into triplets in the format of (subject, predicate, object). After that, grounding is accomplished by calculating the structural similarity matrix between visual and textual triplets with a VLA model, and subsequently propagate it to an instance-level similarity matrix. Furthermore, to equip VLA models with the ability of relationship understanding, we design a triplet-matching objective to fine-tune the VLA models on a collection of curated dataset containing abundant entity relationships. Experiments demonstrate that our visual grounding performance increase of up to 19.5% over the SOTA zero-shot model on RefCOCO/+/g.

Current VLMs, while proficient in tasks like image captioning and visual question answering, face computational burdens when processing long videos due to the excessive visual tokens. LLaMA-VID addresses this issue by representing each frame with two distinct tokens, namely context token and content token. The context token encodes the overall image context based on user input, whereas the content token encapsulates visual cues in each frame. This dual-token strategy significantly reduces the overload of long videos while preserving critical information. Generally, LLaMA-VID empowers existing frameworks to support hour-long videos and pushes their upper limit with an extra context token.

Our key observation is that even if the conditional image generations obtained from multi-view rendering of the input shapes are inconsistent, the associated image features are robust and can be directly aggregated across views. This produces semantic features on the input shapes, without requiring additional data or training.

    "abstract": "Due to the depth degradation effect in residual connections, many efficient Vision Transformers models that rely on stacking layers for information exchange often fail to form sufficient information mixing, leading to unnatural visual perception. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose Aggregated Attention, a biomimetic design-based token mixer that simulates biological foveal vision and continuous eye movement while enabling each token on the feature map to have a global perception. Furthermore, we incorporate learnable tokens that interact with conventional queries and keys, which further diversifies the generation of affinity matrices beyond merely relying on the similarity between queries and keys. Our approach does not rely on stacking for information exchange, thus effectively avoiding depth degradation and achieving natural visual perception. Additionally, we propose Convolutional GLU, a channel mixer that bridges the gap between GLU and SE mechanism, which empowers each token to have channel attention based on its nearest neighbor image features, enhancing local modeling capability and model robustness. We combine aggregated attention and convolutional GLU to create a new visual backbone called TransNeXt. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TransNeXt achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple model sizes. At a resolution of $224^2$, TransNeXt-Tiny attains an ImageNet accuracy of 84.0%, surpassing ConvNeXt-B with 69% fewer parameters.

By transforming various static tasks into dynamic ones, we enable the systematic generation of video tasks that require a broad spectrum of temporal skills, ranging from perception to cognition. Then, guided by the task definition, we automatically convert public video annotations into multiple-choice QA to evaluate each task. On one hand, such a distinct paradigm allows us to build MVBench efficiently, without much manual intervention. On the other hand, it guarantees evaluation fairness with ground-truth video annotations, avoiding the biased scoring of LLMs. Moreover, we further develop a robust video MLLM baseline, i.e., VideoChat2, by progressive multi-modal training with diverse instruction-tuning data. The extensive results on our MVBench reveal that, the existing MLLMs are far from satisfactory in temporal understanding, while our VideoChat2 largely surpasses these leading models by over 15% on MVBench.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Existing text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models usually struggle in interpreting complex prompts, especially those with quantity, object-attribute binding, and multi-subject descriptions. In this work, we introduce a semantic panel as the middleware in decoding texts to images, supporting the generator to better follow instructions. The panel is obtained through arranging the visual concepts parsed from the input text by the aid of large language models, and then injected into the denoising network as a detailed control signal to complement the text condition. To facilitate text-to-panel learning, we come up with a carefully designed semantic formatting protocol, accompanied by a fully-automatic data preparation pipeline. Thanks to such a design, our approach, which we call Ranni, manages to enhance a pre-trained T2I generator regarding its textual controllability. More importantly, the introduction of the generative middleware brings a more convenient form of interaction (i.e., directly adjusting the elements in the panel or using language instructions) and further allows users to finely customize their generation, based on which we develop a practical system and showcase its potential in continuous generation and chatting-based editing",

    "title": "COLE: A Hierarchical Generation Framework for Graphic Design",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Graphic design, which has been evolving since the 15th century, plays a crucial role in advertising. The creation of high-quality designs demands creativity, innovation, and lateral thinking. This intricate task involves understanding the objective, crafting visual elements such as the background, decoration, font, color, and shape, formulating diverse professional layouts, and adhering to fundamental visual design principles. In this paper, we introduce COLE, a hierarchical generation framework designed to comprehensively address these challenges. This COLE system can transform a straightforward intention prompt into a high-quality graphic design, while also supporting flexible editing based on user input. Examples of such input might include directives like ``design a poster for Hisaishi's concert.'' The key insight is to dissect the complex task of text-to-design generation into a hierarchy of simpler sub-tasks, each addressed by specialized models working collaboratively. The results from these models are then consolidated to produce a cohesive final output. Our hierarchical task decomposition can streamline the complex process and significantly enhance generation reliability. Our COLE system consists of multiple fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs), Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), and Diffusion Models (DMs), each specifically tailored for a design-aware text or image generation task. Furthermore, we construct the DESIGNERINTENTION benchmark to highlight the superiority of our COLE over existing methods in generating high-quality graphic designs from user intent. We perceive our COLE as an important step towards addressing more complex visual design generation tasks in the future",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Generating a 3D human model from a single reference image is challenging because it requires inferring textures and geometries in invisible views while maintaining consistency with the reference image. Previous methods utilizing 3D generative models are limited by the availability of 3D training data. Optimization-based methods that lift text-to-image diffusion models to 3D generation often fail to preserve the texture details of the reference image, resulting in inconsistent appearances in different views. In this paper, we propose HumanRef, a 3D human generation framework from a single-view input. To ensure the generated 3D model is photorealistic and consistent with the input image, HumanRef introduces a novel method called reference-guided score distillation sampling (Ref-SDS), which effectively incorporates image guidance into the generation process. Furthermore, we introduce region-aware attention to Ref-SDS, ensuring accurate correspondence between different body regions. Experimental results demonstrate that HumanRef outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating 3D clothed humans with fine geometry, photorealistic textures, and view-consistent appearances",

    "abstract": "Multi-camera setups find widespread use across various applications, such as autonomous driving, as they greatly expand sensing capabilities. Despite the fast development of Neural radiance field (NeRF) techniques and their wide applications in both indoor and outdoor scenes, applying NeRF to multi-camera systems remains very challenging. This is primarily due to the inherent under-calibration issues in multi-camera setup, including inconsistent imaging effects stemming from separately calibrated image signal processing units in diverse cameras, and system errors arising from mechanical vibrations during driving that affect relative camera poses. In this paper, we present UC-NeRF, a novel method tailored for novel view synthesis in under-calibrated multi-view camera systems. Firstly, we propose a layer-based color correction to rectify the color inconsistency in different image regions. Second, we propose virtual warping to generate more viewpoint-diverse but color-consistent virtual views for color correction and 3D recovery. Finally, a spatiotemporally constrained pose refinement is designed for more robust and accurate pose calibration in multi-camera systems. Our method not only achieves state-of-the-art performance of novel view synthesis in multi-camera setups, but also effectively facilitates depth estimation in large-scale outdoor scenes with the synthesized novel views",

We then demonstrate a simple algorithm for object segmentation that generalizes across inputs ranging from simple geometric objects in grayscale images to natural images. Object segmentation across all images is accomplished with one recurrent neural network that has a single, fixed set of weights.

    "title": "Debiasing Multimodal Models via Causal Information Minimization",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Most existing debiasing methods for multimodal models, including causal intervention and inference methods, utilize approximate heuristics to represent the biases, such as shallow features from early stages of training or unimodal features for multimodal tasks like VQA, etc., which may not be accurate. In this paper, we study bias arising from confounders in a causal graph for multimodal data and examine a novel approach that leverages causally-motivated information minimization to learn the confounder representations. Robust predictive features contain diverse information that helps a model generalize to out-of-distribution data. Hence, minimizing the information content of features obtained from a pretrained biased model helps learn the simplest predictive features that capture the underlying data distribution. We treat these features as confounder representations and use them via methods motivated by causal theory to remove bias from models. We find that the learned confounder representations indeed capture dataset biases, and the proposed debiasing methods improve out-of-distribution (OOD) performance on multiple multimodal datasets without sacrificing in-distribution performance. Additionally, we introduce a novel metric to quantify the sufficiency of spurious features in models' predictions that further demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed methods.

    "abstract": "Inverse rendering of outdoor scenes from unconstrained image collections is a challenging task, particularly illumination/albedo ambiguities and occlusion of the illumination environment (shadowing) caused by geometry. However, there are many cues in an image that can aid in the disentanglement of geometry, albedo and shadows. We exploit the fact that any sky pixel provides a direct measurement of distant lighting in the corresponding direction and, via a neural illumination prior, a statistical cue as to the remaining illumination environment. We also introduce a novel `outside-in' method for computing differentiable sky visibility based on a neural directional distance function. This is efficient and can be trained in parallel with the neural scene representation, allowing gradients from appearance loss to flow from shadows to influence estimation of illumination and geometry. Our method estimates high-quality albedo, geometry, illumination and sky visibility, achieving state-of-the-art results on the NeRF-OSR relighting benchmark.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The development of text-to-video (T2V), i.e., generating videos with a given text prompt, has been significantly advanced in recent years. However, relying solely on text prompts often results in ambiguous frame composition due to spatial uncertainty. The research community thus leverages the dense structure signals, e.g., per-frame depth/edge sequences, to enhance controllability, whose collection accordingly increases the burden of inference. In this work, we present SparseCtrl to enable flexible structure control with temporally sparse signals, requiring only one or a few inputs, as shown in Figure 1. It incorporates an additional condition encoder to process these sparse signals while leaving the pre-trained T2V model untouched. The proposed approach is compatible with various modalities, including sketches, depth maps, and RGB images, providing more practical control for video generation and promoting applications such as storyboarding, depth rendering, keyframe animation, and interpolation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the generalization of SparseCtrl on both original and personalized T2V generators.

In contrast to the conventional few-shot segmentation methods that only rely on the limited and biased information from the annotated support images, LLaFS leverages the vast prior knowledge gained by LLM as an effective supplement and directly uses the LLM to segment images in a few-shot manner. To enable the text-based LLM to handle image-related tasks, we carefully design an input instruction that allows the LLM to produce segmentation results represented as polygons, and propose a region-attribute table to simulate the human visual mechanism and provide multi-modal guidance. We also synthesize pseudo samples and use curriculum learning for pretraining to augment data and achieve better optimization.

Recent unsupervised approaches search the latent space of a StyleGAN pre-trained on HR images, for the image that best downscales to the input LR image. However, they tend to produce out-of-domain images and fail to accurately reconstruct HR images that are far from the original domain. Our contribution is twofold. Firstly, we introduce a new regularizer to constrain the search in the latent space, ensuring that the inverted code lies in the original image manifold. Secondly, we further enhanced the reconstruction through expanding the image prior around the optimal latent code. Our results show that the proposed approach recovers realistic high-quality images for large magnification factors. Furthermore, for low magnification factors, it can still reconstruct details that the generator could not have produced otherwise. Altogether, our approach achieves a good trade-off between fidelity and realism for the super-resolution task",

Despite their success, LVLMs still suffer from the issue of object hallucinations, where models generate plausible yet incorrect outputs that include objects that do not exist in the images. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Visual Contrastive Decoding (VCD), a simple and training-free method that contrasts output distributions derived from original and distorted visual inputs. The proposed VCD effectively reduces the over-reliance on statistical bias and unimodal priors, two essential causes of object hallucinations. This adjustment ensures the generated content is closely grounded to visual inputs, resulting in contextually accurate outputs. Our experiments show that VCD, without either additional training or the usage of external tools, significantly mitigates the object hallucination issue across different LVLM families. Beyond mitigating object hallucinations, VCD also excels in general LVLM benchmarks, highlighting its wide-ranging applicability",

    "abstract": "Lifting 2D diffusion for 3D generation is a challenging problem due to the lack of geometric prior and the complex entanglement of materials and lighting in natural images. Existing methods have shown promise by first creating the geometry through score-distillation sampling (SDS) applied to rendered surface normals, followed by appearance modeling. However, relying on a 2D RGB diffusion model to optimize surface normals is suboptimal due to the distribution discrepancy between natural images and normals maps, leading to instability in optimization. In this paper, recognizing that the normal and depth information effectively describe scene geometry and be automatically estimated from images, we propose to learn a generalizable Normal-Depth diffusion model for 3D generation. We achieve this by training on the large-scale LAION dataset together with the generalizable image-to-depth and normal prior models. In an attempt to alleviate the mixed illumination effects in the generated materials, we introduce an albedo diffusion model to impose data-driven constraints on the albedo component. Our experiments show that when integrated into existing text-to-3D pipelines, our models significantly enhance the detail richness, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Regression-based methods that directly predict grasping parameters given the object may achieve a high success rate but often lack diversity. Generation-based methods that generate grasping postures conditioned on the object can often produce diverse grasping, but they are insufficient for high grasping success due to lack of discriminative information. To mitigate, we introduce a unified diffusion-based dexterous grasp generation model, dubbed the name UGG, which operates within the object point cloud and hand parameter spaces. Our all-transformer architecture unifies the information from the object, the hand, and the contacts, introducing a novel representation of contact points for improved contact modeling. The flexibility and quality of our model enable the integration of a lightweight discriminator, benefiting from simulated discriminative data, which pushes for a high success rate while preserving high diversity. Beyond grasp generation, our model can also generate objects based on hand information, offering valuable insights into object design and studying how the generative model perceives objects. Our model achieves state-of-the-art dexterous grasping on the large-scale DexGraspNet dataset while facilitating human-centric object design, marking a significant advancement in dexterous grasping research.

We validate the robustness of Brain-ID features, and evaluate their performance in a variety of downstream applications, including both contrast-independent (anatomy reconstruction/contrast synthesis, brain segmentation), and contrast-dependent (super-resolution, bias field estimation) tasks.

To address this problem in automobile lane-keeping control without the use of additional smoothing algorithms, we developed a soft-constrained iterative linear-quadratic regulator (soft-CILQR) algorithm by integrating CILQR algorithm and a model predictive control (MPC) constraint relaxation method. We incorporated slack variables into the state and control barrier functions of the soft-CILQR solver to soften the constraints in the optimization process so that stabilizing control inputs can be calculated in a relatively simple manner. Two types of automotive lane-keeping experiments were conducted with a linear system dynamics model to test the performance of the proposed soft-CILQR algorithm and to compare its performance with that of the CILQR algorithm: numerical simulations and experiments involving challenging vision-based maneuvers. In the numerical simulations, the soft-CILQR and CILQR solvers managed to drive the system toward the reference state asymptotically; however, the soft-CILQR solver obtained smooth steering input trajectories more easily than did the CILQR solver under conditions involving additive disturbances. In the experiments with visual inputs, the soft-CILQR controller outperformed the CILQR controller in terms of tracking accuracy and steering smoothness during the driving of an ego vehicle on TORCS",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Recent advancements in Optical Character Recognition (OCR) have been driven by transformer-based models. OCR systems are critical in numerous high-stakes domains, yet their vulnerability to adversarial attack remains largely uncharted territory, raising concerns about security and compliance with emerging AI regulations. In this work we present a novel framework to assess the resilience of Transformer-based OCR (TrOCR) models. We develop and assess algorithms for both targeted and untargeted attacks. For the untargeted case, we measure the Character Error Rate (CER), while for the targeted case we use the success ratio. We find that TrOCR is highly vulnerable to untargeted attacks and somewhat less vulnerable to targeted attacks. On a benchmark handwriting data set, untargeted attacks can cause a CER of more than 1 without being noticeable to the eye. With a similar perturbation size, targeted attacks can lead to success rates of around $25\\%$ -- here we attacked single tokens, requiring TrOCR to output the tenth most likely token from a large vocabulary",

    "abstract": "Large-scale diffusion generative models are greatly simplifying image, video and 3D asset creation from user-provided text prompts and images. However, the challenging problem of text-to-4D dynamic 3D scene generation with diffusion guidance remains largely unexplored. We propose Dream-in-4D, which features a novel two-stage approach for text-to-4D synthesis, leveraging (1) 3D and 2D diffusion guidance to effectively learn a high-quality static 3D asset in the first stage; (2) a deformable neural radiance field that explicitly disentangles the learned static asset from its deformation, preserving quality during motion learning; and (3) a multi-resolution feature grid for the deformation field with a displacement total variation loss to effectively learn motion with video diffusion guidance in the second stage. Through a user preference study, we demonstrate that our approach significantly advances image and motion quality, 3D consistency and text fidelity for text-to-4D generation compared to baseline approaches. Thanks to its motion-disentangled representation, Dream-in-4D can also be easily adapted for controllable generation where appearance is defined by one or multiple images, without the need to modify the motion learning stage. Thus, our method offers, for the first time, a unified approach for text-to-4D, image-to-4D and personalized 4D generation tasks",

    "abstract": "Underwater images are subject to intricate and diverse degradation, inevitably affecting the effectiveness of underwater visual tasks. However, most approaches primarily operate in the raw pixel space of images, which limits the exploration of the frequency characteristics of underwater images, leading to an inadequate utilization of deep models' representational capabilities in producing high-quality images. In this paper, we introduce a novel Underwater Image Enhancement (UIE) framework, named WF-Diff, designed to fully leverage the characteristics of frequency domain information and diffusion models. WF-Diff consists of two detachable networks: Wavelet-based Fourier information interaction network (WFI2-net) and Frequency Residual Diffusion Adjustment Module (FRDAM). With our full exploration of the frequency domain information, WFI2-net aims to achieve preliminary enhancement of frequency information in the wavelet space. Our proposed FRDAM can further refine the high- and low-frequency information of the initial enhanced images, which can be viewed as a plug-and-play universal module to adjust the detail of the underwater images. With the above techniques, our algorithm can show SOTA performance on real-world underwater image datasets, and achieves competitive performance in visual quality",

    "abstract": "Multimodal large language models have made significant advancements in recent years, yet they still suffer from a common issue known as the \"hallucination problem\" where the models generate textual descriptions that contain inaccurate or non-existent content from the image. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel strategy: Hallucination-Aware Direct Preference Optimization (HA-DPO). Our approach treats the hallucination problem as a unique preference selection issue, where the model is trained to favor the non-hallucinating response when presented with two responses of the same image (one accurate and one hallucinating). This paper also presents an efficient process for constructing hallucination sample pairs to ensure high-quality, style-consistent pairs for stable HA-DPO training. We applied this strategy to two mainstream multimodal models, and the results showed a significant reduction in the hallucination problem and an enhancement in the models' generalization capabilities. With HA-DPO, the MiniGPT-4 model demonstrates significant advancements: POPE accuracy increases from 51.13% to 85.66% (34.5% absolute improvement), and the MME score escalates from 968.58 to 1365.76 (41% relative improvement).

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) generative models have shown remarkable capabilities in producing diverse and imaginative visuals based on text prompts. Despite the advancement, these diffusion models sometimes struggle to translate the semantic content from the text into images entirely. While conditioning on the layout has shown to be effective in improving the compositional ability of T2I diffusion models, they typically require manual layout input. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to improving T2I diffusion models using Large Language Models (LLMs) as layout generators. Our method leverages the Chain-of-Thought prompting of LLMs to interpret text and generate spatially reasonable object layouts. The generated layout is then used to enhance the generated images' composition and spatial accuracy. Moreover, we propose an efficient adapter based on a cross-attention mechanism, which explicitly integrates the layout information into the stable diffusion models. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in image quality and layout accuracy, showcasing the potential of LLMs in augmenting generative image models",

Nevertheless, assigning appropriate strategies to modality variable inputs is challenging. To this end, UniSOD learns modality-aware prompts with task-specific hints through adaptive prompt learning, which are plugged into the proposed pre-trained baseline SOD model to handle corresponding tasks, while only requiring few learnable parameters compared to training the entire model. Each modality-aware prompt is generated from a switchable prompt generation block, which performs structural switching solely relied on single-modal and multi-modal inputs. UniSOD achieves consistent performance improvement on 14 benchmark datasets for RGB, RGB-D, and RGB-T SOD, which demonstrates that our method effectively and efficiently unifies single-modal and multi-modal SOD tasks",

For this reason, this work provides a thorough theoretical and empirical comparison between methods by evaluating them in terms of memory usage, speed, and certifiable robust accuracy.

Each distortion changes the original signal in different ways, e.g., additive or multiplicative noise. We propose a transformer-based model to explicitly learn this decomposition. The sequential model uses 3D Swin-Transformers for spatio-temporal encoding and 3D U-Nets as prediction heads for individual parts of the decomposition. We demonstrate that by separately pre-training our model on weakly supervised pseudo labels, we can steer our model to optimize for our ambiguous problem definition and learn to differentiate between the different image distortions",

    "abstract": "Makeup transfer is a process of transferring the makeup style from a reference image to the source images, while preserving the source images' identities. This technique is highly desirable and finds many applications. However, existing methods lack fine-level control of the makeup style, making it challenging to achieve high-quality results when dealing with large spatial misalignments. To address this problem, we propose a novel Spatial Alignment and Region-Adaptive normalization method (SARA) in this paper. Our method generates detailed makeup transfer results that can handle large spatial misalignments and achieve part-specific and shade-controllable makeup transfer. Specifically, SARA comprises three modules: Firstly, a spatial alignment module that preserves the spatial context of makeup and provides a target semantic map for guiding the shape-independent style codes. Secondly, a region-adaptive normalization module that decouples shape and makeup style using per-region encoding and normalization, which facilitates the elimination of spatial misalignments. Lastly, a makeup fusion module blends identity features and makeup style by injecting learned scale and bias parameters. Experimental results show that our SARA method outperforms existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance on two public datasets",

This is the basis to study the multi-scale architecture of the brain regarding its subdivision into brain areas and nuclei, cortical layers, columns, and cell clusters down to single cell morphology Methods for brain mapping and cell segmentation exploit such images to enable rapid and automated analysis of cytoarchitecture and cell distribution in complete series of histological sections. However, the presence of inevitable processing artifacts in the image data caused by missing sections, tears in the tissue, or staining variations remains the primary reason for gaps in the resulting image data. To this end we aim to provide a model that can fill in missing information in a reliable way, following the true cell distribution at different scales. Inspired by the recent success in image generation, we propose a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM), trained on light-microscopic scans of cell-body stained sections. We extend this model with the RePaint method to impute missing or replace corrupted image data. We show that our trained DDPM is able to generate highly realistic image information for this purpose, generating plausible cell statistics and cytoarchitectonic patterns.

Existing 2D virtual try-on methods cannot be directly extended to 3D since they lack the ability to perceive the depth of each pixel. Besides, 3D virtual try-on approaches are mostly built on the fixed topological structure and with heavy computation. To deal with these problems, we propose a Decomposed Implicit garment transfer network (DI-Net), which can effortlessly reconstruct a 3D human mesh with the newly try-on result and preserve the texture from an arbitrary perspective. Specifically, DI-Net consists of two modules: 1) A complementary warping module that warps the reference image to have the same pose as the source image through dense correspondence learning and sparse flow learning; 2) A geometry-aware decomposed transfer module that decomposes the garment transfer into image layout based transfer and texture based transfer, achieving surface and texture reconstruction by constructing pixel-aligned implicit functions.

Some existing approaches could achieve this by using generalizable pixel-aligned implicit fields to reconstruct a textured mesh of a human or by employing a 2D diffusion model as guidance with the Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) method, to lift the 2D image into 3D space. However, a generalizable implicit field often results in an over-smooth texture field, while the SDS method tends to lead to a texture-inconsistent novel view with the input image. In this paper, we introduce a texture-consistent back view synthesis module that could transfer the reference image content to the back view through depth and text-guided attention injection. Moreover, to alleviate the color distortion that occurs in the side region, we propose a visibility-aware patch consistency regularization for texture mapping and refinement combined with the synthesized back view texture. With the above techniques, we could achieve high-fidelity and texture-consistent human rendering from a single image.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Remote sensing visual question answering (RSVQA) opens new opportunities for the use of overhead imagery by the general public, by enabling human-machine interaction with natural language. Building on the recent advances in natural language processing and computer vision, the goal of RSVQA is to answer a question formulated in natural language about a remote sensing image. Language understanding is essential to the success of the task, but has not yet been thoroughly examined in RSVQA. In particular, the problem of language biases is often overlooked in the remote sensing community, which can impact model robustness and lead to wrong conclusions about the performances of the model. Thus, the present work aims at highlighting the problem of language biases in RSVQA with a threefold analysis strategy: visual blind models, adversarial testing and dataset analysis. This analysis focuses both on model and data. Moreover, we motivate the use of more informative and complementary evaluation metrics sensitive to the issue. The gravity of language biases in RSVQA is then exposed for all of these methods with the training of models discarding the image data and the manipulation of the visual input during inference. Finally, a detailed analysis of question-answer distribution demonstrates the root of the problem in the data itself. Thanks to this analytical study, we observed that biases in remote sensing are more severe than in standard VQA, likely due to the specifics of existing remote sensing datasets for the task, e.g. geographical similarities and sparsity, as well as a simpler vocabulary and question generation strategies. While new, improved and less-biased datasets appear as a necessity for the development of the promising field of RSVQA, we demonstrate that more informed, relative evaluation metrics remain much needed to transparently communicate results of future RSVQA methods",

This task involves two major challenges: the COD domain-specific perception and multimodal reference-image alignment. Our motivation is to make full use of the semantic intelligence and intrinsic knowledge of recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to decompose this complex task in a human-like way. As language is highly condensed and inductive, linguistic expression is the main media of human knowledge learning, and the transmission of knowledge information follows a multi-level progression from simplicity to complexity. In this paper, we propose a large-model-based Multi-Level Knowledge-Guided multimodal method for Ref-COD termed MLKG, where multi-level knowledge descriptions from MLLM are organized to guide the large vision model of segmentation to perceive the camouflage-targets and camouflage-scene progressively and meanwhile deeply align the textual references with camouflaged photos. To our knowledge, our contributions mainly include: (1) This is the first time that the MLLM knowledge is studied for Ref-COD and COD. (2) We, for the first time, propose decomposing Ref-COD into two main perspectives of perceiving the target and scene by integrating MLLM knowledge, and contribute a multi-level knowledge-guided method. (3) Our method achieves the state-of-the-art on the Ref-COD benchmark outperforming numerous strong competitors. Moreover, thanks to the injected rich knowledge, it demonstrates zero-shot generalization ability on uni-modal COD datasets. We will release our code soon",

Prior works have shown that training on synthetic images improves many perception tasks, such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. We are the first to explore generative data augmentations for scribble-supervised semantic segmentation. We propose a generative data augmentation method that leverages a ControlNet diffusion model conditioned on semantic scribbles to produce high-quality training data. However, naive implementations of generative data augmentations may inadvertently harm the performance of the downstream segmentor rather than improve it. We leverage classifier-free diffusion guidance to enforce class consistency and introduce encode ratios to trade off data diversity for data realism. Using the guidance scale and encode ratio, we are able to generate a spectrum of high-quality training images. We propose multiple augmentation schemes and find that these schemes significantly impact model performance, especially in the low-data regime. Our framework further reduces the gap between the performance of scribble-supervised segmentation and that of fully-supervised segmentation. We also show that our framework significantly improves segmentation performance on small datasets, even surpassing fully-supervised segmentation",

    "title": "Continuous Pose for Monocular Cameras in Neural Implicit Representation",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we showcase the effectiveness of optimizing monocular camera poses as a continuous function of time. The camera poses are represented using an implicit neural function which maps the given time to the corresponding camera pose. The mapped camera poses are then used for the downstream tasks where joint camera pose optimization is also required. While doing so, the network parameters -- that implicitly represent camera poses -- are optimized. We exploit the proposed method in four diverse experimental settings, namely, (1) NeRF from noisy poses; (2) NeRF from asynchronous Events; (3) Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (vSLAM); and (4) vSLAM with IMUs. In all four settings, the proposed method performs significantly better than the compared baselines and the state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, using the assumption of continuous motion, changes in pose may actually live in a manifold that has lower than 6 degrees of freedom (DOF) is also realized. We call this low DOF motion representation as the \\emph{intrinsic motion} and use the approach in vSLAM settings, showing impressive camera tracking performance",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The success of deep learning models deployed in the real world depends critically on their ability to generalize well across diverse data domains. Here, we address a fundamental challenge with selective classification during automated diagnosis with domain-shifted medical images. In this scenario, models must learn to avoid making predictions when label confidence is low, especially when tested with samples far removed from the training set (covariate shift). Such uncertain cases are typically referred to the clinician for further analysis and evaluation. Yet, we show that even state-of-the-art domain generalization approaches fail severely during referral when tested on medical images acquired from a different demographic or using a different technology. We examine two benchmark diagnostic medical imaging datasets exhibiting strong covariate shifts: i) diabetic retinopathy prediction with retinal fundus images and ii) multilabel disease prediction with chest X-ray images. We show that predictive uncertainty estimates do not generalize well under covariate shifts leading to non-monotonic referral curves, and severe drops in performance (up to 50%) at high referral rates (>70%). We evaluate novel combinations of robust generalization and post hoc referral approaches, that rescue these failures and achieve significant performance improvements, typically >10%, over baseline methods. Our study identifies a critical challenge with referral in domain-shifted medical images and finds key applications in reliable, automated disease diagnosis",

    "abstract": "Robots are increasingly used in tomato greenhouses to automate labour-intensive tasks such as selective harvesting and de-leafing. To perform these tasks, robots must be able to accurately and efficiently perceive the plant nodes that need to be cut, despite the high levels of occlusion from other plant parts. We formulate this problem as a local next-best-view (NBV) planning task where the robot has to plan an efficient set of camera viewpoints to overcome occlusion and improve the quality of perception. Our formulation focuses on quickly improving the perception accuracy of a single target node to maximise its chances of being cut. Previous methods of NBV planning mostly focused on global view planning and used random sampling of candidate viewpoints for exploration, which could suffer from high computational costs, ineffective view selection due to poor candidates, or non-smooth trajectories due to inefficient sampling. We propose a gradient-based NBV planner using differential ray sampling, which directly estimates the local gradient direction for viewpoint planning to overcome occlusion and improve perception. Through simulation experiments, we showed that our planner can handle occlusions and improve the 3D reconstruction and position estimation of nodes equally well as a sampling-based NBV planner, while taking ten times less computation and generating 28% more efficient trajectories",

    "abstract": "Collaborative perception has recently gained significant attention in autonomous driving, improving perception quality by enabling the exchange of additional information among vehicles. However, deploying collaborative perception systems can lead to domain shifts due to diverse environmental conditions and data heterogeneity among connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). To address these challenges, we propose a unified domain generalization framework applicable in both training and inference stages of collaborative perception. In the training phase, we introduce an Amplitude Augmentation (AmpAug) method to augment low-frequency image variations, broadening the model's ability to learn across various domains. We also employ a meta-consistency training scheme to simulate domain shifts, optimizing the model with a carefully designed consistency loss to encourage domain-invariant representations. In the inference phase, we introduce an intra-system domain alignment mechanism to reduce or potentially eliminate the domain discrepancy among CAVs prior to inference. Comprehensive experiments substantiate the effectiveness of our method in comparison with the existing state-of-the-art works.

The deformed mesh is rendered, and the resulting 2D image is used in the Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) process, which enables extracting meaningful plausibility priors from a pretrained 2D diffusion model. To better preserve the identity of the edited mesh, we fine-tune our 2D diffusion model with LoRA. Gradients extracted by SDS and a user-prescribed handle displacement are then backpropagated to the per-face Jacobians, and we use iterative gradient descent to compute the final deformation that balances between the user edit and the output plausibility.

Motivated by the great success of self-attention mechanism in capturing long-range relationships, an SPD manifold self-attention mechanism (SMSA) is proposed in this paper using some manifold-valued geometric operations, mainly the Riemannian metric, Riemannian mean, and Riemannian optimization. Then, an SMSA-based geometric learning module (SMSA-GLM) is designed for the sake of improving the discrimination of the generated deep structured representations.

    "abstract": "Developing end-to-end models for long-video action understanding tasks presents significant computational and memory challenges. Existing works generally build models on long-video features extracted by off-the-shelf action recognition models, which are trained on short-video datasets in different domains, making the extracted features suffer domain discrepancy. To avoid this, action recognition models can be end-to-end trained on clips, which are trimmed from long videos and labeled using action interval annotations. Such fully supervised annotations are expensive to collect. Thus, a weakly supervised method is needed for long-video action understanding at scale. Under the weak supervision setting, action labels are provided for the whole video without precise start and end times of the action clip. To this end, we propose an AdaFocus framework. AdaFocus estimates the spike-actionness and temporal positions of actions, enabling it to adaptively focus on action clips that facilitate better training without the need for precise annotations. Experiments on three long-video datasets show its effectiveness. Remarkably, on two of datasets, models trained with AdaFocus under weak supervision outperform those trained under full supervision. Furthermore, we form a weakly supervised feature extraction pipeline with our AdaFocus, which enables significant improvements on three long-video action understanding tasks",

Currently, diffusion models have become the mainstream in visual generation research, owing to their robust generative capabilities. However, challenges persist in the realm of image-to-video, especially in character animation, where temporally maintaining consistency with detailed information from character remains a formidable problem. In this paper, we leverage the power of diffusion models and propose a novel framework tailored for character animation. To preserve consistency of intricate appearance features from reference image, we design ReferenceNet to merge detail features via spatial attention. To ensure controllability and continuity, we introduce an efficient pose guider to direct character's movements and employ an effective temporal modeling approach to ensure smooth inter-frame transitions between video frames. By expanding the training data, our approach can animate arbitrary characters, yielding superior results in character animation compared to other image-to-video methods.

In this paper, we present Photo-SLAM, a novel SLAM framework with a hyper primitives map.

In addition to actively densifying hyper primitives based on geometric features, we further introduce a Gaussian-Pyramid-based training method to progressively learn multi-level features, enhancing photorealistic mapping performance. The extensive experiments with monocular, stereo, and RGB-D datasets prove that our proposed system Photo-SLAM significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art SLAM systems for online photorealistic mapping, e.g., PSNR is 30% higher and rendering speed is hundreds of times faster in the Replica dataset.

Such methods, which are based on volume rendering, can model various light phenomena, and various extended methods have been proposed to accommodate different scenes and situations. However, when handling scenes with multiple glass objects, e.g., objects in a glass showcase, modeling the target scene accurately has been challenging due to the presence of multiple reflection and refraction effects. Thus, this paper proposes a NeRF-based modeling method for scenes containing a glass case. In the proposed method, refraction and reflection are modeled using elements that are dependent and independent of the viewer's perspective. This approach allows us to estimate the surfaces where refraction occurs, i.e., glass surfaces, and enables the separation and modeling of both direct and reflected light components. Compared to existing methods, the proposed method enables more accurate modeling of both glass refraction and the overall scene",

    "abstract": "While large language models (LLMs) excel in a simulated world of texts, they struggle to interact with the more realistic world without perceptions of other modalities such as visual or audio signals. Although vision-language models (VLMs) integrate LLM modules (1) aligned with static image features, and (2) may possess prior knowledge of world dynamics (as demonstrated in the text world), they have not been trained in an embodied visual world and thus cannot align with its dynamics. On the other hand, training an embodied agent in a noisy visual world without expert guidance is often challenging and inefficient. In this paper, we train a VLM agent living in a visual world using an LLM agent excelling in a parallel text world (but inapplicable to the visual world). Specifically, we distill LLM's reflection outcomes (improved actions by analyzing mistakes) in a text world's tasks to finetune the VLM on the same tasks of the visual world, resulting in an Embodied Multi-Modal Agent (EMMA) quickly adapting to the visual world dynamics. Such cross-modality imitation learning between the two parallel worlds enables EMMA to generalize to a broad scope of new tasks without any further guidance from the LLM expert. Extensive evaluations on the ALFWorld benchmark highlight EMMA's superior performance to SOTA VLM-based agents across diverse tasks, e.g., 20%-70% improvement in the success rate",

Subsequent research efforts aim to exploit and apply their capabilities to real image editing. However, existing image-to-image methods are often inefficient, imprecise, and of limited versatility. They either require time-consuming fine-tuning, deviate unnecessarily strongly from the input image, and/or lack support for multiple, simultaneous edits.

LEDITS++'s novel inversion approach requires no tuning nor optimization and produces high-fidelity results with a few diffusion steps. Second, our methodology supports multiple simultaneous edits and is architecture-agnostic. Third, we use a novel implicit masking technique that limits changes to relevant image regions.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Dense prediction is a fundamental requirement for many medical vision tasks such as medical image restoration, registration, and segmentation. The most popular vision model, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), has reached bottlenecks due to the intrinsic locality of convolution operations. Recently, transformers have been widely adopted for dense prediction for their capability to capture long-range visual dependence. However, due to the high computational complexity and large memory consumption of self-attention operations, transformers are usually used at downsampled feature resolutions. Such usage cannot effectively leverage the tissue-level textural information available only at the full image resolution. This textural information is crucial for medical dense prediction as it can differentiate the subtle human anatomy in medical images. In this study, we hypothesize that Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLPs) are superior alternatives to transformers in medical dense prediction where tissue-level details dominate the performance, as MLPs enable long-range dependence at the full image resolution. To validate our hypothesis, we develop a full-resolution hierarchical MLP framework that uses MLPs beginning from the full image resolution. We evaluate this framework with various MLP blocks on a wide range of medical dense prediction tasks including restoration, registration, and segmentation. Extensive experiments on six public well-benchmarked datasets show that, by simply using MLPs at full resolution, our framework outperforms its CNN and transformer counterparts and achieves state-of-the-art performance on various medical dense prediction tasks",

However, without sufficient semantic comments and structure, such programs can be challenging to understand, let alone modify. We introduce the problem of semantic commenting CAD programs, wherein the goal is to segment the input program into code blocks corresponding to semantically meaningful shape parts and assign a semantic label to each block. We solve the problem by combining program parsing with visual-semantic analysis afforded by recent advances in foundational language and vision models. Specifically, by executing the input programs, we create shapes, which we use to generate conditional photorealistic images to make use of semantic annotators for such images. We then distill the information across the images and link back to the original programs to semantically comment on them. Additionally, we collected and annotated a benchmark dataset, CADTalk, consisting of 5,280 machine-made programs and 45 human-made programs with ground truth semantic comments to foster future research. We extensively evaluated our approach, compared to a GPT-based baseline approach, and an open-set shape segmentation baseline, i.e., PartSLIP, and reported an 83.24% accuracy on the new CADTalk dataset.

In the computer vision community, PEFT has shown effectiveness in image classification, but little research has studied its ability for image segmentation. Fine-tuning segmentation models usually require a heavier adjustment of parameters to align the proper projection directions in the parameter space for new scenarios. This raises a challenge to existing PEFT algorithms, as they often inject a limited number of individual parameters into each block, which prevents substantial adjustment of the projection direction of the parameter space due to the limitation of Hidden Markov Chain along blocks. In this paper, we equip PEFT with a cross-block orchestration mechanism to enable the adaptation of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to various downstream scenarios. We introduce a novel inter-block communication module, which integrates a learnable relation matrix to facilitate communication among different coefficient sets of each PEFT block's parameter space. Moreover, we propose an intra-block enhancement module, which introduces a linear projection head whose weights are generated from a hyper-complex layer, further enhancing the impact of the adjustment of projection directions on the entire parameter space.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Knowledge distillation(KD) has demonstrated remarkable success across various domains, but its application to medical imaging tasks, such as kidney and liver tumor segmentation, has encountered challenges. Many existing KD methods are not specifically tailored for these tasks. Moreover, prevalent KD methods often lack a careful consideration of what and from where to distill knowledge from the teacher to the student. This oversight may lead to issues like the accumulation of training bias within shallower student layers, potentially compromising the effectiveness of KD. To address these challenges, we propose Hierarchical Layer-selective Feedback Distillation (HLFD). HLFD strategically distills knowledge from a combination of middle layers to earlier layers and transfers final layer knowledge to intermediate layers at both the feature and pixel levels. This design allows the model to learn higher-quality representations from earlier layers, resulting in a robust and compact student model. Extensive quantitative evaluations reveal that HLFD outperforms existing methods by a significant margin. For example, in the kidney segmentation task, HLFD surpasses the student model (without KD) by over 10pp, significantly improving its focus on tumor-specific features. From a qualitative standpoint, the student model trained using HLFD excels at suppressing irrelevant information and can focus sharply on tumor-specific details, which opens a new pathway for more efficient and accurate diagnostic tools",

In the second stage, we treat an entire stroke as a single entity and label a group of strokes within the same semantic part using an auto-regressive Transformer with the default attention mechanism. By group-based labeling, our method can fully leverage the context information when making decisions for the remaining groups of strokes. Our method achieves the best segmentation accuracy compared with state-of-the-art approaches on two representative datasets and has been extensively evaluated demonstrating its superior performance. Additionally, we offer insights into solving part imbalance in training data and the preliminary experiment on cross-category training, which can inspire future research in this field",

    "title": "Understanding the (Extra-)Ordinary: Validating Deep Model Decisions with Prototypical Concept-based Explanations",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Ensuring both transparency and safety is critical when deploying Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in high-risk applications, such as medicine. The field of explainable AI (XAI) has proposed various methods to comprehend the decision-making processes of opaque DNNs. However, only few XAI methods are suitable of ensuring safety in practice as they heavily rely on repeated labor-intensive and possibly biased human assessment. In this work, we present a novel post-hoc concept-based XAI framework that conveys besides instance-wise (local) also class-wise (global) decision-making strategies via prototypes. What sets our approach apart is the combination of local and global strategies, enabling a clearer understanding of the (dis-)similarities in model decisions compared to the expected (prototypical) concept use, ultimately reducing the dependence on human long-term assessment. Quantifying the deviation from prototypical behavior not only allows to associate predictions with specific model sub-strategies but also to detect outlier behavior. As such, our approach constitutes an intuitive and explainable tool for model validation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in identifying out-of-distribution samples, spurious model behavior and data quality issues across three datasets (ImageNet, CUB-200, and CIFAR-10) utilizing VGG, ResNet, and EfficientNet architectures.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a neural rendering pipeline for textured articulated shapes that we call Neural Texture Puppeteer. Our method separates geometry and texture encoding. The geometry pipeline learns to capture spatial relationships on the surface of the articulated shape from ground truth data that provides this geometric information. A texture auto-encoder makes use of this information to encode textured images into a global latent code. This global texture embedding can be efficiently trained separately from the geometry, and used in a downstream task to identify individuals. The neural texture rendering and the identification of individuals run at interactive speeds. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to offer a promising alternative to CNN- or transformer-based approaches for re-identification of articulated individuals based on neural rendering. Realistic looking novel view and pose synthesis for different synthetic cow textures further demonstrate the quality of our method. Restricted by the availability of ground truth data for the articulated shape's geometry, the quality for real-world data synthesis is reduced. We further demonstrate the flexibility of our model for real-world data by applying a synthetic to real-world texture domain shift where we reconstruct the texture from a real-world 2D RGB image. Thus, our method can be applied to endangered species where data is limited. Our novel synthetic texture dataset NePuMoo is publicly available to inspire further development in the field of neural rendering-based re-identification",

    "abstract": "Existing real-time RGB-D reconstruction approaches, like Kinect Fusion, lack real-time photo-realistic visualization. This is due to noisy, oversmoothed or incomplete geometry and blurry textures which are fused from imperfect depth maps and camera poses. Recent neural rendering methods can overcome many of such artifacts but are mostly optimized for offline usage, hindering the integration into a live reconstruction pipeline. In this paper, we present LiveNVS, a system that allows for neural novel view synthesis on a live RGB-D input stream with very low latency and real-time rendering. Based on the RGB-D input stream, novel views are rendered by projecting neural features into the target view via a densely fused depth map and aggregating the features in image-space to a target feature map. A generalizable neural network then translates the target feature map into a high-quality RGB image.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Despite the recent success of Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), it is still challenging to render large-scale driving scenes with long trajectories, particularly when the rendering quality and efficiency are in high demand. Existing methods for such scenes usually involve with spatial warping, geometric supervision from zero-shot normal or depth estimation, or scene division strategies, where the synthesized views are often blurry or fail to meet the requirement of efficient rendering. To address the above challenges, this paper presents a novel framework that learns a density space from the scenes to guide the construction of a point-based renderer, dubbed as DGNR (Density-Guided Neural Rendering). In DGNR, geometric priors are no longer needed, which can be intrinsically learned from the density space through volumetric rendering. Specifically, we make use of a differentiable renderer to synthesize images from the neural density features obtained from the learned density space. A density-based fusion module and geometric regularization are proposed to optimize the density space. By conducting experiments on a widely used autonomous driving dataset, we have validated the effectiveness of DGNR in synthesizing photorealistic driving scenes and achieving real-time capable rendering",

    "abstract": "In this work, we introduce SCALAR-NeRF, a novel framework tailored for scalable large-scale neural scene reconstruction. We structure the neural representation as an encoder-decoder architecture, where the encoder processes 3D point coordinates to produce encoded features, and the decoder generates geometric values that include volume densities of signed distances and colors. Our approach first trains a coarse global model on the entire image dataset. Subsequently, we partition the images into smaller blocks using KMeans with each block being modeled by a dedicated local model. We enhance the overlapping regions across different blocks by scaling up the bounding boxes of each local block. Notably, the decoder from the global model is shared across distinct blocks and therefore promoting alignment in the feature space of local encoders. We propose an effective and efficient methodology to fuse the outputs from these local models to attain the final reconstruction. Employing this refined coarse-to-fine strategy, our method outperforms state-of-the-art NeRF methods and demonstrates scalability for large-scale scene reconstruction.

However, reconstructing real-space structures from reciprocal-space x-ray diffraction data is highly challenging due to the absence of phase and orientation information, which is further complicated by weak scattering signals and considerable fluctuations in the number of photons per pulse. In this work, we present an end-to-end, self-supervised machine learning approach to recover particle orientations and estimate reciprocal space intensities from diffraction images only. Our method demonstrates great robustness under demanding experimental conditions with significantly enhanced reconstruction capabilities compared with conventional algorithms, and signifies a paradigm shift in SPI as currently practiced at XFELs",

Initially, the warping rule for pixels in the epipolar geometry is established through the infinite homography. Subsequently, Subsequently, the epipolar displacement field, which represents the sliding distance of the warped pixel along the epipolar line, is formulated by thin plate splines based on the principle of local elastic deformation. The stitching result can be generated by inversely warping the pixels according to the epipolar displacement field. This method incorporates the epipolar constraints in the warping rule, which ensures high-quality alignment and maintains the projectivity of the panorama.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Zero-shot Text-to-Video synthesis generates videos based on prompts without any videos. Without motion information from videos, motion priors implied in prompts are vital guidance. For example, the prompt \"airplane landing on the runway\" indicates motion priors that the \"airplane\" moves downwards while the \"runway\" stays static. Whereas the motion priors are not fully exploited in previous approaches, thus leading to two nontrivial issues: 1) the motion variation pattern remains unaltered and prompt-agnostic for disregarding motion priors; 2) the motion control of different objects is inaccurate and entangled without considering the independent motion priors of different objects. To tackle the two issues, we propose a prompt-adaptive and disentangled motion control strategy coined as MotionZero, which derives motion priors from prompts of different objects by Large-Language-Models and accordingly applies motion control of different objects to corresponding regions in disentanglement. Furthermore, to facilitate videos with varying degrees of motion amplitude, we propose a Motion-Aware Attention scheme which adjusts attention among frames by motion amplitude. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our strategy could correctly control motion of different objects and support versatile applications including zero-shot video edit",

    "title": "On the Calibration of Human Pose Estimation",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Most 2D human pose estimation frameworks estimate keypoint confidence in an ad-hoc manner, using heuristics such as the maximum value of heatmaps. The confidence is part of the evaluation scheme, e.g., AP for the MSCOCO dataset, yet has been largely overlooked in the development of state-of-the-art methods. This paper takes the first steps in addressing miscalibration in pose estimation. From a calibration point of view, the confidence should be aligned with the pose accuracy. In practice, existing methods are poorly calibrated. We show, through theoretical analysis, why a miscalibration gap exists and how to narrow the gap. Simply predicting the instance size and adjusting the confidence function gives considerable AP improvements. Given the black-box nature of deep neural networks, however, it is not possible to fully close this gap with only closed-form adjustments. As such, we go one step further and learn network-specific adjustments by enforcing consistency between confidence and pose accuracy. Our proposed Calibrated ConfidenceNet (CCNet) is a light-weight post-hoc addition that improves AP by up to 1.4% on off-the-shelf pose estimation frameworks. Applied to the downstream task of mesh recovery, CCNet facilitates an additional 1.0mm decrease in 3D keypoint error",

    "abstract": "Camouflaged objects adaptively fit their color and texture with the environment, which makes them indistinguishable from the surroundings. Current methods revealed that high-level semantic features can highlight the differences between camouflaged objects and the backgrounds. Consequently, they integrate high-level semantic features with low-level detailed features for accurate camouflaged object detection (COD). Unlike previous designs for multi-level feature fusion, we state that enhancing low-level features is more impending for COD. In this paper, we propose an overlapped window cross-level attention (OWinCA) to achieve the low-level feature enhancement guided by the highest-level features. By sliding an aligned window pair on both the highest- and low-level feature maps, the high-level semantics are explicitly integrated into the low-level details via cross-level attention. Additionally, it employs an overlapped window partition strategy to alleviate the incoherence among windows, which prevents the loss of global information. These adoptions enable the proposed OWinCA to enhance low-level features by promoting the separability of camouflaged objects. The associated proposed OWinCANet fuses these enhanced multi-level features by simple convolution operation to achieve the final COD. Experiments conducted on three large-scale COD datasets demonstrate that our OWinCANet significantly surpasses the current state-of-the-art COD methods",

Therefore, there's a pressing demand for compact face detection models that can function efficiently across resource-constrained devices. Over recent years, network pruning techniques have attracted a lot of attention from researchers. These methods haven't been well examined in the context of face detectors, despite their expanding popularity. In this paper, we implement filter pruning on two already small and compact face detectors, named EXTD (Extremely Tiny Face Detector) and EResFD (Efficient ResNet Face Detector). The main pruning algorithm that we utilize is Filter Pruning via Geometric Median (FPGM), combined with the Soft Filter Pruning (SFP) iterative procedure. We also apply L1 Norm pruning, as a baseline to compare with the proposed approach. The experimental evaluation on the WIDER FACE dataset indicates that the proposed approach has the potential to further reduce the model size of already lightweight face detectors, with limited accuracy loss, or even with small accuracy gain for low pruning rates",

It is a highly contagious respiratory disease requiring early and accurate detection to curb its rapid transmission.

To address this challenge, experts have suggested using radiological imagery, particularly chest X-rays, as a valuable approach within the diagnostic protocol. This study investigates the potential of leveraging radiographic imaging (X-rays) with deep learning algorithms to swiftly and precisely identify COVID-19 patients. The proposed approach elevates the detection accuracy by fine-tuning with appropriate layers on various established transfer learning models. The experimentation was conducted on a COVID-19 X-ray dataset containing 2000 images. The accuracy rates achieved were impressive of 100% for EfficientNetB4 model. The fine-tuned EfficientNetB4 achieved an excellent accuracy score, showcasing its potential as a robust COVID-19 detection model. Furthermore, EfficientNetB4 excelled in identifying Lung disease using Chest X-ray dataset containing 4,350 Images, achieving remarkable performance with an accuracy of 99.17%, precision of 99.13%, recall of 99.16%, and f1-score of 99.14%.

The large sizes of textures can bottleneck the real-time rendering of high-quality virtual 3D scenes on devices having low computational budgets and limited memory. Downsampling the texture maps directly addresses the issue, albeit at the cost of visual fidelity. Traditionally, downsampling of texture maps is performed using methods like bicubic interpolation and the Lanczos algorithm. These methods ignore the geometric layout of the mesh and its UV parametrization and also do not account for the rendering process used to obtain the final visualization that the users will experience. Towards filling these gaps, we introduce GeoScaler, which is a method of downsampling texture maps of 3D meshes while incorporating geometric cues, and by maximizing the visual fidelity of the rendered views of the textured meshes. We show that the textures generated by GeoScaler deliver significantly better quality rendered images compared to those generated by traditional downsampling methods",

Most medical image segmentation with noisy labels methods utilize either noise transition matrix, noise-robust loss functions or pseudo-labeling methods, while none of the current research focuses on clean label disentanglement. We argue that the main reason is that the severe class-imbalanced issue will lead to the inaccuracy of the selected ``clean'' labels, thus influencing the robustness of the model against the noises. In this work, we come up with a simple but efficient class-balanced sampling strategy to tackle the class-imbalanced problem, which enables our newly proposed clean label disentangling framework to successfully select clean labels from the given label sets and encourages the model to learn from the correct annotations. However, such a method will filter out too many annotations which may also contain useful information. Therefore, we further extend our clean label disentangling framework to a new noisy feature-aided clean label disentangling framework, which takes the full annotations into utilization to learn more semantics. Extensive experiments have validated the effectiveness of our methods, where our methods achieve new state-of-the-art performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/xiaoyao3302/2BDenoise",

    "title": "StreamFlow: Streamlined Multi-Frame Optical Flow Estimation for Video Sequences",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Occlusions between consecutive frames have long posed a significant challenge in optical flow estimation. The inherent ambiguity introduced by occlusions directly violates the brightness constancy constraint and considerably hinders pixel-to-pixel matching. To address this issue, multi-frame optical flow methods leverage adjacent frames to mitigate the local ambiguity. Nevertheless, prior multi-frame methods predominantly adopt recursive flow estimation, resulting in a considerable computational overlap. In contrast, we propose a streamlined in-batch framework that eliminates the need for extensive redundant recursive computations while concurrently developing effective spatio-temporal modeling approaches under in-batch estimation constraints. Specifically, we present a Streamlined In-batch Multi-frame (SIM) pipeline tailored to video input, attaining a similar level of time efficiency to two-frame networks. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient Integrative Spatio-temporal Coherence (ISC) modeling method for effective spatio-temporal modeling during the encoding phase, which introduces no additional parameter overhead. Additionally, we devise a Global Temporal Regressor (GTR) that effectively explores temporal relations during decoding. Benefiting from the efficient SIM pipeline and effective modules, StreamFlow not only excels in terms of performance on the challenging KITTI and Sintel datasets, with particular improvement in occluded areas but also attains a remarkable $63.82\\%$ enhancement in speed compared with previous multi-frame methods.

    "title": "DyRA: Dynamic Resolution Adjustment for Scale-robust Object Detection",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In object detection, achieving constant accuracy is challenging due to the variability of object sizes. One possible solution to this problem is to optimize the input resolution, known as a multi-resolution strategy. Previous approaches for optimizing resolution are often based on pre-defined resolutions or a dynamic neural network, but there is a lack of study for run-time resolution optimization for existing architecture. In this paper, we propose an adaptive resolution scaling network called DyRA, which comprises convolutions and transformer encoder blocks, for existing detectors. Our DyRA returns a scale factor from an input image, which enables instance-specific scaling. This network is jointly trained with detectors with specially designed loss functions, namely ParetoScaleLoss and BalanceLoss. The ParetoScaleLoss produces an adaptive scale factor from the image, while the BalanceLoss optimizes the scale factor according to localization power for the dataset. The loss function is designed to minimize accuracy drop about the contrasting objective of small and large objects. Our experiments on COCO, RetinaNet, Faster-RCNN, FCOS, and Mask-RCNN achieved 1.3%, 1.1%, 1.3%, and 0.8% accuracy improvement than a multi-resolution baseline with solely resolution adjustment.

First, we stress that deploying key-based models on edge devices is feasible with the latest model deployment advancements, such as Apple CoreML, although the mainstream enterprise edge artificial intelligence (Edge AI) has been focused on the Cloud. Then, we point out that the previous key-based defense on on-device image classification is impractical for two reasons: (1) training many classifiers from scratch is not feasible, and (2) key-based defenses still need to be thoroughly tested on large datasets like ImageNet. To this end, we propose to leverage pre-trained models and utilize efficient fine-tuning techniques to proliferate key-based models even on limited computing resources. Experiments were carried out on the ImageNet-1k dataset using adaptive and non-adaptive attacks. The results show that our proposed fine-tuned key-based models achieve a superior classification accuracy (more than 10% increase) compared to the previous key-based models on classifying clean and adversarial examples",

This task presents significant challenges due to three factors: the lack of high-quality datasets, fisheye camera distortion, and human body self-occlusion. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that leverages FisheyeViT to extract fisheye image features, which are subsequently converted into pixel-aligned 3D heatmap representations for 3D human body pose prediction. For hand tracking, we incorporate dedicated hand detection and hand pose estimation networks for regressing 3D hand poses. Finally, we develop a diffusion-based whole-body motion prior model to refine the estimated whole-body motion while accounting for joint uncertainties. To train these networks, we collect a large synthetic dataset, EgoWholeBody, comprising 840,000 high-quality egocentric images captured across a diverse range of whole-body motion sequences. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in producing high-quality whole-body motion estimates from a single egocentric camera",

    "abstract": "Speech-driven 3D facial animation has been an attractive task in both academia and industry. Traditional methods mostly focus on learning a deterministic mapping from speech to animation. Recent approaches start to consider the non-deterministic fact of speech-driven 3D face animation and employ the diffusion model for the task. However, personalizing facial animation and accelerating animation generation are still two major limitations of existing diffusion-based methods. To address the above limitations, we propose DiffusionTalker, a diffusion-based method that utilizes contrastive learning to personalize 3D facial animation and knowledge distillation to accelerate 3D animation generation. Specifically, to enable personalization, we introduce a learnable talking identity to aggregate knowledge in audio sequences. The proposed identity embeddings extract customized facial cues across different people in a contrastive learning manner. During inference, users can obtain personalized facial animation based on input audio, reflecting a specific talking style. With a trained diffusion model with hundreds of steps, we distill it into a lightweight model with 8 steps for acceleration.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Scene text detection techniques have garnered significant attention due to their wide-ranging applications. However, existing methods have a high demand for training data, and obtaining accurate human annotations is labor-intensive and time-consuming. As a solution, researchers have widely adopted synthetic text images as a complementary resource to real text images during pre-training. Yet there is still room for synthetic datasets to enhance the performance of scene text detectors. We contend that one main limitation of existing generation methods is the insufficient integration of foreground text with the background. To alleviate this problem, we present the Diffusion Model based Text Generator (DiffText), a pipeline that utilizes the diffusion model to seamlessly blend foreground text regions with the background's intrinsic features. Additionally, we propose two strategies to generate visually coherent text with fewer spelling errors. With fewer text instances, our produced text images consistently surpass other synthetic data in aiding text detectors. Extensive experiments on detecting horizontal, rotated, curved, and line-level texts demonstrate the effectiveness of DiffText in producing realistic text images",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to develop a learning model with the ability to generalize to new classes using a few support samples. For transductive FSL tasks, prototype learning and label propagation methods are commonly employed. Prototype methods generally first learn the representative prototypes from the support set and then determine the labels of queries based on the metric between query samples and prototypes. Label propagation methods try to propagate the labels of support samples on the constructed graph encoding the relationships between both support and query samples. This paper aims to integrate these two principles together and develop an efficient and robust transductive FSL approach, termed Prototype-based Soft-label Propagation (PSLP). Specifically, we first estimate the soft-label presentation for each query sample by leveraging prototypes. Then, we conduct soft-label propagation on our learned query-support graph. Both steps are conducted progressively to boost their respective performance. Moreover, to learn effective prototypes for soft-label estimation as well as the desirable query-support graph for soft-label propagation, we design a new joint message passing scheme to learn sample presentation and relational graph jointly. Our PSLP method is parameter-free and can be implemented very efficiently. On four popular datasets, our method achieves competitive results on both balanced and imbalanced settings compared to the state-of-the-art methods. The code will be released upon acceptance",

    "abstract": "From an enormous amount of image-text pairs, large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) learn to implicitly associate image regions with words, which is vital for tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering. However, leveraging such pre-trained models for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a simple, yet extremely effective, training-free technique, Plug-and-Play Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (PnP-OVSS) for this task. PnP-OVSS leverages a VLM with direct text-to-image cross-attention and an image-text matching loss to produce semantic segmentation. However, cross-attention alone tends to over-segment, whereas cross-attention plus GradCAM tend to under-segment. To alleviate this issue, we introduce Salience Dropout; by iteratively dropping patches that the model is most attentive to, we are able to better resolve the entire extent of the segmentation mask. Compared to existing techniques, the proposed method does not require any neural network training and performs hyperparameter tuning without the need for any segmentation annotations, even for a validation set. PnP-OVSS demonstrates substantial improvements over a comparable baseline (+29.4% mIoU on Pascal VOC, +13.2% mIoU on Pascal Context, +14.0% mIoU on MS COCO, +2.4% mIoU on COCO Stuff) and even outperforms most baselines that conduct additional network training on top of pretrained VLMs",

Our approach employs rendering priors to align with input images and segmentation masks along with physics priors to mitigate penetration and relative-sliding across frames. Furthermore, we present two alternatives for hand and object pose estimation. The optimization-based pose estimation achieves higher accuracy, while the filtering-based tracking, which utilizes the differentiable priors as dynamics and observation models, executes faster. We demonstrate that HandyPriors attains comparable or superior results in the pose estimation task, and that the differentiable physics module can predict contact information for pose refinement.

In RA, the goal is to estimate a set of $N$ unknown orientations $R_{1}, ..., R_{N} \\in SO(3)$, given noisy measurements $R_{ij} \\sim R^{-1}_{i} R_{j}$ of a subset of their pairwise relative rotations. This problem is both nonconvex and NP-hard, and thus difficult to solve in the general case. We apply harmonic analysis on compact groups to derive a (convex) spectral relaxation constructed from truncated Fourier decompositions of the individual summands appearing in the RA objective; we then recover an estimate of the RA solution by computing a few extremal eigenpairs of this relaxation, and (approximately) solving a consensus problem. Our approach affords several notable advantages versus prior RA methods: it can be used in conjunction with \\emph{any} smooth loss function (including, but not limited to, robust M-estimators), does not require any initialization, and is implemented using only simple (and highly scalable) linear-algebraic computations and parallelizable optimizations over band-limited functions of individual rotational states. Moreover, under the (physically well-motivated) assumption of multiplicative Langevin measurement noise, we derive explicit performance guarantees for our spectral estimator (in the form of probabilistic tail bounds on the estimation error) that are parameterized in terms of graph-theoretic quantities of the underlying measurement network. By concretely linking estimator performance with properties of the underlying measurement graph, our results also indicate how to devise measurement networks that are \\emph{guaranteed} to achieve accurate estimation, enabling such downstream tasks as sensor placement, network compression, and active sensing",

However, existing methods use either multi-round training or knowledge within minibatches, posing challenges in finding a favorable coupling strategy for straight trajectories. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach, Straighter trajectories of Flow Matching (StraightFM). It straightens trajectories with the coupling strategy guided by diffusion model from entire distribution level. First, we propose a coupling strategy to straighten trajectories, creating couplings between image and noise samples under diffusion model guidance. Second, StraightFM also integrates real data to enhance training, employing a neural network to parameterize another coupling process from images to noise samples. StraightFM is jointly optimized with couplings from above two mutually complementary directions, resulting in straighter trajectories and enabling both one-step and few-step generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that StraightFM yields high quality samples with fewer step. StraightFM generates visually appealing images with a lower FID among diffusion and traditional flow matching methods within 5 sampling steps when trained on pixel space. In the latent space (i.e., Latent Diffusion), StraightFM achieves a lower KID value compared to existing methods on the CelebA-HQ 256 dataset in fewer than 10 sampling steps",

In this paper, we delve into the impacts of data transformations on the speed of neural field training, specifically focusing on how permuting pixel locations affect the convergence speed of SGD. Counterintuitively, we find that randomly permuting the pixel locations can considerably accelerate the training. To explain this phenomenon, we examine the neural field training through the lens of PSNR curves, loss landscapes, and error patterns.

    "abstract": "In this study, we introduce the concept of OKR-Agent designed to enhance the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in task-solving. Our approach utilizes both self-collaboration and self-correction mechanism, facilitated by hierarchical agents, to address the inherent complexities in task-solving. Our key observations are two-fold: first, effective task-solving demands in-depth domain knowledge and intricate reasoning, for which deploying specialized agents for individual sub-tasks can markedly enhance LLM performance. Second, task-solving intrinsically adheres to a hierarchical execution structure, comprising both high-level strategic planning and detailed task execution. Towards this end, our OKR-Agent paradigm aligns closely with this hierarchical structure, promising enhanced efficacy and adaptability across a range of scenarios. Specifically, our framework includes two novel modules: hierarchical Objects and Key Results generation and multi-level evaluation, each contributing to more efficient and robust task-solving. In practical, hierarchical OKR generation decomposes Objects into multiple sub-Objects and assigns new agents based on key results and agent responsibilities. These agents subsequently elaborate on their designated tasks and may further decompose them as necessary. Such generation operates recursively and hierarchically, culminating in a comprehensive set of detailed solutions. The multi-level evaluation module of OKR-Agent refines solution by leveraging feedback from all associated agents, optimizing each step of the process. This ensures solution is accurate, practical, and effectively address intricate task requirements, enhancing the overall reliability and quality of the outcome. Experimental results also show our method outperforms the previous methods on several tasks. Code and demo are available at https://okr-agent.github.io/",

This enables us to pretrain the projection head of our network using the high-quality embeddings of the foundation model with vMF-SNE. We also propose soft multi-view pseudolabels, where predictions across multiple views are combined to provide a more reliable supervision signal compared to a consistency or swapped assignment approach. We demonstrate that these ideas improve upon P}redicting View-Assignments with Support Samples (PAWS), a current state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning method, as well as Robust PAWS (RoPAWS), over a range of benchmarking datasets.

These changes improve upon PAWS by an average of +2.9% for CIFAR-10 and +5.7% for CIFAR-100 with four labels per class, and by +15.2% for DeepWeeds, a particularly challenging dataset for semi-supervised learning.

However, performance advancements are limited when relying solely on intricate algorithmic designs for a single model, even one exhibiting strong performance, e.g., CLIP-ViT-B/16. This paper, for the first time, explores the collaborative potential of leveraging much weaker VLMs to enhance the generalization of a robust single model. The affirmative findings motivate us to address the generalization problem from a novel perspective, i.e., ensemble of pre-trained VLMs. We introduce three customized ensemble strategies, each tailored to one specific scenario. Firstly, we introduce the zero-shot ensemble, automatically adjusting the logits of different models based on their confidence when only pre-trained VLMs are available. Furthermore, for scenarios with extra few-shot samples, we propose the training-free and tuning ensemble, offering flexibility based on the availability of computing resources. The proposed ensemble strategies are evaluated on zero-shot, base-to-new, and cross-dataset generalization, achieving new state-of-the-art performance.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Panoramic radiography is a widely used imaging modality in dental practice and research. However, it only provides flattened 2D images, which limits the detailed assessment of dental structures. In this paper, we propose Occudent, a framework for 3D teeth reconstruction from panoramic radiographs using neural implicit functions, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first work to do so. For a given point in 3D space, the implicit function estimates whether the point is occupied by a tooth, and thus implicitly determines the boundaries of 3D tooth shapes. Firstly, Occudent applies multi-label segmentation to the input panoramic radiograph. Next, tooth shape embeddings as well as tooth class embeddings are generated from the segmentation outputs, which are fed to the reconstruction network. A novel module called Conditional eXcitation (CX) is proposed in order to effectively incorporate the combined shape and class embeddings into the implicit function. The performance of Occudent is evaluated using both quantitative and qualitative measures. Importantly, Occudent is trained and validated with actual panoramic radiographs as input, distinct from recent works which used synthesized images. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of Occudent over state-of-the-art methods",

    "abstract": "Recently, diffusion models have been used successfully to fit distributions for cross-modal data translation and multimodal data generation. However, these methods rely on extensive scaling, overlooking the inefficiency and interference between modalities. We develop Partially Shared U-Net (PS-U-Net) architecture which is an efficient multimodal diffusion model that allows text and image inputs to pass through dedicated layers and skip-connections for preserving modality-specific fine-grained details. Inspired by image inpainting, we also propose a new efficient multimodal sampling method that introduces new scenarios for conditional generation while only requiring a simple joint distribution to be learned. Our empirical exploration of the MS-COCO dataset demonstrates that our method generates multimodal text and image data with higher quality compared to existing multimodal diffusion models while having a comparable size, faster training, faster multimodal sampling, and more flexible generation",

    "abstract": "The field has made significant progress in synthesizing realistic human motion driven by various modalities. Yet, the need for different methods to animate various body parts according to different control signals limits the scalability of these techniques in practical scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a cohesive and scalable approach that consolidates multimodal (text, music, speech) and multi-part (hand, torso) human motion generation. Our methodology unfolds in several steps: We begin by quantizing the motions of diverse body parts into separate codebooks tailored to their respective domains. Next, we harness the robust capabilities of pre-trained models to transcode multimodal signals into a shared latent space. We then translate these signals into discrete motion tokens by iteratively predicting subsequent tokens to form a complete sequence. Finally, we reconstruct the continuous actual motion from this tokenized sequence. Our method frames the multimodal motion generation challenge as a token prediction task, drawing from specialized codebooks based on the modality of the control signal. This approach is inherently scalable, allowing for the easy integration of new modalities.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models(LLMs) have shown remarkable emergent abilities in unifying almost all (if not every) NLP tasks. In the human motion-related realm, however, researchers still develop siloed models for each task.

AvatarGPT treats each task as one type of instruction fine-tuned on the shared LLM. All the tasks are seamlessly interconnected with language as the universal interface, constituting a closed-loop within the framework. To achieve this, human motion sequences are first encoded as discrete tokens, which serve as the extended vocabulary of LLM. Then, an unsupervised pipeline to generate natural language descriptions of human action sequences from in-the-wild videos is developed. Finally, all tasks are jointly trained. Extensive experiments show that AvatarGPT achieves SOTA on low-level tasks, and promising results on high-level tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed All-in-One framework.

    "abstract": "The diffusion model has been proven a powerful generative model in recent years, yet remains a challenge in generating visual text. Several methods alleviated this issue by incorporating explicit text position and content as guidance on where and what text to render. However, these methods still suffer from several drawbacks, such as limited flexibility and automation, constrained capability of layout prediction, and restricted style diversity. In this paper, we present TextDiffuser-2, aiming to unleash the power of language models for text rendering. Firstly, we fine-tune a large language model for layout planning. The large language model is capable of automatically generating keywords for text rendering and also supports layout modification through chatting. Secondly, we utilize the language model within the diffusion model to encode the position and texts at the line level. Unlike previous methods that employed tight character-level guidance, this approach generates more diverse text images. We conduct extensive experiments and incorporate user studies involving human participants as well as GPT-4V, validating TextDiffuser-2's capacity to achieve a more rational text layout and generation with enhanced diversity.

    "abstract": "Video Moment Retrieval (MR) and Highlight Detection (HD) have attracted significant attention due to the growing demand for video analysis. Recent approaches treat MR and HD as similar video grounding problems and address them together with transformer-based architecture. However, we observe that the emphasis of MR and HD differs, with one necessitating the perception of local relationships and the other prioritizing the understanding of global contexts. Consequently, the lack of task-specific design will inevitably lead to limitations in associating the intrinsic specialty of two tasks. To tackle the issue, we propose a Unified Video COMprehension framework (UVCOM) to bridge the gap and jointly solve MR and HD effectively. By performing progressive integration on intra and inter-modality across multi-granularity, UVCOM achieves the comprehensive understanding in processing a video. Moreover, we present multi-aspect contrastive learning to consolidate the local relation modeling and global knowledge accumulation via well aligned multi-modal space. Extensive experiments on QVHighlights, Charades-STA, TACoS , YouTube Highlights and TVSum datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and rationality of UVCOM which outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a remarkable margin",

    "abstract": "Volumetric video, also known as hologram video, is a novel medium that portrays natural content in Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR). It is expected to be the next-gen video technology and a prevalent use case for 5G and beyond wireless communication. Considering that each user typically only watches a section of the volumetric video, known as the viewport, it is essential to have precise viewport prediction for optimal performance. However, research on this topic is still in its infancy. In the end, this paper presents and proposes a novel approach, named Saliency and Trajectory Viewport Prediction (STVP), which aims to improve the precision of viewport prediction in volumetric video streaming. The STVP extensively utilizes video saliency information and viewport trajectory. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study of viewport prediction in volumetric video streaming. In particular, we introduce a novel sampling method, Uniform Random Sampling (URS), to reduce computational complexity while still preserving video features in an efficient manner. Then we present a saliency detection technique that incorporates both spatial and temporal information for detecting static, dynamic geometric, and color salient regions. Finally, we intelligently fuse saliency and trajectory information to achieve more accurate viewport prediction. We conduct extensive simulations to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed viewport prediction methods using state-of-the-art volumetric video sequences. The experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method over existing schemes. The dataset and source code will be publicly accessible after acceptance",

    "abstract": "3D Gaussians have recently emerged as a highly efficient representation for 3D reconstruction and rendering. Despite its high rendering quality and speed at high resolutions, they both deteriorate drastically when rendered at lower resolutions or from far away camera position. During low resolution or far away rendering, the pixel size of the image can fall below the Nyquist frequency compared to the screen size of each splatted 3D Gaussian and leads to aliasing effect. The rendering is also drastically slowed down by the sequential alpha blending of more splatted Gaussians per pixel. To address these issues, we propose a multi-scale 3D Gaussian splatting algorithm, which maintains Gaussians at different scales to represent the same scene. Higher-resolution images are rendered with more small Gaussians, and lower-resolution images are rendered with fewer larger Gaussians. With similar training time, our algorithm can achieve 13\\%-66\\% PSNR and 160\\%-2400\\% rendering speed improvement at 4$\\times$-128$\\times$ scale rendering on Mip-NeRF360 dataset compared to the single scale 3D Gaussian splatting",

    "abstract": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as a popular spatio-temporal computing paradigm for complex vision tasks. Recently proposed SNN training algorithms have significantly reduced the number of time steps (down to 1) for improved latency and energy efficiency, however, they target only convolutional neural networks (CNN). These algorithms, when applied on the recently spotlighted vision transformers (ViT), either require a large number of time steps or fail to converge. Based on analysis of the histograms of the ANN and SNN activation maps, we hypothesize that each ViT block has a different sensitivity to the number of time steps. We propose a novel training framework that dynamically allocates the number of time steps to each ViT module depending on a trainable score assigned to each timestep. In particular, we generate a scalar binary time step mask that filters spikes emitted by each neuron in a leaky-integrate-and-fire (LIF) layer. The resulting SNNs have high activation sparsity and require only accumulate operations (AC), except for the input embedding layer, in contrast to expensive multiply-and-accumulates (MAC) needed in traditional ViTs. This yields significant improvements in energy efficiency. We evaluate our training framework and resulting SNNs on image recognition tasks including CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet with different ViT architectures. We obtain a test accuracy of 95.97% with 4.97 time steps with direct encoding on CIFAR10",

    "abstract": "Deepfake videos present an increasing threat to society with potentially negative impact on criminal justice, democracy, and personal safety and privacy. Meanwhile, detecting deepfakes, at scale, remains a very challenging tasks that often requires labeled training data from existing deepfake generation methods. Further, even the most accurate supervised learning, deepfake detection methods do not generalize to deepfakes generated using new generation methods. In this paper, we introduce a novel unsupervised approach for detecting deepfake videos by measuring of intra- and cross-modal consistency among multimodal features; specifically visual, audio, and identity features. The fundamental hypothesis behind the proposed detection method is that since deepfake generation attempts to transfer the facial motion of one identity to another, these methods will eventually encounter a trade-off between motion and identity that enviably leads to detectable inconsistencies. We validate our method through extensive experimentation, demonstrating the existence of significant intra- and cross- modal inconsistencies in deepfake videos, which can be effectively utilized to detect them with high accuracy. Our proposed method is scalable because it does not require pristine samples at inference, generalizable because it is trained only on real data, and is explainable since it can pinpoint the exact location of modality inconsistencies which are then verifiable by a human expert",

This has vast potential for minimizing life losses and property damages as well as reducing economic and environmental impacts. Leveraging satellite imagery for scenario analysis is effective but also introduces additional challenges due to the complex relations among clouds and the highly dynamic context. Existing deep learning methods in this domain rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which suffer from limited per-layer receptive fields. This limitation hinders their ability to capture long-range dependencies and global contextual knowledge during inference. In response, we introduce a novel approach, namely \"Typhoon Intensity Transformer\" (Tint), which leverages self-attention mechanisms with global receptive fields per layer. Tint adopts a sequence-to-sequence feature representation learning perspective. It begins by cutting a given satellite image into a sequence of patches and recursively employs self-attention operations to extract both local and global contextual relations between all patch pairs simultaneously, thereby enhancing per-patch feature representation learning. Extensive experiments on a publicly available typhoon benchmark validate the efficacy of Tint in comparison with both state-of-the-art deep learning and conventional meteorological methods.

    "abstract": "Mixup augmentation has been widely integrated to generate adversarial examples with superior adversarial transferability when immigrating from a surrogate model to other models. However, the underlying mechanism influencing the mixup's effect on transferability remains unexplored. In this work, we posit that the adversarial examples located at the convergence of decision boundaries across various categories exhibit better transferability and identify that Admix tends to steer the adversarial examples towards such regions. However, we find the constraint on the added image in Admix decays its capability, resulting in limited transferability. To address such an issue, we propose a new input transformation-based attack called Mixing the Image but Separating the gradienT (MIST). Specifically, MIST randomly mixes the input image with a randomly shifted image and separates the gradient of each loss item for each mixed image. To counteract the imprecise gradient, MIST calculates the gradient on several mixed images for each input sample. Extensive experimental results on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that MIST outperforms existing SOTA input transformation-based attacks with a clear margin on both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) w/wo defense mechanisms, supporting MIST's high effectiveness and generality",

To address this issue, we propose TopoSemiSeg, the first semi-supervised method that learns the topological representation from unlabeled data. In particular, we propose a topology-aware teacher-student approach in which the teacher and student networks learn shared topological representations. To achieve this, we introduce topological consistency loss, which contains signal consistency and noise removal losses to ensure the learned representation is robust and focuses on true topological signals.

Thus, we propose a novel network head to estimate the closeness of timesteps to the action centre, which we call the centricity score.

In this study, we propose a new method to enhance robustness solely through text augmentation, eliminating the need for retraining the image encoder on adversarial examples. Our motivation arises from the realization that text and image data inherently occupy a shared latent space, comprising latent content variables and style variables. This insight suggests the feasibility of learning to disentangle these latent content variables using text data exclusively. To accomplish this, we introduce an effective text augmentation method that focuses on modifying the style while preserving the content in the text data. By changing the style part of the text data, we empower the text encoder to emphasize latent content variables, ultimately enhancing the robustness of vision-language models.

    "abstract": "We propose a novel benchmark for cross-view knowledge transfer of dense video captioning, adapting models from web instructional videos with exocentric views to an egocentric view. While dense video captioning (predicting time segments and their captions) is primarily studied with exocentric videos (e.g., YouCook2), benchmarks with egocentric videos are restricted due to data scarcity. To overcome the limited video availability, transferring knowledge from abundant exocentric web videos is demanded as a practical approach. However, learning the correspondence between exocentric and egocentric views is difficult due to their dynamic view changes. The web videos contain mixed views focusing on either human body actions or close-up hand-object interactions, while the egocentric view is constantly shifting as the camera wearer moves. This necessitates the in-depth study of cross-view transfer under complex view changes. In this work, we first create a real-life egocentric dataset (EgoYC2) whose captions are shared with YouCook2, enabling transfer learning between these datasets assuming their ground-truth is accessible. To bridge the view gaps, we propose a view-invariant learning method using adversarial training in both the pre-training and fine-tuning stages. While the pre-training is designed to learn invariant features against the mixed views in the web videos, the view-invariant fine-tuning further mitigates the view gaps between both datasets. We validate our proposed method by studying how effectively it overcomes the view change problem and efficiently transfers the knowledge to the egocentric domain. Our benchmark pushes the study of the cross-view transfer into a new task domain of dense video captioning and will envision methodologies to describe egocentric videos in natural language",

However, the existing works have predominantly focused on English, lacking support for non-English text-to-image models. The most commonly used translation methods cannot solve the generation problem related to language culture, while training from scratch on a specific language dataset is prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we are inspired to propose a simple plug-and-play language transfer method based on knowledge distillation. All we need to do is train a lightweight MLP-like parameter-efficient adapter (PEA) with only 6M parameters under teacher knowledge distillation along with a small parallel data corpus. We are surprised to find that freezing the parameters of UNet can still achieve remarkable performance on the language-specific prompt evaluation set, demonstrating that PEA can stimulate the potential generation ability of the original UNet. Additionally, it closely approaches the performance of the English text-to-image model on a general prompt evaluation set. Furthermore, our adapter can be used as a plugin to achieve significant results in downstream tasks in cross-lingual text-to-image generation.

    "abstract": "Single object tracking aims to locate one specific target in video sequences, given its initial state. Classical trackers rely solely on visual cues, restricting their ability to handle challenges such as appearance variations, ambiguity, and distractions. Hence, Vision-Language (VL) tracking has emerged as a promising approach, incorporating language descriptions to directly provide high-level semantics and enhance tracking performance. However, current VL trackers have not fully exploited the power of VL learning, as they suffer from limitations such as heavily relying on off-the-shelf backbones for feature extraction, ineffective VL fusion designs, and the absence of VL-related loss functions. Consequently, we present a novel tracker that progressively explores target-centric semantics for VL tracking. Specifically, we propose the first Synchronous Learning Backbone (SLB) for VL tracking, which consists of two novel modules: the Target Enhance Module (TEM) and the Semantic Aware Module (SAM). These modules enable the tracker to perceive target-related semantics and comprehend the context of both visual and textual modalities at the same pace, facilitating VL feature extraction and fusion at different semantic levels. Moreover, we devise the dense matching loss to further strengthen multi-modal representation learning. Extensive experiments on VL tracking datasets demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our methods",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Language has emerged as a natural interface for image editing. In this paper, we introduce a method for region-based image editing driven by textual prompts, without the need for user-provided masks or sketches. Specifically, our approach leverages an existing pretrained text-to-image model and introduces a bounding box generator to find the edit regions that are aligned with the textual prompts. We show that this simple approach enables flexible editing that is compatible with current image generation models, and is able to handle complex prompts featuring multiple objects, complex sentences or long paragraphs. We conduct an extensive user study to compare our method against state-of-the-art methods. Experiments demonstrate the competitive performance of our method in manipulating images with high fidelity and realism that align with the language descriptions provided.

    "abstract": "Despite the recent advancements, conditional image generation still faces challenges of cost, generalizability, and the need for task-specific training. In this paper, we propose Manifold Preserving Guided Diffusion (MPGD), a training-free conditional generation framework that leverages pretrained diffusion models and off-the-shelf neural networks with minimal additional inference cost for a broad range of tasks. Specifically, we leverage the manifold hypothesis to refine the guided diffusion steps and introduce a shortcut algorithm in the process. We then propose two methods for on-manifold training-free guidance using pre-trained autoencoders and demonstrate that our shortcut inherently preserves the manifolds when applied to latent diffusion models. Our experiments show that MPGD is efficient and effective for solving a variety of conditional generation applications in low-compute settings, and can consistently offer up to 3.8x speed-ups with the same number of diffusion steps while maintaining high sample quality compared to the baselines",

Most existing methods for OOD detection learn a fixed decision criterion from a given in-distribution dataset and apply it universally to decide if a data point is OOD. Recent work~\\cite{fang2022is} shows that given only in-distribution data, it is impossible to reliably detect OOD data without extra assumptions.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The task of 3D semantic scene completion with monocular cameras is gaining increasing attention in the field of autonomous driving. Its objective is to predict the occupancy status of each voxel in the 3D scene from partial image inputs. Despite the existence of numerous methods, many of them overlook the issue of accurate alignment between spatial and depth information. To address this, we propose DepthSSC, an advanced method for semantic scene completion solely based on monocular cameras. DepthSSC combines the ST-GF (Spatial Transformation Graph Fusion) module with geometric-aware voxelization, enabling dynamic adjustment of voxel resolution and considering the geometric complexity of 3D space to ensure precise alignment between spatial and depth information. This approach successfully mitigates spatial misalignment and distortion issues observed in prior methods. Through evaluation on the SemanticKITTI dataset, DepthSSC not only demonstrates its effectiveness in capturing intricate 3D structural details but also achieves state-of-the-art performance. We believe DepthSSC provides a fresh perspective on monocular camera-based 3D semantic scene completion research and anticipate it will inspire further related studies",

Learning a localized concept and placing it on an object in a target image is a nontrivial task, as the objects may have different orientations and shapes. Our approach builds upon recent advancements in visual concept learning. It involves acquiring a visual concept (e.g., an ornament) from a source image and subsequently applying it to an object (e.g., a chair) in a target image. Our key idea is to perform in-context concept learning, acquiring the local visual concept within the broader context of the objects they belong to. To localize the concept learning, we employ soft masks that contain both the concept within the mask and the surrounding image area. We demonstrate our approach through object generation within an image, showcasing plausible embedding of in-context learned concepts. We also introduce methods for directing acquired concepts to specific locations within target images, employing cross-attention mechanisms, and establishing correspondences between source and target objects.

Our framework generalizes Picard iterations, a classical algorithm for parallel sampling an ODE path, and can account for non-ODE paths such as momentum-based gradient updates and changes in dimensions during the optimization process as in many cases of 3D generation.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "With the development of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), many efforts have been made to handle medical image segmentation. Traditional methods such as nnUNet train specific segmentation models on the individual datasets. Plenty of recent methods have been proposed to adapt the foundational Segment Anything Model (SAM) to medical image segmentation. However, they still focus on discrete representations to generate pixel-wise predictions, which are spatially inflexible and scale poorly to higher resolution. In contrast, implicit methods learn continuous representations for segmentation, which is crucial for medical image segmentation. In this paper, we propose I-MedSAM, which leverages the benefits of both continuous representations and SAM, to obtain better cross-domain ability and accurate boundary delineation. Since medical image segmentation needs to predict detailed segmentation boundaries, we designed a novel adapter to enhance the SAM features with high-frequency information during Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT). To convert the SAM features and coordinates into continuous segmentation output, we utilize Implicit Neural Representation (INR) to learn an implicit segmentation decoder. We also propose an uncertainty-guided sampling strategy for efficient learning of INR. Extensive evaluations on 2D medical image segmentation tasks have shown that our proposed method with only 1.6M trainable parameters outperforms existing methods including discrete and continuous methods.

    "abstract": "While there has been significant progress in object detection using conventional image processing and machine learning algorithms, exploring small and dim target detection in the IR domain is a relatively new area of study. The majority of small and dim target detection methods are derived from conventional object detection algorithms, albeit with some alterations. The task of detecting small and dim targets in IR imagery is complex. This is because these targets often need distinct features, the background is cluttered with unclear details, and the IR signatures of the scene can change over time due to fluctuations in thermodynamics. The primary objective of this review is to highlight the progress made in this field. This is the first review in the field of small and dim target detection in infrared imagery, encompassing various methodologies ranging from conventional image processing to cutting-edge deep learning-based approaches. The authors have also introduced a taxonomy of such approaches. There are two main types of approaches: methodologies using several frames for detection, and single-frame-based detection techniques. Single frame-based detection techniques encompass a diverse range of methods, spanning from traditional image processing-based approaches to more advanced deep learning methodologies. Our findings indicate that deep learning approaches perform better than traditional image processing-based approaches. In addition, a comprehensive compilation of various available datasets has also been provided. Furthermore, this review identifies the gaps and limitations in existing techniques, paving the way for future research and development in this area",

    "abstract": "The combination of strong visual backbones and Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning has led to Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) becoming the current standard for a wide range of vision and language (VL) tasks. However, recent research has shown that even the most advanced LMMs still struggle to capture aspects of compositional visual reasoning, such as attributes and relationships between objects. One solution is to utilize scene graphs (SGs)--a formalization of objects and their relations and attributes that has been extensively used as a bridge between the visual and textual domains. Yet, scene graph data requires scene graph annotations, which are expensive to collect and thus not easily scalable. Moreover, finetuning an LMM based on SG data can lead to catastrophic forgetting of the pretraining objective. To overcome this, inspired by chain-of-thought methods, we propose Compositional Chain-of-Thought (CCoT), a novel zero-shot Chain-of-Thought prompting method that utilizes SG representations in order to extract compositional knowledge from an LMM. Specifically, we first generate an SG using the LMM, and then use that SG in the prompt to produce a response. Through extensive experiments, we find that the proposed CCoT approach not only improves LMM performance on several vision and language VL compositional benchmarks but also improves the performance of several popular LMMs on general multimodal benchmarks, without the need for fine-tuning or annotated ground-truth SGs",

Our second contribution is a novel adversarial training scheme, which is designed meticulously to strike a harmonious balance between the sampling and simulation objectives. The adversarial approach ensures that the wrinkles are represented with high fidelity, while also maintaining computational efficiency.

BRICKxAR (M3D) utilizes deep learning-trained 3D model-based registration. Object recognition and tracking become challenging as the assembly model updates at each step. Additionally, not every part in a 3D assembly may be visible to the camera during the assembly. BRICKxAR (M3D) combines multiple assembly phases with a step count to address these challenges. Thus, using fewer phases simplifies the complex assembly process while step count facilitates accurate object recognition and precise visualization of each step. A testing and heuristic evaluation of the BRICKxAR (M3D) prototype and qualitative analysis were conducted with users and experts in visualization and human-computer interaction.

To address the challenges in GAR, we present REACT (\\textbf{R}ecognize \\textbf{E}very \\textbf{Act}ion Everywhere All At Once), a novel architecture inspired by the transformer encoder-decoder model explicitly designed to model complex contextual relationships within videos, including multi-modality and spatio-temporal features.

At the core, our Actor Fusion Block orchestrates a fusion of actor-specific data and textual features, striking a balance between specificity and context. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art GAR approaches in extensive experiments, demonstrating superior accuracy in recognizing and understanding group activities.

    "abstract": "The problem of self-calibration of two cameras from a given fundamental matrix is one of the basic problems in geometric computer vision. Under the assumption of known principal points and square pixels, the well-known Bougnoux formula offers a means to compute the two unknown focal lengths. However, in many practical situations, the formula yields inaccurate results due to commonly occurring singularities. Moreover, the estimates are sensitive to noise in the computed fundamental matrix and to the assumed positions of the principal points. In this paper, we therefore propose an efficient and robust iterative method to estimate the focal lengths along with the principal points of the cameras given a fundamental matrix and priors for the estimated camera parameters. In addition, we study a computationally efficient check of models generated within RANSAC that improves the accuracy of the estimated models while reducing the total computational time. Extensive experiments on real and synthetic data show that our iterative method brings significant improvements in terms of the accuracy of the estimated focal lengths over the Bougnoux formula and other state-of-the-art methods, even when relying on inaccurate priors",

However, we find that retaining the spurious correlation between causal and non-causal factors plays a vital role in bridging the domain gap and improving target adaptation. Therefore, we propose to build a framework that disentangles and supports causal factor alignment by aligning the non-causal factors first. We also investigate and find that the strong shape bias of vision transformers, coupled with its multi-head attention, make it a suitable architecture for realizing our proposed disentanglement. Hence, we propose to build a Causality-enforcing Source-Free Transformer framework (C-SFTrans) to achieve disentanglement via a novel two-stage alignment approach: a) non-causal factor alignment: non-causal factors are aligned using a style classification task which leads to an overall global alignment, b) task-discriminative causal factor alignment: causal factors are aligned via target adaptation.

To promote the Vehicle Re-ID models, this paper proposes to synthesize a large number of vehicle images in the target pose, whose idea is to project the vehicles of diverse poses into the unified target pose so as to enhance feature discrimination. Considering that the paired data of the same vehicles in different traffic surveillance cameras might be not available in the real world, we propose the first Pair-flexible Pose Guided Image Synthesis method for Vehicle Re-ID, named as VehicleGAN in this paper, which works for both supervised and unsupervised settings without the knowledge of geometric 3D models. Because of the feature distribution difference between real and synthetic data, simply training a traditional metric learning based Re-ID model with data-level fusion (i.e., data augmentation) is not satisfactory, therefore we propose a new Joint Metric Learning (JML) via effective feature-level fusion from both real and synthetic data. Intensive experimental results on the public VeRi-776 and VehicleID datasets prove the accuracy and effectiveness of our proposed VehicleGAN and JML",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Interactive Segmentation Models (ISMs) like the Segment Anything Model have significantly improved various computer vision tasks, yet their application to Person Re-identification (ReID) remains limited. On the other hand, existing semantic pre-training models for ReID often have limitations like predefined parsing ranges or coarse semantics. Additionally, ReID and Clothes-Changing ReID (CC-ReID) are usually treated separately due to their different domains. This paper investigates whether utilizing precise human-centric semantic representation can boost the ReID performance and improve the generalization among various ReID tasks. We propose SemReID, a self-supervised ReID model that leverages ISMs for adaptive part-based semantic extraction, contributing to the improvement of ReID performance. SemReID additionally refines its semantic representation through techniques such as image masking and KoLeo regularization. Evaluation across three types of ReID datasets -- standard ReID, CC-ReID, and unconstrained ReID -- demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. In addition, recognizing the scarcity of large person datasets with fine-grained semantics, we introduce the novel LUPerson-Part dataset to assist ReID methods in acquiring the fine-grained part semantics for robust performance",

    "abstract": "Visual relations are complex, multimodal concepts that play an important role in the way humans perceive the world. As a result of their complexity, high-quality, diverse and large scale datasets for visual relations are still absent. In an attempt to overcome this data barrier, we choose to focus on the problem of few-shot Visual Relationship Detection (VRD), a setting that has been so far neglected by the community. In this work we present the first pretraining method for few-shot predicate classification that does not require any annotated relations. We achieve this by introducing a generative model that is able to capture the variation of semantic, visual and spatial information of relations inside a latent space and later exploiting its representations in order to achieve efficient few-shot classification. We construct few-shot training splits and show quantitative experiments on VG200 and VRD datasets where our model outperforms the baselines.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Vision-and-Language models such as CLIP have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness across a wide range of tasks. However, these models are typically trained on web-scale data, which can introduce inappropriate content and lead to the development of unsafe and biased behavior. This, in turn, hampers their applicability in sensitive and trustworthy contexts and could raise significant concern in their adoption. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a methodology to make Vision-and-Language models safer by removing their sensitivity to not-safe-for-work concepts. We show how this can be done by distilling from a large language model which converts between safe and unsafe sentences and which is fine-tuned starting from just 100 manually-curated pairs. We conduct extensive experiments on the resulting embedding space for both retrieval and text-to-image generation, where we show that our model can also be properly employed with pre-trained image generators.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In semi-supervised semantic segmentation, a model is trained with a limited number of labeled images along with a large corpus of unlabeled images to reduce the high annotation effort. While previous methods are able to learn good segmentation boundaries, they are prone to confuse classes with similar visual appearance due to the limited supervision. On the other hand, vision-language models (VLMs) are able to learn diverse semantic knowledge from image-caption datasets but produce noisy segmentation due to the image-level training. In SemiVL, we propose to integrate rich priors from VLM pre-training into semi-supervised semantic segmentation to learn better semantic decision boundaries. To adapt the VLM from global to local reasoning, we introduce a spatial fine-tuning strategy for label-efficient learning. Further, we design a language-guided decoder to jointly reason over vision and language. Finally, we propose to handle inherent ambiguities in class labels by providing the model with language guidance in the form of class definitions. We evaluate SemiVL on 4 semantic segmentation datasets, where it significantly outperforms previous semi-supervised methods. For instance, SemiVL improves the state-of-the-art by +13.5 mIoU on COCO with 232 annotated images and by +6.1 mIoU on Pascal VOC with 92 labels.

    "title": "IG Captioner: Information Gain Captioners are Strong Zero-shot Classifiers",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Generative training has been demonstrated to be powerful for building visual-language models. However, on zero-shot discriminative benchmarks, there is still a performance gap between models trained with generative and discriminative objectives. In this paper, we aim to narrow this gap by improving the efficacy of generative training on classification tasks, without any finetuning processes or additional modules. Specifically, we focus on narrowing the gap between the generative captioner and the CLIP classifier. We begin by analysing the predictions made by the captioner and classifier and observe that the caption generation inherits the distribution bias from the language model trained with pure text modality, making it less grounded on the visual signal. To tackle this problem, we redesign the scoring objective for the captioner to alleviate the distributional bias and focus on measuring the gain of information brought by the visual inputs. We further design a generative training objective to match the evaluation objective. We name our model trained and evaluated from the novel procedures as Information Gain (IG) captioner. We pretrain the models on the public Laion-5B dataset and perform a series of discriminative evaluations. For the zero-shot classification on ImageNet, IG captioner achieves $> 18\\%$ improvements over the standard captioner, achieving comparable performances with the CLIP classifier. IG captioner also demonstrated strong performance on zero-shot image-text retrieval tasks on MSCOCO and Flickr30K.

    "abstract": "Video-based large language models (Video-LLMs) have been recently introduced, targeting both fundamental improvements in perception and comprehension, and a diverse range of user inquiries. In pursuit of the ultimate goal of achieving artificial general intelligence, a truly intelligent Video-LLM model should not only see and understand the surroundings, but also possess human-level commonsense, and make well-informed decisions for the users. To guide the development of such a model, the establishment of a robust and comprehensive evaluation system becomes crucial. To this end, this paper proposes \\textit{Video-Bench}, a new comprehensive benchmark along with a toolkit specifically designed for evaluating Video-LLMs. The benchmark comprises 10 meticulously crafted tasks, evaluating the capabilities of Video-LLMs across three distinct levels: Video-exclusive Understanding, Prior Knowledge-based Question-Answering, and Comprehension and Decision-making. In addition, we introduce an automatic toolkit tailored to process model outputs for various tasks, facilitating the calculation of metrics and generating convenient final scores. We evaluate 8 representative Video-LLMs using \\textit{Video-Bench}. The findings reveal that current Video-LLMs still fall considerably short of achieving human-like comprehension and analysis of real-world videos, offering valuable insights for future research directions.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The advancements in generative modeling, particularly the advent of diffusion models, have sparked a fundamental question: how can these models be effectively used for discriminative tasks? In this work, we find that generative models can be great test-time adapters for discriminative models. Our method, Diffusion-TTA, adapts pre-trained discriminative models such as image classifiers, segmenters and depth predictors, to each unlabelled example in the test set using generative feedback from a diffusion model. We achieve this by modulating the conditioning of the diffusion model using the output of the discriminative model. We then maximize the image likelihood objective by backpropagating the gradients to discriminative model's parameters. We show Diffusion-TTA significantly enhances the accuracy of various large-scale pre-trained discriminative models, such as, ImageNet classifiers, CLIP models, image pixel labellers and image depth predictors. Diffusion-TTA outperforms existing test-time adaptation methods, including TTT-MAE and TENT, and particularly shines in online adaptation setups, where the discriminative model is continually adapted to each example in the test set.

Different from prior studies, we shift our focus from evaluating standard performance to introducing a comprehensive safety evaluation suite, covering both out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization and adversarial robustness. For the OOD evaluation, we present two novel VQA datasets, each with one variant, designed to test model performance under challenging conditions. In exploring adversarial robustness, we propose a straightforward attack strategy for misleading VLLMs to produce visual-unrelated responses. Moreover, we assess the efficacy of two jailbreaking strategies, targeting either the vision or language component of VLLMs. Our evaluation of 21 diverse models, ranging from open-source VLLMs to GPT-4V, yields interesting observations: 1) Current VLLMs struggle with OOD texts but not images, unless the visual information is limited; and 2) These VLLMs can be easily misled by deceiving vision encoders only, and their vision-language training often compromise safety protocols.

    "abstract": "Throughout history, we have successfully integrated various machines into our homes. Dishwashers, laundry machines, stand mixers, and robot vacuums are a few recent examples. However, these machines excel at performing only a single task effectively. The concept of a \"generalist machine\" in homes - a domestic assistant that can adapt and learn from our needs, all while remaining cost-effective - has long been a goal in robotics that has been steadily pursued for decades. In this work, we initiate a large-scale effort towards this goal by introducing Dobb-E, an affordable yet versatile general-purpose system for learning robotic manipulation within household settings. Dobb-E can learn a new task with only five minutes of a user showing it how to do it, thanks to a demonstration collection tool (\"The Stick\") we built out of cheap parts and iPhones. We use the Stick to collect 13 hours of data in 22 homes of New York City, and train Home Pretrained Representations (HPR). Then, in a novel home environment, with five minutes of demonstrations and fifteen minutes of adapting the HPR model, we show that Dobb-E can reliably solve the task on the Stretch, a mobile robot readily available on the market. Across roughly 30 days of experimentation in homes of New York City and surrounding areas, we test our system in 10 homes, with a total of 109 tasks in different environments, and finally achieve a success rate of 81%. Beyond success percentages, our experiments reveal a plethora of unique challenges absent or ignored in lab robotics. These range from effects of strong shadows, to variable demonstration quality by non-expert users. With the hope of accelerating research on home robots, and eventually seeing robot butlers in every home, we open-source Dobb-E software stack and models, our data, and our hardware designs at https://dobb-e.com",

We model the motion of both human and object in an interdependent fashion, as semantically rich human motion rarely happens in isolation without any interactions. Our key insight is that explicitly modeling contact between the human body surface and object geometry can be used as strong proxy guidance, both during training and inference. Using this guidance to bridge human and object motion enables generating more realistic and physically plausible interaction sequences, where the human body and corresponding object move in a coherent manner. Our method first learns to model human motion, object motion, and contact in a joint diffusion process, inter-correlated through cross-attention. We then leverage this learned contact for guidance during inference synthesis of realistic, coherent HOIs. Extensive evaluation shows that our joint contact-based human-object interaction approach generates realistic and physically plausible sequences, and we show two applications highlighting the capabilities of our method. Conditioned on a given object trajectory, we can generate the corresponding human motion without re-training, demonstrating strong human-object interdependency learning.

Recent works usually adopt MLP-based neural radiance fields (NeRF) to represent 3D humans, but it remains difficult for pure MLPs to regress pose-dependent garment details. To this end, we introduce Animatable Gaussians, a new avatar representation that leverages powerful 2D CNNs and 3D Gaussian splatting to create high-fidelity avatars. To associate 3D Gaussians with the animatable avatar, we learn a parametric template from the input videos, and then parameterize the template on two front \\& back canonical Gaussian maps where each pixel represents a 3D Gaussian. The learned template is adaptive to the wearing garments for modeling looser clothes like dresses. Such template-guided 2D parameterization enables us to employ a powerful StyleGAN-based CNN to learn the pose-dependent Gaussian maps for modeling detailed dynamic appearances. Furthermore, we introduce a pose projection strategy for better generalization given novel poses. Overall, our method can create lifelike avatars with dynamic, realistic and generalized appearances.

    "abstract": "Virtual try-on has become a popular research topic, but most existing methods focus on studio images with a clean background. They can achieve plausible results for this studio try-on setting by learning to warp a garment image to fit a person's body from paired training data, i.e., garment images paired with images of people wearing the same garment. Such data is often collected from commercial websites, where each garment is demonstrated both by itself and on several models. By contrast, it is hard to collect paired data for in-the-wild scenes, and therefore, virtual try-on for casual images of people against cluttered backgrounds is rarely studied. In this work, we fill the gap in the current virtual try-on research by (1) introducing a Street TryOn benchmark to evaluate performance on street scenes and (2) proposing a novel method that can learn without paired data, from a set of in-the-wild person images directly. Our method can achieve robust performance across shop and street domains using a novel DensePose warping correction method combined with diffusion-based inpainting controlled by pose and semantic segmentation.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) provides a promising way for intelligent agents (e.g., autonomous vehicles) to learn to navigate complex scenarios. However, DRL with neural networks as function approximators is typically considered a black box with little explainability and often suffers from suboptimal performance, especially for autonomous navigation in highly interactive multi-agent environments. To address these issues, we propose three auxiliary tasks with spatio-temporal relational reasoning and integrate them into the standard DRL framework, which improves the decision making performance and provides explainable intermediate indicators. We propose to explicitly infer the internal states (i.e., traits and intentions) of surrounding agents (e.g., human drivers) as well as to predict their future trajectories in the situations with and without the ego agent through counterfactual reasoning. These auxiliary tasks provide additional supervision signals to infer the behavior patterns of other interactive agents. Multiple variants of framework integration strategies are compared. We also employ a spatio-temporal graph neural network to encode relations between dynamic entities, which enhances both internal state inference and decision making of the ego agent. Moreover, we propose an interactivity estimation mechanism based on the difference between predicted trajectories in these two situations, which indicates the degree of influence of the ego agent on other agents. To validate the proposed method, we design an intersection driving simulator based on the Intelligent Intersection Driver Model (IIDM) that simulates vehicles and pedestrians. Our approach achieves robust and state-of-the-art performance in terms of standard evaluation metrics and provides explainable intermediate indicators (i.e., internal states, and interactivity scores) for decision making",

    "abstract": "Text-to-image generation has witnessed significant progress with the advent of diffusion models. Despite the ability to generate photorealistic images, current text-to-image diffusion models still often struggle to accurately interpret and follow complex input text prompts. In contrast to existing models that aim to generate images only with their best effort, we introduce Self-correcting LLM-controlled Diffusion (SLD). SLD is a framework that generates an image from the input prompt, assesses its alignment with the prompt, and performs self-corrections on the inaccuracies in the generated image. Steered by an LLM controller, SLD turns text-to-image generation into an iterative closed-loop process, ensuring correctness in the resulting image. SLD is not only training-free but can also be seamlessly integrated with diffusion models behind API access, such as DALL-E 3, to further boost the performance of state-of-the-art diffusion models. Experimental results show that our approach can rectify a majority of incorrect generations, particularly in generative numeracy, attribute binding, and spatial relationships. Furthermore, by simply adjusting the instructions to the LLM, SLD can perform image editing tasks, bridging the gap between text-to-image generation and image editing pipelines.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Aiming to advance AI agents, large foundation models significantly improve reasoning and instruction execution, yet the current focus on vision and language neglects the potential of perceiving diverse modalities in open-world environments. However, the success of data-driven vision and language models is costly or even infeasible to be reproduced for rare modalities. In this paper, we present ViT-Lens-2 that facilitates efficient omni-modal representation learning by perceiving novel modalities with a pretrained ViT and aligning them to a pre-defined space. Specifically, the modality-specific lens is tuned to project any-modal signals to an intermediate embedding space, which are then processed by a strong ViT with pre-trained visual knowledge. The encoded representations are optimized toward aligning with the modal-independent space, pre-defined by off-the-shelf foundation models. ViT-Lens-2 provides a unified solution for representation learning of increasing modalities with two appealing advantages: (i) Unlocking the great potential of pretrained ViTs to novel modalities effectively with efficient data regime; (ii) Enabling emergent downstream capabilities through modality alignment and shared ViT parameters. We tailor ViT-Lens-2 to learn representations for 3D point cloud, depth, audio, tactile and EEG, and set new state-of-the-art results across various understanding tasks, such as zero-shot classification. By seamlessly integrating ViT-Lens-2 into Multimodal Foundation Models, we enable Any-modality to Text and Image Generation in a zero-shot manner.

Despite achieving reasonable results, these approaches face challenges in maintaining temporal consistency throughout the animation due to the lack of temporal modeling and poor preservation of reference identity. In this work, we introduce MagicAnimate, a diffusion-based framework that aims at enhancing temporal consistency, preserving reference image faithfully, and improving animation fidelity. To achieve this, we first develop a video diffusion model to encode temporal information. Second, to maintain the appearance coherence across frames, we introduce a novel appearance encoder to retain the intricate details of the reference image. Leveraging these two innovations, we further employ a simple video fusion technique to encourage smooth transitions for long video animation. Empirical results demonstrate the superiority of our method over baseline approaches on two benchmarks. Notably, our approach outperforms the strongest baseline by over 38% in terms of video fidelity on the challenging TikTok dancing dataset. Code and model will be made available",

    "title": "DiffSLVA: Harnessing Diffusion Models for Sign Language Video Anonymization",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Since American Sign Language (ASL) has no standard written form, Deaf signers frequently share videos in order to communicate in their native language. However, since both hands and face convey critical linguistic information in signed languages, sign language videos cannot preserve signer privacy. While signers have expressed interest, for a variety of applications, in sign language video anonymization that would effectively preserve linguistic content, attempts to develop such technology have had limited success, given the complexity of hand movements and facial expressions. Existing approaches rely predominantly on precise pose estimations of the signer in video footage and often require sign language video datasets for training. These requirements prevent them from processing videos 'in the wild,' in part because of the limited diversity present in current sign language video datasets. To address these limitations, our research introduces DiffSLVA, a novel methodology that utilizes pre-trained large-scale diffusion models for zero-shot text-guided sign language video anonymization. We incorporate ControlNet, which leverages low-level image features such as HED (Holistically-Nested Edge Detection) edges, to circumvent the need for pose estimation. Additionally, we develop a specialized module dedicated to capturing facial expressions, which are critical for conveying essential linguistic information in signed languages. We then combine the above methods to achieve anonymization that better preserves the essential linguistic content of the original signer. This innovative methodology makes possible, for the first time, sign language video anonymization that could be used for real-world applications, which would offer significant benefits to the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing communities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with a series of signer anonymization experiments",

    "title": "Seeing Beyond Cancer: Multi-Institutional Validation of Object Localization and 3D Semantic Segmentation using Deep Learning for Breast MRI",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The clinical management of breast cancer depends on an accurate understanding of the tumor and its anatomical context to adjacent tissues and landmark structures. This context may be provided by semantic segmentation methods; however, previous works have been largely limited to a singular focus on the tumor alone and rarely other tissue types. In contrast, we present a method that exploits tissue-tissue interactions to accurately segment every major tissue type in the breast including: chest wall, skin, adipose tissue, fibroglandular tissue, vasculature and tumor via standard-of-care Dynamic Contrast Enhanced MRI. Comparing our method to prior state-of-the-art, we achieved a superior Dice score on tumor segmentation while maintaining competitive performance on other studied tissues across multiple institutions. Briefly, our method proceeds by localizing the tumor using 2D object detectors, then segmenting the tumor and surrounding tissues independently using two 3D U-nets, and finally integrating these results while mitigating false positives by checking for anatomically plausible tissue-tissue contacts. The object detection models were pre-trained on ImageNet and COCO, and operated on MIP (maximum intensity projection) images in the axial and sagittal planes, establishing a 3D tumor bounding box. By integrating multiple relevant peri-tumoral tissues, our work enables clinical applications in breast cancer staging, prognosis and surgical planning",

    "abstract": "Semantic segmentation models, while effective for in-distribution categories, face challenges in real-world deployment due to encountering out-of-distribution (OoD) objects. Detecting these OoD objects is crucial for safety-critical applications. Existing methods rely on anomaly scores, but choosing a suitable threshold for generating masks presents difficulties and can lead to fragmentation and inaccuracy. This paper introduces a method to convert anomaly Score To segmentation Mask, called S2M, a simple and effective framework for OoD detection in semantic segmentation. Unlike assigning anomaly scores to pixels, S2M directly segments the entire OoD object. By transforming anomaly scores into prompts for a promptable segmentation model, S2M eliminates the need for threshold selection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that S2M outperforms the state-of-the-art by approximately 10\\% in IoU and 30\\% in mean F1 score, on average, across various benchmarks including Fishyscapes, Segment-Me-If-You-Can, and RoadAnomaly datasets",

In this work, we formulate the task of \\textit{diverse attribute editing} by modeling the multidimensional nature of attribute edits. This enables users to generate multiple plausible edits per attribute. We capitalize on disentangled latent spaces of pretrained GANs and train a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) to learn the latent distribution for diverse edits. Specifically, we train DDPM over a dataset of edit latent directions obtained by embedding image pairs with a single attribute change. This leads to latent subspaces that enable diverse attribute editing. Applying diffusion in the highly compressed latent space allows us to model rich distributions of edits within limited computational resources. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments conducted across a range of datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for diverse attribute editing.

    "abstract": "Owe to the powerful generative priors, the pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have become increasingly popular in solving the real-world image super-resolution problem. However, as a consequence of the heavy quality degradation of input low-resolution (LR) images, the destruction of local structures can lead to ambiguous image semantics. As a result, the content of reproduced high-resolution image may have semantic errors, deteriorating the super-resolution performance. To address this issue, we present a semantics-aware approach to better preserve the semantic fidelity of generative real-world image super-resolution. First, we train a degradation-aware prompt extractor, which can generate accurate soft and hard semantic prompts even under strong degradation. The hard semantic prompts refer to the image tags, aiming to enhance the local perception ability of the T2I model, while the soft semantic prompts compensate for the hard ones to provide additional representation information. These semantic prompts can encourage the T2I model to generate detailed and semantically accurate results. Furthermore, during the inference process, we integrate the LR images into the initial sampling noise to mitigate the diffusion model's tendency to generate excessive random details. The experiments show that our method can reproduce more realistic image details and hold better the semantics",

    "abstract": "We present a novel differentiable point-based rendering framework for material and lighting decomposition from multi-view images, enabling editing, ray-tracing, and real-time relighting of the 3D point cloud. Specifically, a 3D scene is represented as a set of relightable 3D Gaussian points, where each point is additionally associated with a normal direction, BRDF parameters, and incident lights from different directions. To achieve robust lighting estimation, we further divide incident lights of each point into global and local components, as well as view-dependent visibilities. The 3D scene is optimized through the 3D Gaussian Splatting technique while BRDF and lighting are decomposed by physically-based differentiable rendering. Moreover, we introduce an innovative point-based ray-tracing approach based on the bounding volume hierarchy for efficient visibility baking, enabling real-time rendering and relighting of 3D Gaussian points with accurate shadow effects. Extensive experiments demonstrate improved BRDF estimation and novel view rendering results compared to state-of-the-art material estimation approaches. Our framework showcases the potential to revolutionize the mesh-based graphics pipeline with a relightable, traceable, and editable rendering pipeline solely based on point cloud.

Given a single RGB image or multiview images, our network infers a signed distance function (SDF) discretized on a tetrahedral mesh surrounding the body in a rest pose. Subsequently, inferred pose and camera parameters are used to generate a normal map from the SDF. A key aspect of our approach is the use of Marching Tetrahedra to (uniquely) compute a triangulated surface from the SDF on the tetrahedral mesh, facilitating straightforward differentiation (and thus backpropagation). Thus, given only ground truth normal maps (with no volumetric information ground truth information), we can train the network to produce SDF values from corresponding RGB images. Optionally, an additional multiview loss leads to improved results. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach for both network inference and 3D reconstruction",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Understanding how the 3D scene evolves is vital for making decisions in autonomous driving. Most existing methods achieve this by predicting the movements of object boxes, which cannot capture more fine-grained scene information. In this paper, we explore a new framework of learning a world model, OccWorld, in the 3D Occupancy space to simultaneously predict the movement of the ego car and the evolution of the surrounding scenes. We propose to learn a world model based on 3D occupancy rather than 3D bounding boxes and segmentation maps for three reasons: 1) expressiveness. 3D occupancy can describe the more fine-grained 3D structure of the scene; 2) efficiency. 3D occupancy is more economical to obtain (e.g., from sparse LiDAR points). 3) versatility. 3D occupancy can adapt to both vision and LiDAR. To facilitate the modeling of the world evolution, we learn a reconstruction-based scene tokenizer on the 3D occupancy to obtain discrete scene tokens to describe the surrounding scenes. We then adopt a GPT-like spatial-temporal generative transformer to generate subsequent scene and ego tokens to decode the future occupancy and ego trajectory. Extensive experiments on the widely used nuScenes benchmark demonstrate the ability of OccWorld to effectively model the evolution of the driving scenes. OccWorld also produces competitive planning results without using instance and map supervision. Code: https://github.com/wzzheng/OccWorld",

    "abstract": "Recently, impressive results have been achieved in 3D scene editing with text instructions based on a 2D diffusion model. However, current diffusion models primarily generate images by predicting noise in the latent space, and the editing is usually applied to the whole image, which makes it challenging to perform delicate, especially localized, editing for 3D scenes. Inspired by recent 3D Gaussian splatting, we propose a systematic framework, named GaussianEditor, to edit 3D scenes delicately via 3D Gaussians with text instructions. Benefiting from the explicit property of 3D Gaussians, we design a series of techniques to achieve delicate editing. Specifically, we first extract the region of interest (RoI) corresponding to the text instruction, aligning it to 3D Gaussians. The Gaussian RoI is further used to control the editing process. Our framework can achieve more delicate and precise editing of 3D scenes than previous methods while enjoying much faster training speed, i.e. within 20 minutes on a single V100 GPU, more than twice as fast as Instruct-NeRF2NeRF (45 minutes -- 2 hours)",

The first stage consists of a local transformer that extracts features from five different body regions. The second stage then aggregates the regional features to estimate a global human gait representation. Such a design significantly reduces the complexity of the attention operation and improves efficiency and performance simultaneously.

Accurate analysis of diagnostic images, like computed tomographic angiograms (CTAs), is essential for staging and monitoring the progression of atherosclerosis-related conditions, including peripheral arterial disease (PAD). However, manual analysis of CTA images is time-consuming and tedious. To address this limitation, we employed a deep learning model to segment the vascular system in CTA images of PAD patients undergoing femoral endarterectomy surgery and to measure vascular calcification from the left renal artery to the patella. Utilizing proprietary CTA images of 27 patients undergoing femoral endarterectomy surgery provided by Prisma Health Midlands, we developed a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model to first segment the arterial system, starting from the descending aorta to the patella, and second, to provide a metric of arterial calcification. Our designed DNN achieved 83.4% average Dice accuracy in segmenting arteries from aorta to patella, advancing the state-of-the-art by 0.8%. Furthermore, our work is the first to present a robust statistical analysis of automated calcification measurement in the lower extremities using deep learning, attaining a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 9.5% and a correlation coefficient of 0.978 between automated and manual calcification scores. These findings underscore the potential of deep learning techniques as a rapid and accurate tool for medical professionals to assess calcification in the abdominal aorta and its branches above the patella.

    "abstract": "Batch Normalization (BN) has become an essential technique in contemporary neural network design, enhancing training stability. Specifically, BN employs centering and scaling operations to standardize features along the batch dimension and uses an affine transformation to recover features. Although standard BN has shown its capability to improve deep neural network training and convergence, it still exhibits inherent limitations in certain cases. Most existing techniques that enhance BN consider a single or a few aspects of BN. In this paper, we first identify problems with BN from a feature perspective and explore that feature condensation exists in the learning when employing BN, which negatively affects testing performance. To tackle this problem, we propose a two-stage unified framework called Unified Batch Normalization (UBN). In the first stage, we utilize a simple feature condensation threshold to alleviate the feature condensation, which hinders inappropriate statistic updates in normalization. In the second stage, we unify various normalization variants to boost each component of BN. Our experimental results reveal that UBN significantly enhances performance across different visual backbones and notably expedites network training convergence, particularly in early training stages.

    "title": "Direct2.5: Diverse Text-to-3D Generation via Multi-view 2.5D Diffusion",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Recent advances in generative AI have unveiled significant potential for the creation of 3D content. However, current methods either apply a pre-trained 2D diffusion model with the time-consuming score distillation sampling (SDS), or a direct 3D diffusion model trained on limited 3D data losing generation diversity. In this work, we approach the problem by employing a multi-view 2.5D diffusion fine-tuned from a pre-trained 2D diffusion model. The multi-view 2.5D diffusion directly models the structural distribution of 3D data, while still maintaining the strong generalization ability of the original 2D diffusion model, filling the gap between 2D diffusion-based and direct 3D diffusion-based methods for 3D content generation. During inference, multi-view normal maps are generated using the 2.5D diffusion, and a novel differentiable rasterization scheme is introduced to fuse the almost consistent multi-view normal maps into a consistent 3D model. We further design a normal-conditioned multi-view image generation module for fast appearance generation given the 3D geometry. Our method is a one-pass diffusion process and does not require any SDS optimization as post-processing. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that, our direct 2.5D generation with the specially-designed fusion scheme can achieve diverse, mode-seeking-free, and high-fidelity 3D content generation in only 10 seconds.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "We tackle the problem of 3D point cloud localization based on a few natural linguistic descriptions and introduce a novel neural network, Text2Loc, that fully interprets the semantic relationship between points and text. Text2Loc follows a coarse-to-fine localization pipeline: text-submap global place recognition, followed by fine localization. In global place recognition, relational dynamics among each textual hint are captured in a hierarchical transformer with max-pooling (HTM), whereas a balance between positive and negative pairs is maintained using text-submap contrastive learning. Moreover, we propose a novel matching-free fine localization method to further refine the location predictions, which completely removes the need for complicated text-instance matching and is lighter, faster, and more accurate than previous methods. Extensive experiments show that Text2Loc improves the localization accuracy by up to $2\\times$ over the state-of-the-art on the KITTI360Pose dataset. We will make the code publicly available",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Continual Learning in semantic scene segmentation aims to continually learn new unseen classes in dynamic environments while maintaining previously learned knowledge. Prior studies focused on modeling the catastrophic forgetting and background shift challenges in continual learning. However, fairness, another major challenge that causes unfair predictions leading to low performance among major and minor classes, still needs to be well addressed. In addition, prior methods have yet to model the unknown classes well, thus resulting in producing non-discriminative features among unknown classes. This paper presents a novel Fairness Learning via Contrastive Attention Approach to continual learning in semantic scene understanding. In particular, we first introduce a new Fairness Contrastive Clustering loss to address the problems of catastrophic forgetting and fairness. Then, we propose an attention-based visual grammar approach to effectively model the background shift problem and unknown classes, producing better feature representations for different unknown classes. Through our experiments, our proposed approach achieves State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance on different continual learning settings of three standard benchmarks, i.e., ADE20K, Cityscapes, and Pascal VOC. It promotes the fairness of the continual semantic segmentation model",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Procedural videos show step-by-step demonstrations of tasks like recipe preparation. Understanding such videos is challenging, involving the precise localization of steps and the generation of textual instructions. Manually annotating steps and writing instructions is costly, which limits the size of current datasets and hinders effective learning. Leveraging large but noisy video-transcript datasets for pre-training can boost performance, but demands significant computational resources. Furthermore, transcripts contain irrelevant content and exhibit style variation compared to instructions written by human annotators. To mitigate both issues, we propose a technique, Sieve-&-Swap, to automatically curate a smaller dataset: (i) Sieve filters irrelevant transcripts and (ii) Swap enhances the quality of the text instruction by automatically replacing the transcripts with human-written instructions from a text-only recipe dataset. The curated dataset, three orders of magnitude smaller than current web-scale datasets, enables efficient training of large-scale models with competitive performance. We complement our Sieve-\\&-Swap approach with a Procedure Transformer (ProcX) for end-to-end step localization and instruction generation for procedural videos. When this model is pre-trained on our curated dataset, it achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot and finetuning settings on YouCook2 and Tasty, while using a fraction of the computational resources",

Confirming the hypothesis, CNNs autonomously extract image features, enabling the identification of game titles from screenshots without additional features. Using ImageNet pre-trained weights, EfficientNetB3 achieves the highest average accuracy (74.51%), while DenseNet169 excels in 14 of the 22 systems. Employing alternative initial weights from another screenshots dataset boosts accuracy for EfficientNetB2 and EfficientNetB3, with the latter reaching a peak accuracy of 76.36% and demonstrating reduced convergence epochs from 23.7 to 20.5 on average. Overall, the combination of optimal architecture and weights attains 77.67% accuracy, primarily led by EfficientNetB3 in 19 systems.

    "abstract": "This paper presents Deceptive-Human, a novel Prompt-to-NeRF framework capitalizing state-of-the-art control diffusion models (e.g., ControlNet) to generate a high-quality controllable 3D human NeRF. Different from direct 3D generative approaches, e.g., DreamFusion and DreamHuman, Deceptive-Human employs a progressive refinement technique to elevate the reconstruction quality. This is achieved by utilizing high-quality synthetic human images generated through the ControlNet with view-consistent loss. Our method is versatile and readily extensible, accommodating multimodal inputs, including a text prompt and additional data such as 3D mesh, poses, and seed images. The resulting 3D human NeRF model empowers the synthesis of highly photorealistic novel views from 360-degree perspectives. The key to our Deceptive-Human for hallucinating multi-view consistent synthetic human images lies in our progressive finetuning strategy. This strategy involves iteratively enhancing views using the provided multimodal inputs at each intermediate step to improve the human NeRF model. Within this iterative refinement process, view-dependent appearances are systematically eliminated to prevent interference with the underlying density estimation. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experimental comparison shows that our deceptive human models achieve state-of-the-art application quality",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Nuclear instance segmentation in histology images is crucial for a broad spectrum of clinical applications. Current prevailing nuclear instance segmentation algorithms rely on regression of nuclei contours, distance maps, watershed markers or a proxy nuclear representation of star-convex polygons. Consequently, these methods necessitate sophisticated post-processing operations to distinguish nuclei instances, which are commonly acknowledged to be error-prone and parameter-sensitive. Recently, the segment anything model (SAM) has earned attracted huge attention within the domain of medical image segmentation due to its impressive generalization ability and promptable property. Nevertheless, its potential on nuclear instance segmentation remains largely underexplored. In this paper, we present a novel prompt-driven framework that consists of a point prompter and a SAM for automatic nuclei instance segmentation. Specifically, the prompter learns to generate a unique point prompt for each nucleus while the SAM is fine tuned to output the corresponding mask of the cued nucleus. Furthermore, we propose to add adjacent nuclei as negative prompts to promote the model's ability to recognize overlapping nuclei. Without bells and whistles, our proposed method sets a new state-of-the-art performance on three challenging benchmarks.

State-of-the-art pipelines focus on the aggregation of features extracted from a deep backbone, in order to form a global descriptor for each image. In this context, we introduce SALAD (Sinkhorn Algorithm for Locally Aggregated Descriptors), which reformulates NetVLAD's soft-assignment of local features to clusters as an optimal transport problem. In SALAD, we consider both feature-to-cluster and cluster-to-feature relations and we also introduce a 'dustbin' cluster, designed to selectively discard features deemed non-informative, enhancing the overall descriptor quality. Additionally, we leverage and fine-tune DINOv2 as a backbone, which provides enhanced description power for the local features, and dramatically reduces the required training time. As a result, our single-stage method not only surpasses single-stage baselines in public VPR datasets, but also surpasses two-stage methods that add a re-ranking with significantly higher cost.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "This paper addresses the challenge of point-supervised temporal action detection, in which only one frame per action instance is annotated in the training set. Self-training aims to provide supplementary supervision for the training process by generating pseudo-labels (action proposals) from a base model. However, most current methods generate action proposals by applying manually designed thresholds to action classification probabilities and treating adjacent snippets as independent entities. As a result, these methods struggle to generate complete action proposals, exhibit sensitivity to fluctuations in action classification scores, and generate redundant and overlapping action proposals. This paper proposes a novel framework termed ADM-Loc, which stands for Actionness Distribution Modeling for point-supervised action Localization. ADM-Loc generates action proposals by fitting a composite distribution, comprising both Gaussian and uniform distributions, to the action classification signals. This fitting process is tailored to each action class present in the video and is applied separately for each action instance, ensuring the distinctiveness of their distributions. ADM-Loc significantly enhances the alignment between the generated action proposals and ground-truth action instances and offers high-quality pseudo-labels for self-training. Moreover, to model action boundary snippets, it enforces consistency in action classification scores during training by employing Gaussian kernels, supervised with the proposed loss functions.

Improvements to the deck tracking process would result in increased Sortie Generation Rates, and therefore applying automation is seen as a critical method to improve deck tracking. However, the requirements on a carrier ship do not allow for the installation of hardware-based location sensing technologies like Global Positioning System (GPS) sensors. PATRIOT (Panoramic Asset Tracking of Real-Time Information for the Ouija Tabletop) is a research effort and proposed solution to performing deck tracking with passive sensing and without the need for GPS sensors. PATRIOT is a prototype system which takes existing camera feeds, calculates aircraft poses, and updates a virtual Ouija board interface with the current status of the assets. PATRIOT would allow for faster, more accurate, and less laborious asset tracking for aircraft, people, and support equipment. PATRIOT is anticipated to benefit the warfighter by reducing cognitive workload, reducing manning requirements, collecting data to improve logistics, and enabling an automation gateway for future efforts to improve efficiency and safety. The authors have developed and tested algorithms to perform pose estimations of assets in real-time including OpenPifPaf, High-Resolution Network (HRNet), HigherHRNet (HHRNet), Faster R-CNN, and in-house developed encoder-decoder network.

In many commercial settings, the application of global positioning system (GPS) sensors is appropriate to achieve timely knowledge of the position of people and equipment.

LIFT OFF: LoRaWAN Installation and Fiducial Tracking Operations for the Flightline of the Future proposes a hybrid framework solution to achieve real-time situational awareness for people, support equipment, and aircraft positions regardless of the environment. This framework included a machine-vision component, which involved setting up cameras to detect AprilTag decals that were installed on the sides of aircraft. The framework included a geolocation sensor component, which involved installing GPS sensors on support equipment and helmets. The framework also included creating a long-range wide area network (LoRaWAN) to transfer data and developing a user interface to display the data. The framework was tested at Naval Air Station Oceana Flightline, the United States Naval Test Pilot School, and at Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst. LIFT OFF successfully provided a real-time updating map of all tracked assets using GPS sensors for people and support equipment and with visual fiducials for aircraft.

First, the background substitution and visual corruptions techniques are used to generate diverse and effective augmented domains. Then, the multi-channel feature alignment module based on class activation maps and class agnostic activation maps is designed to effectively extract adequate transferability knowledge. In this module, domain-invariant features can be fully explored by focusing on similar target regions between source and augmented domains feature space and suppressing the feature representation of non-similar target regions.

It unifies the data format of vision-language tasks, enabling multi-task joint training. However, vision-language tasks are constantly being created in practice. Instead of always re-training LMMs when new tasks arrive, continual learning offers flexibility for models to continually and efficiently exploit the evolving data. This work aims to explore the following two questions: 1) Do LMMs still suffer from catastrophic forgetting in continual instruction tuning? 2) Are the existing three classes of continual learning methods still applicable to the continual instruction tuning of LMMs? An extensive study is conducted to address the above questions. First, we establish the first benchmark in this setting and reveal that catastrophic forgetting is still observed when continually instruction-tuning LMMs. However, the multi-task joint instruction tuning can facilitate the model's continual learning ability and mitigate forgetting. Second, we integrate and adapt classic continual learning methods to our context, demonstrating the efficacy of data replay and model expansion strategies across diverse scenarios. In contrast, regularization-based methods only perform well on models that have been jointly instruction-tuned on multiple tasks. Third, we delve into the correlation and forgetting dynamics between vision-language task pairs and propose task-similarity-informed regularization and model expansion methods for continual instruction tuning of LMMs. Experimental results show that our approach consistently boosts the model's performance",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel approach to post-Optical Character Recognition Correction (POC) for handwritten Cyrillic text, addressing a significant gap in current research methodologies. This gap is due to the lack of large text corporas that provide OCR errors for further training of language-based POC models, which are demanding in terms of corpora size. Our study primarily focuses on the development and application of a synthetic handwriting generation engine based on B\\'ezier curves. Such an engine generates highly realistic handwritten text in any amounts, which we utilize to create a substantial dataset by transforming Russian text corpora sourced from the internet. We apply a Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) model to this dataset to identify OCR errors, forming the basis for our POC model training. The correction model is trained on a 90-symbol input context, utilizing a pre-trained T5 architecture with a seq2seq correction task. We evaluate our approach on HWR200 and School_notebooks_RU datasets as they provide significant challenges in the HTR domain. Furthermore, POC can be used to highlight errors for teachers, evaluating student performance. This can be done simply by comparing sentences before and after correction, displaying differences in text. Our primary contribution lies in the innovative use of B\\'ezier curves for Cyrillic text generation and subsequent error correction using a specialized POC model. We validate our approach by presenting Word Accuracy Rate (WAR) and Character Accuracy Rate (CAR) results, both with and without post-OCR correction, using real open corporas of handwritten Cyrillic text. These results, coupled with our methodology, are designed to be reproducible, paving the way for further advancements in the field of OCR and handwritten text analysis.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs)-based image captioning has the capability of describing objects not explicitly observed in training data; yet novel objects occur frequently, necessitating the requirement of sustaining up-to-date object knowledge for open-world comprehension. Instead of relying on large amounts of data and scaling up network parameters, we introduce a highly effective retrieval-augmented image captioning method that prompts LLMs with object names retrieved from External Visual--name memory (EVCap). We build ever-changing object knowledge memory using objects' visuals and names, enabling us to (i) update the memory at a minimal cost and (ii) effortlessly augment LLMs with retrieved object names utilizing a lightweight and fast-to-train model. Our model, which was trained only on the COCO dataset, can be adapted to out-domain data without additional fine-tuning or retraining. Our comprehensive experiments conducted on various benchmarks and synthetic commonsense-violating data demonstrate that EVCap, comprising solely 3.97M trainable parameters, exhibits superior performance compared to other methods of equivalent model size scale. Notably, it achieves competitive performance against specialist SOTAs with an enormous number of parameters. Our code is available at https://jiaxuan-li.github.io/EVCap",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have profoundly influenced medical fields, by providing tools to reduce clinical workloads. However, most AI models are constrained to execute uni-modal tasks, in stark contrast to the comprehensive approaches utilized by medical professionals. To address this, here we present RO-LLaMA, a versatile generalist large language model (LLM) tailored for the field of radiation oncology. This model seamlessly covers a wide range of the workflow of radiation oncologists, adept at various tasks such as clinical report summarization, radiation therapy plan suggestion, and plan-guided therapy target volume segmentation. In particular, to maximize the end-to-end performance, we further present a novel Consistency Embedding Fine-Tuning (CEFTune) technique, which boosts LLM's robustness to additional errors at the intermediates while preserving the capability of handling clean inputs, and creatively transform this concept into LLM-driven segmentation framework as Consistency Embedding Segmentation (CESEG). Experimental results on multi-centre cohort sets demonstrate our proposed RO-LLaMA's promising performance for diverse tasks with generalization capabilities",

We present a novel approach named InterControl for flexible spatial control of every joint in every person at any time by leveraging motion diffusion model only trained on single-person data. We incorporate a motion controlnet to generate coherent and realistic motions given sparse spatial control signals and a loss guidance module to precisely align any joint to the desired position in a classifier guidance manner via Inverse Kinematics (IK).

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging represents an important diagnostic modality; however, its inherently slow acquisition process poses challenges in obtaining fully sampled k-space data under motion in clinical scenarios such as abdominal, cardiac, and prostate imaging. In the absence of fully sampled acquisitions, which can serve as ground truth data, training deep learning algorithms in a supervised manner to predict the underlying ground truth image becomes an impossible task. To address this limitation, self-supervised methods have emerged as a viable alternative, leveraging available subsampled k-space data to train deep learning networks for MRI reconstruction. Nevertheless, these self-supervised approaches often fall short when compared to supervised methodologies. In this paper, we introduce JSSL (Joint Supervised and Self-supervised Learning), a novel training approach for deep learning-based MRI reconstruction algorithms aimed at enhancing reconstruction quality in scenarios where target dataset(s) containing fully sampled k-space measurements are unavailable. Our proposed method operates by simultaneously training a model in a self-supervised learning setting, using subsampled data from the target dataset(s), and in a supervised learning manner, utilizing data from other datasets, referred to as proxy datasets, where fully sampled k-space data is accessible. To demonstrate the efficacy of JSSL, we utilized subsampled prostate parallel MRI measurements as the target dataset, while employing fully sampled brain and knee k-space acquisitions as proxy datasets. Our results showcase a substantial improvement over conventional self-supervised training methods, thereby underscoring the effectiveness of our joint approach. We provide a theoretical motivation for JSSL and establish a practical \"rule-of-thumb\" for selecting the most appropriate training approach for deep MRI reconstruction",

To address this, we propose SiTH, a novel pipeline that uniquely integrates an image-conditioned diffusion model into a 3D mesh reconstruction workflow. At the core of our method lies the decomposition of the ill-posed single-view reconstruction problem into hallucination and reconstruction subproblems. For the former, we employ a powerful generative diffusion model to hallucinate back appearances from the input images. For the latter, we leverage skinned body meshes as guidance to recover full-body texture meshes from the input and back-view images. Our designs enable training of the pipeline with only about 500 3D human scans while maintaining its generality and robustness.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In the realm of video object tracking, auxiliary modalities such as depth, thermal, or event data have emerged as valuable assets to complement the RGB trackers. In practice, most existing RGB trackers learn a single set of parameters to use them across datasets and applications. However, a similar single-model unification for multi-modality tracking presents several challenges. These challenges stem from the inherent heterogeneity of inputs -- each with modality-specific representations, the scarcity of multi-modal datasets, and the absence of all the modalities at all times. In this work, we introduce Un-Track, a \\underline{Un}ified Tracker of a single set of parameters for any modality. To handle any modality, our method learns their common latent space through low-rank factorization and reconstruction techniques. More importantly, we use only the RGB-X pairs to learn the common latent space. This unique shared representation seamlessly binds all modalities together, enabling effective unification and accommodating any missing modality, all within a single transformer-based architecture and without the need for modality-specific fine-tuning. Our Un-Track achieves +8.1 absolute F-score gain, on the DepthTrack dataset, by introducing only +2.14 (over 21.50) GFLOPs with +6.6M (over 93M) parameters, through a simple yet efficient prompting strategy. Extensive comparisons on five benchmark datasets with different modalities show that Un-Track surpasses both SOTA unified trackers and modality-specific finetuned counterparts, validating our effectiveness and practicality",

In this work, we propose a novel machine learning pipeline capable of classifying tissue tiles into one of the five patterns or as non-tumor, with an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUCROC) score of 0.97. Our model's strength lies in its comprehensive consideration of cellular spatial patterns, where it first generates cell maps from Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) whole slide images (WSIs), which are then fed into a convolutional neural network classification model. Exploiting these cell maps provides the model with robust generalizability to new data, achieving approximately 30% higher accuracy on unseen test-sets compared to current state of the art approaches.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Learning based image quality assessment (IQA) models have obtained impressive performance with the help of reliable subjective quality labels, where mean opinion score (MOS) is the most popular choice. However, in view of the subjective bias of individual annotators, the labor-abundant MOS (LA-MOS) typically requires a large collection of opinion scores from multiple annotators for each image, which significantly increases the learning cost. In this paper, we aim to learn robust IQA models from low-cost MOS (LC-MOS), which only requires very few opinion scores or even a single opinion score for each image. More specifically, we consider the LC-MOS as the noisy observation of LA-MOS and enforce the IQA model learned from LC-MOS to approach the unbiased estimation of LA-MOS. In this way, we represent the subjective bias between LC-MOS and LA-MOS, and the model bias between IQA predictions learned from LC-MOS and LA-MOS (i.e., dual-bias) as two latent variables with unknown parameters. By means of the expectation-maximization based alternating optimization, we can jointly estimate the parameters of the dual-bias, which suppresses the misleading of LC-MOS via a gated dual-bias calibration (GDBC) module. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first exploration of robust IQA model learning from noisy low-cost labels. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on four popular IQA datasets show that the proposed method is robust toward different bias rates and annotation numbers and significantly outperforms the other learning based IQA models when only LC-MOS is available. Furthermore, we also achieve comparable performance with respect to the other models learned with LA-MOS",

    "abstract": "This study focuses on a novel task in text-to-image (T2I) generation, namely action customization. The objective of this task is to learn the co-existing action from limited data and generalize it to unseen humans or even animals. Experimental results show that existing subject-driven customization methods fail to learn the representative characteristics of actions and struggle in decoupling actions from context features, including appearance. To overcome the preference for low-level features and the entanglement of high-level features, we propose an inversion-based method Action-Disentangled Identifier (ADI) to learn action-specific identifiers from the exemplar images. ADI first expands the semantic conditioning space by introducing layer-wise identifier tokens, thereby increasing the representational richness while distributing the inversion across different features. Then, to block the inversion of action-agnostic features, ADI extracts the gradient invariance from the constructed sample triples and masks the updates of irrelevant channels. To comprehensively evaluate the task, we present an ActionBench that includes a variety of actions, each accompanied by meticulously selected samples. Both quantitative and qualitative results show that our ADI outperforms existing baselines in action-customized T2I generation",

We introduce Audio-based Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (A-JEPA), a simple extension method for self-supervised learning from the audio spectrum. Following the design of I-JPEA, our A-JEPA encodes visible audio spectrogram patches with a curriculum masking strategy via context encoder, and predicts the representations of regions sampled at well-designed locations. The target representations of those regions are extracted by the exponential moving average of context encoder, \\emph{i.e.}, target encoder, on the whole spectrogram. We find it beneficial to transfer random block masking into time-frequency aware masking in a curriculum manner, considering the complexity of highly correlated in local time and frequency in audio spectrograms. To enhance contextual semantic understanding and robustness, we fine-tune the encoder with a regularized masking on target datasets, instead of input dropping or zero. Empirically, when built with Vision Transformers structure, we find A-JEPA to be highly scalable and sets new state-of-the-art performance on multiple audio and speech classification tasks, outperforming other recent models that use externally supervised pre-training",

While contrastively trained VLMs show impressive zero-shot generalization performance, their effectiveness is limited when dealing with diverse domains during training and testing. Existing prompt learning techniques overlook the importance of incorporating domain and content information into the prompts, which results in a drop in performance while dealing with such multi-domain data. To address these challenges, we propose a solution that ensures domain-invariant prompt learning while enhancing the expressiveness of visual features. We observe that CLIP's vision encoder struggles to identify contextual image information, particularly when image patches are jumbled up. This issue is especially severe in optical remote sensing images, where land-cover classes exhibit well-defined contextual appearances. To this end, we introduce C-SAW, a method that complements CLIP with a self-supervised loss in the visual space and a novel prompt learning technique that emphasizes both visual domain and content-specific features. We keep the CLIP backbone frozen and introduce a small set of projectors for both the CLIP encoders to train C-SAW contrastively.

However, such techniques suffer from their lack of adaptability to the target devices, as a hardware typically only support specific bit widths. Thus, to adapt to a variety of devices, a quantization method shall be flexible enough to find good accuracy v.s. speed trade-offs for every bit width and target device. To achieve this, we propose PIPE, a quantization method that leverages residual error expansion, along with group sparsity and an ensemble approximation for better parallelization.

    "abstract": "Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) is an open-set recognition task, which is usually formulated as a one-class classification (OCC) problem, where training data is comprised of videos with normal instances while test data contains both normal and anomalous instances. Recent works have investigated the creation of pseudo-anomalies (PAs) using only the normal data and making strong assumptions about real-world anomalies with regards to abnormality of objects and speed of motion to inject prior information about anomalies in an autoencoder (AE) based reconstruction model during training. This work proposes a novel method for generating generic spatio-temporal PAs by inpainting a masked out region of an image using a pre-trained Latent Diffusion Model and further perturbing the optical flow using mixup to emulate spatio-temporal distortions in the data. In addition, we present a simple unified framework to detect real-world anomalies under the OCC setting by learning three types of anomaly indicators, namely reconstruction quality, temporal irregularity and semantic inconsistency. Extensive experiments on four VAD benchmark datasets namely Ped2, Avenue, ShanghaiTech and UBnormal demonstrate that our method performs on par with other existing state-of-the-art PAs generation and reconstruction based methods under the OCC setting. Our analysis also examines the transferability and generalisation of PAs across these datasets, offering valuable insights by identifying real-world anomalies through PAs",

To address this problem, we introduce a 3D smoothing filter which constrains the size of the 3D Gaussian primitives based on the maximal sampling frequency induced by the input views, eliminating high-frequency artifacts when zooming in. Moreover, replacing 2D dilation with a 2D Mip filter, which simulates a 2D box filter, effectively mitigates aliasing and dilation issues.

    "title": "TFMQ-DM: Temporal Feature Maintenance Quantization for Diffusion Models",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The Diffusion model, a prevalent framework for image generation, encounters significant challenges in terms of broad applicability due to its extended inference times and substantial memory requirements. Efficient Post-training Quantization (PTQ) is pivotal for addressing these issues in traditional models. Different from traditional models, diffusion models heavily depend on the time-step $t$ to achieve satisfactory multi-round denoising. Usually, $t$ from the finite set $\\{1, \\ldots, T\\}$ is encoded to a temporal feature by a few modules totally irrespective of the sampling data. However, existing PTQ methods do not optimize these modules separately. They adopt inappropriate reconstruction targets and complex calibration methods, resulting in a severe disturbance of the temporal feature and denoising trajectory, as well as a low compression efficiency. To solve these, we propose a Temporal Feature Maintenance Quantization (TFMQ) framework building upon a Temporal Information Block which is just related to the time-step $t$ and unrelated to the sampling data. Powered by the pioneering block design, we devise temporal information aware reconstruction (TIAR) and finite set calibration (FSC) to align the full-precision temporal features in a limited time. Equipped with the framework, we can maintain the most temporal information and ensure the end-to-end generation quality. Extensive experiments on various datasets and diffusion models prove our state-of-the-art results. Remarkably, our quantization approach, for the first time, achieves model performance nearly on par with the full-precision model under 4-bit weight quantization. Additionally, our method incurs almost no extra computational cost and accelerates quantization time by $2.0 \\times$ on LSUN-Bedrooms $256 \\times 256$ compared to previous works",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) aims to adapt a source model for a target domain, with only access to unlabeled target training data and the source model pre-trained on a supervised source domain. Relying on pseudo labeling and/or auxiliary supervision, conventional methods are inevitably error-prone. To mitigate this limitation, in this work we for the first time explore the potentials of off-the-shelf vision-language (ViL) multimodal models (e.g.,CLIP) with rich whilst heterogeneous knowledge. We find that directly applying the ViL model to the target domain in a zero-shot fashion is unsatisfactory, as it is not specialized for this particular task but largely generic. To make it task specific, we propose a novel Distilling multimodal Foundation model(DIFO)approach. Specifically, DIFO alternates between two steps during adaptation: (i) Customizing the ViL model by maximizing the mutual information with the target model in a prompt learning manner, (ii) Distilling the knowledge of this customized ViL model to the target model. For more fine-grained and reliable distillation, we further introduce two effective regularization terms, namely most-likely category encouragement and predictive consistency. Extensive experiments show that DIFO significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art alternatives. Our source code will be released",

    "title": "Stable Segment Anything Model",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The Segment Anything Model (SAM) achieves remarkable promptable segmentation given high-quality prompts which, however, often require good skills to specify. To make SAM robust to casual prompts, this paper presents the first comprehensive analysis on SAM's segmentation stability across a diverse spectrum of prompt qualities, notably imprecise bounding boxes and insufficient points. Our key finding reveals that given such low-quality prompts, SAM's mask decoder tends to activate image features that are biased towards the background or confined to specific object parts. To mitigate this issue, our key idea consists of adjusting the sampling locations of image feature using learnable deformable offsets, while the original SAM model architecture and weights remain unchanged. Consequently, our deformable sampling plugin (DSP) enables SAM to adaptively shift attention to the prompted target regions in a data-driven manner, facilitated by our effective robust training strategy (RTS). During inference, dynamic routing plugin (DRP) is proposed that toggles SAM between the deformable and regular grid sampling modes, conditioned on the input prompt quality. Thus, our solution, termed Stable-SAM, is one of its kind focusing on solely adjusting feature sampling locations, which offers several advantages: 1) improved SAM's segmentation stability across a wide range of prompt qualities, while 2) retaining SAM's powerful promptable segmentation efficiency and generality, with 3) minimal learnable parameters (0.08 M) and fast adaptation (by 1 training epoch). Extensive experiments across multiple datasets validate the effectiveness and advantages of our approach, underscoring Stable-SAM as a more robust solution for segmenting anything.

However, challenges remain in accurately understanding and synthesizing the layout requirements in the textual prompts. To align the generated image with layout instructions, we present a training-free layout calibration system SimM that intervenes in the generative process on the fly during inference time. Specifically, following a \"check-locate-rectify\" pipeline, the system first analyses the prompt to generate the target layout and compares it with the intermediate outputs to automatically detect errors. Then, by moving the located activations and making intra- and inter-map adjustments, the rectification process can be performed with negligible computational overhead. To evaluate SimM over a range of layout requirements, we present a benchmark SimMBench that compensates for the lack of superlative spatial relations in existing datasets. And both quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SimM in calibrating the layout inconsistencies",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Large pre-trained vision models achieve impressive success in computer vision. However, fully fine-tuning large models for downstream tasks, particularly in video understanding, can be prohibitively computationally expensive. Recent studies turn their focus towards efficient image-to-video transfer learning. Nevertheless, existing efficient fine-tuning methods lack attention to training memory usage and exploration of transferring a larger model to the video domain. In this paper, we present a novel Spatial-Temporal Side Network for memory-efficient fine-tuning large image models to video understanding, named Side4Video. Specifically, we introduce a lightweight spatial-temporal side network attached to the frozen vision model, which avoids the backpropagation through the heavy pre-trained model and utilizes multi-level spatial features from the original image model. Extremely memory-efficient architecture enables our method to reduce 75% memory usage than previous adapter-based methods. In this way, we can transfer a huge ViT-E (4.4B) for video understanding tasks which is 14x larger than ViT-L (304M). Our approach achieves remarkable performance on various video datasets across unimodal and cross-modal tasks (i.e., action recognition and text-video retrieval), especially in Something-Something V1&V2 (67.3% & 74.6%), Kinetics-400 (88.6%), MSR-VTT (52.3%), MSVD (56.1%) and VATEX (68.8%).

These models predominantly map visual information into language representation space, leveraging the vast knowledge and powerful text generation abilities of LLMs to produce multimodal instruction-following responses. We could term this method as LLMs for Vision because of its employing LLMs for visual-language understanding, yet observe that these MLLMs neglect the potential of harnessing visual knowledge to enhance overall capabilities of LLMs, which could be regraded as Vision Enhancing LLMs. In this paper, we propose an approach called MKS2, aimed at enhancing LLMs through empowering Multimodal Knowledge Storage and Sharing in LLMs. Specifically, we introduce the Modular Visual Memory, a component integrated into the internal blocks of LLMs, designed to store open-world visual information efficiently. Additionally, we present a soft Mixtures-of-Multimodal Experts architecture in LLMs to invoke multimodal knowledge collaboration during generation. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MKS2 substantially augments the reasoning capabilities of LLMs in contexts necessitating physical or commonsense knowledge.

This interconnection extends to the manifestation of interplanar spacings within a crystalline lattice. Analysis of these interplanar spacings and the comprehension of any deviations, whether it be lattice compression or expansion, commonly referred to as strain, hold paramount significance in unraveling various unknowns within the field. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) is widely used to capture atomic-scale ordering, facilitating direct investigation of interplanar spacings. However, creating critical contour maps for visualizing and interpreting lattice stresses in TEM images remains a challenging task. Here we developed a Python code for TEM image processing that can handle a wide range of materials including nanoparticles, 2D materials, pure crystals and solid solutions. This algorithm converts local differences in interplanar spacings into contour maps allowing for a visual representation of lattice expansion and compression. The tool is very generic and can significantly aid in analyzing material properties using TEM images, allowing for a more in-depth exploration of the underlying science behind strain engineering via strain contour maps at the atomic level",

Further, we present an objective function related to optimizing Sinkhorn distance with traditional GAN to improve the stability of adversarial learning.

We demonstrate both qualitative and quantitative outcomes with available state-of-the-art methods.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "It is well known that many open-released foundational diffusion models have difficulty in generating images that substantially depart from average brightness, despite such images being present in the training data. This is due to an inconsistency: while denoising starts from pure Gaussian noise during inference, the training noise schedule retains residual data even in the final timestep distribution, due to difficulties in numerical conditioning in mainstream formulation, leading to unintended bias during inference. To mitigate this issue, certain $\\epsilon$-prediction models are combined with an ad-hoc offset-noise methodology. In parallel, some contemporary models have adopted zero-terminal SNR noise schedules together with $\\mathbf{v}$-prediction, which necessitate major alterations to pre-trained models. However, such changes risk destabilizing a large multitude of community-driven applications anchored on these pre-trained models. In light of this, our investigation revisits the fundamental causes, leading to our proposal of an innovative and principled remedy, called One More Step (OMS). By integrating a compact network and incorporating an additional simple yet effective step during inference, OMS elevates image fidelity and harmonizes the dichotomy between training and inference, while preserving original model parameters. Once trained, various pre-trained diffusion models with the same latent domain can share the same OMS module",

Cultural heritage institutions have been using linked data to improve archival descriptions and facilitate the discovery of information. Most archival records have digital representations of physical artifacts in the form of scanned images that are non-machine-readable. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) recognizes text in images and translates it into machine-encoded text. This paper evaluates the impact of image processing methods and parameter tuning in OCR applied to typewritten cultural heritage documents. The approach uses a multi-objective problem formulation to minimize Levenshtein edit distance and maximize the number of words correctly identified with a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) to tune the methods' parameters. Evaluation results show that parameterization by digital representation typology benefits the performance of image pre-processing algorithms in OCR. Furthermore, our findings suggest that employing image pre-processing algorithms in OCR might be more suitable for typologies where the text recognition task without pre-processing does not produce good results. In particular, Adaptive Thresholding, Bilateral Filter, and Opening are the best-performing algorithms for the theatre plays' covers, letters, and overall dataset, respectively, and should be applied before OCR to improve its performance",

Specifically, we explore the potential of its generated rich textual descriptions across various categories to enhance recognition performance without any training. Additionally, we evaluate its visual proficiency in directly recognizing diverse visual content. To achieve this, we conduct an extensive series of experiments, systematically quantifying the performance of GPT-4 across three modalities: images, videos, and point clouds. This comprehensive evaluation encompasses a total of 16 widely recognized benchmark datasets, providing top-1 and top-5 accuracy metrics. Our study reveals that leveraging GPT-4's advanced linguistic knowledge to generate rich descriptions markedly improves zero-shot recognition. In terms of visual proficiency, GPT-4V's average performance across 16 datasets sits roughly between the capabilities of OpenAI-CLIP's ViT-L and EVA-CLIP's ViT-E.

However, in light of these rapid advances, addressing the underrepresentation of black communities and African countries in AI is crucial. Boosting enthusiasm for AI can be effectively accomplished by showcasing straightforward applications around tasks like identifying and categorizing traditional symbols, such as Adinkra symbols, or familiar objects within the community. In this research endeavor, we dived into classical machine learning and harnessed the power of deep learning models to tackle the intricate task of classifying and recognizing Adinkra symbols. The idea led to a newly constructed ADINKRA dataset comprising 174,338 images meticulously organized into 62 distinct classes, each representing a singular and emblematic symbol. We constructed a CNN model for classification and recognition using six convolutional layers, three fully connected (FC) layers, and optional dropout regularization. The model is a simpler and smaller version of VGG, with fewer layers, smaller channel sizes, and a fixed kernel size. Additionally, we tap into the transfer learning capabilities provided by pre-trained models like VGG and ResNet. These models assist us in both classifying images and extracting features that can be used with classical machine learning models. We assess the model's performance by measuring its accuracy and convergence rate and visualizing the areas that significantly influence its predictions.

Although Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) [22] is a widely adpoted method for understanding model behaviors, it is unstable with respect to random seeds [35,24,3] and exhibits low local fidelity (i.e., how well the explanation approximates the model's local behaviors) [21,16]. Our study shows that this instability problem stems from small sample weights, leading to the dominance of regularization and slow convergence. Additionally, LIME's sampling neighborhood is non-local and biased towards the reference, resulting in poor local fidelity and sensitivity to reference choice. To tackle these challenges, we introduce GLIME, an enhanced framework extending LIME and unifying several prior methods. Within the GLIME framework, we derive an equivalent formulation of LIME that achieves significantly faster convergence and improved stability. By employing a local and unbiased sampling distribution, GLIME generates explanations with higher local fidelity compared to LIME. GLIME explanations are independent of reference choice.

This study investigates the application Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), a type of generative AI model, to lung cancer lesions. Proposed models were trained on lesions extracted from 3D CT scans in the LIDC-IDRI public dataset. Latent vector representations of 2D slices produced by the VAEs were explored through clustering to justify their quality and used in an MLP classifier model for lung cancer diagnosis, the best model achieved state-of-the-art metrics of AUC 0.98 and 93.1% accuracy. Cluster analysis shows the VAE latent space separates the dataset of malignant and benign lesions based on meaningful feature components including tumour size, shape, patient and malignancy class. We also include a comparative analysis of the standard Gaussian VAE (GVAE) and the more recent Dirichlet VAE (DirVAE), which replaces the prior with a Dirichlet distribution to encourage a more explainable latent space with disentangled feature representation.

Given the target objects, SAM-6D employs two dedicated sub-networks, namely Instance Segmentation Model (ISM) and Pose Estimation Model (PEM), to perform these steps on cluttered RGB-D images. ISM takes SAM as an advanced starting point to generate all possible object proposals and selectively preserves valid ones through meticulously crafted object matching scores in terms of semantics, appearance and geometry. By treating pose estimation as a partial-to-partial point matching problem, PEM performs a two-stage point matching process featuring a novel design of background tokens to construct dense 3D-3D correspondence, ultimately yielding the pose estimates. Without bells and whistles, SAM-6D outperforms the existing methods on the seven core datasets of the BOP Benchmark for both instance segmentation and pose estimation of novel objects",

    "abstract": "Although soft prompt tuning is effective in efficiently adapting Vision-Language (V&L) models for downstream tasks, it shows limitations in dealing with distribution shifts. We address this issue with Attribute-Guided Prompt Tuning (ArGue), making three key contributions. 1) In contrast to the conventional approach of directly appending soft prompts preceding class names, we align the model with primitive visual attributes generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). We posit that a model's ability to express high confidence in these attributes signifies its capacity to discern the correct class rationales. 2) We introduce attribute sampling to eliminate disadvantageous attributes, thus only semantically meaningful attributes are preserved. 3) We propose negative prompting, explicitly enumerating class-agnostic attributes to activate spurious correlations and encourage the model to generate highly orthogonal probability distributions in relation to these negative features. In experiments, our method significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art prompt tuning methods on both novel class prediction and out-of-distribution generalization tasks",

However, due to the fact that they can only manipulate input to see changes in output, they suffer from weak performance when used with complex model architectures.

In this work, we present a framework for using sampling-based explanation models in a computer vision context by body part relevance assessment for pedestrian detection.

    "title": "HAVE-FUN: Human Avatar Reconstruction from Few-Shot Unconstrained Images",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "As for human avatar reconstruction, contemporary techniques commonly necessitate the acquisition of costly data and struggle to achieve satisfactory results from a small number of casual images. In this paper, we investigate this task from a few-shot unconstrained photo album. The reconstruction of human avatars from such data sources is challenging because of limited data amount and dynamic articulated poses. For handling dynamic data, we integrate a skinning mechanism with deep marching tetrahedra (DMTet) to form a drivable tetrahedral representation, which drives arbitrary mesh topologies generated by the DMTet for the adaptation of unconstrained images. To effectively mine instructive information from few-shot data, we devise a two-phase optimization method with few-shot reference and few-shot guidance. The former focuses on aligning avatar identity with reference images, while the latter aims to generate plausible appearances for unseen regions. Overall, our framework, called HaveFun, can undertake avatar reconstruction, rendering, and animation. Extensive experiments on our developed benchmarks demonstrate that HaveFun exhibits substantially superior performance in reconstructing the human body and hand.

    "abstract": "We present an unsupervised data-driven approach for non-rigid shape matching. Shape matching identifies correspondences between two shapes and is a fundamental step in many computer vision and graphics applications. Our approach is designed to be particularly robust when matching shapes digitized using 3D scanners that contain fine geometric detail and suffer from different types of noise including topological noise caused by the coalescence of spatially close surface regions. We build on two strategies. First, using a hierarchical patch based shape representation we match shapes consistently in a coarse to fine manner, allowing for robustness to noise. This multi-scale representation drastically reduces the dimensionality of the problem when matching at the coarsest scale, rendering unsupervised learning feasible. Second, we constrain this hierarchical matching to be reflected in 3D by fitting a patch-wise near-rigid deformation model. Using this constraint, we leverage spatial continuity at different scales to capture global shape properties, resulting in matchings that generalize well to data with different deformations and noise characteristics. Experiments demonstrate that our approach obtains significantly better results on raw 3D scans than state-of-the-art methods, while performing on-par on standard test scenarios",

Specifically, TReg applies the textual description of the preconception of the solution during the reverse sampling phase, of which description isndynamically reinforced through null-text optimization for adaptive negation.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Text-to-image diffusion models are typically trained to optimize the log-likelihood objective, which presents challenges in meeting specific requirements for downstream tasks, such as image aesthetics and image-text alignment. Recent research addresses this issue by refining the diffusion U-Net using human rewards through reinforcement learning or direct backpropagation. However, many of them overlook the importance of the text encoder, which is typically pretrained and fixed during training. In this paper, we demonstrate that by finetuning the text encoder through reinforcement learning, we can enhance the text-image alignment of the results, thereby improving the visual quality. Our primary motivation comes from the observation that the current text encoder is suboptimal, often requiring careful prompt adjustment. While fine-tuning the U-Net can partially improve performance, it remains suffering from the suboptimal text encoder. Therefore, we propose to use reinforcement learning with low-rank adaptation to finetune the text encoder based on task-specific rewards, referred as \\textbf{TexForce}. We first show that finetuning the text encoder can improve the performance of diffusion models. Then, we illustrate that TexForce can be simply combined with existing U-Net finetuned models to get much better results without additional training. Finally, we showcase the adaptability of our method in diverse applications, including the generation of high-quality face and hand images",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Large vision-language models (LVLMs) suffer from hallucination a lot, generating responses that apparently contradict to the image content occasionally. The key problem lies in its weak ability to comprehend detailed content in a multi-modal context, which can be mainly attributed to two factors in training data and loss function. The vision instruction dataset primarily focuses on global description, and the auto-regressive loss function favors text modeling rather than image understanding. In this paper, we bring more detailed vision annotations and more discriminative vision models to facilitate the training of LVLMs, so that they can generate more precise responses without encounter hallucination. On one hand, we generate image-text pairs with detailed relationship annotations in panoptic scene graph dataset (PSG). These conversations pay more attention on detailed facts in the image, encouraging the model to answer questions based on multi-modal contexts. On the other hand, we integrate SAM and mask prediction loss as auxiliary supervision, forcing the LVLMs to have the capacity to identify context-related objects, so that they can generate more accurate responses, mitigating hallucination. Moreover, to provide a deeper evaluation on the hallucination in LVLMs, we propose a new benchmark, RAH-Bench. It divides vision hallucination into three different types that contradicts the image with wrong categories, attributes or relations, and introduces False Positive Rate as detailed sub-metric for each type. In this benchmark, our approach demonstrates an +8.4% enhancement compared to original LLaVA and achieves widespread performance improvements across other models",

This employs Q-learning (with standard Q*) for generation and follows a semantic-rewarded trajectory for image search through finite encoding-tailored actions.

We develop a palette of stylized 3D strokes from basic primitives and splines, and consider the 3D scene stylization task as a multi-view reconstruction process based on these 3D stroke primitives. Instead of directly searching for the parameters of these 3D strokes, which would be too costly, we introduce a differentiable renderer that allows optimizing stroke parameters using gradient descent, and propose a training scheme to alleviate the vanishing gradient issue. The extensive evaluation demonstrates that our approach effectively synthesizes 3D scenes with significant geometric and aesthetic stylization while maintaining a consistent appearance across different views.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Computer-aided diagnosis of skin diseases is an important tool. However, the interpretability of computer-aided diagnosis is currently poor. Dermatologists and patients cannot intuitively understand the learning and prediction process of neural networks, which will lead to a decrease in the credibility of computer-aided diagnosis. In addition, traditional methods need to be trained using negative samples in order to predict the presence or absence of a lesion, but medical data is often in short supply. In this paper, we propose a multiple high-order attention interaction model (MHA-UNet) for use in a highly explainable skin lesion segmentation task. MHA-UNet is able to obtain the presence or absence of a lesion by explainable reasoning without the need for training on negative samples. Specifically, we propose a high-order attention interaction mechanism that introduces squeeze attention to a higher level for feature attention. In addition, a multiple high-order attention interaction (MHAblock) module is proposed by combining the different features of different orders. For classifying the presence or absence of lesions, we conducted classification experiments on several publicly available datasets in the absence of negative samples, based on explainable reasoning about the interaction of 5 attention orders of MHAblock. The highest positive detection rate obtained from the experiments was 81.0% and the highest negative detection rate was 83.5%. For segmentation experiments, comparison experiments of the proposed method with 13 medical segmentation models and external validation experiments with 8 state-of-the-art models in three public datasets and our clinical dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our model.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Large-scale visual-language pre-trained models have achieved significant success in various video tasks. However, most existing methods follow an \"adapt then align\" paradigm, which adapts pre-trained image encoders to model video-level representations and utilizes one-hot or text embedding of the action labels for supervision. This paradigm overlooks the challenge of mapping from static images to complicated activity concepts. In this paper, we propose a novel \"Align before Adapt\" (ALT) paradigm. Prior to adapting to video representation learning, we exploit the entity-to-region alignments for each frame. The alignments are fulfilled by matching the region-aware image embeddings to an offline-constructed text corpus. With the aligned entities, we feed their text embeddings to a transformer-based video adapter as the queries, which can help extract the semantics of the most important entities from a video to a vector. This paradigm reuses the visual-language alignment of VLP during adaptation and tries to explain an action by the underlying entities. This helps understand actions by bridging the gap with complex activity semantics, particularly when facing unfamiliar or unseen categories. ALT achieves competitive performance and superior generalizability while requiring significantly low computational costs. In fully supervised scenarios, it achieves 88.1% top-1 accuracy on Kinetics-400 with only 4947 GFLOPs. In 2-shot experiments, ALT outperforms the previous state-of-the-art by 7.1% and 9.2% on HMDB-51 and UCF-101, respectively",

    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are susceptible to adversarial examples. Conventional attacks generate controlled noise-like perturbations that fail to reflect real-world scenarios and hard to interpretable. In contrast, recent unconstrained attacks mimic natural image transformations occurring in the real world for perceptible but inconspicuous attacks, yet compromise realism due to neglect of image post-processing and uncontrolled attack direction. In this paper, we propose RetouchUAA, an unconstrained attack that exploits a real-life perturbation: image retouching styles, highlighting its potential threat to DNNs. Compared to existing attacks, RetouchUAA offers several notable advantages. Firstly, RetouchUAA excels in generating interpretable and realistic perturbations through two key designs: the image retouching attack framework and the retouching style guidance module. The former custom-designed human-interpretability retouching framework for adversarial attack by linearizing images while modelling the local processing and retouching decision-making in human retouching behaviour, provides an explicit and reasonable pipeline for understanding the robustness of DNNs against retouching. The latter guides the adversarial image towards standard retouching styles, thereby ensuring its realism. Secondly, attributed to the design of the retouching decision regularization and the persistent attack strategy, RetouchUAA also exhibits outstanding attack capability and defense robustness, posing a heavy threat to DNNs. Experiments on ImageNet and Place365 reveal that RetouchUAA achieves nearly 100\\% white-box attack success against three DNNs, while achieving a better trade-off between image naturalness, transferability and defense robustness than baseline attacks",

Leveraging anatomical priors in neural networks can greatly enhance their utility in resource-constrained clinical settings. Prior research has harnessed such information for image segmentation, yet progress in deformable image registration has been modest. Our work introduces textSCF, a novel method that integrates spatially covariant filters and textual anatomical prompts encoded by visual-language models, to fill this gap. This approach optimizes an implicit function that correlates text embeddings of anatomical regions to filter weights, relaxing the typical translation-invariance constraint of convolutional operations. TextSCF not only boosts computational efficiency but can also retain or improve registration accuracy. By capturing the contextual interplay between anatomical regions, it offers impressive inter-regional transferability and the ability to preserve structural discontinuities during registration. TextSCF's performance has been rigorously tested on inter-subject brain MRI and abdominal CT registration tasks, outperforming existing state-of-the-art models in the MICCAI Learn2Reg 2021 challenge and leading the leaderboard. In abdominal registrations, textSCF's larger model variant improved the Dice score by 11.3% over the second-best model, while its smaller variant maintained similar accuracy but with an 89.13% reduction in network parameters and a 98.34\\% decrease in computational operations",

However these methods continue to show weak boundary estimation and high false negative rates for small objects and distant sparse regions. We argue that such weaknesses can be compensated by using RGB images which provide a denser representation of the scene. We propose an image-guidance network (IGNet) which builds upon the idea of distilling high level feature information from a domain adapted synthetically trained 2D semantic segmentation network. We further utilize a one-way contrastive learning scheme alongside a novel mixing strategy called FOVMix, to combat the horizontal field-of-view mismatch between the two sensors and enhance the effects of image guidance.

    "title": "UniRepLKNet: A Universal Perception Large-Kernel ConvNet for Audio, Video, Point Cloud, Time-Series and Image Recognition",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Large-kernel convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) have recently received extensive research attention, but there are two unresolved and critical issues that demand further investigation. 1) The architectures of existing large-kernel ConvNets largely follow the design principles of conventional ConvNets or transformers, while the architectural design for large-kernel ConvNets remains under-addressed. 2) As transformers have dominated multiple modalities, it remains to be investigated whether ConvNets also have a strong universal perception ability in domains beyond vision. In this paper, we contribute from two aspects. 1) We propose four architectural guidelines for designing large-kernel ConvNets, the core of which is to exploit the essential characteristics of large kernels that distinguish them from small kernels - they can see wide without going deep. Following such guidelines, our proposed large-kernel ConvNet shows leading performance in image recognition. For example, our models achieve an ImageNet accuracy of 88.0%, ADE20K mIoU of 55.6%, and COCO box AP of 56.4%, demonstrating better performance and higher speed than a number of recently proposed powerful competitors. 2) We discover that large kernels are the key to unlocking the exceptional performance of ConvNets in domains where they were originally not proficient. With certain modality-related preprocessing approaches, the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on time-series forecasting and audio recognition tasks even without modality-specific customization to the architecture.

    "title": "Can Vision-Language Models Think from a First-Person Perspective?",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently shown promising results in traditional downstream tasks. Evaluation studies have emerged to assess their abilities, with the majority focusing on the third-person perspective, and only a few addressing specific tasks from the first-person perspective. However, the capability of VLMs to \"think\" from a first-person perspective, a crucial attribute for advancing autonomous agents and robotics, remains largely unexplored. To bridge this research gap, we introduce EgoThink, a novel visual question-answering benchmark that encompasses six core capabilities with twelve detailed dimensions. The benchmark is constructed using selected clips from egocentric videos, with manually annotated question-answer pairs containing first-person information. To comprehensively assess VLMs, we evaluate eighteen popular VLMs on EgoThink. Moreover, given the open-ended format of the answers, we use GPT-4 as the automatic judge to compute single-answer grading. Experimental results indicate that although GPT-4V leads in numerous dimensions, all evaluated VLMs still possess considerable potential for improvement in first-person perspective tasks. Meanwhile, enlarging the number of trainable parameters has the most significant impact on model performance on EgoThink. In conclusion, EgoThink serves as a valuable addition to existing evaluation benchmarks for VLMs, providing an indispensable resource for future research in the realm of embodied artificial intelligence and robotics",

    "title": "Progressive Target-Styled Feature Augmentation for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation on Point Clouds",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Unsupervised domain adaptation is a critical challenge in the field of point cloud analysis, as models trained on one set of data often struggle to perform well in new scenarios due to domain shifts. Previous works tackle the problem by using adversarial training or self-supervised learning for feature extractor adaptation, but ensuring that features extracted from the target domain can be distinguished by the source-supervised classifier remains challenging. In this work, we propose a novel approach called progressive target-styled feature augmentation (PTSFA). Unlike previous works that focus on feature extractor adaptation, our PTSFA approach focuses on classifier adaptation. It aims to empower the classifier to recognize target-styled source features and progressively adapt to the target domain. To enhance the reliability of predictions within the PTSFA framework and encourage discriminative feature extraction, we further introduce a new intermediate domain approaching (IDA) strategy. We validate our method on the benchmark datasets, where our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/xiaoyao3302/PTSFA",

    "title": "LFSRDiff: Light Field Image Super-Resolution via Diffusion Models",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Light field (LF) image super-resolution (SR) is a challenging problem due to its inherent ill-posed nature, where a single low-resolution (LR) input LF image can correspond to multiple potential super-resolved outcomes. Despite this complexity, mainstream LF image SR methods typically adopt a deterministic approach, generating only a single output supervised by pixel-wise loss functions. This tendency often results in blurry and unrealistic results. Although diffusion models can capture the distribution of potential SR results by iteratively predicting Gaussian noise during the denoising process, they are primarily designed for general images and struggle to effectively handle the unique characteristics and information present in LF images. To address these limitations, we introduce LFSRDiff, the first diffusion-based LF image SR model, by incorporating the LF disentanglement mechanism. Our novel contribution includes the introduction of a disentangled U-Net for diffusion models, enabling more effective extraction and fusion of both spatial and angular information within LF images. Through comprehensive experimental evaluations and comparisons with the state-of-the-art LF image SR methods, the proposed approach consistently produces diverse and realistic SR results. It achieves the highest perceptual metric in terms of LPIPS. It also demonstrates the ability to effectively control the trade-off between perception and distortion.

We then train a U-Net model to perform marine snow removal as an image to image translation task. Our experiments show that the U-Net model can effectively remove both synthetic and natural marine snow with high accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art methods such as the Median filter and its adaptive variant. We also demonstrate the robustness of our method by testing it on the MSRB dataset, which contains synthetic artifacts that our model has not seen during training.

In this work, we explore this gap by adapting a pre-trained language model for auto-regressive text-to-image generation, and find that pre-trained language models offer limited help. We provide a two-fold explanation by analyzing tokens from each modality. First, we demonstrate that image tokens possess significantly different semantics compared to text tokens, rendering pre-trained language models no more effective in modeling them than randomly initialized ones. Second, the text tokens in the image-text datasets are too simple compared to normal language model pre-training data, which causes the catastrophic degradation of language models' capability",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Visible-infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID) aims to match persons captured by visible and infrared cameras, allowing person retrieval and tracking in 24-hour surveillance systems. Previous methods focus on learning from cross-modality person images in different cameras. However, temporal information and single-camera samples tend to be neglected. To crack this nut, in this paper, we first contribute a large-scale VI-ReID dataset named BUPTCampus. Different from most existing VI-ReID datasets, it 1) collects tracklets instead of images to introduce rich temporal information, 2) contains pixel-aligned cross-modality sample pairs for better modality-invariant learning, 3) provides one auxiliary set to help enhance the optimization, in which each identity only appears in a single camera. Based on our constructed dataset, we present a two-stream framework as baseline and apply Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to narrow the gap between the two modalities. To exploit the advantages introduced by the auxiliary set, we propose a curriculum learning based strategy to jointly learn from both primary and auxiliary sets. Moreover, we design a novel temporal k-reciprocal re-ranking method to refine the ranking list with fine-grained temporal correlation cues. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. We also reproduce 9 state-of-the-art image-based and video-based VI-ReID methods on BUPTCampus and our methods show substantial superiority to them.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Conventional Federated Domain Adaptation (FDA) approaches usually demand an abundance of assumptions, such as label set consistency, which makes them significantly less feasible for real-world situations and introduces security hazards. In this work, we propose a more practical scenario named Universal Federated Domain Adaptation (UFDA). It only requires the black-box model and the label set information of each source domain, while the label sets of different source domains could be inconsistent and the target-domain label set is totally blind. This relaxes the assumptions made by FDA, which are often challenging to meet in real-world cases and diminish model security. To address the UFDA scenario, we propose a corresponding framework called Hot-Learning with Contrastive Label Disambiguation (HCLD), which tackles UFDA's domain shifts and category gaps problem by using one-hot outputs from the black-box models of various source domains. Moreover, to better distinguish the shared and unknown classes, we further present a cluster-level strategy named Mutual-Voting Decision (MVD) to extract robust consensus knowledge across peer classes from both source and target domains. The extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that our HCLD achieves comparable performance for our UFDA scenario with much fewer assumptions, compared to the previous methodologies with many additional assumptions",

In this paper, we empirically analyze how VLMs behave when using vision and text prompts, adapters, and a combination of these components, marking a novel exploration by our study. Our observations find that utilizing vision prompts for class separability and text adapters for task adaptation is crucial for adaptability and generalizability. Moreover, to improve generalization across every domain, we propose an adaptive ensemble method that effectively combines the general knowledge of VLMs with task-specific knowledge according to transfer difficulty.

    "abstract": "Recent breakthroughs in text-to-image generation has shown encouraging results via large generative models. Due to the scarcity of 3D assets, it is hardly to transfer the success of text-to-image generation to that of text-to-3D generation. Existing text-to-3D generation methods usually adopt the paradigm of DreamFusion, which conducts per-asset optimization by distilling a pretrained text-to-image diffusion model. The generation speed usually ranges from several minutes to tens of minutes per 3D asset, which degrades the user experience and also imposes a burden to the service providers due to the high computational budget. In this work, we present an efficient text-to-3D generation method, which requires only around 8 $ms$ to generate a 3D asset given the text prompt on a consumer graphic card. The main insight is that we exploit the images generated by a large pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model, to supervise the training of a text conditioned 3D generative adversarial network. Once the network is trained, we are able to efficiently generate a 3D asset via a single forward pass.

However, the development of AIGC image generative models also brings new problems and challenges. A significant challenge is that AI-generated images (AIGI) compared to natural images may have some unique distortions, and not all generated images meet the requirements of the real world, so it is of great significance to evaluate AI-generated images more comprehensively. Although previous work has established some human perception-based AIGC image quality assessment databases for text-generated images, the AI image generation technology includes scenarios like text-to-image and image-to-image, and assessing only the images generated by text-to-image models is insufficient. To address this issue, we have established a human perception-based image-to-image AIGC image quality assessment database, named PKU-I2IQA.

It tries to distill a large dataset into a small and condensed one so that models trained on the distilled dataset can perform comparably with those trained on the full dataset when performing downstream tasks. Among the previous works in this area, there are three key problems that hinder the performance and availability of the existing DD methods: high time complexity, high space complexity, and low info-compactness. In this work, we simultaneously attempt to settle these three problems by moving the DD processes from conventionally used pixel space to latent space. Encoded by a pretrained generic autoencoder, latent codes in the latent space are naturally info-compact representations of the original images in much smaller sizes. After transferring three mainstream DD algorithms to latent space, we significantly reduce time and space consumption while achieving similar performance, allowing us to distill high-resolution datasets or target at greater data ratio that previous methods have failed. Besides, within the same storage budget, we can also quantitatively deliver more latent codes than pixel-level images, which further boosts the performance of our methods",

    "abstract": "In the field of computer graphics, the use of vector graphics, particularly Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), represents a notable development from traditional pixel-based imagery. SVGs, with their XML-based format, are distinct in their ability to directly and explicitly represent visual elements such as shape, color, and path. This direct representation facilitates a more accurate and logical depiction of graphical elements, enhancing reasoning and interpretability. Recognizing the potential of SVGs, the machine learning community has introduced multiple methods for image vectorization. However, transforming images into SVG format while retaining the relational properties and context of the original scene remains a key challenge. Most vectorization methods often yield SVGs that are overly complex and not easily interpretable. In response to this challenge, we introduce our method, Simple-SVG-Generation (S\\textsuperscript{2}VG\\textsuperscript{2}). Our method focuses on producing SVGs that are both accurate and simple, aligning with human readability and understanding. With simple images, we evaluate our method with reasoning tasks together with advanced language models, the results show a clear improvement over previous SVG generation methods. We also conducted surveys for human evaluation on the readability of our generated SVGs, the results also favor our methods",

Furthermore, it serves as a feature preprocessing module that can be connected to any model front-end to enhance the lesion features in input images. Moreover, we propose a novel adaptive disease detection model named EAFP-Med ST, which utilizes the Swin Transformer V2 - Tiny (SwinV2-T) as its backbone and connects it to EAFP-Med. We have compared our method to nine state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results demonstrate that EAFP-Med ST achieves the best performance on all three datasets (chest X-ray images, cranial magnetic resonance imaging images, and skin images). EAFP-Med can efficiently extract lesion features from various medical images based on prompts, enhancing the model's performance. This holds significant potential for improving medical image analysis and diagnosis",

    "abstract": "Whole slide images are the foundation of digital pathology for the diagnosis and treatment of carcinomas. Writing pathology reports is laborious and error-prone for inexperienced pathologists. To reduce the workload and improve clinical automation, we investigate how to generate pathology reports given whole slide images. On the data end, we curated the largest WSI-text dataset (TCGA-PathoText). In specific, we collected nearly 10000 high-quality WSI-text pairs for visual-language models by recognizing and cleaning pathology reports which narrate diagnostic slides in TCGA. On the model end, we propose the multiple instance generative model (MI-Gen) which can produce pathology reports for gigapixel WSIs. We benchmark our model on the largest subset of TCGA-PathoText. Experimental results show our model can generate pathology reports which contain multiple clinical clues. Furthermore, WSI-text prediction can be seen as an approach of visual-language pre-training, which enables our model to be transferred to downstream diagnostic tasks like carcinoma grading and phenotyping. We observe that simple semantic extraction from the pathology reports can achieve the best performance (0.838 of F1 score) on BRCA subtyping without adding extra parameters or tricky fine-tuning. Our collected dataset and related code will all be publicly available",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation strives to distinguish pixels into different semantic groups from an open set of categories. Most existing methods explore utilizing pre-trained vision-language models, in which the key is to adopt the image-level model for pixel-level segmentation task. In this paper, we propose a simple encoder-decoder, named SED, for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, which comprises a hierarchical encoder-based cost map generation and a gradual fusion decoder with category early rejection. The hierarchical encoder-based cost map generation employs hierarchical backbone, instead of plain transformer, to predict pixel-level image-text cost map. Compared to plain transformer, hierarchical backbone better captures local spatial information and has linear computational complexity with respect to input size. Our gradual fusion decoder employs a top-down structure to combine cost map and the feature maps of different backbone levels for segmentation. To accelerate inference speed, we introduce a category early rejection scheme in the decoder that rejects many no-existing categories at the early layer of decoder, resulting in at most 4.7 times acceleration without accuracy degradation. Experiments are performed on multiple open-vocabulary semantic segmentation datasets, which demonstrates the efficacy of our SED method. When using ConvNeXt-B, our SED method achieves mIoU score of 31.6\\% on ADE20K with 150 categories at 82 millisecond ($ms$) per image on a single A6000.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Background and Objective: The lack of benchmark datasets has impeded the development of slice-to-volume registration algorithms. Such datasets are difficult to annotate, primarily due to the dimensional difference within data and the dearth of task-specific software. We aim to develop a user-friendly tool to streamline dataset annotation for slice-to-volume registration. Methods: The proposed tool, named SVRDA, is an installation-free web application for platform-agnostic collaborative dataset annotation. It enables efficient transformation manipulation via keyboard shortcuts and smooth case transitions with auto-saving. SVRDA supports configuration-based data loading and adheres to the separation of concerns, offering great flexibility and extensibility for future research. Various supplementary features have been implemented to facilitate slice-to-volume registration. Results: We validated the effectiveness of SVRDA by indirectly evaluating the post-registration segmentation quality on UK Biobank data, observing a dramatic overall improvement (24.02% in the Dice Similarity Coefficient and 48.93% in the 95th percentile Hausdorff distance, respectively) supported by highly statistically significant evidence ($p<0.001$).We further showcased the clinical usage of SVRDA by integrating it into test-retest T1 quantification on in-house magnetic resonance images, leading to more consistent results after registration. Conclusions: SVRDA can facilitate collaborative annotation of benchmark datasets while being potentially applicable to other pipelines incorporating slice-to-volume registration.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Dataset distillation reduces the storage and computational consumption of training a network by generating a small surrogate dataset that encapsulates rich information of the original large-scale one. However, previous distillation methods heavily rely on the sample-wise iterative optimization scheme. As the images-per-class (IPC) setting or image resolution grows larger, the necessary computation will demand overwhelming time and resources. In this work, we intend to incorporate generative diffusion techniques for computing the surrogate dataset. Observing that key factors for constructing an effective surrogate dataset are representativeness and diversity, we design additional minimax criteria in the generative training to enhance these facets for the generated images of diffusion models. We present a theoretical model of the process as hierarchical diffusion control demonstrating the flexibility of the diffusion process to target these criteria without jeopardizing the faithfulness of the sample to the desired distribution. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art validation performance while demanding much less computational resources. Under the 100-IPC setting on ImageWoof, our method requires less than one-twentieth the distillation time of previous methods, yet yields even better performance.

    "title": "Fine-grained Appearance Transfer with Diffusion Models",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Image-to-image translation (I2I), and particularly its subfield of appearance transfer, which seeks to alter the visual appearance between images while maintaining structural coherence, presents formidable challenges. Despite significant advancements brought by diffusion models, achieving fine-grained transfer remains complex, particularly in terms of retaining detailed structural elements and ensuring information fidelity. This paper proposes an innovative framework designed to surmount these challenges by integrating various aspects of semantic matching, appearance transfer, and latent deviation. A pivotal aspect of our approach is the strategic use of the predicted $x_0$ space by diffusion models within the latent space of diffusion processes. This is identified as a crucial element for the precise and natural transfer of fine-grained details. Our framework exploits this space to accomplish semantic alignment between source and target images, facilitating mask-wise appearance transfer for improved feature acquisition. A significant advancement of our method is the seamless integration of these features into the latent space, enabling more nuanced latent deviations without necessitating extensive model retraining or fine-tuning. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through extensive experiments, which showcase its ability to adeptly handle fine-grained appearance transfers across a wide range of categories and domains.

Recent work utilizes pedestrian character information, \\textit{i.e.}, action and appearance, to improve the learned trajectory embedding and achieves state-of-the-art performance. However, it neglects the invalid and negative pedestrian character information, which is harmful to trajectory representation and thus leads to performance degradation. To address this issue, we present a two-stream sparse-character-based network~(TSNet) for pedestrian trajectory prediction. Specifically, TSNet learns the negative-removed characters in the sparse character representation stream to improve the trajectory embedding obtained in the trajectory representation stream. Moreover, to model the negative-removed characters, we propose a novel sparse character graph, including the sparse category and sparse temporal character graphs, to learn the different effects of various characters in category and temporal dimensions, respectively. Extensive experiments on two first-person view datasets, PIE and JAAD, show that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. In addition, ablation studies demonstrate different effects of various characters and prove that TSNet outperforms approaches without eliminating negative characters",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Continual learning (CL) aims to acquire new knowledge while preserving information from previous experiences without forgetting. Though buffer-based methods (i.e., retaining samples from previous tasks) have achieved acceptable performance, determining how to allocate the buffer remains a critical challenge. Most recent research focuses on refining these methods but often fails to sufficiently consider the varying influence of samples on the learning process, and frequently overlooks the complexity of the classes/concepts being learned. Generally, these methods do not directly take into account the contribution of individual classes. However, our investigation indicates that more challenging classes necessitate preserving a larger number of samples compared to less challenging ones. To address this issue, we propose a novel method and policy named 'Class-Adaptive Sampling Policy' (CASP), which dynamically allocates storage space within the buffer. By utilizing concepts of class contribution and difficulty, CASP adaptively manages buffer space, allowing certain classes to occupy a larger portion of the buffer while reducing storage for others. This approach significantly improves the efficiency of knowledge retention and utilization. CASP provides a versatile solution to boost the performance and efficiency of CL. It meets the demand for dynamic buffer allocation, accommodating the varying contributions of different classes and their learning complexities over time",

We leverage the pretrained text-to-2D image stable diffusion model as prior knowledge of the 3D world. The model is finetuned in two steps to optimize for the text embedding and the UNet that reconstruct the input image and its inverse perspective mapping respectively. The inverse perspective mapping creates variance within the text-image space of the diffusion model, while providing weak guidance for aerial view synthesis. At inference, we steer the contents of the generated image towards the input image using novel mutual information guidance that maximizes the information content between the probability distributions of the two images. We evaluate our approach on a wide spectrum of real and synthetic data, including natural scenes, indoor scenes, human action, etc. Through extensive experiments and ablation studies, we demonstrate the effectiveness of AerialBooth and also its generalizability to other text-controlled views.

Despite their capabilities, these models face limitations in creating new, detailed creatures within specific categories (e.g., virtual dog or bird species), which are valuable in digital asset creation and biodiversity analysis. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel task, Virtual Creatures Generation: Given a set of unlabeled images of the target concepts (e.g., 200 bird species), we aim to train a T2I model capable of creating new, hybrid concepts within diverse backgrounds and contexts. We propose a new method called DreamCreature, which identifies and extracts the underlying sub-concepts (e.g., body parts of a specific species) in an unsupervised manner. The T2I thus adapts to generate novel concepts (e.g., new bird species) with faithful structures and photorealistic appearance by seamlessly and flexibly composing learned sub-concepts. To enhance sub-concept fidelity and disentanglement, we extend the textual inversion technique by incorporating an additional projector and tailored attention loss regularization. Extensive experiments on two fine-grained image benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of DreamCreature over prior methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluation.

We first learn a vocabulary of latent quantized embeddings, using graph convolutions, which inform these embeddings of the local mesh geometry and topology. These embeddings are sequenced and decoded into triangles by a decoder, ensuring that they can effectively reconstruct the mesh. A transformer is then trained on this learned vocabulary to predict the index of the next embedding given previous embeddings. Once trained, our model can be autoregressively sampled to generate new triangle meshes, directly generating compact meshes with sharp edges, more closely imitating the efficient triangulation patterns of human-crafted meshes. MeshGPT demonstrates a notable improvement over state of the art mesh generation methods, with a 9% increase in shape coverage and a 30-point enhancement in FID scores across various categories",

This work for the first time attempts to utilize the foundation model as an instructive teacher for initialization in FL, assessing its impact on the performance of FL models, especially in non-IID data scenarios.

Diffusion models learn to modify inputs $x$ to increase the probability of it belonging to a desired distribution, i.e., they model the score function $\\nabla_x \\log p(x)$. Such a score function is potentially relevant for UAD, since $\\nabla_x \\log p(x)$ is itself a pixel-wise anomaly score. However, diffusion models are trained to invert a corruption process based on Gaussian noise and the learned score function is unlikely to generalize to medical anomalies. This work addresses the problem of how to learn a score function relevant for UAD and proposes DISYRE: Diffusion-Inspired SYnthetic REstoration. We retain the diffusion-like pipeline but replace the Gaussian noise corruption with a gradual, synthetic anomaly corruption so the learned score function generalizes to medical, naturally occurring anomalies.

While diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have been shown to achieve remarkable performance for face image restoration, they often fail to preserve temporally coherent, high-quality videos, compromising the fidelity of reconstructed faces. We present a new conditional diffusion framework called FLAIR for FVR. FLAIR ensures temporal consistency across frames in a computationally efficient fashion by converting a traditional image DPM into a video DPM. The proposed conversion uses a recurrent video refinement layer and a temporal self-attention at different scales. FLAIR also uses a conditional iterative refinement process to balance the perceptual and distortion quality during inference. This process consists of two key components: a data-consistency module that analytically ensures that the generated video precisely matches its degraded observation and a coarse-to-fine image enhancement module specifically for facial regions.

    "abstract": "Grid-based structures are commonly used to encode explicit features for graphics primitives such as images, signed distance functions (SDF), and neural radiance fields (NeRF) due to their simple implementation. However, in $n$-dimensional space, calculating the value of a sampled point requires interpolating the values of its $2^n$ neighboring vertices. The exponential scaling with dimension leads to significant computational overheads. To address this issue, we propose a simplex-based approach for encoding graphics primitives. The number of vertices in a simplex-based structure increases linearly with dimension, making it a more efficient and generalizable alternative to grid-based representations. Using the non-axis-aligned simplicial structure property, we derive and prove a coordinate transformation, simplicial subdivision, and barycentric interpolation scheme for efficient sampling, which resembles transformation procedures in the simplex noise algorithm. Finally, we use hash tables to store multiresolution features of all interest points in the simplicial grid, which are passed into a tiny fully connected neural network to parameterize graphics primitives. We implemented a detailed simplex-based structure encoding algorithm in C++ and CUDA using the methods outlined in our approach. In the 2D image fitting task, the proposed method is capable of fitting a giga-pixel image with 9.4% less time compared to the baseline method proposed by instant-ngp, while maintaining the same quality and compression rate.

In contrast to previous work, functional diffusion works on samples that are represented by functions with a continuous domain. Functional diffusion can be seen as an extension of classical diffusion models to an infinite-dimensional domain. Functional diffusion is very versatile as images, videos, audio, 3D shapes, deformations, \\etc, can be handled by the same framework with minimal changes. In addition, functional diffusion is especially suited for irregular data or data defined in non-standard domains. In our work, we derive the necessary foundations for functional diffusion and propose a first implementation based on the transformer architecture.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Even though the use of power electronics PE loads offers enhanced electrical energy conversion efficiency and control, they remain the primary sources of harmonics in grids. When diverse loads are connected in the distribution system, their interactions complicate establishing analytical models for the relationship between harmonic voltages and currents. To solve this, our paper presents a data-driven model using MCReSANet to construct the highly nonlinear between harmonic voltage and current. Two datasets from PCCs in Finland and Germany are utilized, which demonstrates that MCReSANet is capable of establishing accurate nonlinear mappings, even in the presence of various network characteristics for selected Finland and Germany datasets. The model built by MCReSANet can improve the MAE by 10% and 14% compared to the CNN, and by 8% and 17% compared to the MLP for both Finnish and German datasets, also showing much lower model uncertainty than others. This is a crucial prerequisite for more precise SHAP value-based feature importance analysis, which is a method for the model interpretability analysis in this paper. The results by feature importance analysis show the detailed relationships between each order of harmonic voltage and current in the distribution system. There is an interactive impact on each order of harmonic current, but some orders of harmonic voltages have a dominant influence on harmonic current emissions: positive sequence and zero sequence harmonics have the dominant importance in the Finnish and German networks, respectively, which conforms to the pattern of connected load types in two selected Finnish and German datasets. This paper enhances the potential for understanding and predicting harmonic current emissions by diverse PE loads in distribution systems, which is beneficial to more effective management for optimizing power quality in diverse grid environments",

    "abstract": "Drawing inspiration from prompt tuning techniques applied to Large Language Models, recent methods based on pre-trained ViT networks have achieved remarkable results in the field of Continual Learning. Specifically, these approaches propose to maintain a set of prompts and allocate a subset of them to learn each task using a key-query matching strategy. However, they may encounter limitations when lacking control over the correlations between old task queries and keys of future tasks, the shift of features in the latent space, and the relative separation of latent vectors learned in independent tasks. In this work, we introduce a novel key-query learning strategy based on orthogonal projection, inspired by model-agnostic meta-learning, to enhance prompt matching efficiency and address the challenge of shifting features. Furthermore, we introduce a One-Versus-All (OVA) prototype-based component that enhances the classification head distinction.

While they perform well even in the absence of the true underlying class labels, constrained clustering models still require large amounts of binary constraint annotations for training. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised context whereby a large amount of \\textit{unconstrained} data is available alongside a smaller set of constraints, and propose \\textit{ConstraintMatch} to leverage such unconstrained data. While a great deal of progress has been made in semi-supervised learning using full labels, there are a number of challenges that prevent a naive application of the resulting methods in the constraint-based label setting. Therefore, we reason about and analyze these challenges, specifically 1) proposing a \\textit{pseudo-constraining} mechanism to overcome the confirmation bias, a major weakness of pseudo-labeling, 2) developing new methods for pseudo-labeling towards the selection of \\textit{informative} unconstrained samples, 3) showing that this also allows the use of pairwise loss functions for the initial and auxiliary losses which facilitates semi-constrained model training. In extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of ConstraintMatch over relevant baselines in both the regular clustering and overclustering scenarios on five challenging benchmarks and provide analyses of its several components",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In weakly supervised video anomaly detection (WVAD), where only video-level labels indicating the presence or absence of abnormal events are available, the primary challenge arises from the inherent ambiguity in temporal annotations of abnormal occurrences. Inspired by the statistical insight that temporal features of abnormal events often exhibit outlier characteristics, we propose a novel method, BN-WVAD, which incorporates BatchNorm into WVAD. In the proposed BN-WVAD, we leverage the Divergence of Feature from Mean vector (DFM) of BatchNorm as a reliable abnormality criterion to discern potential abnormal snippets in abnormal videos. The proposed DFM criterion is also discriminative for anomaly recognition and more resilient to label noise, serving as the additional anomaly score to amend the prediction of the anomaly classifier that is susceptible to noisy labels. Moreover, a batch-level selection strategy is devised to filter more abnormal snippets in videos where more abnormal events occur. The proposed BN-WVAD model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on UCF-Crime with an AUC of 87.24%, and XD-Violence, where AP reaches up to 84.93%.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Hand gestures play a significant role in human interactions where non-verbal intentions, thoughts and commands are conveyed. In Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), hand gestures offer a similar and efficient medium for conveying clear and rapid directives to a robotic agent. However, state-of-the-art vision-based methods for gesture recognition have been shown to be effective only up to a user-camera distance of seven meters. Such a short distance range limits practical HRI with, for example, service robots, search and rescue robots and drones. In this work, we address the Ultra-Range Gesture Recognition (URGR) problem by aiming for a recognition distance of up to 25 meters and in the context of HRI. We propose a novel deep-learning framework for URGR using solely a simple RGB camera. First, a novel super-resolution model termed HQ-Net is used to enhance the low-resolution image of the user. Then, we propose a novel URGR classifier termed Graph Vision Transformer (GViT) which takes the enhanced image as input. GViT combines the benefits of a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and a modified Vision Transformer (ViT). Evaluation of the proposed framework over diverse test data yields a high recognition rate of 98.1%. The framework has also exhibited superior performance compared to human recognition in ultra-range distances. With the framework, we analyze and demonstrate the performance of an autonomous quadruped robot directed by human gestures in complex ultra-range indoor and outdoor environments",

To address this hypothesis, we propose a certification process mimicking selective attention and test if it could make DL models more robust.

    "abstract": "Adversarial attacks meticulously generate minuscule, imperceptible perturbations to images to deceive neural networks. Counteracting these, adversarial purification methods seek to transform adversarial input samples into clean output images to defend against adversarial attacks. Nonetheless, extent generative models fail to effectively eliminate adversarial perturbations, yielding less-than-ideal purification results. We emphasize the potential threat of residual adversarial perturbations to target models, quantitatively establishing a relationship between perturbation scale and attack capability. Notably, the residual perturbations on the purified image primarily stem from the same-position patch and similar patches of the adversarial sample. We propose a novel adversarial purification approach named Information Mask Purification (IMPure), aims to extensively eliminate adversarial perturbations. To obtain an adversarial sample, we first mask part of the patches information, then reconstruct the patches to resist adversarial perturbations from the patches. We reconstruct all patches in parallel to obtain a cohesive image. Then, in order to protect the purified samples against potential similar regional perturbations, we simulate this risk by randomly mixing the purified samples with the input samples before inputting them into the feature extraction network. Finally, we establish a combined constraint of pixel loss and perceptual loss to augment the model's reconstruction adaptability. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset with three classifier models demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results against nine adversarial attack methods.

Therefore, ViTs are well suited for sequential decision-making, e.g. in the Active Visual Exploration problem.

To reduce this computational inefficiency, we introduce the TOken REcycling (TORE) modification for the ViT inference, which can be used with any architecture. TORE divides ViT into two parts, iterator and aggregator. An iterator processes sequential information separately into midway tokens, which are cached. The aggregator processes midway tokens jointly to obtain the prediction. This way, we can reuse the results of computations made by iterator. Except for efficient sequential inference, we propose a complementary training policy, which significantly reduces the computational burden associated with sequential decision-making while achieving state-of-the-art accuracy",

These are widely assumed to be true and used as evidence for choosing how to solve a problem when Deep Learning is involved. We evaluate six medical datasets and six general datasets. Training a ResNet18 network on varying subsets of these datasets to evaluate `more data gives better results'. We take eleven of these datasets as the sources for Transfer Learning on subsets of the twelfth dataset -- Chest -- in order to determine whether Transfer Learning is universally beneficial. We go further to see whether multi-stage Transfer Learning provides a consistent benefit. Our analysis shows that the real situation is more complex than these simple adages -- more data could lead to a case of diminishing returns and an incorrect choice of dataset for transfer learning can lead to worse performance, with datasets which we would consider highly similar to the Chest dataset giving worse results than datasets which are more dissimilar.

Nonetheless, the efficacy of CXRs is somewhat impeded, given that approximately 75% of the lung area overlaps with bone, which in turn hampers the detection and diagnosis of diseases. As a remedial measure, bone suppression techniques have been introduced. The current dual-energy subtraction imaging technique in the clinic requires costly equipment and subjects being exposed to high radiation. To circumvent these issues, deep learning-based image generation algorithms have been proposed. However, existing methods fall short in terms of producing high-quality images and capturing texture details, particularly with pulmonary vessels. To address these issues, this paper proposes a new bone suppression framework, termed BS-Diff, that comprises a conditional diffusion model equipped with a U-Net architecture and a simple enhancement module to incorporate an autoencoder. Our proposed network cannot only generate soft tissue images with a high bone suppression rate but also possesses the capability to capture fine image details. Additionally, we compiled the largest dataset since 2010, including data from 120 patients with high-definition, high-resolution paired CXRs and soft tissue images collected by our affiliated hospital. Extensive experiments, comparative analyses, ablation studies, and clinical evaluations indicate that the proposed BS-Diff outperforms several bone-suppression models across multiple metrics",

    "abstract": "Contrastive Vision-Language Pre-training, known as CLIP, has shown promising effectiveness in addressing downstream image recognition tasks. However, recent works revealed that the CLIP model can be implanted with a downstream-oriented backdoor. On downstream tasks, one victim model performs well on clean samples but predicts a specific target class whenever a specific trigger is present. For injecting a backdoor, existing attacks depend on a large amount of additional data to maliciously fine-tune the entire pre-trained CLIP model, which makes them inapplicable to data-limited scenarios. In this work, motivated by the recent success of learnable prompts, we address this problem by injecting a backdoor into the CLIP model in the prompt learning stage. Our method named BadCLIP is built on a novel and effective mechanism in backdoor attacks on CLIP, i.e., influencing both the image and text encoders with the trigger. It consists of a learnable trigger applied to images and a trigger-aware context generator, such that the trigger can change text features via trigger-aware prompts, resulting in a powerful and generalizable attack. Extensive experiments conducted on 11 datasets verify that the clean accuracy of BadCLIP is similar to those of advanced prompt learning methods and the attack success rate is higher than 99% in most cases. BadCLIP is also generalizable to unseen classes, and shows a strong generalization capability under cross-dataset and cross-domain settings",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The detection and localization of highly realistic deepfake audio-visual content are challenging even for the most advanced state-of-the-art methods. While most of the research efforts in this domain are focused on detecting high-quality deepfake images and videos, only a few works address the problem of the localization of small segments of audio-visual manipulations embedded in real videos. In this research, we emulate the process of such content generation and propose the AV-Deepfake1M dataset. The dataset contains content-driven (i) video manipulations, (ii) audio manipulations, and (iii) audio-visual manipulations for more than 2K subjects resulting in a total of more than 1M videos. The paper provides a thorough description of the proposed data generation pipeline accompanied by a rigorous analysis of the quality of the generated data. The comprehensive benchmark of the proposed dataset utilizing state-of-the-art deepfake detection and localization methods indicates a significant drop in performance compared to previous datasets. The proposed dataset will play a vital role in building the next-generation deepfake localization methods.

To address this, we propose a novel optimization-based framework for sketching videos represented by the frame-wise B\\'ezier curve. In detail, we first propose a cross-frame stroke initialization approach to warm up the location and the width of each curve. Then, we optimize the locations of these curves by utilizing a semantic loss based on CLIP features and a newly designed consistency loss using the self-decomposed 2D atlas network. Built upon these design elements, the resulting sketch video showcases impressive visual abstraction and temporal coherence. Furthermore, by transforming a video into SVG lines through the sketching process, our method unlocks applications in sketch-based video editing and video doodling, enabled through video composition, as exemplified in the teaser",

    "title": "Eye Disease Prediction using Ensemble Learning and Attention on OCT Scans",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Eye diseases have posed significant challenges for decades, but advancements in technology have opened new avenues for their detection and treatment. Machine learning and deep learning algorithms have become instrumental in this domain, particularly when combined with Optical Coherent Technology (OCT) imaging. We propose a novel method for efficient detection of eye diseases from OCT images. Our technique enables the classification of patients into disease free (normal eyes) or affected by specific conditions such as Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV), Diabetic Macular Edema (DME), or Drusen. In this work, we introduce an end to end web application that utilizes machine learning and deep learning techniques for efficient eye disease prediction. The application allows patients to submit their raw OCT scanned images, which undergo segmentation using a trained custom UNet model. The segmented images are then fed into an ensemble model, comprising InceptionV3 and Xception networks, enhanced with a self attention layer. This self attention approach leverages the feature maps of individual models to achieve improved classification accuracy. The ensemble model's output is aggregated to predict and classify various eye diseases. Extensive experimentation and optimization have been conducted to ensure the application's efficiency and optimal performance. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in accurate eye disease prediction. The developed web application holds significant potential for early detection and timely intervention, thereby contributing to improved eye healthcare outcomes",

    "abstract": "Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in novel view synthesis within 3D environments. However, extracting a radiance field of one specific object from multi-view images encounters substantial challenges due to occlusion and background complexity, thereby presenting difficulties in downstream applications such as NeRF editing and 3D mesh extraction. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose Obj-NeRF, a comprehensive pipeline that recovers the 3D geometry of a specific object from multi-view images using a single prompt. This method combines the 2D segmentation capabilities of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) in conjunction with the 3D reconstruction ability of NeRF. Specifically, we first obtain multi-view segmentation for the indicated object using SAM with a single prompt. Then, we use the segmentation images to supervise NeRF construction, integrating several effective techniques. Additionally, we construct a large object-level NeRF dataset containing diverse objects, which can be useful in various downstream tasks. To demonstrate the practicality of our method, we also apply Obj-NeRF to various applications, including object removal, rotation, replacement, and recoloring",

    "abstract": "Artificial neural networks encounter a notable challenge known as continual learning, which involves acquiring knowledge of multiple tasks over an extended period. This challenge arises due to the tendency of previously learned weights to be adjusted to suit the objectives of new tasks, resulting in a phenomenon called catastrophic forgetting. Most approaches to this problem seek a balance between maximizing performance on the new tasks and minimizing the forgetting of previous tasks. In contrast, our approach attempts to maximize the performance of the new task, while ensuring zero forgetting. This is accomplished by creating a task-specific modulation parameters for each task. Only these would be learnable parameters during learning of consecutive tasks. Through comprehensive experimental evaluations, our model demonstrates superior performance in acquiring and retaining novel tasks that pose difficulties for other multi-task models. This emphasizes the efficacy of our approach in preventing catastrophic forgetting while accommodating the acquisition of new tasks",

    "abstract": "The use of artificial intelligence technology in education is growing rapidly, with increasing attention being paid to handwritten mathematical expression recognition (HMER) by researchers. However, many existing methods for HMER may fail to accurately read formulas with complex structures, as the attention results can be inaccurate due to illegible handwriting or large variations in writing styles. Our proposed Intelligent-Detection Network (IDN) for HMER differs from traditional encoder-decoder methods by utilizing object detection techniques. Specifically, we have developed an enhanced YOLOv7 network that can accurately detect both digital and symbolic objects. The detection results are then integrated into the bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU) and the baseline symbol relationship tree (BSRT) to determine the relationships between symbols and numbers. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms those encoder-decoder networks in recognizing complex handwritten mathematical expressions. This is due to the precise detection of symbols and numbers. Our research has the potential to make valuable contributions to the field of HMER.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Unlike color photography images, which are consistently encoded into RGB channels, biological images encompass various modalities, where the type of microscopy and the meaning of each channel varies with each experiment. Importantly, the number of channels can range from one to a dozen and their correlation is often comparatively much lower than RGB, as each of them brings specific information content. This aspect is largely overlooked by methods designed out of the bioimage field, and current solutions mostly focus on intra-channel spatial attention, often ignoring the relationship between channels, yet crucial in most biological applications. Importantly, the variable channel type and count prevent the projection of several experiments to a unified representation for large scale pre-training. In this study, we propose ChAda-ViT, a novel Channel Adaptive Vision Transformer architecture employing an Inter-Channel Attention mechanism on images with an arbitrary number, order and type of channels. We also introduce IDRCell100k, a bioimage dataset with a rich set of 79 experiments covering 7 microscope modalities, with a multitude of channel types, and channel counts varying from 1 to 10 per experiment. Our proposed architecture, trained in a self-supervised manner, outperforms existing approaches in several biologically relevant downstream tasks. Additionally, it can be used to bridge the gap for the first time between assays with different microscopes, channel numbers or types by embedding various image and experimental modalities into a unified biological image representation. The latter should facilitate interdisciplinary studies and pave the way for better adoption of deep learning in biological image-based analyses. Code and Data to be released soon",

In this paper, we propose NeuRAD, a robust novel view synthesis method tailored to dynamic AD data. Our method features simple network design, extensive sensor modeling for both camera and lidar -- including rolling shutter, beam divergence and ray dropping -- and is applicable to multiple datasets out of the box. We verify its performance on five popular AD datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance across the board. To encourage further development, we openly release the NeuRAD source code.

    "abstract": "Human-object interaction (HOI) detection aims at detecting human-object pairs and predicting their interactions. However, the complexity of human behavior and the diverse contexts in which these interactions occur make it challenging. Intuitively, human-centric visual cues, such as the involved participants, the body language, and the surrounding environment, play crucial roles in shaping these interactions. These cues are particularly vital in interpreting unseen interactions. In this paper, we propose three prompts with VLM to generate human-centric visual cues within an image from multiple perspectives of humans. To capitalize on these rich Human-Centric Visual Cues, we propose a novel approach named HCVC for HOI detection. Particularly, we develop a transformer-based multimodal fusion module with multitower architecture to integrate visual cue features into the instance and interaction decoders. Our extensive experiments and analysis validate the efficacy of leveraging the generated human-centric visual cues for HOI detection.

    "abstract": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods often exploit auxiliary outliers to train model identifying OOD samples, especially discovering challenging outliers from auxiliary outliers dataset to improve OOD detection. However, they may still face limitations in effectively distinguishing between the most challenging OOD samples that are much like in-distribution (ID) data, i.e., ID-like samples. To this end, we propose a novel OOD detection framework that discovers ID-like outliers using CLIP from the vicinity space of the ID samples, thus helping to identify these most challenging OOD samples. Then a prompt learning framework is proposed that utilizes the identified ID-like outliers to further leverage the capabilities of CLIP for OOD detection. Benefiting from the powerful CLIP, we only need a small number of ID samples to learn the prompts of the model without exposing other auxiliary outlier datasets. By focusing on the most challenging ID-like OOD samples and elegantly exploiting the capabilities of CLIP, our method achieves superior few-shot learning performance on various real-world image datasets (e.g., in 4-shot OOD detection on the ImageNet-1k dataset, our method reduces the average FPR95 by 12.16% and improves the average AUROC by 2.76%, compared to state-of-the-art methods)",

    "abstract": "The fusion of LiDARs and cameras has been increasingly adopted in autonomous driving for perception tasks. The performance of such fusion-based algorithms largely depends on the accuracy of sensor calibration, which is challenging due to the difficulty of identifying common features across different data modalities. Previously, many calibration methods involved specific targets and/or manual intervention, which has proven to be cumbersome and costly. Learning-based online calibration methods have been proposed, but their performance is barely satisfactory in most cases. These methods usually suffer from issues such as sparse feature maps, unreliable cross-modality association, inaccurate calibration parameter regression, etc. In this paper, to address these issues, we propose CalibFormer, an end-to-end network for automatic LiDAR-camera calibration. We aggregate multiple layers of camera and LiDAR image features to achieve high-resolution representations. A multi-head correlation module is utilized to identify correlations between features more accurately. Lastly, we employ transformer architectures to estimate accurate calibration parameters from the correlation information.

Specifically, through exploring the effect of distillation weight on the process of distillation, we are inspired to adopt the double reverse thought to implement an effective regularization network by combining offline and online distillation in a complementary way. Then, the Adaptive Weight Assignment (AWA) module is designed to adaptively assign two reverse-changing weights based on the network performance, allowing the student network to better benefit from both teachers.

Previous methods have relied on domain-specific heuristics such as warping-based motion representation and 3D Morphable Models, which limit the naturalness and diversity of the generated avatars. In this work, we introduce GAIA (Generative AI for Avatar), which eliminates the domain priors in talking avatar generation. In light of the observation that the speech only drives the motion of the avatar while the appearance of the avatar and the background typically remain the same throughout the entire video, we divide our approach into two stages: 1) disentangling each frame into motion and appearance representations; 2) generating motion sequences conditioned on the speech and reference portrait image. We collect a large-scale high-quality talking avatar dataset and train the model on it with different scales (up to 2B parameters). Experimental results verify the superiority, scalability, and flexibility of GAIA as 1) the resulting model beats previous baseline models in terms of naturalness, diversity, lip-sync quality, and visual quality; 2) the framework is scalable since larger models yield better results; 3) it is general and enables different applications like controllable talking avatar generation and text-instructed avatar generation",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "This paper presents one-bit supervision, a novel setting of learning with fewer labels, for image classification. Instead of training model using the accurate label of each sample, our setting requires the model to interact with the system by predicting the class label of each sample and learn from the answer whether the guess is correct, which provides one bit (yes or no) of information. An intriguing property of the setting is that the burden of annotation largely alleviates in comparison to offering the accurate label. There are two keys to one-bit supervision, which are (i) improving the guess accuracy and (ii) making good use of the incorrect guesses. To achieve these goals, we propose a multi-stage training paradigm and incorporate negative label suppression into an off-the-shelf semi-supervised learning algorithm. Theoretical analysis shows that one-bit annotation is more efficient than full-bit annotation in most cases and gives the conditions of combining our approach with active learning. Inspired by this, we further integrate the one-bit supervision framework into the self-supervised learning algorithm which yields an even more efficient training schedule. Different from training from scratch, when self-supervised learning is used for initialization, both hard example mining and class balance are verified effective in boosting the learning performance. However, these two frameworks still need full-bit labels in the initial stage. To cast off this burden, we utilize unsupervised domain adaptation to train the initial model and conduct pure one-bit annotations on the target dataset. In multiple benchmarks, the learning efficiency of the proposed approach surpasses that using full-bit, semi-supervised supervision",

    "title": "Leveraging Anatomical Constraints with Uncertainty for Pneumothorax Segmentation",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Pneumothorax is a medical emergency caused by abnormal accumulation of air in the pleural space - the potential space between the lungs and chest wall. On 2D chest radiographs, pneumothorax occurs within the thoracic cavity and outside of the mediastinum and we refer to this area as \"lung+ space\". While deep learning (DL) has increasingly been utilized to segment pneumothorax lesions in chest radiographs, many existing DL models employ an end-to-end approach. These models directly map chest radiographs to clinician-annotated lesion areas, often neglecting the vital domain knowledge that pneumothorax is inherently location-sensitive. We propose a novel approach that incorporates the lung+ space as a constraint during DL model training for pneumothorax segmentation on 2D chest radiographs. To circumvent the need for additional annotations and to prevent potential label leakage on the target task, our method utilizes external datasets and an auxiliary task of lung segmentation. This approach generates a specific constraint of lung+ space for each chest radiograph. Furthermore, we have incorporated a discriminator to eliminate unreliable constraints caused by the domain shift between the auxiliary and target datasets. Our results demonstrated significant improvements, with average performance gains of 4.6%, 3.6%, and 3.3% regarding Intersection over Union (IoU), Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), and Hausdorff Distance (HD).

The current machine vision model requires a large volume of data to achieve high performance. However, there are approximately 5.5 million different insect species in the world. None of the existing insect datasets can cover even a fraction of them due to varying geographic locations and acquisition costs.

Covering a vast spectrum of insect species, our dataset, including 1 million images with dense identification labels of taxonomy hierarchy and insect descriptions, offers a panoramic view of entomology, enabling foundation models to comprehend visual and semantic information about insects like never before. Then, to efficiently establish an Insect Foundation Model, we develop a micro-feature self-supervised learning method with a Patch-wise Relevant Attention mechanism capable of discerning the subtle differences among insect images. In addition, we introduce Description Consistency loss to improve micro-feature modeling via insect descriptions. Through our experiments, we illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in insect modeling and achieve State-of-the-Art performance on standard benchmarks of insect-related tasks.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Most existing synthetic aperture radar (SAR) ship classification technologies heavily rely on correctly labeled data, ignoring the discriminative features of unlabeled SAR ship images. Even though researchers try to enrich CNN-based features by introducing traditional handcrafted features, existing methods easily cause information redundancy and fail to capture the interaction between them. To address these issues, we propose a novel dual-stream contrastive predictive network (DCPNet), which consists of two asymmetric task designs and the false negative sample elimination module. The first task is to construct positive sample pairs, guiding the core encoder to learn more general representations. The second task is to encourage adaptive capture of the correspondence between deep features and handcrated features, achieving knowledge transfer within the model, and effectively improving the redundancy caused by the feature fusion. To increase the separability between clusters, we also design a cluster-level tasks. The experimental results on OpenSARShip and FUSAR-Ship datasets demonstrate the improvement in classification accuracy of supervised models and confirm the capability of learning effective representations of DCPNet",

    "title": "SpliceMix: A Cross-scale and Semantic Blending Augmentation Strategy for Multi-label Image Classification",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Recently, Mix-style data augmentation methods (e.g., Mixup and CutMix) have shown promising performance in various visual tasks. However, these methods are primarily designed for single-label images, ignoring the considerable discrepancies between single- and multi-label images, i.e., a multi-label image involves multiple co-occurred categories and fickle object scales. On the other hand, previous multi-label image classification (MLIC) methods tend to design elaborate models, bringing expensive computation. In this paper, we introduce a simple but effective augmentation strategy for multi-label image classification, namely SpliceMix. The \"splice\" in our method is two-fold: 1) Each mixed image is a splice of several downsampled images in the form of a grid, where the semantics of images attending to mixing are blended without object deficiencies for alleviating co-occurred bias; 2) We splice mixed images and the original mini-batch to form a new SpliceMixed mini-batch, which allows an image with different scales to contribute to training together. Furthermore, such splice in our SpliceMixed mini-batch enables interactions between mixed images and original regular images. We also offer a simple and non-parametric extension based on consistency learning (SpliceMix-CL) to show the flexible extensibility of our SpliceMix. Extensive experiments on various tasks demonstrate that only using SpliceMix with a baseline model (e.g., ResNet) achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the generalizability of our SpliceMix is further validated by the improvements in current MLIC methods when married with our SpliceMix.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Predicting the trajectory of pedestrians in crowd scenarios is indispensable in self-driving or autonomous mobile robot field because estimating the future locations of pedestrians around is beneficial for policy decision to avoid collision. It is a challenging issue because humans have different walking motions and the interactions between humans and objects in the current environment, especially between human themselves, are complex. Previous researches have focused on how to model the human-human interactions, however, neglecting the relative importance of interactions. In order to address this issue, we introduce a novel mechanism based on the correntropy, which not only can measure the relative importance of human-human interactions, but also can build personal space for each pedestrian. We further propose an Interaction Module including this data-driven mechanism that can effectively extract feature representations of dynamic human-human interactions in the scene and calculate corresponding weights to represent the importance of different interactions. To share such social messages among pedestrians, we design an interaction-aware architecture based on the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for trajectory prediction. We demonstrate the performance of our model on two public datasets and the experimental results demonstrate that our model can achieve better performance than several latest methods with good performance",

More importantly, the self-attention patterns show us where the model looks to predict memorability. We compare model attention against human gaze fixation density maps collected through a small-scale eye-tracking experiment where humans perform a video memory task. Quantitative saliency metrics show that the model attention and human gaze follow similar patterns. Furthermore, while panoptic segmentation confirms that the model and humans attend more to thing classes, stuff classes that receive increased/decreased attention tend to have higher memorability scores. We also observe that the model assigns greater importance to the initial frames, mimicking temporal attention patterns found in humans",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Recent methods for dynamic human reconstruction have attained promising reconstruction results. Most of these methods rely only on RGB color supervision without considering explicit geometric constraints. This leads to existing human reconstruction techniques being more prone to overfitting to color and causes geometrically inherent ambiguities, especially in the sparse multi-view setup. Motivated by recent advances in the field of monocular geometry prediction, we consider the geometric constraints of estimated depth and normals in the learning of neural implicit representation for dynamic human reconstruction. As a geometric regularization, this provides reliable yet explicit supervision information, and improves reconstruction quality. We also exploit several beneficial physical priors, such as adding noise into view direction and maximizing the density on the human surface. These priors ensure the color rendered along rays to be robust to view direction and reduce the inherent ambiguities of density estimated along rays. Experimental results demonstrate that depth and normal cues, predicted by human-specific monocular estimators, can provide effective supervision signals and render more accurate images. Finally, we also show that the proposed physical priors significantly reduce overfitting and improve the overall quality of novel view synthesis.

Learning-based self-supervised methods for structure-preserving noise reduction have demonstrated superior performance over traditional methods but face unique challenges in OCT imaging. The high correlation of voxels generated by coherent A-scan beams undermines the efficacy of self-supervised learning methods as it violates the assumption of independent pixel noise. We conduct experiments demonstrating limitations of existing models due to this independence assumption. We then introduce a new end-to-end self-supervised learning framework specifically tailored for OCT image denoising, integrating slice-by-slice training and registration modules into one network. An extensive ablation study is conducted for the proposed approach. Comparison to previously published self-supervised denoising models demonstrates improved performance of the proposed framework, potentially serving as a preprocessing step towards superior segmentation performance and quantitative analysis",

    "abstract": "We propose GS-IR, a novel inverse rendering approach based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) that leverages forward mapping volume rendering to achieve photorealistic novel view synthesis and relighting results. Unlike previous works that use implicit neural representations and volume rendering (e.g. NeRF), which suffer from low expressive power and high computational complexity, we extend GS, a top-performance representation for novel view synthesis, to estimate scene geometry, surface material, and environment illumination from multi-view images captured under unknown lighting conditions. There are two main problems when introducing GS to inverse rendering: 1) GS does not support producing plausible normal natively; 2) forward mapping (e.g. rasterization and splatting) cannot trace the occlusion like backward mapping (e.g. ray tracing). To address these challenges, our GS-IR proposes an efficient optimization scheme that incorporates a depth-derivation-based regularization for normal estimation and a baking-based occlusion to model indirect lighting. The flexible and expressive GS representation allows us to achieve fast and compact geometry reconstruction, photorealistic novel view synthesis, and effective physically-based rendering.

However, standard learning models often suffer from an accuracy-robustness trade-off, which is a limitation that must be overcome in the control of safety-critical systems that require both high performance and rigorous robustness guarantees. In this work, we build upon the recent \"locally biased smoothing\" method to develop classifiers that simultaneously inherit high accuracy from standard models and high robustness from robust models. Specifically, we extend locally biased smoothing to the multi-class setting, and then overcome its performance bottleneck by generalizing the formulation to \"mix\" the outputs of a standard neural network and a robust neural network. We prove that when the robustness of the robust base model is certifiable, within a closed-form $\\ell_p$ radius, no alteration or attack on an input can result in misclassification of the mixed classifier; the proposed model inherits the certified robustness. Moreover, we use numerical experiments on the CIFAR-10 benchmark dataset to verify that the mixed model noticeably improves the accuracy-robustness trade-off",

    "title": "Deep Learning-Based Approaches for Contactless Fingerprints Segmentation and Extraction",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Fingerprints are widely recognized as one of the most unique and reliable characteristics of human identity. Most modern fingerprint authentication systems rely on contact-based fingerprints, which require the use of fingerprint scanners or fingerprint sensors for capturing fingerprints during the authentication process. Various types of fingerprint sensors, such as optical, capacitive, and ultrasonic sensors, employ distinct techniques to gather and analyze fingerprint data. This dependency on specific hardware or sensors creates a barrier or challenge for the broader adoption of fingerprint based biometric systems. This limitation hinders the widespread adoption of fingerprint authentication in various applications and scenarios. Border control, healthcare systems, educational institutions, financial transactions, and airport security face challenges when fingerprint sensors are not universally available. To mitigate the dependence on additional hardware, the use of contactless fingerprints has emerged as an alternative. Developing precise fingerprint segmentation methods, accurate fingerprint extraction tools, and reliable fingerprint matchers are crucial for the successful implementation of a robust contactless fingerprint authentication system. This paper focuses on the development of a deep learning-based segmentation tool for contactless fingerprint localization and segmentation. Our system leverages deep learning techniques to achieve high segmentation accuracy and reliable extraction of fingerprints from contactless fingerprint images. In our evaluation, our segmentation method demonstrated an average mean absolute error (MAE) of 30 pixels, an error in angle prediction (EAP) of 5.92 degrees, and a labeling accuracy of 97.46%. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our novel contactless fingerprint segmentation and extraction tools",

    "title": "Advancing Vision Transformers with Group-Mix Attention",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Vision Transformers (ViTs) have been shown to enhance visual recognition through modeling long-range dependencies with multi-head self-attention (MHSA), which is typically formulated as Query-Key-Value computation. However, the attention map generated from the Query and Key captures only token-to-token correlations at one single granularity. In this paper, we argue that self-attention should have a more comprehensive mechanism to capture correlations among tokens and groups (i.e., multiple adjacent tokens) for higher representational capacity. Thereby, we propose Group-Mix Attention (GMA) as an advanced replacement for traditional self-attention, which can simultaneously capture token-to-token, token-to-group, and group-to-group correlations with various group sizes. To this end, GMA splits the Query, Key, and Value into segments uniformly and performs different group aggregations to generate group proxies. The attention map is computed based on the mixtures of tokens and group proxies and used to re-combine the tokens and groups in Value. Based on GMA, we introduce a powerful backbone, namely GroupMixFormer, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation with fewer parameters than existing models. For instance, GroupMixFormer-L (with 70.3M parameters and 384^2 input) attains 86.2% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K without external data, while GroupMixFormer-B (with 45.8M parameters) attains 51.2% mIoU on ADE20K",

Recently, latent diffusion models trained for 2D image synthesis have been turned into generative video models by inserting temporal layers and finetuning them on small, high-quality video datasets. However, training methods in the literature vary widely, and the field has yet to agree on a unified strategy for curating video data. In this paper, we identify and evaluate three different stages for successful training of video LDMs: text-to-image pretraining, video pretraining, and high-quality video finetuning. Furthermore, we demonstrate the necessity of a well-curated pretraining dataset for generating high-quality videos and present a systematic curation process to train a strong base model, including captioning and filtering strategies. We then explore the impact of finetuning our base model on high-quality data and train a text-to-video model that is competitive with closed-source video generation. We also show that our base model provides a powerful motion representation for downstream tasks such as image-to-video generation and adaptability to camera motion-specific LoRA modules. Finally, we demonstrate that our model provides a strong multi-view 3D-prior and can serve as a base to finetune a multi-view diffusion model that jointly generates multiple views of objects in a feedforward fashion, outperforming image-based methods at a fraction of their compute budget.

For this analysis to be reliable and reproducible, identification of individual fibres within microscopy images (segmentation) of SM tissue should be automatic and precise. Biomedical scientists in this field currently rely on custom tools and general machine learning (ML) models, both followed by labour intensive and subjective manual interventions to fine-tune segmentation. We believe that fully automated, precise, reproducible segmentation is possible by training ML models. However, in this important biomedical domain, there are currently no good quality, publicly available annotated imaging datasets available for ML model training. In this paper we release NCL-SM: a high quality bioimaging dataset of 46 human SM tissue cross-sections from both healthy control subjects and from patients with genetically diagnosed muscle pathology. These images include $>$ 50k manually segmented muscle fibres (myofibres). In addition we also curated high quality myofibre segmentations, annotating reasons for rejecting low quality myofibres and low quality regions in SM tissue images, making these annotations completely ready for downstream analysis. This, we believe, will pave the way for development of a fully automatic pipeline that identifies individual myofibres within images of tissue sections and, in particular, also classifies individual myofibres that are fit for further analysis",

    "abstract": "Identifying anatomical structures (e.g., lesions or landmarks) in medical images plays a fundamental role in medical image analysis. As an exemplar-based landmark detection method, Self-supervised Anatomical eMbedding (SAM) learns a discriminative embedding for each voxel in the image and has shown promising results on various tasks. However, SAM still faces challenges in: (1) differentiating voxels with similar appearance but different semantic meanings (\\textit{e.g.}, two adjacent structures without clear borders); (2) matching voxels with similar semantics but markedly different appearance (e.g., the same vessel before and after contrast injection); and (3) cross-modality matching (e.g., CT-MRI registration). To overcome these challenges, we propose SAMv2, which is a unified framework designed to learn appearance, semantic, and cross-modality anatomical embeddings. Specifically, SAMv2 incorporates three key innovations: (1) semantic embedding learning with prototypical contrastive loss; (2) a fixed-point-based matching strategy; and (3) an iterative approach for cross-modality embedding learning. We thoroughly evaluated SAMv2 across three tasks, including one-shot landmark detection, lesion tracking on longitudinal CT scans, and CT-MRI affine/rigid registration with varying field of view. Our results suggest that SAMv2 outperforms SAM and other state-of-the-art methods, offering a robust and versatile approach for landmark based medical image analysis tasks.

    "abstract": "Computer vision models have been known to encode harmful biases, leading to the potentially unfair treatment of historically marginalized groups, such as people of color. However, there remains a lack of datasets balanced along demographic traits that can be used to evaluate the downstream fairness of these models. In this work, we demonstrate that diffusion models can be leveraged to create such a dataset. We first use a diffusion model to generate a large set of images depicting various occupations. Subsequently, each image is edited using inpainting to generate multiple variants, where each variant refers to a different perceived race. Using this dataset, we benchmark several vision-language models on a multi-class occupation classification task. We find that images generated with non-Caucasian labels have a significantly higher occupation misclassification rate than images generated with Caucasian labels, and that several misclassifications are suggestive of racial biases. We measure a model's downstream fairness by computing the standard deviation in the probability of predicting the true occupation label across the different perceived identity groups. Using this fairness metric, we find significant disparities between the evaluated vision-and-language models. We hope that our work demonstrates the potential value of diffusion methods for fairness evaluations",

    "title": "Unbalancedness in Neural Monge Maps Improves Unpaired Domain Translation",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In optimal transport (OT), a Monge map is known as a mapping that transports a source distribution to a target distribution in the most cost-efficient way. Recently, multiple neural estimators for Monge maps have been developed and applied in diverse unpaired domain translation tasks, e.g. in single-cell biology and computer vision. However, the classic OT framework enforces mass conservation, which makes it prone to outliers and limits its applicability in real-world scenarios. The latter can be particularly harmful in OT domain translation tasks, where the relative position of a sample within a distribution is explicitly taken into account. While unbalanced OT tackles this challenge in the discrete setting, its integration into neural Monge map estimators has received limited attention. We propose a theoretically grounded method to incorporate unbalancedness into any Monge map estimator. We improve existing estimators to model cell trajectories over time and to predict cellular responses to perturbations. Moreover, our approach seamlessly integrates with the OT flow matching (OT-FM) framework. While we show that OT-FM performs competitively in image translation, we further improve performance by incorporating unbalancedness (UOT-FM), which better preserves relevant features. We hence establish UOT-FM as a principled method for unpaired image translation",

    "abstract": "The domain adaptation approach has gained significant acceptance in transferring styles across various vendors and centers, along with filling the gaps in modalities. However, multi-center application faces the challenge of the difficulty of domain adaptation due to their intra-domain differences. We focus on introducing a fine-grained unsupervised framework for domain adaptation to facilitate cross-modality segmentation of vestibular schwannoma (VS) and cochlea. We propose to use a vector to control the generator to synthesize a fake image with given features. And then, we can apply various augmentations to the dataset by searching the feature dictionary. The diversity augmentation can increase the performance and robustness of the segmentation model.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The high costs of annotating large datasets suggests a need for effectively training CNNs with limited data, and data augmentation is a promising direction. We study foundational augmentation techniques, including Mixed Sample Data Augmentations (MSDAs) and a no-parameter variant of RandAugment termed Preset-RandAugment, in the fully supervised scenario. We observe that Preset-RandAugment excels in limited-data contexts while MSDAs are moderately effective. We show that low-level feature transforms play a pivotal role in this performance difference, postulate a new property of augmentations related to their data efficiency, and propose new ways to measure the diversity and realism of augmentations. Building on these insights, we introduce a novel augmentation technique called RandMSAugment that integrates complementary strengths of existing methods. RandMSAugment significantly outperforms the competition on CIFAR-100, STL-10, and Tiny-Imagenet. With very small training sets (4, 25, 100 samples/class), RandMSAugment achieves compelling performance gains between 4.1% and 6.75%. Even with more training data (500 samples/class) we improve performance by 1.03% to 2.47%. RandMSAugment does not require hyperparameter tuning, extra validation data, or cumbersome optimizations",

    "abstract": "Intraoperative fluoroscopy is a frequently used modality in minimally invasive orthopedic surgeries. Aligning the intraoperatively acquired X-ray image with the preoperatively acquired 3D model of a computed tomography (CT) scan reduces the mental burden on surgeons induced by the overlapping anatomical structures in the acquired images. This paper proposes a fully automatic registration method that is robust to extreme viewpoints and does not require manual annotation of landmark points during training. It is based on a fully convolutional neural network (CNN) that regresses the scene coordinates for a given X-ray image. The scene coordinates are defined as the intersection of the back-projected rays from a pixel toward the 3D model. Training data for a patient-specific model were generated through a realistic simulation of a C-arm device using preoperative CT scans. In contrast, intraoperative registration was achieved by solving the perspective-n-point (PnP) problem with a random sample and consensus (RANSAC) algorithm. Experiments were conducted using a pelvic CT dataset that included several real fluoroscopic (X-ray) images with ground truth annotations. The proposed method achieved an average mean target registration error (mTRE) of 3.79 mm in the 50th percentile of the simulated test dataset and projected mTRE of 9.65 mm in the 50th percentile of real fluoroscopic images for pelvis registration",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Large-scale image-language pretrained models, e.g., CLIP, have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in acquiring general multi-modal knowledge through web-scale image-text data. Despite the impressive performance of image-language models on various image tasks, how to effectively expand them on general video understanding remains an area of ongoing exploration. In this paper, we investigate the image-to-video transferring from the perspective of the model and the data, unveiling two key obstacles impeding the adaptation of image-language models: non-generalizable temporal modeling and partially misaligned video-text data. To address these challenges, we propose Spatial-Temporal Auxiliary Network with Mutual-guided alignment module (Mug-STAN), a simple yet effective framework extending image-text model to diverse video tasks and video-text data.Specifically, STAN adopts a branch structure with decomposed spatial-temporal modules to enable generalizable temporal modeling, while Mug suppresses misalignment by introducing token-wise feature aggregation of either modality from the other. Extensive experimental results verify Mug-STAN significantly improves adaptation of language-image pretrained models such as CLIP and CoCa at both video-text post-pretraining and finetuning stages. With our solution, state-of-the-art zero-shot and finetuning results on various downstream datasets, including MSR-VTT, DiDeMo, LSMDC, Kinetics-400, Something-Something-2, HMDB-51, UCF- 101, and AVA, are achieved. Moreover, by integrating pretrained Mug-STAN with the emerging multimodal dialogue model, we can realize zero-shot video chatting. Codes are available at https://github.com/farewellthree/STAN",

In this regard, machine learning-based methods for automated capturing of early signs of autism from the recorded videos of the children is a promising alternative. In this paper, the authors propose a novel pipelined deep learning architecture to detect certain self-stimulatory behaviors that help in the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

Here, we test the computational viability of such a scheme in the context of multi-task learning. We show that fine-tuning convolutional networks by stochastic gain modulation improves on deterministic gain modulation, achieving state-of-the-art results on the CelebA dataset. To better understand the mechanisms supporting this improvement, we explore how fine-tuning performance is affected by architecture using Cifar-100. Overall, our results suggest that stochastic comodulation can enhance learning efficiency and performance in multi-task learning, without additional learnable parameters.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Stylized text-to-image generation focuses on creating images from textual descriptions while adhering to a style specified by a few reference images. However, subtle style variations within different reference images can hinder the model from accurately learning the target style. In this paper, we propose InstaStyle, a novel approach that excels in generating high-fidelity stylized images with only a single reference image. Our approach is based on the finding that the inversion noise from a stylized reference image inherently carries the style signal, as evidenced by their non-zero signal-to-noise ratio. We employ DDIM inversion to extract this noise from the reference image and leverage a diffusion model to generate new stylized images from the ``style\" noise. Additionally, the inherent ambiguity and bias of textual prompts impede the precise conveying of style. To address this, we introduce a learnable style token via prompt refinement, which enhances the accuracy of the style description for the reference image. Qualitative and quantitative experimental results demonstrate that InstaStyle achieves superior performance compared to current benchmarks. Furthermore, our approach also showcases its capability in the creative task of style combination with mixed inversion noise",

In this work, we present methods to reduce the size of this data, scaling it from gigabytes to megabytes, enabling the micro-CT dataset to be delivered in real-time. In addition, arthropods can be identified by scientists even after implementing data reduction methodologies. Our initial step is to devise three distinct visual previews that comply with the best practices of data exploration. Subsequently, each visual preview warrants its own design consideration, thereby necessitating an individual data processing pipeline for each. We aim to present data reduction algorithms applied across the data processing pipelines. Particularly, we reduce size by using the multi-resolution slicemaps, the server-side rendering, and the histogram filtering approaches. In the evaluation, we examine the disparities of each method to identify the most favorable arrangement for our operation, which can then be adjusted for other experiments that have comparable necessities. Our demonstration proved that reducing the dataset size to the megabyte range is achievable without compromising the arthropod's geometry information",

    "title": "Word for Person: Zero-shot Composed Person Retrieval",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Searching for specific person has great security value and social benefits, and it often involves a combination of visual and textual information. Conventional person retrieval methods, whether image-based or text-based, usually fall short in effectively harnessing both types of information, leading to the loss of accuracy. In this paper, a whole new task called Composed Person Retrieval (CPR) is proposed to jointly utilize both image and text information for target person retrieval. However, the supervised CPR must depend on very costly manual annotation dataset, while there are currently no available resources. To mitigate this issue, we firstly introduce the Zero-shot Composed Person Retrieval (ZS-CPR), which leverages existing domain-related data to resolve the CPR problem without reliance on expensive annotations. Secondly, to learn ZS-CPR model, we propose a two-stage learning framework, Word4Per, where a lightweight Textual Inversion Network (TINet) and a text-based person retrieval model based on fine-tuned Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) network are learned without utilizing any CPR data. Thirdly, a finely annotated Image-Text Composed Person Retrieval dataset (ITCPR) is built as the benchmark to assess the performance of the proposed Word4Per framework. Extensive experiments under both Rank-1 and mAP demonstrate the effectiveness of Word4Per for the ZS-CPR task, surpassing the comparative methods by over 10%.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "As an emerging concept, steganography without embedding (SWE) hides a secret message without directly embedding it into a cover. Thus, SWE has the unique advantage of being immune to typical steganalysis methods and can better protect the secret message from being exposed. However, existing SWE methods are generally criticized for their poor payload capacity and low fidelity of recovered secret messages. In this paper, we propose a novel steganography-without-embedding technique, named DF-SWE, which addresses the aforementioned drawbacks and produces diverse and natural stego images. Specifically, DF-SWE employs a reversible circulation of double flow to build a reversible bijective transformation between the secret image and the generated stego image. Hence, it provides a way to directly generate stego images from secret images without a cover image. Besides leveraging the invertible property, DF-SWE can invert a secret image from a generated stego image in a nearly lossless manner and increases the fidelity of extracted secret images. To the best of our knowledge, DF-SWE is the first SWE method that can hide large images and multiple images into one image with the same size, significantly enhancing the payload capacity. According to the experimental results, the payload capacity of DF-SWE achieves 24-72 BPP is 8000-16000 times compared to its competitors while producing diverse images to minimize the exposure risk. Importantly, DF-SWE can be applied in the steganography of secret images in various domains without requiring training data from the corresponding domains. This domain-agnostic property suggests that DF-SWE can 1) be applied to hiding private data and 2) be deployed in resource-limited systems",

Despite their success, existing visual delta-tuning art fails to exceed the upper limit of full fine-tuning on challenging tasks like instance segmentation and semantic segmentation. To find a competitive alternative to full fine-tuning, we propose the Multi-cognitive Visual Adapter (Mona) tuning, a novel adapter-based tuning method. First, we introduce multiple vision-friendly filters into the adapter to enhance its ability to process visual signals, while previous methods mainly rely on language-friendly linear filters. Second, we add the scaled normalization layer in the adapter to regulate the distribution of input features for visual filters. To fully demonstrate the practicality and generality of Mona, we conduct experiments on multiple representative visual tasks, including instance segmentation on COCO, semantic segmentation on ADE20K, object detection on Pascal VOC, and image classification on several common datasets. Exciting results illustrate that Mona surpasses full fine-tuning on all these tasks and is the only delta-tuning method outperforming full fine-tuning on instance segmentation and semantic segmentation tasks. For example, Mona achieves a 1% performance gain on the COCO dataset compared to full fine-tuning. Comprehensive results suggest that Mona-tuning is more suitable for retaining and utilizing the capabilities of pre-trained models than full fine-tuning.

We further reveal that the cross-attention mechanism in latent diffusion models tends to blend the content and style images, resulting in stylized outputs that deviate from the original content image.

    "title": "Coordinate-Aware Modulation for Neural Fields",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Neural fields, mapping low-dimensional input coordinates to corresponding signals, have shown promising results in representing various signals. Numerous methodologies have been proposed, and techniques employing MLPs and grid representations have achieved substantial success. MLPs allow compact and high expressibility, yet often suffer from spectral bias and slow convergence speed. On the other hand, methods using grids are free from spectral bias and achieve fast training speed, however, at the expense of high spatial complexity. In this work, we propose a novel way for exploiting both MLPs and grid representations in neural fields. Unlike the prevalent methods that combine them sequentially (extract features from the grids first and feed them to the MLP), we inject spectral bias-free grid representations into the intermediate features in the MLP. More specifically, we suggest a Coordinate-Aware Modulation (CAM), which modulates the intermediate features using scale and shift parameters extracted from the grid representations. This can maintain the strengths of MLPs while mitigating any remaining potential biases, facilitating the rapid learning of high-frequency components. In addition, we empirically found that the feature normalizations, which have not been successful in neural filed literature, proved to be effective when applied in conjunction with the proposed CAM. Experimental results demonstrate that CAM enhances the performance of neural representation and improves learning stability across a range of signals. Especially in the novel view synthesis task, we achieved state-of-the-art performance with the least number of parameters and fast training speed for dynamic scenes and the best performance under 1MB memory for static scenes.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Image registration is a fundamental medical image analysis task. Ideally, registration should focus on aligning semantically corresponding voxels, i.e., the same anatomical locations. However, existing methods often optimize similarity measures computed directly on intensities or on hand-crafted features, which lack anatomical semantic information. These similarity measures may lead to sub-optimal solutions where large deformations, complex anatomical differences, or cross-modality imagery exist. In this work, we introduce a fast and accurate method for unsupervised 3D medical image registration building on top of a Self-supervised Anatomical eMbedding (SAM) algorithm, which is capable of computing dense anatomical correspondences between two images at the voxel level. We name our approach SAM-Enhanced registration (SAME++), which decomposes image registration into four steps: affine transformation, coarse deformation, deep non-parametric transformation, and instance optimization. Using SAM embeddings, we enhance these steps by finding more coherent correspondence and providing features with better semantic guidance. We extensively evaluated SAME++ using more than 50 labeled organs on three challenging inter-subject registration tasks of different body parts. As a complete registration framework, SAME++ markedly outperforms leading methods by $4.2\\%$ - $8.2\\%$ in terms of Dice score while being orders of magnitude faster than numerical optimization-based methods.

    "title": "Elucidating and Overcoming the Challenges of Label Noise in Supervised Contrastive Learning",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Image classification datasets exhibit a non-negligible fraction of mislabeled examples, often due to human error when one class superficially resembles another. This issue poses challenges in supervised contrastive learning (SCL), where the goal is to cluster together data points of the same class in the embedding space while distancing those of disparate classes. While such methods outperform those based on cross-entropy, they are not immune to labeling errors. However, while the detrimental effects of noisy labels in supervised learning are well-researched, their influence on SCL remains largely unexplored. Hence, we analyse the effect of label errors and examine how they disrupt the SCL algorithm's ability to distinguish between positive and negative sample pairs. Our analysis reveals that human labeling errors manifest as easy positive samples in around 99% of cases. We, therefore, propose D-SCL, a novel Debiased Supervised Contrastive Learning objective designed to mitigate the bias introduced by labeling errors. We demonstrate that D-SCL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art techniques for representation learning across diverse vision benchmarks, offering improved robustness to label errors",

    "abstract": "Piece-wise planar 3D reconstruction simultaneously segments plane instances and recovers their 3D plane parameters from an image, which is particularly useful for indoor or man-made environments. Efficient reconstruction of 3D planes coupled with semantic predictions offers advantages for a wide range of applications requiring scene understanding and concurrent spatial mapping. However, most existing planar reconstruction models either neglect semantic predictions or do not run efficiently enough for real-time applications. We introduce SoloPlanes, a real-time planar reconstruction model based on a modified instance segmentation architecture which simultaneously predicts semantics for each plane instance, along with plane parameters and piece-wise plane instance masks. By providing multi-view guidance in feature space, we achieve an improvement in instance mask segmentation despite only warping plane features due to the nature of feature sharing in multi-task learning. Our model simultaneously predicts semantics using single images at inference time, while achieving real-time predictions at 43 FPS. The code will be released post-publication",

    "title": "Incorporating granularity bias as the margin into contrastive loss for video captioning",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Video captioning models easily suffer from long-tail distribution of phrases, which makes captioning models prone to generate vague sentences instead of accurate ones. However, existing debiasing strategies tend to export external knowledge to build dependency trees of words or refine frequency distribution by complex losses and extra input features, which lack interpretability and are hard to train. To mitigate the impact of granularity bias on the model, we introduced a statistical-based bias extractor. This extractor quantifies the information content within sentences and videos, providing an estimate of the likelihood that a video-sentence pair is affected by granularity bias. Furthermore, with the growing trend of integrating contrastive learning methods into video captioning tasks, we use a bidirectional triplet loss to get more negative samples in a batch. Subsequently, we incorporate the margin score into the contrastive learning loss, establishing distinct training objectives for head and tail sentences. This approach facilitates the model's training effectiveness on tail samples. Our simple yet effective loss, incorporating Granularity bias, is referred to as the Margin-Contrastive Loss (GMC Loss). The proposed model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on MSRVTT with a CIDEr of 57.17, and MSVD, where CIDEr reaches up to 138.68",

    "title": "Point Cloud Pre-training with Diffusion Models",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Pre-training a model and then fine-tuning it on downstream tasks has demonstrated significant success in the 2D image and NLP domains. However, due to the unordered and non-uniform density characteristics of point clouds, it is non-trivial to explore the prior knowledge of point clouds and pre-train a point cloud backbone. In this paper, we propose a novel pre-training method called Point cloud Diffusion pre-training (PointDif). We consider the point cloud pre-training task as a conditional point-to-point generation problem and introduce a conditional point generator. This generator aggregates the features extracted by the backbone and employs them as the condition to guide the point-to-point recovery from the noisy point cloud, thereby assisting the backbone in capturing both local and global geometric priors as well as the global point density distribution of the object. We also present a recurrent uniform sampling optimization strategy, which enables the model to uniformly recover from various noise levels and learn from balanced supervision. Our PointDif achieves substantial improvement across various real-world datasets for diverse downstream tasks such as classification, segmentation and detection. Specifically, PointDif attains 70.0% mIoU on S3DIS Area 5 for the segmentation task and achieves an average improvement of 2.4% on ScanObjectNN for the classification task compared to TAP. Furthermore, our pre-training framework can be flexibly applied to diverse point cloud backbones and bring considerable gains",

    "title": "Effective Backdoor Mitigation Depends on the Pre-training Objective",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Despite the advanced capabilities of contemporary machine learning (ML) models, they remain vulnerable to adversarial and backdoor attacks. This vulnerability is particularly concerning in real-world deployments, where compromised models may exhibit unpredictable behavior in critical scenarios. Such risks are heightened by the prevalent practice of collecting massive, internet-sourced datasets for pre-training multimodal models, as these datasets may harbor backdoors. Various techniques have been proposed to mitigate the effects of backdooring in these models such as CleanCLIP which is the current state-of-the-art approach. In this work, we demonstrate that the efficacy of CleanCLIP in mitigating backdoors is highly dependent on the particular objective used during model pre-training. We observe that stronger pre-training objectives correlate with harder to remove backdoors behaviors. We show this by training multimodal models on two large datasets consisting of 3 million (CC3M) and 6 million (CC6M) datapoints, under various pre-training objectives, followed by poison removal using CleanCLIP. We find that CleanCLIP is ineffective when stronger pre-training objectives are used, even with extensive hyperparameter tuning. Our findings underscore critical considerations for ML practitioners who pre-train models using large-scale web-curated data and are concerned about potential backdoor threats. Notably, our results suggest that simpler pre-training objectives are more amenable to effective backdoor removal. This insight is pivotal for practitioners seeking to balance the trade-offs between using stronger pre-training objectives and security against backdoor attacks",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Automated driving object detection has always been a challenging task in computer vision due to environmental uncertainties. These uncertainties include significant differences in object sizes and encountering the class unseen. It may result in poor performance when traditional object detection models are directly applied to automated driving detection. Because they usually presume fixed categories of common traffic participants, such as pedestrians and cars. Worsely, the huge class imbalance between common and novel classes further exacerbates performance degradation. To address the issues stated, we propose OpenNet to moderate the class imbalance with the Balanced Loss, which is based on Cross Entropy Loss. Besides, we adopt an inductive layer based on gradient reshaping to fast learn new classes with limited samples during incremental learning. To against catastrophic forgetting, we employ normalized feature distillation. By the way, we improve multi-scale detection robustness and unknown class recognition through FPN and energy-based detection, respectively.

    "abstract": "This paper provides an efficient training-free painterly image harmonization (PIH) method, dubbed FreePIH, that leverages only a pre-trained diffusion model to achieve state-of-the-art harmonization results. Unlike existing methods that require either training auxiliary networks or fine-tuning a large pre-trained backbone, or both, to harmonize a foreground object with a painterly-style background image, our FreePIH tames the denoising process as a plug-in module for foreground image style transfer. Specifically, we find that the very last few steps of the denoising (i.e., generation) process strongly correspond to the stylistic information of images, and based on this, we propose to augment the latent features of both the foreground and background images with Gaussians for a direct denoising-based harmonization. To guarantee the fidelity of the harmonized image, we make use of multi-scale features to enforce the consistency of the content and stability of the foreground objects in the latent space, and meanwhile, aligning both fore-/back-grounds with the same style. Moreover, to accommodate the generation with more structural and textural details, we further integrate text prompts to attend to the latent features, hence improving the generation quality.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Predicting pedestrian trajectories is crucial for improving the safety and effectiveness of autonomous driving and mobile robots. However, this task is nontrivial due to the inherent stochasticity of human motion, which naturally requires the predictor to generate multi-model prediction. Previous works have used various generative methods, such as GAN and VAE, for pedestrian trajectory prediction. Nevertheless, these methods may suffer from problems, including mode collapse and relatively low-quality results. The denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) has recently been applied to trajectory prediction due to its simple training process and powerful reconstruction ability. However, current diffusion-based methods are straightforward without fully leveraging input information and usually require many denoising iterations leading to a long inference time or an additional network for initialization. To address these challenges and promote the application of diffusion models in trajectory prediction, we propose a novel scene-aware multi-modal pedestrian trajectory prediction framework called GBD. GBD combines goal prediction with the diffusion network. First, the goal predictor produces multiple goals, and then the diffusion network generates multi-modal trajectories conditioned on these goals. Furthermore, we introduce a new diffusion sampling algorithm named tree sampling (TS), which leverages common feature to reduce the inference time and improve accuracy for multi-modal prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that our GBD-TS method achieves state-of-the-art performance with real-time inference speed",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Explicit Caption Editing (ECE) -- refining reference image captions through a sequence of explicit edit operations (e.g., KEEP, DETELE) -- has raised significant attention due to its explainable and human-like nature. After training with carefully designed reference and ground-truth caption pairs, state-of-the-art ECE models exhibit limited generalization ability beyond the original training data distribution, i.e., they are tailored to refine content details only in in-domain samples but fail to correct errors in out-of-domain samples. To this end, we propose a new Diffusion-based Explicit Caption editing method: DECap. Specifically, we reformulate the ECE task as a denoising process under the diffusion mechanism, and introduce innovative edit-based noising and denoising processes. Thanks to this design, the noising process can help to eliminate the need for meticulous paired data selection by directly introducing word-level noises for training, learning diverse distribution over input reference caption. The denoising process involves the explicit predictions of edit operations and corresponding content words, refining reference captions through iterative step-wise editing. To further efficiently implement our diffusion process and improve the inference speed, DECap discards the prevalent multi-stage design and directly generates edit operations and content words simultaneously. Extensive ablations have demonstrated the strong generalization ability of DECap in various scenarios. More interestingly, it even shows great potential in improving the quality and controllability of caption generation",

    "abstract": "High-resolution fMRI provides a window into the brain's mesoscale organization. Yet, higher spatial resolution increases scan times, to compensate for the low signal and contrast-to-noise ratio. This work introduces a deep learning-based 3D super-resolution (SR) method for fMRI. By incorporating a resolution-agnostic image augmentation framework, our method adapts to varying voxel sizes without retraining. We apply this innovative technique to localize fine-scale motion-selective sites in the early visual areas. Detection of these sites typically requires a resolution higher than 1 mm isotropic, whereas here, we visualize them based on lower resolution (2-3mm isotropic) fMRI data. Remarkably, the super-resolved fMRI is able to recover high-frequency detail of the interdigitated organization of these sites (relative to the color-selective sites), even with training data sourced from different subjects and experimental paradigms -- including non-visual resting-state fMRI, underscoring its robustness and versatility. Quantitative and qualitative results indicate that our method has the potential to enhance the spatial resolution of fMRI, leading to a drastic reduction in acquisition time",

    "abstract": "The focus of this study is on Unsupervised Continual Learning (UCL), as it presents an alternative to Supervised Continual Learning which needs high-quality manual labeled data. The experiments under the UCL paradigm indicate a phenomenon where the results on the first few tasks are suboptimal. This phenomenon can render the model inappropriate for practical applications. To address this issue, after analyzing the phenomenon and identifying the lack of diversity as a vital factor, we propose a method named Codebook for Unsupervised Continual Learning (CUCL) which promotes the model to learn discriminative features to complete the class boundary. Specifically, we first introduce a Product Quantization to inject diversity into the representation and apply a cross quantized contrastive loss between the original representation and the quantized one to capture discriminative information. Then, based on the quantizer, we propose an effective Codebook Rehearsal to address catastrophic forgetting. This study involves conducting extensive experiments on CIFAR100, TinyImageNet, and MiniImageNet benchmark datasets. Our method significantly boosts the performances of supervised and unsupervised methods. For instance, on TinyImageNet, our method led to a relative improvement of 12.76% and 7% when compared with Simsiam and BYOL, respectively",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) aims to localize an image region of a given object described by a natural-language expression. While promising performance has been demonstrated, existing REC algorithms make a strong assumption that training data feeding into a model are given upfront, which degrades its practicality for real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose Continual Referring Expression Comprehension (CREC), a new setting for REC, where a model is learning on a stream of incoming tasks. In order to continuously improve the model on sequential tasks without forgetting prior learned knowledge and without repeatedly re-training from a scratch, we propose an effective baseline method named Dual Modular Memorization (DMM), which alleviates the problem of catastrophic forgetting by two memorization modules: Implicit-Memory and Explicit-Memory. Specifically, the former module aims to constrain drastic changes to important parameters learned on old tasks when learning a new task; while the latter module maintains a buffer pool to dynamically select and store representative samples of each seen task for future rehearsal. We create three benchmarks for the new CREC setting, by respectively re-splitting three widely-used REC datasets RefCOCO, RefCOCO+ and RefCOCOg into sequential tasks. Extensive experiments on the constructed benchmarks demonstrate that our DMM method significantly outperforms other alternatives, based on two popular REC backbones.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "We propose a novel and challenging benchmark, AutoEval-Video, to comprehensively evaluate large vision-language models in open-ended video question answering. The comprehensiveness of AutoEval-Video is demonstrated in two aspects: 1) AutoEval-Video constructs open-ended video-questions across 9 skill dimensions, addressing capabilities of perception, comprehension, and generation. 2) AutoEval-Video contains newly collected videos that cover over 40 distinct themes. To efficiently evaluate responses to the open-ended questions, we employ an LLM-based evaluation approach, but instead of merely providing a reference answer, we annotate unique evaluation rules for every single instance (video-question pair). To maximize the robustness of these rules, we develop a novel adversarial annotation mechanism. By using instance-specific rules as prompt, GPT-4, as an automatic evaluator, can achieve a stable evaluation accuracy of around 97.0\\%, comparable to the 94.9\\% - 97.5\\% accuracy of a human evaluator. Furthermore, we assess the performance of eight large vision-language models on AutoEval-Video. Among them, GPT-4V(ision) significantly outperforms other models, achieving an accuracy of 32.2\\%. However, there is still substantial room for improvement compared to human accuracy of 72.8\\%. By conducting an extensive case study, we uncover several drawbacks of GPT-4V, such as limited temporal and dynamic comprehension, and overly general responses.

    "title": "Class Gradient Projection For Continual Learning",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Catastrophic forgetting is one of the most critical challenges in Continual Learning (CL). Recent approaches tackle this problem by projecting the gradient update orthogonal to the gradient subspace of existing tasks. While the results are remarkable, those approaches ignore the fact that these calculated gradients are not guaranteed to be orthogonal to the gradient subspace of each class due to the class deviation in tasks, e.g., distinguishing \"Man\" from \"Sea\" v.s. differentiating \"Boy\" from \"Girl\". Therefore, this strategy may still cause catastrophic forgetting for some classes. In this paper, we propose Class Gradient Projection (CGP), which calculates the gradient subspace from individual classes rather than tasks. Gradient update orthogonal to the gradient subspace of existing classes can be effectively utilized to minimize interference from other classes. To improve the generalization and efficiency, we further design a Base Refining (BR) algorithm to combine similar classes and refine class bases dynamically. Moreover, we leverage a contrastive learning method to improve the model's ability to handle unseen tasks. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. It improves the previous methods by 2.0% on the CIFAR-100 dataset",

Our study introduces a multimodal approach with both image and non-image features with a contrastive cross-view graph fusion for Parkinson's disease classification. Specifically, we designed a multimodal co-attention module to integrate embeddings from two distinct graph views derived from low dimensional representation of images and clinical features, enabling the extraction of more stable and structured features from the multiview data. Additionally, we have devised a simplified fusion method utilizing a contrastive loss for positive and negative pairs, to enhance the model's overall cross-view fusion learning capabilities. In our experiments, the graph-view multimodal approach can achieve an accuracy rate of 91% and an AUC of 92.8% in five-fold cross-validation, and it also demonstrates superior predictive capabilities on non-image data as compared to methods that rely solely on machine learning methods",

However, previous works can not seamlessly integrate existing end-to-end models with denoising diffusion models. Existing research can only select acceleration steps based on experience rather than calculating them specifically. Moreover, most methods are limited to small models and small-scale datasets, unable to generalize to general datasets and a wider range of tasks. Therefore, we propose Resfusion with a novel resnoise-diffusion process, which gradually generates segmentation masks or any type of target image, seamlessly integrating state-of-the-art end-to-end models and denoising diffusion models. Resfusion bridges the discrepancy between the likelihood output and the ground truth output through a Markov process. Through the novel smooth equivalence transformation in resnoise-diffusion process, we determine the optimal acceleration step. Experimental results demonstrate that Resfusion combines the capabilities of existing end-to-end models and denoising diffusion models, further enhancing performance and achieving outstanding results. Moreover, Resfusion is not limited to segmentation tasks, it can easily generalize to any general tasks of image generation and exhibit strong competitiveness",

Additionally, a Feature Discrimination Module (FDM) is introduced to separate environment-related and category-related features. Experimental results across three commonly used datasets validate the effectiveness of HyperDID in improving hyperspectral image classification performance.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Recently, 3D anomaly detection, a crucial problem involving fine-grained geometry discrimination, is getting more attention. However, the lack of abundant real 3D anomaly data limits the scalability of current models. To enable scalable anomaly data collection, we propose a 3D anomaly synthesis pipeline to adapt existing large-scale 3Dmodels for 3D anomaly detection. Specifically, we construct a synthetic dataset, i.e., Anomaly-ShapeNet, basedon ShapeNet. Anomaly-ShapeNet consists of 1600 point cloud samples under 40 categories, which provides a rich and varied collection of data, enabling efficient training and enhancing adaptability to industrial scenarios. Meanwhile,to enable scalable representation learning for 3D anomaly localization, we propose a self-supervised method, i.e., Iterative Mask Reconstruction Network (IMRNet). During training, we propose a geometry-aware sample module to preserve potentially anomalous local regions during point cloud down-sampling. Then, we randomly mask out point patches and sent the visible patches to a transformer for reconstruction-based self-supervision. During testing, the point cloud repeatedly goes through the Mask Reconstruction Network, with each iteration's output becoming the next input. By merging and contrasting the final reconstructed point cloud with the initial input, our method successfully locates anomalies. Experiments show that IMRNet outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving 66.1% in I-AUC on Anomaly-ShapeNet dataset and 72.5% in I-AUC on Real3D-AD dataset.

The integration of Artificial Intelligence algorithms, leveraging machine learning and computer vision, has facilitated the development of precise traffic rule enforcement. This paper illustrates how computer vision and machine learning enable the creation of robust algorithms for detecting various traffic violations. Our model, capable of identifying six common traffic infractions, detects red light violations, illegal use of breakdown lanes, violations of vehicle following distance, breaches of marked crosswalk laws, illegal parking, and parking on marked crosswalks. Utilizing online traffic footage and a self-mounted on-dash camera, we apply the YOLOv5 algorithm's detection module to identify traffic agents such as cars, pedestrians, and traffic signs, and the strongSORT algorithm for continuous interframe tracking. Six discrete algorithms analyze agents' behavior and trajectory to detect violations. Subsequently, an Identification Module extracts vehicle ID information, such as the license plate, to generate violation notices sent to relevant authorities",

It efficiently learns visual representations, which in turn facilitates enhanced analysis and interpretation of intricate imaging data. However, such observation is predominantly justified on single-modality data (mostly 2D images like X-rays), adapting VLP to learning unified representations for medical images in real scenario remains an open challenge. This arises from medical images often encompass a variety of modalities, especially modalities with different various number of dimensions (e.g., 3D images like Computed Tomography). To overcome the aforementioned challenges, we propose an Unified Medical Image Pre-training framework, namely UniMedI, which utilizes diagnostic reports as common semantic space to create unified representations for diverse modalities of medical images (especially for 2D and 3D images). Under the text's guidance, we effectively uncover visual modality information, identifying the affected areas in 2D X-rays and slices containing lesion in sophisticated 3D CT scans, ultimately enhancing the consistency across various medical imaging modalities. To demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of UniMedI, we evaluate its performance on both 2D and 3D images across 10 different datasets, covering a wide range of medical image tasks such as classification, segmentation, and retrieval.

Current approaches rely on single deep-learning models, like CNNs, which employ a large amount of data to capture underlying patterns.

To address this, researchers have advocated transfer learning and fine-tuning the pre-trained models. However, using a single backbone network in transfer learning still may cause bottleneck issues and inconsistent performance if it is not suitable for a specific problem domain. To overcome these challenges, we propose a reusable AI-enabled defect detection approach. By combining ensemble learning with transfer learning models (VGG-19, MobileNetV3, and ResNet-50), we improved the classification accuracy and achieved consistent performance at a certain phase of training. Our empirical analysis demonstrates better and more consistent performance compared to other state-of-the-art approaches.

    "abstract": "In-context segmentation aims at segmenting novel images using a few labeled example images, termed as \"in-context examples\", exploring content similarities between examples and the target. The resulting models can be generalized seamlessly to novel segmentation tasks, significantly reducing the labeling and training costs compared with conventional pipelines. However, in-context segmentation is more challenging than classic ones due to its meta-learning nature, requiring the model to learn segmentation rules conditioned on a few samples, not just the segmentation. Unlike previous work with ad-hoc or non-end-to-end designs, we propose SEGIC, an end-to-end segment-in-context framework built upon a single vision foundation model (VFM). In particular, SEGIC leverages the emergent correspondence within VFM to capture dense relationships between target images and in-context samples. As such, information from in-context samples is then extracted into three types of instructions, i.e. geometric, visual, and meta instructions, serving as explicit conditions for the final mask prediction. SEGIC is a straightforward yet effective approach that yields state-of-the-art performance on one-shot segmentation benchmarks. Notably, SEGIC can be easily generalized to diverse tasks, including video object segmentation and open-vocabulary segmentation. Code will be available at \\url{https://github.com/MengLcool/SEGIC}",

For example, to handle high-resolution RS imagery with diverse scale changes across categories and many small objects, region-level reasoning is necessary alongside holistic scene interpretation. Furthermore, the lack of domain-specific multimodal instruction following data as well as strong backbone models for RS make it hard for the models to align their behavior with user queries. To address these limitations, we propose GeoChat - the first versatile remote sensing VLM that offers multitask conversational capabilities with high-resolution RS images. Specifically, GeoChat can not only answer image-level queries but also accepts region inputs to hold region-specific dialogue. Furthermore, it can visually ground objects in its responses by referring to their spatial coordinates. To address the lack of domain-specific datasets, we generate a novel RS multimodal instruction-following dataset by extending image-text pairs from existing diverse RS datasets. We establish a comprehensive benchmark for RS multitask conversations and compare with a number of baseline methods. GeoChat demonstrates robust zero-shot performance on various RS tasks, e.g., image and region captioning, visual question answering, scene classification, visually grounded conversations and referring detection.

    "abstract": "Existing pedestrian behavior prediction methods rely primarily on deep neural networks that utilize features extracted from video frame sequences. Although these vision-based models have shown promising results, they face limitations in effectively capturing and utilizing the dynamic spatio-temporal interactions between the target pedestrian and its surrounding traffic elements, crucial for accurate reasoning. Additionally, training these models requires manually annotating domain-specific datasets, a process that is expensive, time-consuming, and difficult to generalize to new environments and scenarios. The recent emergence of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) offers potential solutions to these limitations due to their superior visual understanding and causal reasoning capabilities, which can be harnessed through semi-supervised training. GPT-4V(ision), the latest iteration of the state-of-the-art Large-Language Model GPTs, now incorporates vision input capabilities. This report provides a comprehensive evaluation of the potential of GPT-4V for pedestrian behavior prediction in autonomous driving using publicly available datasets: JAAD, PIE, and WiDEVIEW. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate GPT-4V(ision)'s promise in zero-shot pedestrian behavior prediction and driving scene understanding ability for autonomous driving. However, it still falls short of the state-of-the-art traditional domain-specific models. Challenges include difficulties in handling small pedestrians and vehicles in motion.

An example of this is Optical Chemical Structure Recognition (OCSR), which aids chemists in retrieving information about chemicals from large amounts of documents. Markush structures are chemical structures that cannot be parsed correctly by OCSR and cause errors. The focus of this research was to propose and test a novel method for classifying Markush structures. Within this method, a comparison was made between fixed-feature extraction and end-to-end learning (CNN). The end-to-end method performed significantly better than the fixed-feature method, achieving 0.928 (0.035 SD) Macro F1 compared to the fixed-feature method's 0.701 (0.052 SD). Because of the nature of the experiment, these figures are a lower bound and can be improved further. These results suggest that Markush structures can be filtered out effectively and accurately using the proposed method. When implemented into OCSR pipelines, this method can improve their performance and use to other researchers",

Subsequently, users can utilize text prompts to generate images that embody the personalized concept, thereby achieving text-to-image personalization. In contrast to existing approaches that emphasize word embedding learning or parameter fine-tuning for the diffusion model, which potentially causes concept dilution or overfitting, our method concatenates embeddings on the feature-dense space of the text encoder in the diffusion model to learn the gap between the personalized concept and its base class, aiming to maximize the preservation of prior knowledge in diffusion models while restoring the personalized concepts. To this end, we first dissect the text encoder's integration in the image generation process to identify the feature-dense space of the encoder. Afterward, we concatenate embeddings on the Keys and Values in this space to learn the gap between the personalized concept and its base class. In this way, the concatenated embeddings ultimately manifest as a residual on the original attention output. To more accurately and unbiasedly quantify the results of personalized image generation, we improve the CLIP image alignment score based on masks. Qualitatively and quantitatively, CatVersion helps to restore personalization concepts more faithfully and enables more robust editing",

To this end, we conduct the first joint ARchitecture-Initialization-Aggregation study and benchmark ARIAs across a range of medical image classification tasks.

Our 4D generation leverages an advanced 4D grid dynamic Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) model, optimized in three distinct stages using multiple diffusion priors. Initially, a static model is optimized using the reference image, guided by 2D and 3D diffusion priors, which serves as the initialization for the dynamic NeRF. Subsequently, a video diffusion model is employed to learn the motion specific to the subject. However, the object in the 3D videos tends to drift away from the reference image over time. This drift is mainly due to the misalignment between the text prompt and the reference image in the video diffusion model. In the final stage, a personalized diffusion prior is therefore utilized to address the semantic drift.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "With the advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have reached a new level of sophistication, showing notable competence in executing intricate cognition and reasoning tasks. However, existing evaluation benchmarks, primarily relying on rigid, hand-crafted datasets to measure task-specific performance, face significant limitations in assessing the alignment of these increasingly anthropomorphic models with human intelligence. In this work, we address the limitations via Auto-Bench, which delves into exploring LLMs as proficient aligners, measuring the alignment between VLMs and human intelligence and value through automatic data curation and assessment. Specifically, for data curation, Auto-Bench utilizes LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) to automatically generate a vast set of question-answer-reasoning triplets via prompting on visual symbolic representations (e.g., captions, object locations, instance relationships, and etc.). The curated data closely matches human intent, owing to the extensive world knowledge embedded in LLMs. Through this pipeline, a total of 28.5K human-verified and 3,504K unfiltered question-answer-reasoning triplets have been curated, covering 4 primary abilities and 16 sub-abilities. We subsequently engage LLMs like GPT-3.5 to serve as judges, implementing the quantitative and qualitative automated assessments to facilitate a comprehensive evaluation of VLMs. Our validation results reveal that LLMs are proficient in both evaluation data curation and model assessment, achieving an average agreement rate of 85%.

Current Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) are predominantly constrained to grounding a single, pre-existing object, relying solely on data from Referring Expression Comprehension tasks. The limitation leads to a compromise in model design, necessitating the introduction of visual expert models or the integration of customized head structures. Beyond these constraints, our research delves into the untapped potential of LVLMs and uncover their inherent capability for basic object perception, allowing them to accurately identify and locate objects of interest.

Traditional diagnostic methods, primarily relying on electroencephalograms (EEGs), often result in cumbersome and non-portable solutions, making continuous patient monitoring challenging. The video-based seizure detection system is expected to free patients from the constraints of scalp or implanted EEG devices and enable remote monitoring in residential settings. Previous video-based methods neither enable all-day monitoring nor provide short detection latency due to insufficient resources and ineffective patient action recognition techniques. Additionally, skeleton-based action recognition approaches remain limitations in identifying subtle seizure-related actions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel skeleton-based spatiotemporal vision graph neural network (STViG) for efficient, accurate, and timely REal-time Automated Detection of epileptic Seizures from surveillance Videos (READS-V). Our experimental results indicate STViG outperforms previous state-of-the-art action recognition models on our collected patients' video data with higher accuracy (5.9% error) and lower FLOPs (0.4G). Furthermore, by integrating a decision-making rule that combines output probabilities and an accumulative function, our READS-V system achieves a 5.1 s EEG onset detection latency, a 13.1 s advance in clinical onset detection, and zero false detection rate",

    "abstract": "3D editing plays a crucial role in many areas such as gaming and virtual reality. Traditional 3D editing methods, which rely on representations like meshes and point clouds, often fall short in realistically depicting complex scenes. On the other hand, methods based on implicit 3D representations, like Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), render complex scenes effectively but suffer from slow processing speeds and limited control over specific scene areas. In response to these challenges, our paper presents GaussianEditor, an innovative and efficient 3D editing algorithm based on Gaussian Splatting (GS), a novel 3D representation. GaussianEditor enhances precision and control in editing through our proposed Gaussian semantic tracing, which traces the editing target throughout the training process. Additionally, we propose Hierarchical Gaussian splatting (HGS) to achieve stabilized and fine results under stochastic generative guidance from 2D diffusion models. We also develop editing strategies for efficient object removal and integration, a challenging task for existing methods. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate GaussianEditor's superior control, efficacy, and rapid performance, marking a significant advancement in 3D editing.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "We introduce MVControl, a novel neural network architecture that enhances existing pre-trained multi-view 2D diffusion models by incorporating additional input conditions, e.g. edge maps. Our approach enables the generation of controllable multi-view images and view-consistent 3D content. To achieve controllable multi-view image generation, we leverage MVDream as our base model, and train a new neural network module as additional plugin for end-to-end task-specific condition learning. To precisely control the shapes and views of generated images, we innovatively propose a new conditioning mechanism that predicts an embedding encapsulating the input spatial and view conditions, which is then injected to the network globally. Once MVControl is trained, score-distillation (SDS) loss based optimization can be performed to generate 3D content, in which process we propose to use a hybrid diffusion prior. The hybrid prior relies on a pre-trained Stable-Diffusion network and our trained MVControl for additional guidance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves robust generalization and enables the controllable generation of high-quality 3D content",

    "title": "Set Features for Anomaly Detection",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "This paper proposes set features for detecting anomalies in samples that consist of unusual combinations of normal elements. Many leading methods discover anomalies by detecting an unusual part of a sample. For example, state-of-the-art segmentation-based approaches, first classify each element of the sample (e.g., image patch) as normal or anomalous and then classify the entire sample as anomalous if it contains anomalous elements. However, such approaches do not extend well to scenarios where the anomalies are expressed by an unusual combination of normal elements. In this paper, we overcome this limitation by proposing set features that model each sample by the distribution of its elements. We compute the anomaly score of each sample using a simple density estimation method, using fixed features. Our approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in image-level logical anomaly detection and sequence-level time series anomaly detection",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Deep learning has revolutionized the accurate segmentation of diseases in medical imaging. However, achieving such results requires training with numerous manual voxel annotations. This requirement presents a challenge for whole-body Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging, where lesions are scattered throughout the body. To tackle this problem, we introduce SW-FastEdit - an interactive segmentation framework that accelerates the labeling by utilizing only a few user clicks instead of voxelwise annotations. While prior interactive models crop or resize PET volumes due to memory constraints, we use the complete volume with our sliding window-based interactive scheme. Our model outperforms existing non-sliding window interactive models on the AutoPET dataset and generalizes to the previously unseen HECKTOR dataset. A user study revealed that annotators achieve high-quality predictions with only 10 click iterations and a low perceived NASA-TLX workload.

    "title": "Trainwreck: A damaging adversarial attack on image classifiers",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Adversarial attacks are an important security concern for computer vision (CV), as they enable malicious attackers to reliably manipulate CV models. Existing attacks aim to elicit an output desired by the attacker, but keep the model fully intact on clean data. With CV models becoming increasingly valuable assets in applied practice, a new attack vector is emerging: disrupting the models as a form of economic sabotage. This paper opens up the exploration of damaging adversarial attacks (DAAs) that seek to damage the target model and maximize the total cost incurred by the damage. As a pioneer DAA, this paper proposes Trainwreck, a train-time attack that poisons the training data of image classifiers to degrade their performance. Trainwreck conflates the data of similar classes using stealthy ($\\epsilon \\leq 8/255$) class-pair universal perturbations computed using a surrogate model. Trainwreck is a black-box, transferable attack: it requires no knowledge of the target model's architecture, and a single poisoned dataset degrades the performance of any model trained on it. The experimental evaluation on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 demonstrates that Trainwreck is indeed an effective attack across various model architectures including EfficientNetV2, ResNeXt-101, and a finetuned ViT-L-16. The strength of the attack can be customized by the poison rate parameter. Finally, data redundancy with file hashing and/or pixel difference are identified as a reliable defense technique against Trainwreck or similar DAAs.

Conventional approaches involve the separate reconstruction of each modality within PET-MRI systems. However, there exists complementary information among multi-modal images. The complementary information can contribute to image reconstruction. In this study, we propose a novel PET-MRI joint reconstruction model employing a mutual consistency-driven diffusion mode, namely MC-Diffusion. MC-Diffusion learns the joint probability distribution of PET and MRI for utilizing complementary information. We conducted a series of contrast experiments about LPLS, Joint ISAT-net and MC-Diffusion by the ADNI dataset.

However, there are clear advantages to switching to a black-box tool, including the ability to use it with any classifier and the wide selection of black-box tools available. On standard images, black-box tools are as precise as white-box. In this paper we compare the performance of several black-box methods against gradcam on a brain cancer MRI dataset. We demonstrate that most black-box tools are not suitable for explaining medical image classifications and present a detailed analysis of the reasons for their shortcomings.

    "abstract": "In this work, CT-xCOV, an explainable framework for COVID-19 diagnosis using Deep Learning (DL) on CT-scans is developed. CT-xCOV adopts an end-to-end approach from lung segmentation to COVID-19 detection and explanations of the detection model's prediction. For lung segmentation, we used the well-known U-Net model. For COVID-19 detection, we compared three different CNN architectures: a standard CNN, ResNet50, and DenseNet121. After the detection, visual and textual explanations are provided. For visual explanations, we applied three different XAI techniques, namely, Grad-Cam, Integrated Gradient (IG), and LIME. Textual explanations are added by computing the percentage of infection by lungs. To assess the performance of the used XAI techniques, we propose a ground-truth-based evaluation method, measuring the similarity between the visualization outputs and the ground-truth infections. The performed experiments show that the applied DL models achieved good results. The U-Net segmentation model achieved a high Dice coefficient (98%). The performance of our proposed classification model (standard CNN) was validated using 5-fold cross-validation (acc of 98.40% and f1-score 98.23%). Lastly, the results of the comparison of XAI techniques show that Grad-Cam gives the best explanations compared to LIME and IG, by achieving a Dice coefficient of 55%, on COVID-19 positive scans, compared to 29% and 24% obtained by IG and LIME respectively.

    "abstract": "Large-scale deployment of fully autonomous vehicles requires a very high degree of robustness to unstructured traffic, and weather conditions, and should prevent unsafe mispredictions. While there are several datasets and benchmarks focusing on segmentation for drive scenes, they are not specifically focused on safety and robustness issues. We introduce the IDD-AW dataset, which provides 5000 pairs of high-quality images with pixel-level annotations, captured under rain, fog, low light, and snow in unstructured driving conditions. As compared to other adverse weather datasets, we provide i.) more annotated images, ii.) paired Near-Infrared (NIR) image for each frame, iii.) larger label set with a 4-level label hierarchy to capture unstructured traffic conditions. We benchmark state-of-the-art models for semantic segmentation in IDD-AW. We also propose a new metric called ''Safe mean Intersection over Union (Safe mIoU)'' for hierarchical datasets which penalizes dangerous mispredictions that are not captured in the traditional definition of mean Intersection over Union (mIoU). The results show that IDD-AW is one of the most challenging datasets to date for these tasks. The dataset and code will be available here: http://iddaw.github.io",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "General purpose segmentation models are able to generate (semantic) segmentation masks from a variety of prompts, including visual (points, boxed, etc.) and textual (object names) ones. In particular, input images are pre-processed by an image encoder to obtain embedding vectors which are later used for mask predictions. Existing adversarial attacks target the end-to-end tasks, i.e. aim at altering the segmentation mask predicted for a specific image-prompt pair. However, this requires running an individual attack for each new prompt for the same image. We propose instead to generate prompt-agnostic adversarial attacks by maximizing the $\\ell_2$-distance, in the latent space, between the embedding of the original and perturbed images. Since the encoding process only depends on the image, distorted image representations will cause perturbations in the segmentation masks for a variety of prompts. We show that even imperceptible $\\ell_\\infty$-bounded perturbations of radius $\\epsilon=1/255$ are often sufficient to drastically modify the masks predicted with point, box and text prompts by recently proposed foundation models for segmentation. Moreover, we explore the possibility of creating universal, i.e. non image-specific, attacks which can be readily applied to any input without further computational cost",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "For debugging and verification of computer vision convolutional deep neural networks (CNNs) human inspection of the learned latent representations is imperative. Therefore, state-of-the-art eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods globally associate given natural language semantic concepts with representing vectors or regions in the CNN latent space supporting manual inspection. Yet, this approach comes with two major disadvantages: They are locally inaccurate when reconstructing a concept label and discard information about the distribution of concept instance representations. The latter, though, is of particular interest for debugging, like finding and understanding outliers, learned notions of sub-concepts, and concept confusion. Furthermore, current single-layer approaches neglect that information about a concept may be spread over the CNN depth. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce the local-to-global Guided Concept Projection Vectors (GCPV) approach: It (1) generates local concept vectors that each precisely reconstruct a concept segmentation label, and then (2) generalizes these to global concept and even sub-concept vectors by means of hiearchical clustering. Our experiments on object detectors demonstrate improved performance compared to the state-of-the-art, the benefit of multi-layer concept vectors, and robustness against low-quality concept segmentation labels. Finally, we demonstrate that GCPVs can be applied to find root causes for confusion of concepts like bus and truck, and reveal interesting concept-level outliers.

To this end, we introduce AdaDiff, a lightweight framework designed to learn instance-specific step usage policies, which are then used by the diffusion model for generation. AdaDiff is optimized using a policy gradient method to maximize a carefully designed reward function, balancing inference time and generation quality. We conduct experiments on three image generation and two video generation benchmarks and demonstrate that our approach achieves similar results in terms of visual quality compared to the baseline using a fixed 50 denoising steps while reducing inference time by at least 33%, going as high as 40%.

To solve this problem, a Multi-scale Semantic Correlation Mining network (MSCMNet) is proposed to comprehensively exploit semantic features at multiple scales and simultaneously reduce modality information loss as small as possible in feature extraction. The proposed network contains three novel components. Firstly, after taking into account the effective utilization of modality information, the Multi-scale Information Correlation Mining Block (MIMB) is designed to explore semantic correlations across multiple scales. Secondly, in order to enrich the semantic information that MIMB can utilize, a quadruple-stream feature extractor (QFE) with non-shared parameters is specifically designed to extract information from different dimensions of the dataset. Finally, the Quadruple Center Triplet Loss (QCT) is further proposed to address the information discrepancy in the comprehensive features.

Frames are denoised in a synchronous fashion, and more importantly, information of different frames is shared since the beginning of the denoising process. Such information sharing ensures that a consensus, in terms of the overall structure and color distribution, among frames can be reached in the early stage of the denoising process before it is too late. The optical flow from the original video serves as the connection, and hence the venue for information sharing, among frames.

In this work, we show that vision-language models can be used to alleviate the dependence on a large number of concept-annotated samples. In particular, we propose an embedding learning strategy to adapt CLIP to the downstream task of skin lesion classification using concept-based descriptions as textual embeddings.

Additionally, TVT employs the L2-Norm of the student's weights as the student-capability metric to improve ranking consistency.

    "title": "Maximizing Discrimination Capability of Knowledge Distillation with Energy-based Score",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "To apply the latest computer vision techniques that require a large computational cost in real industrial applications, knowledge distillation methods (KDs) are essential. Existing logit-based KDs apply the constant temperature scaling to all samples in dataset, limiting the utilization of knowledge inherent in each sample individually. In our approach, we classify the dataset into two categories (i.e., low energy and high energy samples) based on their energy score. Through experiments, we have confirmed that low energy samples exhibit high confidence scores, indicating certain predictions, while high energy samples yield low confidence scores, meaning uncertain predictions. To distill optimal knowledge by adjusting non-target class predictions, we apply a higher temperature to low energy samples to create smoother distributions and a lower temperature to high energy samples to achieve sharper distributions. When compared to previous logit-based and feature-based methods, our energy-based KD (Energy KD) achieves better performance on various datasets. Especially, Energy KD shows significant improvements on CIFAR-100-LT and ImageNet datasets, which contain many challenging samples. Furthermore, we propose high energy-based data augmentation (HE-DA) for further improving the performance. We demonstrate that meaningful performance improvement could be achieved by augmenting only 20-50% of dataset, suggesting that it can be employed on resource-limited devices. To the best of our knowledge, this paper represents the first attempt to make use of energy scores in KD and DA, and we believe it will greatly contribute to future research",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "3D whole-body human mesh recovery aims to reconstruct the 3D human body, face, and hands from a single image. Although powerful deep learning models have achieved accurate estimation in this task, they require enormous memory and computational resources. Consequently, these methods can hardly be deployed on resource-limited edge devices. In this work, we propose a Binarized Dual Residual Network (BiDRN), a novel quantization method to estimate the 3D human body, face, and hands parameters efficiently. Specifically, we design a basic unit Binarized Dual Residual Block (BiDRB) composed of Local Convolution Residual (LCR) and Block Residual (BR), which can preserve full-precision information as much as possible. For LCR, we generalize it to four kinds of convolutional modules so that full-precision information can be propagated even between mismatched dimensions. We also binarize the face and hands box-prediction network as Binaried BoxNet, which can further reduce the model redundancy. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of BiDRN, which has a significant improvement over state-of-the-art binarization algorithms. Moreover, our proposed BiDRN achieves comparable performance with full-precision method Hand4Whole while using just 22.1% parameters and 14.8% operations. We will release all the code and pretrained models",

    "title": "Stable Cluster Discrimination for Deep Clustering",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Deep clustering can optimize representations of instances (i.e., representation learning) and explore the inherent data distribution (i.e., clustering) simultaneously, which demonstrates a superior performance over conventional clustering methods with given features. However, the coupled objective implies a trivial solution that all instances collapse to the uniform features. To tackle the challenge, a two-stage training strategy is developed for decoupling, where it introduces an additional pre-training stage for representation learning and then fine-tunes the obtained model for clustering. Meanwhile, one-stage methods are developed mainly for representation learning rather than clustering, where various constraints for cluster assignments are designed to avoid collapsing explicitly. Despite the success of these methods, an appropriate learning objective tailored for deep clustering has not been investigated sufficiently. In this work, we first show that the prevalent discrimination task in supervised learning is unstable for one-stage clustering due to the lack of ground-truth labels and positive instances for certain clusters in each mini-batch. To mitigate the issue, a novel stable cluster discrimination (SeCu) task is proposed and a new hardness-aware clustering criterion can be obtained accordingly. Moreover, a global entropy constraint for cluster assignments is studied with efficient optimization. Extensive experiments are conducted on benchmark data sets and ImageNet. SeCu achieves state-of-the-art performance on all of them, which demonstrates the effectiveness of one-stage deep clustering. Code is available at \\url{https://github.com/idstcv/SeCu}",

    "title": "Cosine Similarity Knowledge Distillation for Individual Class Information Transfer",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Previous logits-based Knowledge Distillation (KD) have utilized predictions about multiple categories within each sample (i.e., class predictions) and have employed Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to reduce the discrepancy between the student and teacher predictions. Despite the proliferation of KD techniques, the student model continues to fall short of achieving a similar level as teachers. In response, we introduce a novel and effective KD method capable of achieving results on par with or superior to the teacher models performance. We utilize teacher and student predictions about multiple samples for each category (i.e., batch predictions) and apply cosine similarity, a commonly used technique in Natural Language Processing (NLP) for measuring the resemblance between text embeddings. This metric's inherent scale-invariance property, which relies solely on vector direction and not magnitude, allows the student to dynamically learn from the teacher's knowledge, rather than being bound by a fixed distribution of the teacher's knowledge. Furthermore, we propose a method called cosine similarity weighted temperature (CSWT) to improve the performance. CSWT reduces the temperature scaling in KD when the cosine similarity between the student and teacher models is high, and conversely, it increases the temperature scaling when the cosine similarity is low. This adjustment optimizes the transfer of information from the teacher to the student model. Extensive experimental results show that our proposed method serves as a viable alternative to existing methods. We anticipate that this approach will offer valuable insights for future research on model compression",

Additionally, the efficiency of generating videos in pixel space is quite low.In this paper, we propose a novel approach to address these challenges by disentangling the target RGB pixels into two distinct components: spatial content and temporal motions. Specifically, we predict temporal motions which include motion vector and residual based on a 3D-UNet diffusion model. By explicitly modeling temporal motions and warping them to the starting image, we improve the temporal consistency of generated videos. This results in a reduction of spatial redundancy, emphasizing temporal details. Our proposed method achieves performance improvements by disentangling content and motion, all without introducing new structural complexities to the model. Extensive experiments on various datasets confirm our approach's superior performance over the majority of state-of-the-art methods in both effectiveness and efficiency",

    "abstract": "Text-to-image (T2I) models have recently experienced rapid development, achieving astonishing performance in terms of fidelity and textual alignment capabilities. However, given a long paragraph (up to 512 words), these generation models still struggle to achieve strong alignment and are unable to generate images depicting complex scenes. In this paper, we introduce an information-enriched diffusion model for paragraph-to-image generation task, termed ParaDiffusion, which delves into the transference of the extensive semantic comprehension capabilities of large language models to the task of image generation. At its core is using a large language model (e.g., Llama V2) to encode long-form text, followed by fine-tuning with LORA to alignthe text-image feature spaces in the generation task. To facilitate the training of long-text semantic alignment, we also curated a high-quality paragraph-image pair dataset, namely ParaImage. This dataset contains a small amount of high-quality, meticulously annotated data, and a large-scale synthetic dataset with long text descriptions being generated using a vision-language model. Experiments demonstrate that ParaDiffusion outperforms state-of-the-art models (SD XL, DeepFloyd IF) on ViLG-300 and ParaPrompts, achieving up to 15% and 45% human voting rate improvements for visual appeal and text faithfulness, respectively. The code and dataset will be released to foster community research on long-text alignment",

    "abstract": "Image super-resolution (SR) methods typically model degradation to improve reconstruction accuracy in complex and unknown degradation scenarios. However, extracting degradation information from low-resolution images is challenging, which limits the model performance. To boost image SR performance, one feasible approach is to introduce additional priors. Inspired by advancements in multi-modal methods and text prompt image processing, we introduce text prompts to image SR to provide degradation priors. Specifically, we first design a text-image generation pipeline to integrate text into SR dataset through the text degradation representation and degradation model. The text representation applies a discretization manner based on the binning method to describe the degradation abstractly. This representation method can also maintain the flexibility of language. Meanwhile, we propose the PromptSR to realize the text prompt SR. The PromptSR employs the diffusion model and the pre-trained language model (e.g., T5 and CLIP). We train the model on the generated text-image dataset. Extensive experiments indicate that introducing text prompts into image SR, yields excellent results on both synthetic and real-world images.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Unsupervised cross-domain action recognition aims at adapting the model trained on an existing labeled source domain to a new unlabeled target domain. Most existing methods solve the task by directly aligning the feature distributions of source and target domains. However, this would cause negative transfer during domain adaptation due to some negative training samples in both domains. In the source domain, some training samples are of low-relevance to target domain due to the difference in viewpoints, action styles, etc. In the target domain, there are some ambiguous training samples that can be easily classified as another type of action under the case of source domain. The problem of negative transfer has been explored in cross-domain object detection, while it remains under-explored in cross-domain action recognition. Therefore, we propose a Multi-modal Instance Refinement (MMIR) method to alleviate the negative transfer based on reinforcement learning. Specifically, a reinforcement learning agent is trained in both domains for every modality to refine the training data by selecting out negative samples from each domain. Our method finally outperforms several other state-of-the-art baselines in cross-domain action recognition on the benchmark EPIC-Kitchens dataset, which demonstrates the advantage of MMIR in reducing negative transfer",

    "abstract": "In this work, we focus on leveraging facial cues beyond the lip region for robust Audio-Visual Speech Enhancement (AVSE). The facial region, encompassing the lip region, reflects additional speech-related attributes such as gender, skin color, nationality, etc., which contribute to the effectiveness of AVSE. However, static and dynamic speech-unrelated attributes also exist, causing appearance changes during speech. To address these challenges, we propose a Dual Attention Cooperative Framework, DualAVSE, to ignore speech-unrelated information, capture speech-related information with facial cues, and dynamically integrate it with the audio signal for AVSE. Specifically, we introduce a spatial attention-based visual encoder to capture and enhance visual speech information beyond the lip region, incorporating global facial context and automatically ignoring speech-unrelated information for robust visual feature extraction. Additionally, a dynamic visual feature fusion strategy is introduced by integrating a temporal-dimensional self-attention module, enabling the model to robustly handle facial variations. The acoustic noise in the speaking process is variable, impacting audio quality. Therefore, a dynamic fusion strategy for both audio and visual features is introduced to address this issue. By integrating cooperative dual attention in the visual encoder and audio-visual fusion strategy, our model effectively extracts beneficial speech information from both audio and visual cues for AVSE. Thorough analysis and comparison on different datasets, including normal and challenging cases with unreliable or absent visual information, consistently show our model outperforming existing methods across multiple metrics",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Machine learning pipelines for classification tasks often train a universal model to achieve accuracy across a broad range of classes. However, a typical user encounters only a limited selection of classes regularly. This disparity provides an opportunity to enhance computational efficiency by tailoring models to focus on user-specific classes. Existing works rely on unstructured pruning, which introduces randomly distributed non-zero values in the model, making it unsuitable for hardware acceleration. Alternatively, some approaches employ structured pruning, such as channel pruning, but these tend to provide only minimal compression and may lead to reduced model accuracy. In this work, we propose CRISP, a novel pruning framework leveraging a hybrid structured sparsity pattern that combines both fine-grained N:M structured sparsity and coarse-grained block sparsity. Our pruning strategy is guided by a gradient-based class-aware saliency score, allowing us to retain weights crucial for user-specific classes. CRISP achieves high accuracy with minimal memory consumption for popular models like ResNet-50, VGG-16, and MobileNetV2 on ImageNet and CIFAR-100 datasets. Moreover, CRISP delivers up to 14$\\times$ reduction in latency and energy consumption compared to existing pruning methods while maintaining comparable accuracy.

While directly converting the pre-trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) - by replacing the non-linear activation with spiking neurons - can provide SNNs with good performance, the resultant SNNs typically demand long timesteps and high energy consumption to achieve their optimal performance. To address this challenge, we introduce the burst-spike mechanism inspired by the biological nervous system, allowing multiple spikes per timestep to reduce conversion errors and produce low-latency SNNs. To further bolster this enhancement, we leverage the Pareto Frontier-driven algorithm to reallocate burst-firing patterns. Moreover, to reduce energy consumption during the conversion process, we propose a sensitivity-driven spike compression technique, which automatically locates the optimal threshold ratio according to layer-specific sensitivity.

    "abstract": "In the domain of 3D Human Pose Estimation, which finds widespread daily applications, the requirement for convenient acquisition equipment continues to grow. To satisfy this demand, we set our sights on a short-baseline binocular setting that offers both portability and a geometric measurement property that radically mitigates depth ambiguity. However, as the binocular baseline shortens, two serious challenges emerge: first, the robustness of 3D reconstruction against 2D errors deteriorates; and second, occlusion reoccurs due to the limited visual differences between two views. To address the first challenge, we propose the Stereo Co-Keypoints Estimation module to improve the view consistency of 2D keypoints and enhance the 3D robustness. In this module, the disparity is utilized to represent the correspondence of binocular 2D points and the Stereo Volume Feature is introduced to contain binocular features across different disparities. Through the regression of SVF, two-view 2D keypoints are simultaneously estimated in a collaborative way which restricts their view consistency. Furthermore, to deal with occlusions, a Pre-trained Pose Transformer module is introduced. Through this module, 3D poses are refined by perceiving pose coherence, a representation of joint correlations. This perception is injected by the Pose Transformer network and learned through a pre-training task that recovers iterative masked joints. Comprehensive experiments carried out on H36M and MHAD datasets, complemented by visualizations, validate the effectiveness of our approach in the short-baseline binocular 3D Human Pose Estimation and occlusion handling",

    "abstract": "High-quality training data is essential for enhancing the robustness of object detection models. Within the maritime domain, obtaining a diverse real image dataset is particularly challenging due to the difficulty of capturing sea images with the presence of maritime objects , especially in stormy conditions. These challenges arise due to resource limitations, in addition to the unpredictable appearance of maritime objects. Nevertheless, acquiring data from stormy conditions is essential for training effective maritime detection models, particularly for search and rescue, where real-world conditions can be unpredictable. In this work, we introduce SafeSea, which is a stepping stone towards transforming actual sea images with various Sea State backgrounds while retaining maritime objects. Compared to existing generative methods such as Stable Diffusion Inpainting~\\cite{stableDiffusion}, this approach reduces the time and effort required to create synthetic datasets for training maritime object detection models. The proposed method uses two automated filters to only pass generated images that meet the criteria. In particular, these filters will first classify the sea condition according to its Sea State level and then it will check whether the objects from the input image are still preserved. This method enabled the creation of the SafeSea dataset, offering diverse weather condition backgrounds to supplement the training of maritime models. Lastly, we observed that a maritime object detection model faced challenges in detecting objects in stormy sea backgrounds, emphasizing the impact of weather conditions on detection accuracy.

    "title": "Pseudo-label Correction for Instance-dependent Noise Using Teacher-student Framework",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The high capacity of deep learning models to learn complex patterns poses a significant challenge when confronted with label noise. The inability to differentiate clean and noisy labels ultimately results in poor generalization. We approach this problem by reassigning the label for each image using a new teacher-student based framework termed P-LC (pseudo-label correction). Traditional teacher-student networks are composed of teacher and student classifiers for knowledge distillation. In our novel approach, we reconfigure the teacher network into a triple encoder, leveraging the triplet loss to establish a pseudo-label correction system. As the student generates pseudo labels for a set of given images, the teacher learns to choose between the initially assigned labels and the pseudo labels. Experiments on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and SVHN demonstrate P-LC's superior performance over existing state-of-the-art methods across all noise levels, most notably in high noise. In addition, we introduce a noise level estimation to help assess model performance and inform the need for additional data cleaning procedures",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "High-resolution image generation with Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has immense potential but, due to the enormous capital investment required for training, it is increasingly centralised to a few large corporations, and hidden behind paywalls. This paper aims to democratise high-resolution GenAI by advancing the frontier of high-resolution generation while remaining accessible to a broad audience. We demonstrate that existing Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) possess untapped potential for higher-resolution image generation. Our novel DemoFusion framework seamlessly extends open-source GenAI models, employing Progressive Upscaling, Skip Residual, and Dilated Sampling mechanisms to achieve higher-resolution image generation. The progressive nature of DemoFusion requires more passes, but the intermediate results can serve as \"previews\", facilitating rapid prompt iteration",

    "title": "Robust and Interpretable COVID-19 Diagnosis on Chest X-ray Images using Adversarial Training",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The novel 2019 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) global pandemic is a defining health crisis. Recent efforts have been increasingly directed towards achieving quick and accurate detection of COVID-19 across symptomatic patients to mitigate the intensity and spread of the disease. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms applied to chest X-ray (CXR) images have emerged as promising diagnostic tools, and previous work has demonstrated impressive classification performances. However, such methods have faced criticisms from physicians due to their black-box reasoning process and unpredictable nature. In contrast to professional radiologist diagnosis, AI systems often lack generalizability, explainability, and robustness in the clinical decision making process. In our work, we address these issues by first proposing an extensive baseline study, training and evaluating 21 convolutional neural network (CNN) models on a diverse set of 33,000+ CXR images to classify between healthy, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 pneumonia CXRs. Our resulting models achieved a 3-way classification accuracy, recall, and precision of up to 97.03\\%, 97.97\\%, and 99.95\\%, respectively. Next, we investigate the effectiveness of adversarial training on model robustness and explainability via Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) heatmaps. We find that adversarially trained models not only significantly outperform their standard counterparts on classifying perturbed images, but also yield saliency maps that 1) better specify clinically relevant features, 2) are robust against extraneous artifacts, and 3) agree considerably more with expert radiologist findings",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The ability to detect manipulation in multimedia data is vital in digital forensics. Existing Image Manipulation Detection (IMD) methods are mainly based on detecting anomalous features arisen from image editing or double compression artifacts. All existing IMD techniques encounter challenges when it comes to detecting small tampered regions from a large image. Moreover, compression-based IMD approaches face difficulties in cases of double compression of identical quality factors. To investigate the State-of-The-Art (SoTA) IMD methods in those challenging conditions, we introduce a new Challenging Image Manipulation Detection (CIMD) benchmark dataset, which consists of two subsets, for evaluating editing-based and compression-based IMD methods, respectively. The dataset images were manually taken and tampered with high-quality annotations. In addition, we propose a new two-branch network model based on HRNet that can better detect both the image-editing and compression artifacts in those challenging conditions. Extensive experiments on the CIMD benchmark show that our model significantly outperforms SoTA IMD methods on CIMD",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Explicit feature-grid based NeRF models have shown promising results in terms of rendering quality and significant speed-up in training. However, these methods often require a significant amount of data to represent a single scene or object. In this work, we present a compression model that aims to minimize the entropy in the frequency domain in order to effectively reduce the data size. First, we propose using the discrete cosine transform (DCT) on the tensorial radiance fields to compress the feature-grid. This feature-grid is transformed into coefficients, which are then quantized and entropy encoded, following a similar approach to the traditional video coding pipeline. Furthermore, to achieve a higher level of sparsity, we propose using an entropy parameterization technique for the frequency domain, specifically for DCT coefficients of the feature-grid. Since the transformed coefficients are optimized during the training phase, the proposed model does not require any fine-tuning or additional information. Our model only requires a lightweight compression pipeline for encoding and decoding, making it easier to apply volumetric radiance field methods for real-world applications. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed frequency domain entropy model can achieve superior compression performance across various datasets.

    "abstract": "Radiology report generation (RRG) aims to automatically generate free-text descriptions from clinical radiographs, e.g., chest X-Ray images. RRG plays an essential role in promoting clinical automation and presents significant help to provide practical assistance for inexperienced doctors and alleviate radiologists' workloads. Therefore, consider these meaningful potentials, research on RRG is experiencing explosive growth in the past half-decade, especially with the rapid development of deep learning approaches. Existing studies perform RRG from the perspective of enhancing different modalities, provide insights on optimizing the report generation process with elaborated features from both visual and textual information, and further facilitate RRG with the cross-modal interactions among them. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of deep learning-based RRG from various perspectives. Specifically, we firstly cover pivotal RRG approaches based on the task-specific features of radiographs, reports, and the cross-modal relations between them, and then illustrate the benchmark datasets conventionally used for this task with evaluation metrics, subsequently analyze the performance of different approaches and finally offer our summary on the challenges and the trends in future directions. Overall, the goal of this paper is to serve as a tool for understanding existing literature and inspiring potential valuable research in the field of RRG",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI) is a common and challenging condition to diagnose accurately. Timely and precise diagnosis is essential for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes. Traditional diagnostic methods for mTBI often have limitations in terms of accuracy and sensitivity. In this study, we introduce an innovative approach to enhance mTBI diagnosis using 3D Computed Tomography (CT) images and a metric learning technique trained with triplet loss. To address these challenges, we propose a Residual Triplet Convolutional Neural Network (RTCNN) model to distinguish between mTBI cases and healthy ones by embedding 3D CT scans into a feature space. The triplet loss function maximizes the margin between similar and dissimilar image pairs, optimizing feature representations. This facilitates better context placement of individual cases, aids informed decision-making, and has the potential to improve patient outcomes. Our RTCNN model shows promising performance in mTBI diagnosis, achieving an average accuracy of 94.3%, a sensitivity of 94.1%, and a specificity of 95.2%, as confirmed through a five-fold cross-validation. Importantly, when compared to the conventional Residual Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN) model, the RTCNN exhibits a significant improvement, showcasing a remarkable 22.5% increase in specificity, a notable 16.2% boost in accuracy, and an 11.3% enhancement in sensitivity. Moreover, RTCNN requires lower memory resources, making it not only highly effective but also resource-efficient in minimizing false positives while maximizing its diagnostic accuracy in distinguishing normal CT scans from mTBI cases. The quantitative performance metrics provided and utilization of occlusion sensitivity maps to visually explain the model's decision-making process further enhance the interpretability and transparency of our approach",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Reconstructing hand-held objects from a single RGB image without known 3D object templates, category prior, or depth information is a vital yet challenging problem in computer vision. In contrast to prior works that utilize deterministic modeling paradigms, which make it hard to account for the uncertainties introduced by hand- and self-occlusion, we employ a probabilistic point cloud denoising diffusion model to tackle the above challenge. In this work, we present Hand-Aware Conditional Diffusion for monocular hand-held object reconstruction (HACD), modeling the hand-object interaction in two aspects. First, we introduce hand-aware conditioning to model hand-object interaction from both semantic and geometric perspectives. Specifically, a unified hand-object semantic embedding compensates for the 2D local feature deficiency induced by hand occlusion, and a hand articulation embedding further encodes the relationship between object vertices and hand joints. Second, we propose a hand-constrained centroid fixing scheme, which utilizes hand vertices priors to restrict the centroid deviation of partially denoised point cloud during diffusion and reverse process. Removing the centroid bias interference allows the diffusion models to focus on the reconstruction of shape, thus enhancing the stability and precision of local feature projection. Experiments on the synthetic ObMan dataset and two real-world datasets, HO3D and MOW, demonstrate our approach surpasses all existing methods by a large margin",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In the era of big data in scientific research, there is a necessity to leverage techniques which reduce human effort in labeling and categorizing large datasets by involving sophisticated machine tools. To combat this problem, we present a novel, general purpose model for 3D segmentation that leverages patch-wise adversariality and Long Short-Term Memory to encode sequential information. Using this model alongside citizen science projects which use 3D datasets (image cubes) on the Zooniverse platforms, we propose an iterative human-machine optimization framework where only a fraction of the 2D slices from these cubes are seen by the volunteers. We leverage the patch-wise discriminator in our model to provide an estimate of which slices within these image cubes have poorly generalized feature representations, and correspondingly poor machine performance. These images with corresponding machine proposals would be presented to volunteers on Zooniverse for correction, leading to a drastic reduction in the volunteer effort on citizen science projects. We trained our model on ~2300 liver tissue 3D electron micrographs. Lipid droplets were segmented within these images through human annotation via the `Etch A Cell - Fat Checker' citizen science project, hosted on the Zooniverse platform. In this work, we demonstrate this framework and the selection methodology which resulted in a measured reduction in volunteer effort by more than 60%. We envision this type of joint human-machine partnership will be of great use on future Zooniverse projects",

We approach this problem using artificial neural networks and build a modular system estimating gaze from separately cropped eyes, taking advantage of existing well-functioning components for face detection (RetinaFace) and head pose estimation (6DRepNet). Our proposed method does not require any special hardware or infrared filters but uses a standard notebook-builtin RGB camera, as often approached with appearance-based methods. Using the MetaHuman tool, we also generated a large synthetic dataset of more than 57,000 human faces and made it publicly available. The inclusion of this dataset (with eye gaze and head pose information) on top of the standard Columbia Gaze dataset into training the model led to better accuracy with a mean average error below two degrees in eye pitch and yaw directions, which compares favourably to related methods.

GigaPose first leverages discriminative templates, rendered images of the CAD models, to recover the out-of-plane rotation and then uses patch correspondences to estimate the four remaining parameters. Our approach samples templates in only a two-degrees-of-freedom space instead of the usual three and matches the input image to the templates using fast nearest neighbor search in feature space, results in a speedup factor of 38x compared to the state of the art. Moreover, GigaPose is significantly more robust to segmentation errors. Our extensive evaluation on the seven core datasets of the BOP challenge demonstrates that it achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and can be seamlessly integrated with a refinement method. Additionally, we show the potential of GigaPose with 3D models predicted by recent work on 3D reconstruction from a single image, relaxing the need for CAD models and making 6D pose object estimation much more convenient.

For semantic segmentation, state-of-the-art models jointly use two criteria of uncertainty and diversity to select training labels, combined with a pixel-wise acquisition strategy. However, we show that such methods currently suffer from a class imbalance issue which degrades their performance for larger active learning budgets. We then introduce Class Balanced Dynamic Acquisition (CBDA), a novel active learning method that mitigates this issue, especially in high-budget regimes. The more balanced labels increase minority class performance, which in turn allows the model to outperform the previous baseline by 0.6, 1.7, and 2.4 mIoU for budgets of 5%, 10%, and 20%, respectively. Additionally, the focus on minority classes leads to improvements of the minimum class performance of 0.5, 2.9, and 4.6 IoU respectively. The top-performing model even exceeds the fully supervised baseline, showing that a more balanced label than the entire ground truth can be beneficial",

    "abstract": "Though diffusion models excel in image generation, their step-by-step denoising leads to slow generation speeds. Consistency training addresses this issue with single-step sampling but often produces lower-quality generations and requires high training costs. In this paper, we show that optimizing consistency training loss minimizes the Wasserstein distance between target and generated distributions. As timestep increases, the upper bound accumulates previous consistency training losses. Therefore, larger batch sizes are needed to reduce both current and accumulated losses. We propose Adversarial Consistency Training (ACT), which directly minimizes the Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence between distributions at each timestep using a discriminator. Theoretically, ACT enhances generation quality, and convergence. By incorporating a discriminator into the consistency training framework, our method achieves improved FID scores on CIFAR10 and ImageNet 64$\\times$64, retains zero-shot image inpainting capabilities, and uses less than $1/6$ of the original batch size and fewer than $1/2$ of the model parameters and training steps compared to the baseline method, this leads to a substantial reduction in resource consumption",

    "abstract": "Accounting for the increased concern for public safety, automatic abnormal event detection and recognition in a surveillance scene is crucial. It is a current open study subject because of its intricacy and utility. The identification of aberrant events automatically, it's a difficult undertaking because everyone's idea of abnormality is different. A typical occurrence in one circumstance could be seen as aberrant in another. Automatic anomaly identification becomes particularly challenging in the surveillance footage with a large crowd due to congestion and high occlusion. With the use of machine learning techniques, this thesis study aims to offer the solution for this use case so that human resources won't be required to keep an eye out for any unusual activity in the surveillance system records. We have developed a novel generative adversarial network (GAN) based anomaly detection model. This model is trained such that it learns together about constructing a high dimensional picture space and determining the latent space from the video's context. The generator uses a residual Autoencoder architecture made up of a multi-stage channel attention-based decoder and a two-stream, deep convolutional encoder that can realise both spatial and temporal data. We have also offered a technique for refining the GAN model that reduces training time while also generalising the model by utilising transfer learning between datasets. Using a variety of assessment measures, we compare our model to the current state-of-the-art techniques on four benchmark datasets.

    "abstract": "Class-wise characteristics of training examples affect the performance of deep classifiers. A well-studied example is when the number of training examples of classes follows a long-tailed distribution, a situation that is likely to yield sub-optimal performance for under-represented classes. This class imbalance problem is conventionally addressed by approaches relying on the class-wise cardinality of training examples, such as data resampling. In this paper, we demonstrate that considering solely the cardinality of classes does not cover all issues causing class imbalance. To measure class imbalance, we propose \"Class Uncertainty\" as the average predictive uncertainty of the training examples, and we show that this novel measure captures the differences across classes better than cardinality. We also curate SVCI-20 as a novel dataset in which the classes have equal number of training examples but they differ in terms of their hardness; thereby causing a type of class imbalance which cannot be addressed by the approaches relying on cardinality. We incorporate our \"Class Uncertainty\" measure into a diverse set of ten class imbalance mitigation methods to demonstrate its effectiveness on long-tailed datasets as well as on our SVCI-20.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In clinical practice, we often see significant delays between MRI scans and the diagnosis made by radiologists, even for severe cases. In some cases, this may be caused by the lack of additional information and clues, so even the severe cases need to wait in the queue for diagnosis. This can be avoided if there is an automatic software tool, which would supplement additional information, alerting radiologists that the particular patient may be a severe case. We are presenting an automatic brain MRI Screening Tool and we are demonstrating its capabilities for detecting tumor-like pathologies. It is the first version on the path toward a robust multi-pathology screening solution. The tool supports Federated Learning, so multiple institutions may contribute to the model without disclosing their private data",

    "title": "AI-Generated Images Introduce Invisible Relevance Bias to Text-Image Retrieval",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "With the advancement of generation models, AI-generated content (AIGC) is becoming more realistic, flooding the Internet. A recent study suggests that this phenomenon has elevated the issue of source bias in text retrieval for web searches. Specifically, neural retrieval models tend to rank generated texts higher than human-written texts. In this paper, we extend the study of this bias to cross-modal retrieval. Firstly, we successfully construct a suitable benchmark to explore the existence of the bias. Subsequent extensive experiments on this benchmark reveal that AI-generated images introduce an invisible relevance bias to text-image retrieval models. Specifically, our experiments show that text-image retrieval models tend to rank the AI-generated images higher than the real images, even though the AI-generated images do not exhibit more visually relevant features to the query than real images. This invisible relevance bias is prevalent across retrieval models with varying training data and architectures. Furthermore, our subsequent exploration reveals that the inclusion of AI-generated images in the training data of the retrieval models exacerbates the invisible relevance bias. The above phenomenon triggers a vicious cycle, which makes the invisible relevance bias become more and more serious. To elucidate the potential causes of invisible relevance and address the aforementioned issues, we introduce an effective training method aimed at alleviating the invisible relevance bias. Subsequently, we apply our proposed debiasing method to retroactively identify the causes of invisible relevance, revealing that the AI-generated images induce the image encoder to embed additional information into their representation. This information exhibits a certain consistency across generated images with different semantics and can make the retriever estimate a higher relevance score",

    "title": "SinSR: Diffusion-Based Image Super-Resolution in a Single Step",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "While super-resolution (SR) methods based on diffusion models exhibit promising results, their practical application is hindered by the substantial number of required inference steps. Recent methods utilize degraded images in the initial state, thereby shortening the Markov chain. Nevertheless, these solutions either rely on a precise formulation of the degradation process or still necessitate a relatively lengthy generation path (e.g., 15 iterations). To enhance inference speed, we propose a simple yet effective method for achieving single-step SR generation, named SinSR. Specifically, we first derive a deterministic sampling process from the most recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) method for accelerating diffusion-based SR. This allows the mapping between the input random noise and the generated high-resolution image to be obtained in a reduced and acceptable number of inference steps during training. We show that this deterministic mapping can be distilled into a student model that performs SR within only one inference step. Additionally, we propose a novel consistency-preserving loss to simultaneously leverage the ground-truth image during the distillation process, ensuring that the performance of the student model is not solely bound by the feature manifold of the teacher model, resulting in further performance improvement. Extensive experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve comparable or even superior performance compared to both previous SOTA methods and the teacher model, in just one sampling step, resulting in a remarkable up to x10 speedup for inference.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "With the rapidly increasing demand for oriented object detection (OOD), recent research involving weakly-supervised detectors for learning rotated box (RBox) from the horizontal box (HBox) has attracted more and more attention. In this paper, we explore a more challenging yet label-efficient setting, namely single point-supervised OOD, and present our approach called Point2RBox. Specifically, we propose to leverage two principles: 1) Synthetic pattern knowledge combination: By sampling around each labelled point on the image, we transfer the object feature to synthetic visual patterns with the known bounding box to provide the knowledge for box regression. 2) Transform self-supervision: With a transformed input image (e.g. scaled/rotated), the output RBoxes are trained to follow the same transformation so that the network can perceive the relative size/rotation between objects. The detector is further enhanced by a few devised techniques to cope with peripheral issues, e.g. the anchor/layer assignment as the size of the object is not available in our point supervision setting. To our best knowledge, Point2RBox is the first end-to-end solution for point-supervised OOD. In particular, our method uses a lightweight paradigm, yet it achieves a competitive performance among point-supervised alternatives, 41.05%/27.62%/80.01% on DOTA/DIOR/HRSC datasets",

    "abstract": "Single point-supervised object detection is gaining attention due to its cost-effectiveness. However, existing approaches focus on generating horizontal bounding boxes (HBBs) while ignoring oriented bounding boxes (OBBs) commonly used for objects in aerial images. This paper proposes PointOBB, the first single Point-based OBB generation method, for oriented object detection. PointOBB operates through the collaborative utilization of three distinctive views: an original view, a resized view, and a rotated/flipped (rot/flp) view. Upon the original view, we leverage the resized and rot/flp views to build a scale augmentation module and an angle acquisition module, respectively. In the former module, a Scale-Sensitive Consistency (SSC) loss is designed to enhance the deep network's ability to perceive the object scale. For accurate object angle predictions, the latter module incorporates self-supervised learning to predict angles, which is associated with a scale-guided Dense-to-Sparse (DS) matching strategy for aggregating dense angles corresponding to sparse objects. The resized and rot/flp views are switched using a progressive multi-view switching strategy during training to achieve coupled optimization of scale and angle. Experimental results on the DIOR-R and DOTA-v1.0 datasets demonstrate that PointOBB achieves promising performance, and significantly outperforms potential point-supervised baselines",

We show that at particular training intervals, DPMs can generate images with novel feature combinations, even when trained on images displaying correlated input features. We leverage this crucial property to generate synthetic counterfactuals to increase model diversity via ensemble disagreement. We show that DPM-guided diversification is sufficient to remove dependence on primary shortcut cues, without a need for additional supervised signals. We further empirically quantify its efficacy on several diversification objectives, and finally show improved generalization and diversification performance on par with prior work that relies on auxiliary data collection",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Object categories are typically organized into a multi-granularity taxonomic hierarchy. When classifying categories at different hierarchy levels, traditional uni-modal approaches focus primarily on image features, revealing limitations in complex scenarios. Recent studies integrating Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with class hierarchies have shown promise, yet they fall short of fully exploiting the hierarchical relationships. These efforts are constrained by their inability to perform effectively across varied granularity of categories. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel framework (HGCLIP) that effectively combines CLIP with a deeper exploitation of the Hierarchical class structure via Graph representation learning. We explore constructing the class hierarchy into a graph, with its nodes representing the textual or image features of each category. After passing through a graph encoder, the textual features incorporate hierarchical structure information, while the image features emphasize class-aware features derived from prototypes through the attention mechanism.

To alleviate this issue, we build a new VSR test set named WildVSR, by closely following the LRS3 dataset creation processes. We then evaluate and analyse the extent to which the current VSR models generalize to the new test data. We evaluate a broad range of publicly available VSR models and find significant drops in performance on our test set, compared to their corresponding LRS3 results. Our results suggest that the increase in word error rates is caused by the models inability to generalize to slightly harder and in the wild lip sequences than those found in the LRS3 test set.

    "abstract": "In recent years, a variety of deep learning networks for cardiac MRI (CMR) segmentation have been developed and analyzed. However, nearly all of them are focused on cine CMR under breathold. In this work, accuracy of deep learning methods is assessed for volumetric analysis (via segmentation) of the left ventricle in real-time free-breathing CMR at rest and under exercise stress. Data from healthy volunteers (n=15) for cine and real-time free-breathing CMR were analyzed retrospectively. Segmentations of a commercial software (comDL) and a freely available neural network (nnU-Net), were compared to a reference created via the manual correction of comDL segmentation. Segmentation of left ventricular endocardium (LV), left ventricular myocardium (MYO), and right ventricle (RV) is evaluated for both end-systolic and end-diastolic phases and analyzed with Dice's coefficient (DC). The volumetric analysis includes LV end-diastolic volume (EDV), LV end-systolic volume (ESV), and LV ejection fraction (EF). For cine CMR, nnU-Net and comDL achieve a DC above 0.95 for LV and 0.9 for MYO, and RV. For real-time CMR, the accuracy of nnU-Net exceeds that of comDL overall. For real-time CMR at rest, nnU-Net achieves a DC of 0.94 for LV, 0.89 for MYO, and 0.90 for RV; mean absolute differences between nnU-Net and reference are 2.9mL for EDV, 3.5mL for ESV and 2.6% for EF. For real-time CMR under exercise stress, nnU-Net achieves a DC of 0.92 for LV, 0.85 for MYO, and 0.83 for RV; mean absolute differences between nnU-Net and reference are 11.4mL for EDV, 2.9mL for ESV and 3.6% for EF. Deep learning methods designed or trained for cine CMR segmentation can perform well on real-time CMR. For real-time free-breathing CMR at rest, the performance of deep learning methods is comparable to inter-observer variability in cine CMR and is usable or fully automatic segmentation",

One potentially suitable approach is generative replay, where a copy of a generative model trained on previous tasks produces synthetic data that are interleaved with data from the current task. However, standard generative replay applied to diffusion models results in a catastrophic loss in denoising capabilities.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Cloud formations often obscure optical satellite-based monitoring of the Earth's surface, thus limiting Earth observation (EO) activities such as land cover mapping, ocean color analysis, and cropland monitoring. The integration of machine learning (ML) methods within the remote sensing domain has significantly improved performance on a wide range of EO tasks, including cloud detection and filtering, but there is still much room for improvement. A key bottleneck is that ML methods typically depend on large amounts of annotated data for training, which is often difficult to come by in EO contexts. This is especially true for the task of cloud optical thickness (COT) estimation. A reliable estimation of COT enables more fine-grained and application-dependent control compared to using pre-specified cloud categories, as is commonly done in practice. To alleviate the COT data scarcity problem, in this work we propose a novel synthetic dataset for COT estimation, where top-of-atmosphere radiances have been simulated for 12 of the spectral bands of the Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) sensor onboard Sentinel-2 platforms. These data points have been simulated under consideration of different cloud types, COTs, and ground surface and atmospheric profiles. Extensive experimentation of training several ML models to predict COT from the measured reflectivity of the spectral bands demonstrates the usefulness of our proposed dataset. Generalization to real data is also demonstrated on two satellite image datasets -- one that is publicly available, and one which we have collected and annotated.

One of the primary reasons for this is the use of computationally expensive metric learning loss functions such as Triplet Loss in Siamese networks. In this paper, we present a novel loss function called Shadow Loss that compresses the dimensions of an embedding space during loss calculation without loss of performance. The distance between the projections of the embeddings is learned from inputs on a compact projection space where distances directly correspond to a measure of class similarity. Projecting on a lower-dimension projection space, our loss function converges faster, and the resulting classified image clusters have higher inter-class and smaller intra-class distances. Shadow Loss not only reduces embedding dimensions favoring memory constraint devices but also consistently performs better than the state-of-the-art Triplet Margin Loss by an accuracy of 5\\%-10\\% across diverse datasets. The proposed loss function is also model agnostic, upholding its performance across several tested models. Its effectiveness and robustness across balanced, imbalanced, medical, and non-medical image datasets suggests that it is not specific to a particular model or dataset but demonstrates superior performance consistently while using less memory and computation",

    "abstract": "Detailed population maps play an important role in diverse fields ranging from humanitarian action to urban planning. Generating such maps in a timely and scalable manner presents a challenge, especially in data-scarce regions. To address it we have developed POPCORN, a population mapping method whose only inputs are free, globally available satellite images from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2; and a small number of aggregate population counts over coarse census districts for calibration. Despite the minimal data requirements our approach surpasses the mapping accuracy of existing schemes, including several that rely on building footprints derived from high-resolution imagery. E.g., we were able to produce population maps for Rwanda with 100m GSD based on less than 400 regional census counts. In Kigali, those maps reach an $R^2$ score of 66% w.r.t. a ground truth reference map, with an average error of only $\\pm$10 inhabitants/ha. Conveniently, POPCORN retrieves explicit maps of built-up areas and of local building occupancy rates, making the mapping process interpretable and offering additional insights, for instance about the distribution of built-up, but unpopulated areas, e.g., industrial warehouses. Moreover, we find that, once trained, the model can be applied repeatedly to track population changes; and that it can be transferred to geographically similar regions, e.g., from Uganda to Rwanda). With our work we aim to democratize access to up-to-date and high-resolution population maps, recognizing that some regions faced with particularly strong population dynamics may lack the resources for costly micro-census campaigns",

On the other hand, our proposed solution, GRJointNet, is an architecture that can perform joint completion and segmentation on point clouds as a successor of GRNet. Features extracted for the two tasks are also utilized by each other to increase the overall performance. We evaluated our proposed network on the ShapeNet-Part dataset and compared its performance to GRNet. Our results demonstrate GRJointNet can outperform GRNet on point completion. It should also be noted that GRNet is not capable of segmentation while GRJointNet is. This study1, therefore, holds a promise to enhance practicality and utility of point clouds in 3D vision for autonomous systems",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Information Extraction (IE) from document images is challenging due to the high variability of layout formats. Deep models such as LayoutLM and BROS have been proposed to address this problem and have shown promising results. However, they still require a large amount of field-level annotations for training these models. Other approaches using rule-based methods have also been proposed based on the understanding of the layout and semantics of a form such as geometric position, or type of the fields, etc. In this work, we propose a novel approach, EIGEN (Expert-Informed Joint Learning aGgrEatioN), which combines rule-based methods with deep learning models using data programming approaches to circumvent the requirement of annotation of large amounts of training data. Specifically, EIGEN consolidates weak labels induced from multiple heuristics through generative models and use them along with a small number of annotated labels to jointly train a deep model. In our framework, we propose the use of labeling functions that include incorporating contextual information thus capturing the visual and language context of a word for accurate categorization. We empirically show that our EIGEN framework can significantly improve the performance of state-of-the-art deep models with the availability of very few labeled data instances.

    "title": "Low Latency Instance Segmentation by Continuous Clustering for Rotating LiDAR Sensors",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Low-latency instance segmentation of LiDAR point clouds is crucial in real-world applications because it serves as an initial and frequently-used building block in a robot's perception pipeline, where every task adds further delay. Particularly in dynamic environments, this total delay can result in significant positional offsets of dynamic objects, as seen in highway scenarios. To address this issue, we employ continuous clustering of obstacle points in order to obtain an instance-segmented point cloud. Unlike most existing approaches, which use a full revolution of the LiDAR sensor, we process the data stream in a continuous and seamless fashion. More specifically, each column of a range image is processed as soon it is available. Obstacle points are clustered to existing instances in real-time and it is checked at a high-frequency which instances are completed and are ready to be published. An additional advantage is that no problematic discontinuities between the points of the start and the end of a scan are observed. In this work we describe the two-layered data structure and the corresponding algorithm for continuous clustering, which is able to cluster the incoming data in real time. We explain the importance of a large perceptive field of view. Furthermore, we describe and evaluate important architectural design choices, which could be relevant to design an architecture for deep learning based low-latency instance segmentation.

In recent years, deep learning-based approaches have propelled results to a new level causing a rapid growth in the field with 121 methods proposed in the medical imaging domain alone. In this review, we provide a structured overview of this emerging field featuring a comprehensive taxonomy, a systematic review of existing methods, and an in-depth analysis of current practices.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Purpose: To develop and assess a deep learning (DL) pipeline to learn dynamic MR image reconstruction from publicly available natural videos (Inter4K). Materials and Methods: Learning was performed for a range of DL architectures (VarNet, 3D UNet, FastDVDNet) and corresponding sampling patterns (Cartesian, radial, spiral) either from true multi-coil cardiac MR data (N=692) or from pseudo-MR data simulated from Inter4K natural videos (N=692). Real-time undersampled dynamic MR images were reconstructed using DL networks trained with cardiac data and natural videos, and compressed sensing (CS). Differences were assessed in simulations (N=104 datasets) in terms of MSE, PSNR, and SSIM and prospectively for cardiac (short axis, four chambers, N=20) and speech (N=10) data in terms of subjective image quality ranking, SNR and Edge sharpness. Friedman Chi Square tests with post-hoc Nemenyi analysis were performed to assess statistical significance. Results: For all simulation metrics, DL networks trained with cardiac data outperformed DL networks trained with natural videos, which outperformed CS (p<0.05). However, in prospective experiments DL reconstructions using both training datasets were ranked similarly (and higher than CS) and presented no statistical differences in SNR and Edge Sharpness for most conditions. Additionally, high SSIM was measured between the DL methods with cardiac data and natural videos (SSIM>0.85). Conclusion: The developed pipeline enabled learning dynamic MR reconstruction from natural videos preserving DL reconstruction advantages such as high quality fast and ultra-fast reconstructions while overcoming some limitations (data scarcity or sharing). The natural video dataset, code and pre-trained networks are made readily available on github. Key Words: real-time; dynamic MRI; deep learning; image reconstruction; machine learning;",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The task of out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for deploying machine learning models in real-world settings. In this paper, we observe that the singular value distributions of the in-distribution (ID) and OOD features are quite different: the OOD feature matrix tends to have a larger dominant singular value than the ID feature, and the class predictions of OOD samples are largely determined by it. This observation motivates us to propose \\texttt{RankFeat}, a simple yet effective \\emph{post hoc} approach for OOD detection by removing the rank-1 matrix composed of the largest singular value and the associated singular vectors from the high-level feature. \\texttt{RankFeat} achieves \\emph{state-of-the-art} performance and reduces the average false positive rate (FPR95) by 17.90\\% compared with the previous best method. The success of \\texttt{RankFeat} motivates us to investigate whether a similar phenomenon would exist in the parameter matrices of neural networks. We thus propose \\texttt{RankWeight} which removes the rank-1 weight from the parameter matrices of a single deep layer. Our \\texttt{RankWeight}is also \\emph{post hoc} and only requires computing the rank-1 matrix once. As a standalone approach, \\texttt{RankWeight} has very competitive performance against other methods across various backbones. Moreover, \\texttt{RankWeight} enjoys flexible compatibility with a wide range of OOD detection methods. The combination of \\texttt{RankWeight} and \\texttt{RankFeat} refreshes the new \\emph{state-of-the-art} performance, achieving the FPR95 as low as 16.13\\% on the ImageNet-1k benchmark. Extensive ablation studies and comprehensive theoretical analyses are presented to support the empirical results",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Recently, numerous tensor SVD (t-SVD)-based tensor recovery methods have emerged, showing promise in processing visual data. However, these methods often suffer from performance degradation when confronted with high-order tensor data exhibiting non-smooth changes, commonly observed in real-world scenarios but ignored by the traditional t-SVD-based methods. Our objective in this study is to provide an effective tensor recovery technique for handling non-smooth changes in tensor data and efficiently explore the correlations of high-order tensor data across its various dimensions without introducing numerous variables and weights. To this end, we introduce a new tensor decomposition and a new tensor norm called the Tensor $U_1$ norm. We utilize these novel techniques in solving the problem of high-order tensor completion problem and provide theoretical guarantees for the exact recovery of the resulting tensor completion models. An optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the resulting tensor completion model iteratively by combining the proximal algorithm with the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers. Theoretical analysis showed the convergence of the algorithm to the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point of the optimization problem. Numerical experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method in high-order tensor completion, especially for tensor data with non-smooth changes",

In addition, a device that captures the ENF directly from power mains is implemented. This device serves as a ground truth ENF collector. Video recordings captured by a camera are also employed to estimate the ENF. The camera serves as a second optical sensor. The factors affecting the ENF estimation are thoroughly studied. The maximum correlation coefficient between the ENF estimated by the two optical sensors and that estimated directly from power mains is used to measure the estimation accuracy.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The improvement in the performance of efficient and lightweight models (i.e., the student model) is achieved through knowledge distillation (KD), which involves transferring knowledge from more complex models (i.e., the teacher model). However, most existing KD techniques rely on Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, which has certain limitations. First, if the teacher distribution has high entropy, the KL divergence's mode-averaging nature hinders the transfer of sufficient target information. Second, when the teacher distribution has low entropy, the KL divergence tends to excessively focus on specific modes, which fails to convey an abundant amount of valuable knowledge to the student. Consequently, when dealing with datasets that contain numerous confounding or challenging samples, student models may struggle to acquire sufficient knowledge, resulting in subpar performance. Furthermore, in previous KD approaches, we observed that data augmentation, a technique aimed at enhancing a model's generalization, can have an adverse impact. Therefore, we propose a Robustness-Reinforced Knowledge Distillation (R2KD) that leverages correlation distance and network pruning. This approach enables KD to effectively incorporate data augmentation for performance improvement.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Source-free object detection (SFOD) aims to adapt the source detector to unlabeled target domain data in the absence of source domain data. Most SFOD methods follow the same self-training paradigm using mean-teacher (MT) framework where the student model is guided by only one single teacher model. However, such paradigm can easily fall into a training instability problem that when the teacher model collapses uncontrollably due to the domain shift, the student model also suffers drastic performance degradation. To address this issue, we propose the Periodically Exchange Teacher-Student (PETS) method, a simple yet novel approach that introduces a multiple-teacher framework consisting of a static teacher, a dynamic teacher, and a student model. During the training phase, we periodically exchange the weights between the static teacher and the student model. Then, we update the dynamic teacher using the moving average of the student model that has already been exchanged by the static teacher. In this way, the dynamic teacher can integrate knowledge from past periods, effectively reducing error accumulation and enabling a more stable training process within the MT-based framework. Further, we develop a consensus mechanism to merge the predictions of two teacher models to provide higher-quality pseudo labels for student model. Extensive experiments on multiple SFOD benchmarks show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with other related methods, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of our method on SFOD task",

    "abstract": "Generalized Zero-shot Learning (GZSL) has yielded remarkable performance by designing a series of unbiased visual-semantics mappings, wherein, the precision relies heavily on the completeness of extracted visual features from both seen and unseen classes. However, as a common practice in GZSL, the pre-trained feature extractor may easily exhibit difficulty in capturing domain-specific traits of the downstream tasks/datasets to provide fine-grained discriminative features, i.e., domain bias, which hinders the overall recognition performance, especially for unseen classes. Recent studies partially address this issue by fine-tuning feature extractors, while may inevitably incur catastrophic forgetting and overfitting issues. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective Attribute-Aware Representation Rectification framework for GZSL, dubbed $\\mathbf{(AR)^{2}}$, to adaptively rectify the feature extractor to learn novel features while keeping original valuable features. Specifically, our method consists of two key components, i.e., Unseen-Aware Distillation (UAD) and Attribute-Guided Learning (AGL). During training, UAD exploits the prior knowledge of attribute texts that are shared by both seen/unseen classes with attention mechanisms to detect and maintain unseen class-sensitive visual features in a targeted manner, and meanwhile, AGL aims to steer the model to focus on valuable features and suppress them to fit noisy elements in the seen classes by attribute-guided representation learning.

    "abstract": "Predicting individual aesthetic preferences holds significant practical applications and academic implications for human society. However, existing studies mainly focus on learning and predicting the commonality of facial attractiveness, with little attention given to Personalized Facial Beauty Prediction (PFBP). PFBP aims to develop a machine that can adapt to individual aesthetic preferences with only a few images rated by each user. In this paper, we formulate this task from a meta-learning perspective that each user corresponds to a meta-task. To address such PFBP task, we draw inspiration from the human aesthetic mechanism that visual aesthetics in society follows a Gaussian distribution, which motivates us to disentangle user preferences into a commonality and an individuality part. To this end, we propose a novel MetaFBP framework, in which we devise a universal feature extractor to capture the aesthetic commonality and then optimize to adapt the aesthetic individuality by shifting the decision boundary of the predictor via a meta-learning mechanism. Unlike conventional meta-learning methods that may struggle with slow adaptation or overfitting to tiny support sets, we propose a novel approach that optimizes a high-order predictor for fast adaptation. In order to validate the performance of the proposed method, we build several PFBP benchmarks by using existing facial beauty prediction datasets rated by numerous users. Extensive experiments on these benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MetaFBP method",

    "title": "Parameter Exchange for Robust Dynamic Domain Generalization",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Agnostic domain shift is the main reason of model degradation on the unknown target domains, which brings an urgent need to develop Domain Generalization (DG). Recent advances at DG use dynamic networks to achieve training-free adaptation on the unknown target domains, termed Dynamic Domain Generalization (DDG), which compensates for the lack of self-adaptability in static models with fixed weights. The parameters of dynamic networks can be decoupled into a static and a dynamic component, which are designed to learn domain-invariant and domain-specific features, respectively. Based on the existing arts, in this work, we try to push the limits of DDG by disentangling the static and dynamic components more thoroughly from an optimization perspective. Our main consideration is that we can enable the static component to learn domain-invariant features more comprehensively by augmenting the domain-specific information. As a result, the more comprehensive domain-invariant features learned by the static component can then enforce the dynamic component to focus more on learning adaptive domain-specific features. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective Parameter Exchange (PE) method to perturb the combination between the static and dynamic components. We optimize the model using the gradients from both the perturbed and non-perturbed feed-forward jointly to implicitly achieve the aforementioned disentanglement. In this way, the two components can be optimized in a mutually-beneficial manner, which can resist the agnostic domain shifts and improve the self-adaptability on the unknown target domain. Extensive experiments show that PE can be easily plugged into existing dynamic networks to improve their generalization ability without bells and whistles",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the global economy and people's daily lives in unprecedented ways. To make appropriate decisions, it is necessary to diagnose COVID-19 rapidly and accurately. Clinical decision making is influenced by data collected from patients. With the aid of artificial intelligence, COVID-19 has been diagnosed quickly by analyzing symptoms, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), computed tomography scans, chest X-rays, routine laboratory blood tests and even cough sounds. Furthermore, these data can be used to predict a patient's morality, although there is a question about which data makes the most accurate predictions. Therefore, this study consists of two parts. Our first objective is to examine whether machine learning algorithms can predict the outcome of COVID-19 cases (recovery or death), based on the features present in the dataset. In the second part of the research, we investigated the impact of clinical and RT-PCR on prediction of recovery and decease to determine which one is more reliable. We defined four stages with different feature sets and use six machine learning methods to build prediction model. With an accuracy of 78.7%, random forest showed promising results for predicting death and recovery of patients. Based on this, it appears that recovery and decease of patients are predictable using machine learning. For second objective, results indicate that clinical alone (without using RT-PCR), trained with AdaBoost algorithm, is the most accurate with an accuracy of 82.1%. This study can provide guidance for medical professionals in the event of a crisis or outbreak similar to COVID-19",

    "abstract": "Hyper-trabeculation or non-compaction in the left ventricle of the myocardium (LVNC) is a recently classified form of cardiomyopathy. Several methods have been proposed to quantify the trabeculae accurately in the left ventricle, but there is no general agreement in the medical community to use a particular approach. In previous work, we proposed DL-LVTQ, a deep learning approach for left ventricular trabecular quantification based on a U-Net CNN architecture. DL-LVTQ was an automatic diagnosis tool developed from a dataset of patients with the same cardiomyopathy (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). In this work, we have extended and adapted DL-LVTQ to cope with patients with different cardiomyopathies. The dataset consists of up 379 patients in three groups with different particularities and cardiomyopathies. Patient images were taken from different scanners and hospitals. We have modified and adapted the U-Net convolutional neural network to account for the different particularities of a heterogeneous group of patients with various unclassifiable or mixed and inherited cardiomyopathies. The inclusion of new groups of patients has increased the accuracy, specificity and kappa values while maintaining the sensitivity of the automatic deep learning method proposed. Therefore, a better-prepared diagnosis tool is ready for various cardiomyopathies with different characteristics. Cardiologists have considered that 98.9% of the evaluated outputs are verified clinically for diagnosis. Therefore, the high precision to segment the different cardiac structures allows us to make a robust diagnostic system objective and faster, decreasing human error and time spent",

In current query-by-activity-video literature, a common assumption is that all activities have sufficient labelled examples when learning an embedding. This assumption does however practically not hold, as only a portion of activities have many examples, while other activities are only described by few examples. In this paper, we propose a visual-semantic embedding network that explicitly deals with the imbalanced scenario for activity retrieval. Our network contains two novel modules. The visual alignment module performs a global alignment between the input video and fixed-sized visual bank representations for all activities. The semantic module performs an alignment between the input video and fixed-sized semantic activity representations. By matching videos with both visual and semantic activity representations that are of equal size over all activities, we no longer ignore infrequent activities during retrieval.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Compositional zero-shot learning aims to recognize unseen state-object compositions by leveraging known primitives (state and object) during training. However, effectively modeling interactions between primitives and generalizing knowledge to novel compositions remains a perennial challenge. There are two key factors: object-conditioned and state-conditioned variance, i.e., the appearance of states (or objects) can vary significantly when combined with different objects (or states). For instance, the state \"old\" can signify a vintage design for a \"car\" or an advanced age for a \"cat\". In this paper, we argue that these variances can be mitigated by predicting composition categories based on pre-observed primitive. To this end, we propose Progressive Language-based Observations (PLO), which can dynamically determine a better observation order of primitives. These observations comprise a series of concepts or languages that allow the model to understand image content in a step-by-step manner. Specifically, PLO adopts pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to empower the model with observation capabilities. We further devise two variants: 1) PLO-VLM: a two-step method, where a pre-observing classifier dynamically determines the observation order of two primitives. 2) PLO-LLM: a multi-step scheme, which utilizes large language models (LLMs) to craft composition-specific prompts for step-by-step observing. Extensive ablations on three challenging datasets demonstrate the superiority of PLO compared with state-of-the-art methods, affirming its abilities in compositional recognition",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "A computationally-simplified and descriptor-richer Point Cloud Quality Assessment (PCQA) metric, namely PointPCA+, is proposed in this paper, which is an extension of PointPCA. PointPCA proposed a set of perceptually-relevant descriptors based on PCA decomposition that were applied to both the geometry and texture data of point clouds for full reference PCQA. PointPCA+ employs PCA only on the geometry data while enriching existing geometry and texture descriptors, that are computed more efficiently. Similarly to PointPCA, a total quality score is obtained through a learning-based fusion of individual predictions from geometry and texture descriptors that capture local shape and appearance properties, respectively. Before feature fusion, a feature selection module is introduced to choose the most effective features from a proposed super-set. Experimental results show that PointPCA+ achieves high predictive performance against subjective ground truth scores obtained from publicly available datasets.

But for few-shot semantic segmentation, the pixel-level annotations of support images are still expensive. In this paper, we propose an innovative solution to tackle the challenge of few-shot semantic segmentation using only language information, i.e.image-level text labels. Our approach involves a vision-language-driven mask distillation scheme, which contains a vision-language pretraining (VLP) model and a mask refiner, to generate high quality pseudo-semantic masks from text prompts. We additionally introduce a distributed prototype supervision method and complementary correlation matching module to guide the model in digging precise semantic relations among support and query images.

    "abstract": "The explosion of data has resulted in more and more associated text being transmitted along with images. Inspired by from distributed source coding, many works utilize image side information to enhance image compression. However, existing methods generally do not consider using text as side information to enhance perceptual compression of images, even though the benefits of multimodal synergy have been widely demonstrated in research. This begs the following question: How can we effectively transfer text-level semantic dependencies to help image compression, which is only available to the decoder? In this work, we propose a novel deep image compression method with text-guided side information to achieve a better rate-perception-distortion tradeoff. Specifically, we employ the CLIP text encoder and an effective Semantic-Spatial Aware block to fuse the text and image features. This is done by predicting a semantic mask to guide the learned text-adaptive affine transformation at the pixel level. Furthermore, we design a text-conditional generative adversarial networks to improve the perceptual quality of reconstructed images. Extensive experiments involving four datasets and ten image quality assessment metrics demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior results in terms of rate-perception trade-off and semantic distortion",

To ensure the network is more lightweight, we involves the integration of prompt networks with less convolutional layers. Exhaustive experiments show that compared to methods based on multiple models, which are optimized separately for different target rates, the proposed method arrives at the same performance with 80% savings in parameter storage and 90% savings in datasets.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Diffusion models have revolutionized generative content creation and text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models in particular have increased the creative freedom of users by allowing scene synthesis using natural language. T2I models excel at synthesizing concepts such as nouns, appearances, and styles. To enable customized content creation based on a few example images of a concept, methods such as Textual Inversion and DreamBooth invert the desired concept and enable synthesizing it in new scenes. However, inverting more general concepts that go beyond object appearance and style (adjectives and verbs) through natural language, remains a challenge. Two key characteristics of these concepts contribute to the limitations of current inversion methods. 1) Adjectives and verbs are entangled with nouns (subject) and can hinder appearance-based inversion methods, where the subject appearance leaks into the concept embedding and 2) describing such concepts often extends beyond single word embeddings (being frozen in ice, walking on a tightrope, etc.) that current methods do not handle. In this study, we introduce Lego, a textual inversion method designed to invert subject entangled concepts from a few example images. Lego disentangles concepts from their associated subjects using a simple yet effective Subject Separation step and employs a Context Loss that guides the inversion of single/multi-embedding concepts. In a thorough user study, Lego-generated concepts were preferred over 70% of the time when compared to the baseline. Additionally, visual question answering using a large language model suggested Lego-generated concepts are better aligned with the text description of the concept",

    "abstract": "Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) has emerged as an essential paradigm in machine learning, aiming to overcome the constraints of traditional zero-shot learning by incorporating compositional thinking into its methodology. Conventional zero-shot learning has difficulty managing unfamiliar combinations of seen and unseen classes because it depends on pre-defined class embeddings. In contrast, Compositional Zero-Shot Learning uses the inherent hierarchies and structural connections among classes, creating new class representations by combining attributes, components, or other semantic elements. In our paper, we propose a novel framework that for the first time combines the Modern Hopfield Network with a Mixture of Experts (HOMOE) to classify the compositions of previously unseen objects. Specifically, the Modern Hopfield Network creates a memory that stores label prototypes and identifies relevant labels for a given input image. Following this, the Mixture of Expert models integrates the image with the fitting prototype to produce the final composition classification.

    "abstract": "We introduce Posterior Distillation Sampling (PDS), a novel optimization method for parametric image editing based on diffusion models. Existing optimization-based methods, which leverage the powerful 2D prior of diffusion models to handle various parametric images, have mainly focused on generation. Unlike generation, editing requires a balance between conforming to the target attribute and preserving the identity of the source content. Recent 2D image editing methods have achieved this balance by leveraging the stochastic latent encoded in the generative process of diffusion models. To extend the editing capabilities of diffusion models shown in pixel space to parameter space, we reformulate the 2D image editing method into an optimization form named PDS. PDS matches the stochastic latents of the source and the target, enabling the sampling of targets in diverse parameter spaces that align with a desired attribute while maintaining the source's identity. We demonstrate that this optimization resembles running a generative process with the target attribute, but aligning this process with the trajectory of the source's generative process. Extensive editing results in Neural Radiance Fields and Scalable Vector Graphics representations demonstrate that PDS is capable of sampling targets to fulfill the aforementioned balance across various parameter spaces",

    "abstract": "Active recognition enables robots to intelligently explore novel observations, thereby acquiring more information while circumventing undesired viewing conditions. Recent approaches favor learning policies from simulated or collected data, wherein appropriate actions are more frequently selected when the recognition is accurate. However, most recognition modules are developed under the closed-world assumption, which makes them ill-equipped to handle unexpected inputs, such as the absence of the target object in the current observation. To address this issue, we propose treating active recognition as a sequential evidence-gathering process, providing by-step uncertainty quantification and reliable prediction under the evidence combination theory. Additionally, the reward function developed in this paper effectively characterizes the merit of actions when operating in open-world environments. To evaluate the performance, we collect a dataset from an indoor simulator, encompassing various recognition challenges such as distance, occlusion levels, and visibility. Through a series of experiments on recognition and robustness analysis, we demonstrate the necessity of introducing uncertainties to active recognition and the superior performance of the proposed method",

Depending on the type of data being detected, SOD can be categorized into various forms, including RGB, RGB-D (Depth), RGB-T (Thermal) and light field SOD. Previous researches have focused on saliency detection with individual data type. If the RGB-D SOD model is forced to detect RGB-T data it will perform poorly. We propose an innovative model framework that provides a unified solution for the salient object detection task of three types of data (RGB, RGB-D, and RGB-T). The three types of data can be handled in one model (all in one) with the same weight parameters. In this framework, the three types of data are concatenated in an ordered manner within a single input batch, and features are extracted using a transformer network. Based on this framework, we propose an efficient lightweight SOD model, namely AiOSOD, which can detect any RGB, RGB-D, and RGB-T data with high speed (780FPS for RGB data, 485FPS for RGB-D or RGB-T data). Notably, with only 6.25M parameters, AiOSOD achieves excellent performance on RGB, RGB-D, and RGB-T datasets",

To handle this task, we first present a Composite Action Generation (CAG) module to generate synthetic composite actions for training, thus avoiding the laborious work of collecting composite action samples. Moreover, we alleviate the effect of composite actions on demand for a more complicated model by presenting a Dynamic Compositional Graph Convolutional Network (DC-GCN). Extensive experiments on the Human3.6M dataset and our newly collected CHAMP dataset consistently verify the efficiency of our DC-GCN method, which achieves state-of-the-art motion prediction accuracies and meanwhile needs few extra computational costs than traditional GCN-based human motion methods",

These data sets can be quite large, and the algorithms can require numerous computations that slow the process down. A common way of speeding up the process is to use principal component analysis (PCA) for dimension reduction. In the reduced dimensional space, provided by a subset of the principal components, fewer computations are needed to process the data resulting in a faster run time. In this paper, we propose a way to further decrease the time required to use PCA by investigating how many principal components may be omitted with minimal impact on the detection rate. Using ACE to perform the detection, and then probability, and spectral fit for identification, we find that the number of principal components can be reduced by a substantial amount before seeing a noticeable change in detection rates",

This can be avoided by using only geometry inputs such as depth images to reduce the domain-gap but these approaches suffer from a lack of semantic information, which can be vital in the pose estimation problem. To resolve this conflict, we propose to utilize both geometric and semantic features obtained from a pre-trained foundation model.Our approach projects 2D features from this foundation model into 3D for a single object model per category, and then performs matching against this for new single view observations of unseen object instances with a trained matching network. This requires significantly less data to train than prior methods since the semantic features are robust to object texture and appearance.

Using this benchmark, we explore a diverse set of search strategies that use aggregated 2D slices, 3D volumes, and multi-modal embeddings from popular multi-modal foundation models as queries.

This is an arduous and time-consuming task that may introduce a bias in the results due to intra- and inter-observer variability which could be alleviated by making use of automatic quantification tools. However, this is not a simple processing task given the heterogeneity of breast tumors that results in non-uniformly distributed tumor cells exhibiting different staining colors and intensity, size, shape, and texture, of the nucleus, cytoplasm and membrane. In this research work, we demonstrate the feasibility of using a deep learning-based instance segmentation architecture for the automatic quantification of both nuclear and membrane biomarkers applied to IHC-stained slides. We have solved the cumbersome task of training set generation with the design and implementation of a web platform, which has served as a hub for communication and feedback between researchers and pathologists as well as a system for the validation of the automatic image processing models. Through this tool, we have collected annotations over samples of HE, ER and Ki-67 (nuclear biomarkers) and HER2 (membrane biomarker) IHC-stained images. Using the same deep learning network architecture, we have trained two models, so-called nuclei- and membrane-aware segmentation models, which, once successfully validated, have revealed to be a promising method to segment nuclei instances in IHC-stained images.

All ImageNet-based extractors were consistent with each other, but only SwAV was significantly correlated with medical expert judgment. The RadImageNet-based FD showed volatility and lacked correlation with human judgment. Caution is advised when using medical image-trained extraction networks in the FD calculation. These networks should be rigorously evaluated on the imaging modality under consideration and publicly released. ImageNet-based extractors, while imperfect, are consistent and widely understood.

    "abstract": "Recently, diffusion models (DMs) have become the state-of-the-art method for image synthesis. Editing models based on DMs, known for their high fidelity and precision, have inadvertently introduced new challenges related to image copyright infringement and malicious editing. Our work is the first to formalize and address this issue. After assessing and attempting to enhance traditional image watermarking techniques, we recognize their limitations in this emerging context. In response, we develop a novel technique, RIW (Robust Invisible Watermarking), to embed invisible watermarks leveraging adversarial example techniques. Our technique ensures a high extraction accuracy of $96\\%$ for the invisible watermark after editing, compared to the $0\\%$ offered by conventional methods.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging is emerging as a crucial tool to examine cardiac morphology and function. Essential to this endeavour are anatomical 3D surface and volumetric meshes derived from CMR images, which facilitate computational anatomy studies, biomarker discovery, and in-silico simulations. However, conventional surface mesh generation methods, such as active shape models and multi-atlas segmentation, are highly time-consuming and require complex processing pipelines to generate simulation-ready 3D meshes. In response, we introduce HybridVNet, a novel architecture for direct image-to-mesh extraction seamlessly integrating standard convolutional neural networks with graph convolutions, which we prove can efficiently handle surface and volumetric meshes by encoding them as graph structures. To further enhance accuracy, we propose a multiview HybridVNet architecture which processes both long axis and short axis CMR, showing that it can increase the performance of cardiac MR mesh generation. Our model combines traditional convolutional networks with variational graph generative models, deep supervision and mesh-specific regularisation. Experiments on a comprehensive dataset from the UK Biobank confirm the potential of HybridVNet to significantly advance cardiac imaging and computational cardiology by efficiently generating high-fidelity and simulation ready meshes from CMR images",

    "title": "Masked Conditional Diffusion Models for Image Analysis with Application to Radiographic Diagnosis of Infant Abuse",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The classic metaphyseal lesion (CML) is a distinct injury that is highly specific for infant abuse. It commonly occurs in the distal tibia. To aid radiologists detect these subtle fractures, we need to develop a model that can flag abnormal distal tibial radiographs (i.e. those with CMLs). Unfortunately, the development of such a model requires a large and diverse training database, which is often not available. To address this limitation, we propose a novel generative model for data augmentation. Unlike previous models that fail to generate data that span the diverse radiographic appearance of the distal tibial CML, our proposed masked conditional diffusion model (MaC-DM) not only generates realistic-appearing and wide-ranging synthetic images of the distal tibial radiographs with and without CMLs, it also generates their associated segmentation labels. To achieve these tasks, MaC-DM combines the weighted segmentation masks of the tibias and the CML fracture sites as additional conditions for classifier guidance. The augmented images from our model improved the performances of ResNet-34 in classifying normal radiographs and those with CMLs. Further, the augmented images and their associated segmentation masks enhanced the performance of the U-Net in labeling areas of the CMLs on distal tibial radiographs",

However, existing PnP models predominantly rely on pre-trained denoisers using large datasets. In this work, we introduce Single-Shot PnP methods (SS-PnP), shifting the focus to solving inverse problems with minimal data. First, we integrate Single-Shot proximal denoisers into iterative methods, enabling training with single instances.

    "title": "Compact 3D Gaussian Representation for Radiance Field",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in capturing complex 3D scenes with high fidelity. However, one persistent challenge that hinders the widespread adoption of NeRFs is the computational bottleneck due to the volumetric rendering. On the other hand, 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as an alternative representation that leverages a 3D Gaussisan-based representation and adopts the rasterization pipeline to render the images rather than volumetric rendering, achieving very fast rendering speed and promising image quality. However, a significant drawback arises as 3DGS entails a substantial number of 3D Gaussians to maintain the high fidelity of the rendered images, which requires a large amount of memory and storage. To address this critical issue, we place a specific emphasis on two key objectives: reducing the number of Gaussian points without sacrificing performance and compressing the Gaussian attributes, such as view-dependent color and covariance. To this end, we propose a learnable mask strategy that significantly reduces the number of Gaussians while preserving high performance. In addition, we propose a compact but effective representation of view-dependent color by employing a grid-based neural field rather than relying on spherical harmonics. Finally, we learn codebooks to compactly represent the geometric attributes of Gaussian by vector quantization. In our extensive experiments, we consistently show over 10$\\times$ reduced storage and enhanced rendering speed, while maintaining the quality of the scene representation, compared to 3DGS. Our work provides a comprehensive framework for 3D scene representation, achieving high performance, fast training, compactness, and real-time rendering.

By injecting Gaussian noise into the PC inference procedure we re-envision it as an overdamped Langevin sampling, which facilitates optimisation with respect to a tight evidence lower bound (ELBO). We improve the resultant encoder-free training method by incorporating an encoder network to provide an amortised warm-start to our Langevin sampling and test three different objectives for doing so. Finally, to increase robustness to the sampling step size and reduce sensitivity to curvature, we validate a lightweight and easily computable form of preconditioning, inspired by Riemann Manifold Langevin and adaptive optimizers from the SGD literature. We compare against VAEs by training like-for-like generative models using our technique against those trained with standard reparameterisation-trick-based ELBOs.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Digital humans and, especially, 3D facial avatars have raised a lot of attention in the past years, as they are the backbone of several applications like immersive telepresence in AR or VR. Despite the progress, facial avatars reconstructed from commodity hardware are incomplete and miss out on parts of the side and back of the head, severely limiting the usability of the avatar. This limitation in prior work stems from their requirement of face tracking, which fails for profile and back views. To address this issue, we propose to learn person-specific animatable avatars from images without assuming to have access to precise facial expression tracking. At the core of our method, we leverage a 3D-aware generative model that is trained to reproduce the distribution of facial expressions from the training data. To train this appearance model, we only assume to have a collection of 2D images with the corresponding camera parameters. For controlling the model, we learn a mapping from 3DMM facial expression parameters to the latent space of the generative model. This mapping can be learned by sampling the latent space of the appearance model and reconstructing the facial parameters from a normalized frontal view, where facial expression estimation performs well. With this scheme, we decouple 3D appearance reconstruction and animation control to achieve high fidelity in image synthesis. In a series of experiments, we compare our proposed technique to state-of-the-art monocular methods and show superior quality while not requiring expression tracking of the training data",

Existing visual prompting methods focus on referring segmentation to segment the most relevant object, falling short of addressing many generic vision tasks like open-set segmentation and detection. In this paper, we introduce a universal visual in-context prompting framework for both tasks. In particular, we build on top of an encoder-decoder architecture, and develop a versatile prompt encoder to support a variety of prompts like strokes, boxes, and points. We further enhance it to take an arbitrary number of reference image segments as the context. Our extensive explorations show that the proposed visual in-context prompting elicits extraordinary referring and generic segmentation capabilities to refer and detect, yielding competitive performance to close-set in-domain datasets and showing promising results on many open-set segmentation datasets.

Furthermore, we design multi-part discriminators that evaluate the quality of the generated avatars with respect to their appearance and fine-grained control capabilities.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Modern learning-based approaches to 3D-aware image synthesis achieve high photorealism and 3D-consistent viewpoint changes for the generated images. Existing approaches represent instances in a shared canonical space. However, for in-the-wild datasets a shared canonical system can be difficult to define or might not even exist. In this work, we instead model instances in view space, alleviating the need for posed images and learned camera distributions. We find that in this setting, existing GAN-based methods are prone to generating flat geometry and struggle with distribution coverage. We hence propose WildFusion, a new approach to 3D-aware image synthesis based on latent diffusion models (LDMs). We first train an autoencoder that infers a compressed latent representation, which additionally captures the images' underlying 3D structure and enables not only reconstruction but also novel view synthesis. To learn a faithful 3D representation, we leverage cues from monocular depth prediction. Then, we train a diffusion model in the 3D-aware latent space, thereby enabling synthesis of high-quality 3D-consistent image samples, outperforming recent state-of-the-art GAN-based methods. Importantly, our 3D-aware LDM is trained without any direct supervision from multiview images or 3D geometry and does not require posed images or learned pose or camera distributions. It directly learns a 3D representation without relying on canonical camera coordinates. This opens up promising research avenues for scalable 3D-aware image synthesis and 3D content creation from in-the-wild image data.

    "abstract": "Image style transfer occupies an important place in both computer graphics and computer vision. However, most current methods require reference to stylized images and cannot individually stylize specific objects. To overcome this limitation, we propose the \"Soulstyler\" framework, which allows users to guide the stylization of specific objects in an image through simple textual descriptions. We introduce a large language model to parse the text and identify stylization goals and specific styles. Combined with a CLIP-based semantic visual embedding encoder, the model understands and matches text and image content. We also introduce a novel localized text-image block matching loss that ensures that style transfer is performed only on specified target objects, while non-target regions remain in their original style.

    "title": "ADriver-I: A General World Model for Autonomous Driving",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Typically, autonomous driving adopts a modular design, which divides the full stack into perception, prediction, planning and control parts. Though interpretable, such modular design tends to introduce a substantial amount of redundancy. Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLM) and diffusion techniques have demonstrated their superior performance on comprehension and generation ability. In this paper, we first introduce the concept of interleaved vision-action pair, which unifies the format of visual features and control signals. Based on the vision-action pairs, we construct a general world model based on MLLM and diffusion model for autonomous driving, termed ADriver-I. It takes the vision-action pairs as inputs and autoregressively predicts the control signal of the current frame. The generated control signals together with the historical vision-action pairs are further conditioned to predict the future frames. With the predicted next frame, ADriver-I performs further control signal prediction. Such a process can be repeated infinite times, ADriver-I achieves autonomous driving in the world created by itself. Extensive experiments are conducted on nuScenes and our large-scale private datasets. ADriver-I shows impressive performance compared to several constructed baselines. We hope our ADriver-I can provide some new insights for future autonomous driving and embodied intelligence",

    "abstract": "What makes good video representations for video understanding, such as anticipating future activities, or answering video-conditioned questions? While earlier approaches focus on end-to-end learning directly from video pixels, we propose to revisit text-based representations, such as discrete action labels, or free-form video captions, which are interpretable and can be directly consumed by large language models (LLMs). Intuitively, different video understanding tasks may require representations that are complementary and at different granularities. To this end, we propose versatile action models (Vamos), a learning framework powered by a large language model as the \"reasoner\", and can flexibly leverage visual embeddings, action labels, and free-form descriptions extracted from videos as its input. We evaluate Vamos on four complementary video understanding benchmarks, Ego4D, Next-QA, IntentQA, and EgoSchema, on its capability to model temporal dynamics, encode visual history, and perform reasoning. Surprisingly, we observe that text-based representations consistently achieve competitive performance on all benchmarks, and that visual embeddings provide marginal or no performance improvement, demonstrating the effectiveness of text-based video representation in the LLM era. We perform extensive ablation study and qualitative analysis to support our observations, and achieve state-of-the-art performance on three benchmarks",

Efficient retrieval systems are crucial in advancing medical research, enabling large-scale studies and innovative diagnostic tools.

In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of employing four state-of-the-art pretrained models for medical image retrieval at modality, body region, and organ levels and compared the results of two similarity indexing approaches. Since the employed networks take 2D images, we analyzed the impacts of weighting and sampling strategies to incorporate 3D information during retrieval of 3D volumes.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce DiffusionMat, a novel image matting framework that employs a diffusion model for the transition from coarse to refined alpha mattes. Diverging from conventional methods that utilize trimaps merely as loose guidance for alpha matte prediction, our approach treats image matting as a sequential refinement learning process. This process begins with the addition of noise to trimaps and iteratively denoises them using a pre-trained diffusion model, which incrementally guides the prediction towards a clean alpha matte. The key innovation of our framework is a correction module that adjusts the output at each denoising step, ensuring that the final result is consistent with the input image's structures. We also introduce the Alpha Reliability Propagation, a novel technique designed to maximize the utility of available guidance by selectively enhancing the trimap regions with confident alpha information, thus simplifying the correction task. To train the correction module, we devise specialized loss functions that target the accuracy of the alpha matte's edges and the consistency of its opaque and transparent regions. We evaluate our model across several image matting benchmarks, and the results indicate that DiffusionMat consistently outperforms existing methods.

    "abstract": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive diagnostic and radiotherapy (RT) planning tool, offering detailed insights into the anatomy of the human body. The extensive scan time is stressful for patients, who must remain motionless in a prolonged imaging procedure that prioritizes reduction of imaging artifacts. This is challenging for pediatric patients who may require measures for managing voluntary motions such as anesthesia. Several computational approaches reduce scan time (fast MRI), by recording fewer measurements and digitally recovering full information via post-acquisition reconstruction. However, most fast MRI approaches were developed for diagnostic imaging, without addressing reconstruction challenges specific to RT planning. In this work, we developed a deep learning-based method (DeepMRIRec) for MRI reconstruction from undersampled data acquired with RT-specific receiver coil arrangements. We evaluated our method against fully sampled data of T1-weighted MR images acquired from 73 children with brain tumors/surgical beds using loop and posterior coils (12 channels), with and without applying virtual compression of coil elements. DeepMRIRec reduced scanning time by a factor of four producing a structural similarity score surpassing the evaluated state-of-the-art method (0.960 vs 0.896), thereby demonstrating its potential for accelerating MRI scanning for RT planning",

    "abstract": "The choice of the representations is essential for deep gait recognition methods. The binary silhouettes and skeletal coordinates are two dominant representations in recent literature, achieving remarkable advances in many scenarios. However, inherent challenges remain, in which silhouettes are not always guaranteed in unconstrained scenes, and structural cues have not been fully utilized from skeletons. In this paper, we introduce a novel skeletal gait representation named Skeleton Map, together with SkeletonGait, a skeleton-based method to exploit structural information from human skeleton maps. Specifically, the skeleton map represents the coordinates of human joints as a heatmap with Gaussian approximation, exhibiting a silhouette-like image devoid of exact body structure. Beyond achieving state-of-the-art performances over five popular gait datasets, more importantly, SkeletonGait uncovers novel insights about how important structural features are in describing gait and when do they play a role. Furthermore, we propose a multi-branch architecture, named SkeletonGait++, to make use of complementary features from both skeletons and silhouettes. Experiments indicate that SkeletonGait++ outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin in various scenarios.

Addressing these gaps, we propose Video-LLaVA, the first LMM with pixel-level grounding capability, integrating audio cues by transcribing them into text to enrich video-context understanding. Our framework uses an off-the-shelf tracker and a novel grounding module, enabling it to spatially and temporally localize objects in videos following user instructions. We evaluate Video-LLaVA using video-based generative and question-answering benchmarks and introduce new benchmarks specifically designed to measure prompt-based object grounding performance in videos. Further, we propose the use of Vicuna over GPT-3.5, as utilized in Video-ChatGPT, for video-based conversation benchmarking, ensuring reproducibility of results which is a concern with the proprietary nature of GPT-3.5. Our framework builds on SoTA image-based LLaVA model and extends its advantages to the video domain, delivering promising gains on video-based conversation and grounding tasks.

It aims to find a projector input image, named compensation image, such that when projected it cancels the geometric and photometric distortions due to the physical environment and hardware. State-of-the-art methods use deep learning to address this problem and show promising performance for low-resolution setups. However, directly applying deep learning to high-resolution setups is impractical due to the long training time and high memory cost. To address this issue, this paper proposes a practical full compensation solution. Firstly, we design an attention-based grid refinement network to improve geometric correction quality. Secondly, we integrate a novel sampling scheme into an end-to-end compensation network to alleviate computation and introduce attention blocks to preserve key features. Finally, we construct a benchmark dataset for high-resolution projector full compensation. In experiments, our method demonstrates clear advantages in both efficiency and quality",

The core of our model is a novel augmented 3D Gaussian representation, which attaches each Gaussian with a learnable code. The learnable code serves as a pose-dependent appearance embedding for refining the erroneous appearance caused by geometric transformation of Gaussians, based on which an appearance refinement model is learned to produce residual Gaussian properties to match the appearance in target pose. To force the Gaussians to learn the foreground human only without background interference, we further design a novel alpha loss to explicitly constrain the Gaussians within the human body. We also propose to jointly optimize the human joint parameters to improve the appearance accuracy. The animatable 3D Gaussian model can be learned with shallow MLPs, so new human motions can be synthesized in real time (66 fps on avarage).

Existing 3D scene generation models, however, limit the target scene to specific domain, primarily due to their training strategies using 3D scan dataset that is far from the real-world. To address such limitation, we propose LucidDreamer, a domain-free scene generation pipeline by fully leveraging the power of existing large-scale diffusion-based generative model. Our LucidDreamer has two alternate steps: Dreaming and Alignment. First, to generate multi-view consistent images from inputs, we set the point cloud as a geometrical guideline for each image generation. Specifically, we project a portion of point cloud to the desired view and provide the projection as a guidance for inpainting using the generative model. The inpainted images are lifted to 3D space with estimated depth maps, composing a new points. Second, to aggregate the new points into the 3D scene, we propose an aligning algorithm which harmoniously integrates the portions of newly generated 3D scenes. The finally obtained 3D scene serves as initial points for optimizing Gaussian splats. LucidDreamer produces Gaussian splats that are highly-detailed compared to the previous 3D scene generation methods, with no constraint on domain of the target scene",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Classifying patterns of known classes and rejecting ambiguous and novel (also called as out-of-distribution (OOD)) inputs are involved in open world pattern recognition. Deep neural network models usually excel in closed-set classification while performing poorly in rejecting OOD. To tackle this problem, numerous methods have been designed to perform open set recognition (OSR) or OOD rejection/detection tasks. Previous methods mostly take post-training score transformation or hybrid models to ensure low scores on OOD inputs while separating known classes. In this paper, we attempt to build a unified framework for building open set classifiers for both classification and OOD rejection. We formulate the open set recognition of $ K $-known-class as a $ (K + 1) $-class classification problem with model trained on known-class samples only. By decomposing the $ K $-class problem into $ K $ one-versus-all (OVA) binary classification tasks and binding some parameters, we show that combining the scores of OVA classifiers can give $ (K + 1) $-class posterior probabilities, which enables classification and OOD rejection in a unified framework. To maintain the closed-set classification accuracy of the OVA trained classifier, we propose a hybrid training strategy combining OVA loss and multi-class cross-entropy loss. We implement the OVA framework and hybrid training strategy on the recently proposed convolutional prototype network. Experiments on popular OSR and OOD detection datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework, using a single multi-class classifier, yields competitive performance in closed-set classification, OOD detection, and misclassification detection",

    "title": "High-Quality Face Caricature via Style Translation",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Caricature is an exaggerated form of artistic portraiture that accentuates unique yet subtle characteristics of human faces. Recently, advancements in deep end-to-end techniques have yielded encouraging outcomes in capturing both style and elevated exaggerations in creating face caricatures. Most of these approaches tend to produce cartoon-like results that could be more practical for real-world applications. In this study, we proposed a high-quality, unpaired face caricature method that is appropriate for use in the real world and uses computer vision techniques and GAN models. We attain the exaggeration of facial features and the stylization of appearance through a two-step process: Face caricature generation and face caricature projection. The face caricature generation step creates new caricature face datasets from real images and trains a generative model using the real and newly created caricature datasets. The Face caricature projection employs an encoder trained with real and caricature faces with the pretrained generator to project real and caricature faces. We perform an incremental facial exaggeration from the real image to the caricature faces using the encoder and generator's latent space. Our projection preserves the facial identity, attributes, and expressions from the input image. Also, it accounts for facial occlusions, such as reading glasses or sunglasses, to enhance the robustness of our model. Furthermore, we conducted a comprehensive comparison of our approach with various state-of-the-art face caricature methods, highlighting our process's distinctiveness and exceptional realism",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence has made significant progress in the Close World problem, being able to accurately recognize old knowledge through training and classification. However, AI faces significant challenges in the Open World problem, as it involves a new and unknown exploration journey. AI is not inherently proactive in exploration, and its challenge lies in not knowing how to approach and adapt to the unknown world. How do humans acquire knowledge of the unknown world. Humans identify new knowledge through intrinsic cognition. In the process of recognizing new colors, the cognitive cues are different from known color features and involve hue, saturation, brightness, and other characteristics. When AI encounters objects with different features in the new world, it faces another challenge: where are the distinguishing features between influential features of new and old objects? AI often mistakes a new world's brown bear for a known dog because it has not learned the differences in feature distributions between knowledge systems. This is because things in the new and old worlds have different units and dimensions for their features. This paper proposes an open-world model and elemental feature system that focuses on fundamentally recognizing the distribution differences in objective features between the new and old worlds. The quantum tunneling effect of learning ability in the new and old worlds is realized through the tractive force of meta-characteristic. The outstanding performance of the model system in learning new knowledge (using pedestrian re-identification datasets as an example) demonstrates that AI has acquired the ability to recognize the new world with an accuracy of $96.71\\%$ at most and has gained the capability to explore new knowledge, similar to humans",

While most research has centered on supervised continual learning, recent studies have highlighted the strengths of self-supervised continual representation learning. The improved transferability of representations built with self-supervised methods is often associated with the role played by the multi-layer perceptron projector. In this work, we depart from this observation and reexamine the role of supervision in continual representation learning. We reckon that additional information, such as human annotations, should not deteriorate the quality of representations. Our findings show that supervised models when enhanced with a multi-layer perceptron head, can outperform self-supervised models in continual representation learning",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Automated blood vessel segmentation is vital for biomedical imaging, as vessel changes indicate many pathologies. Still, precise segmentation is difficult due to the complexity of vascular structures, anatomical variations across patients, the scarcity of annotated public datasets, and the quality of images. We present a thorough literature review, highlighting the state of machine learning techniques across diverse organs. Our goal is to provide a foundation on the topic and identify a robust baseline model for application to vascular segmentation in a new imaging modality, Hierarchical Phase Contrast Tomography (HiP CT). Introduced in 2020 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, HiP CT enables 3D imaging of complete organs at an unprecedented resolution of ca. 20mm per voxel, with the capability for localized zooms in selected regions down to 1mm per voxel without sectioning. We have created a training dataset with double annotator validated vascular data from three kidneys imaged with HiP CT in the context of the Human Organ Atlas Project. Finally, utilising the nnU Net model, we conduct experiments to assess the models performance on both familiar and unseen samples, employing vessel specific metrics. Our results show that while segmentations yielded reasonably high scores such as clDice values ranging from 0.82 to 0.88, certain errors persisted. Large vessels that collapsed due to the lack of hydrostatic pressure (HiP CT is an ex vivo technique) were segmented poorly. Moreover, decreased connectivity in finer vessels and higher segmentation errors at vessel boundaries were observed. Such errors obstruct the understanding of the structures by interrupting vascular tree connectivity. Through our review and outputs, we aim to set a benchmark for subsequent model evaluations using various modalities, especially with the HiP CT imaging database",

Nevertheless, they remain deficient when confronted with severely blurred images, due to their insufficient generation capability when little structural or semantic information can be extracted from original images. Therefore, we introduce RGDiffSR, a Recognition-Guided Diffusion model for scene text image Super-Resolution, which exhibits great generative diversity and fidelity even in challenging scenarios. Moreover, we propose a Recognition-Guided Denoising Network, to guide the diffusion model generating LR-consistent results through succinct semantic guidance.

    "abstract": "Radiology Report Generation (RRG) draws attention as an interaction between vision and language fields. Previous works inherited the ideology of vision-to-language generation tasks,aiming to generate paragraphs with high consistency as reports. However, one unique characteristic of RRG, the independence between diseases, was neglected, leading to the injection of the spurious confounder, i.e., the disease co-occurrence. Unfortunately, this confounder confuses the process of report generation worse because of the biased RRG data distribution. In this paper, to rethink this issue thoroughly, we reason about its causes and effects from a novel perspective of statistics and causality, where the Joint Vision Coupling and the Conditional Sentence Coherence Coupling are two aspects prone to implicitly decrease the accuracy of reports. Then, a counterfactual augmentation strategy that contains the Counterfactual Sample Synthesis and the Counterfactual Report Reconstruction sub-methods is proposed to break these two aspects of spurious effects.

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is a collaborative method for training models while preserving data privacy in decentralized settings. However, FL encounters challenges related to data heterogeneity, which can result in performance degradation. In our study, we observe that as data heterogeneity increases, feature representation in the FedAVG model deteriorates more significantly compared to classifier weight. Additionally, we observe that as data heterogeneity increases, the gap between higher feature norms for observed classes, obtained from local models, and feature norms of unobserved classes widens, in contrast to the behavior of classifier weight norms. This widening gap extends to encompass the feature norm disparities between local and the global models. To address these issues, we introduce Federated Averaging with Feature Normalization Update (FedFN), a straightforward learning method.

    "abstract": "Copy-move forgery detection aims at detecting duplicated regions in a suspected forged image, and deep learning based copy-move forgery detection methods are in the ascendant. These deep learning based methods heavily rely on synthetic training data, and the performance will degrade when facing new tasks. In this paper, we propose a Transformer-style copy-move forgery detection network named as CMFDFormer, and provide a novel PCSD (Pooled Cube and Strip Distillation) continual learning framework to help CMFDFormer handle new tasks. CMFDFormer consists of a MiT (Mix Transformer) backbone network and a PHD (Pluggable Hybrid Decoder) mask prediction network. The MiT backbone network is a Transformer-style network which is adopted on the basis of comprehensive analyses with CNN-style and MLP-style backbones. The PHD network is constructed based on self-correlation computation, hierarchical feature integration, a multi-scale cycle fully-connected block and a mask reconstruction block. The PHD network is applicable to feature extractors of different styles for hierarchical multi-scale information extraction, achieving comparable performance. Last but not least, we propose a PCSD continual learning framework to improve the forgery detectability and avoid catastrophic forgetting when handling new tasks. Our continual learning framework restricts intermediate features from the PHD network, and takes advantage of both cube pooling and strip pooling. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets demonstrate the good performance of CMFDFormer and the effectiveness of the PCSD continual learning framework",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Digital pathology enables automatic analysis of histopathological sections using artificial intelligence (AI). Automatic evaluation could improve diagnostic efficiency and help find associations between morphological features and clinical outcome. For development of such prediction models, identifying invasive epithelial cells, and separating these from benign epithelial cells and in situ lesions would be the first step. In this study, we aimed to develop an AI model for segmentation of epithelial cells in sections from breast cancer. We generated epithelial ground truth masks by restaining hematoxylin and eosin (HE) sections with cytokeratin (CK) AE1/AE3, and by pathologists' annotations. HE/CK image pairs were used to train a convolutional neural network, and data augmentation was used to make the model more robust. Tissue microarrays (TMAs) from 839 patients, and whole slide images from two patients were used for training and evaluation of the models. The sections were derived from four cohorts of breast cancer patients. TMAs from 21 patients from a fifth cohort was used as a second test set. In quantitative evaluation, a mean Dice score of 0.70, 0.79, and 0.75 for invasive epithelial cells, benign epithelial cells, and in situ lesions, respectively, were achieved. In qualitative scoring (0-5) by pathologists, results were best for all epithelium and invasive epithelium, with scores of 4.7 and 4.4. Scores for benign epithelium and in situ lesions were 3.7 and 2.0. The proposed model segmented epithelial cells in HE stained breast cancer slides well, but further work is needed for accurate division between the classes. Immunohistochemistry, together with pathologists' annotations, enabled the creation of accurate ground truths.

In this work, we present ViStruct, a training framework to learn VLMs for effective visual structural knowledge extraction. Two novel designs are incorporated. First, we propose to leverage the inherent structure of programming language to depict visual structural information. This approach enables explicit and consistent representation of visual structural information of multiple granularities, such as concepts, relations, and events, in a well-organized structured format. Second, we introduce curriculum-based learning for VLMs to progressively comprehend visual structures, from fundamental visual concepts to intricate event structures. Our intuition is that lower-level knowledge may contribute to complex visual structure understanding. Furthermore, we compile and release a collection of datasets tailored for visual structural knowledge extraction. We adopt a weakly-supervised approach to directly generate visual event structures from captions for ViStruct training, capitalizing on abundant image-caption pairs from the web. In experiments, we evaluate ViStruct on visual structure prediction tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving the understanding of visual structures.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we address the challenges of online Continual Learning (CL) by introducing a density distribution-based learning framework. CL, especially the Class Incremental Learning, enables adaptation to new test distributions while continuously learning from a single-pass training data stream, which is more in line with the practical application requirements of real-world scenarios. However, existing CL methods often suffer from catastrophic forgetting and higher computing costs due to complex algorithm designs, limiting their practical use. Our proposed framework overcomes these limitations by achieving superior average accuracy and time-space efficiency, bridging the performance gap between CL and classical machine learning. Specifically, we adopt an independent Generative Kernel Density Estimation (GKDE) model for each CL task. During the testing stage, the GKDEs utilize a self-reported max probability density value to determine which one is responsible for predicting incoming test instances. A GKDE-based learning objective can ensure that samples with the same label are grouped together, while dissimilar instances are pushed farther apart. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple CL datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. Our method outperforms popular CL approaches by a significant margin, while maintaining competitive time-space efficiency, making our framework suitable for real-world applications.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Video semantic segmentation is a pivotal aspect of video representation learning. However, significant domain shifts present a challenge in effectively learning invariant spatio-temporal features across the labeled source domain and unlabeled target domain for video semantic segmentation. To solve the challenge, we propose a novel DA-STC method for domain adaptive video semantic segmentation, which incorporates a bidirectional multi-level spatio-temporal fusion module and a category-aware spatio-temporal feature alignment module to facilitate consistent learning for domain-invariant features. Firstly, we perform bidirectional spatio-temporal fusion at the image sequence level and shallow feature level, leading to the construction of two fused intermediate video domains. This prompts the video semantic segmentation model to consistently learn spatio-temporal features of shared patch sequences which are influenced by domain-specific contexts, thereby mitigating the feature gap between the source and target domain. Secondly, we propose a category-aware feature alignment module to promote the consistency of spatio-temporal features, facilitating adaptation to the target domain. Specifically, we adaptively aggregate the domain-specific deep features of each category along spatio-temporal dimensions, which are further constrained to achieve cross-domain intra-class feature alignment and inter-class feature separation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which achieves state-of-the-art mIOUs on multiple challenging benchmarks. Furthermore, we extend the proposed DA-STC to the image domain, where it also exhibits superior performance for domain adaptive semantic segmentation.

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) enables joint training across distributed clients using their local data privately. Federated Multi-Task Learning (FMTL) builds on FL to handle multiple tasks, assuming model congruity that identical model architecture is deployed in each client. To relax this assumption and thus extend real-world applicability, we introduce a novel problem setting, Hetero-Client Federated Multi-Task Learning (HC-FMTL), to accommodate diverse task setups. The main challenge of HC-FMTL is the model incongruity issue that invalidates conventional aggregation methods. It also escalates the difficulties in accurate model aggregation to deal with data and task heterogeneity inherent in FMTL. To address these challenges, we propose the FedHCA$^2$ framework, which allows for federated training of personalized models by modeling relationships among heterogeneous clients. Drawing on our theoretical insights into the difference between multi-task and federated optimization, we propose the Hyper Conflict-Averse Aggregation scheme to mitigate conflicts during encoder updates. Additionally, inspired by task interaction in MTL, the Hyper Cross Attention Aggregation scheme uses layer-wise cross attention to enhance decoder interactions while alleviating model incongruity. Moreover, we employ learnable Hyper Aggregation Weights for each client to customize personalized parameter updates.

    "title": "Using Human Feedback to Fine-tune Diffusion Models without Any Reward Model",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Using reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) has shown significant promise in fine-tuning diffusion models. Previous methods start by training a reward model that aligns with human preferences, then leverage RL techniques to fine-tune the underlying models. However, crafting an efficient reward model demands extensive datasets, optimal architecture, and manual hyperparameter tuning, making the process both time and cost-intensive. The direct preference optimization (DPO) method, effective in fine-tuning large language models, eliminates the necessity for a reward model. However, the extensive GPU memory requirement of the diffusion model's denoising process hinders the direct application of the DPO method. To address this issue, we introduce the Direct Preference for Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization (D3PO) method to directly fine-tune diffusion models. The theoretical analysis demonstrates that although D3PO omits training a reward model, it effectively functions as the optimal reward model trained using human feedback data to guide the learning process. This approach requires no training of a reward model, proving to be more direct, cost-effective, and minimizing computational overhead. In experiments, our method uses the relative scale of objectives as a proxy for human preference, delivering comparable results to methods using ground-truth rewards. Moreover, D3PO demonstrates the ability to reduce image distortion rates and generate safer images, overcoming challenges lacking robust reward models",

To overcome this, we introduce the Entropy-Reweighted Knowledge Distillation (ER-KD), a novel approach that leverages the entropy in the teacher's predictions to reweight the KD loss on a sample-wise basis. ER-KD precisely refocuses the student on challenging instances rich in the teacher's nuanced insights while reducing the emphasis on simpler cases, enabling a more balanced knowledge transfer. Consequently, ER-KD not only demonstrates compatibility with various state-of-the-art KD methods but also further enhances their performance at negligible cost. This approach offers a streamlined and effective strategy to refine the knowledge transfer process in KD, setting a new paradigm in the meticulous handling of dark knowledge.

    "title": "Towards Detecting, Recognizing, and Parsing the Address Information from Bangla Signboard: A Deep Learning-based Approach",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Retrieving textual information from natural scene images is an active research area in the field of computer vision with numerous practical applications. Detecting text regions and extracting text from signboards is a challenging problem due to special characteristics like reflecting lights, uneven illumination, or shadows found in real-life natural scene images. With the advent of deep learning-based methods, different sophisticated techniques have been proposed for text detection and text recognition from the natural scene. Though a significant amount of effort has been devoted to extracting natural scene text for resourceful languages like English, little has been done for low-resource languages like Bangla. In this research work, we have proposed an end-to-end system with deep learning-based models for efficiently detecting, recognizing, correcting, and parsing address information from Bangla signboards. We have created manually annotated datasets and synthetic datasets to train signboard detection, address text detection, address text recognition, address text correction, and address text parser models. We have conducted a comparative study among different CTC-based and Encoder-Decoder model architectures for Bangla address text recognition. Moreover, we have designed a novel address text correction model using a sequence-to-sequence transformer-based network to improve the performance of Bangla address text recognition model by post-correction. Finally, we have developed a Bangla address text parser using the state-of-the-art transformer-based pre-trained language model",

    "title": "Test-time Adaptive Vision-and-Language Navigation",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) has witnessed significant advancements in recent years, largely attributed to meticulously curated datasets and proficiently trained models. Nevertheless, when tested in diverse environments, the trained models inevitably encounter significant shifts in data distribution, highlighting that relying solely on pre-trained and fixed navigation models is insufficient. To enhance models' generalization ability, test-time adaptation (TTA) demonstrates significant potential in the computer vision field by leveraging unlabeled test samples for model updates. However, simply applying existing TTA methods to the VLN task cannot well handle the adaptability-stability dilemma of VLN models, i.e., frequent updates can result in drastic changes in model parameters, while occasional updates can make the models ill-equipped to handle dynamically changing environments. Therefore, we propose a Fast-Slow Test-Time Adaptation (FSTTA) approach for VLN by performing decomposition-accumulation analysis for both gradients and parameters in a unified framework. Specifically, in the fast update phase, gradients generated during the recent multi-step navigation process are decomposed into components with varying levels of consistency. Then, these components are adaptively accumulated to pinpoint a concordant direction for fast model adaptation. In the slow update phase, historically recorded parameters are gathered, and a similar decomposition-accumulation analysis is conducted to revert the model to a stable state. Extensive experiments show that our method obtains impressive performance gains on four popular benchmarks",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Recent advances in text-to-image generators have led to substantial capabilities in image generation. However, the complexity of prompts acts as a bottleneck in the quality of images generated. A particular under-explored facet is the ability of generative models to create high-quality images comprising multiple components given as a prior. In this paper, we propose and validate a metric called Components Inclusion Score (CIS) to evaluate the extent to which a model can correctly generate multiple components. Our results reveal that the evaluated models struggle to incorporate all the visual elements from prompts with multiple components (8.53% drop in CIS per component for all evaluated models). We also identify a significant decline in the quality of the images and context awareness within an image as the number of components increased (15.91% decrease in inception Score and 9.62% increase in Frechet Inception Distance). To remedy this issue, we fine-tuned Stable Diffusion V2 on a custom-created test dataset with multiple components, outperforming its vanilla counterpart. To conclude, these findings reveal a critical limitation in existing text-to-image generators, shedding light on the challenge of generating multiple components within a single image using a complex prompt",

    "abstract": "The advancement in text-to-image models has led to astonishing artistic performances. However, several studios and websites illegally fine-tune these models using artists' artworks to mimic their styles for profit, which violates the copyrights of artists and diminishes their motivation to produce original works. Currently, there is a notable lack of research focusing on this issue. In this paper, we propose a novel watermarking framework that detects mimicry in text-to-image models through fine-tuning. This framework embeds subtle watermarks into digital artworks to protect their copyrights while still preserving the artist's visual expression. If someone takes watermarked artworks as training data to mimic an artist's style, these watermarks can serve as detectable indicators. By analyzing the distribution of these watermarks in a series of generated images, acts of fine-tuning mimicry using stolen victim data will be exposed. In various fine-tune scenarios and against watermark attack methods, our research confirms that analyzing the distribution of watermarks in artificially generated images reliably detects unauthorized mimicry",

    "abstract": "The Differentiable Rendering and Implicit Function-based model (DRIFu) draws its roots from the Pixel-aligned Implicit Function (PIFU), a pioneering 3D digitization technique initially designed for clothed human bodies. PIFU excels in capturing nuanced body shape variations within a low-dimensional space and has been extensively trained on human 3D scans. However, the application of PIFU to live animals poses significant challenges, primarily due to the inherent difficulty in obtaining the cooperation of animals for 3D scanning. In response to this challenge, we introduce the DRIFu model, specifically tailored for animal digitization. To train DRIFu, we employ a curated set of synthetic 3D animal models, encompassing diverse shapes, sizes, and even accounting for variations such as baby birds. Our innovative alignment tools play a pivotal role in mapping these diverse synthetic animal models onto a unified template, facilitating precise predictions of animal shape and texture. Crucially, our template alignment strategy establishes a shared shape space, allowing for the seamless sampling of new animal shapes, posing them realistically, animating them, and aligning them with real-world data. This groundbreaking approach revolutionizes our capacity to comprehensively understand and represent avian forms.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Object detection in urban scenarios is crucial for autonomous driving in intelligent traffic systems. However, unlike conventional object detection tasks, urban-scene images vary greatly in style. For example, images taken on sunny days differ significantly from those taken on rainy days. Therefore, models trained on sunny day images may not generalize well to rainy day images. In this paper, we aim to solve the single-domain generalizable object detection task in urban scenarios, meaning that a model trained on images from one weather condition should be able to perform well on images from any other weather conditions. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Double AUGmentation (DoubleAUG) method that includes image- and feature-level augmentation schemes. In the image-level augmentation, we consider the variation in color information across different weather conditions and propose a Color Perturbation (CP) method that randomly exchanges the RGB channels to generate various images. In the feature-level augmentation, we propose to utilize a Dual-Style Memory (DSM) to explore the diverse style information on the entire dataset, further enhancing the model's generalization capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each module in our proposed method.

The point of this work is to solve the view consistency problem in single image-guided 3D generation by modeling a reasonable geometric structure. For this purpose, we propose to utilize better 3D prior to training the NeRF. More specifically, we train an object-level LoRA for the target object using original image and the rendering output of NeRF. And then we train the LoRA and NeRF using a progressive training strategy. The LoRA and NeRF will boost each other while training. After the progressive training, the LoRA learns the 3D information of the generated object and eventually turns to an object-level 3D prior. In the final stage, we extract the mesh from the trained NeRF and use the trained LoRA to optimize the structure and appearance of the mesh. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

In this paper, we propose a novel method, STLVQE, specifically designed to address the rarely studied online video quality enhancement (Online-VQE) problem. Our STLVQE designs a new VQE framework which contains a Module-Agnostic Feature Extractor that greatly reduces the redundant computations and redesign the propagation, alignment, and enhancement module of the network. A Spatial-Temporal Look-up Tables (STL) is proposed, which extracts spatial-temporal information in videos while saving substantial inference time. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to exploit the LUT structure to extract temporal information in video tasks.

    "abstract": "Human pose estimation in complicated situations has always been a challenging task. Many Transformer-based pose networks have been proposed recently, achieving encouraging progress in improving performance. However, the remarkable performance of pose networks is always accompanied by heavy computation costs and large network scale. In order to deal with this problem, this paper proposes a High-Efficiency Vision Transformer for Human Pose Estimation (HEViTPose). In HEViTPose, a Cascaded Group Spatial Reduction Multi-Head Attention Module (CGSR-MHA) is proposed, which reduces the computational cost through feature grouping and spatial degradation mechanisms, while preserving feature diversity through multiple low-dimensional attention heads. Moreover, a concept of Patch Embedded Overlap Width (PEOW) is defined to help understand the relationship between the amount of overlap and local continuity. By optimising PEOW, our model gains improvements in performance, parameters and GFLOPs. Comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets (MPII and COCO) demonstrate that the small and large HEViTPose models are on par with state-of-the-art models while being more lightweight. Specifically, HEViTPose-B achieves 90.7 PCK@0.5 on the MPII test set and 72.6 AP on the COCO test-dev2017 set. Compared with HRNet-W32 and Swin-S, our HEViTPose-B significantly reducing Params ($\\downarrow$62.1%,$\\downarrow$80.4%,) and GFLOPs ($\\downarrow$43.4%,$\\downarrow$63.8%,).

To address this problem, we propose Neural Incident Stokes Fields (NeISF), a multi-view inverse rendering framework that reduces ambiguities using polarization cues. The primary motivation for using polarization cues is that it is the accumulation of multi-bounced light, providing rich information about geometry and material. Based on this knowledge, the proposed incident Stokes field efficiently models the accumulated polarization effect with the aid of an original physically-based differentiable polarimetric renderer.

    "abstract": "Off-resonance artifacts in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are visual distortions that occur when the actual resonant frequencies of spins within the imaging volume differ from the expected frequencies used to encode spatial information. These discrepancies can be caused by a variety of factors, including magnetic field inhomogeneities, chemical shifts, or susceptibility differences within the tissues. Such artifacts can manifest as blurring, ghosting, or misregistration of the reconstructed image, and they often compromise its diagnostic quality. We propose to resolve these artifacts by lifting the 2D MRI reconstruction problem to 3D, introducing an additional \"spectral\" dimension to model this off-resonance. Our approach is inspired by recent progress in modeling radiance fields, and is capable of reconstructing both static and dynamic MR images as well as separating fat and water, which is of independent clinical interest. We demonstrate our approach in the context of PROPELLER (Periodically Rotated Overlapping ParallEL Lines with Enhanced Reconstruction) MRI acquisitions, which are popular for their robustness to motion artifacts.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Style transfer for human face has been widely researched in recent years. Majority of the existing approaches work in 2D image domain and have 3D inconsistency issue when applied on different viewpoints of the same face. In this paper, we tackle the problem of 3D face style transfer which aims at generating stylized novel views of a 3D human face with multi-view consistency. We propose to use a neural radiance field (NeRF) to represent 3D human face and combine it with 2D style transfer to stylize the 3D face. We find that directly training a NeRF on stylized images from 2D style transfer brings in 3D inconsistency issue and causes blurriness. On the other hand, training a NeRF jointly with 2D style transfer objectives shows poor convergence due to the identity and head pose gap between style image and content image. It also poses challenge in training time and memory due to the need of volume rendering for full image to apply style transfer loss functions. We therefore propose a hybrid framework of NeRF and mesh rasterization to combine the benefits of high fidelity geometry reconstruction of NeRF and fast rendering speed of mesh. Our framework consists of three stages: 1. Training a NeRF model on input face images to learn the 3D geometry; 2. Extracting a mesh from the trained NeRF model and optimizing it with style transfer objectives via differentiable rasterization; 3. Training a new color network in NeRF conditioned on a style embedding to enable arbitrary style transfer to the 3D face. Experiment results show that our approach generates high quality face style transfer with great 3D consistency, while also enabling a flexible style control",

We use our framework to identify and eliminate hallucinations in the training data automatically. Interestingly, HalluciDoctor also indicates that spurious correlations arising from long-tail object co-occurrences contribute to hallucinations. Based on that, we execute counterfactual visual instruction expansion to balance data distribution, thereby enhancing MLLMs' resistance to hallucinations. Comprehensive experiments on hallucination evaluation benchmarks show that our method successfully mitigates 44.6% hallucinations relatively and maintains competitive performance compared to LLaVA.The source code will be released at \\url{https://github.com/Yuqifan1117/HalluciDoctor}",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Data augmentation is a powerful technique to enhance the performance of a deep learning task but has received less attention in 3D deep learning. It is well known that when 3D shapes are sparsely represented with low point density, the performance of the downstream tasks drops significantly. This work explores test-time augmentation (TTA) for 3D point clouds. We are inspired by the recent revolution of learning implicit representation and point cloud upsampling, which can produce high-quality 3D surface reconstruction and proximity-to-surface, respectively. Our idea is to leverage the implicit field reconstruction or point cloud upsampling techniques as a systematic way to augment point cloud data. Mainly, we test both strategies by sampling points from the reconstructed results and using the sampled point cloud as test-time augmented data. We show that both strategies are effective in improving accuracy. We observed that point cloud upsampling for test-time augmentation can lead to more significant performance improvement on downstream tasks such as object classification and segmentation on the ModelNet40, ShapeNet, ScanObjectNN, and SemanticKITTI datasets, especially for sparse point clouds",

    "abstract": "Popular methods in compressed sensing (CS) are dependent on deep learning (DL), where large amounts of data are used to train non-linear reconstruction models. However, ensuring generalisability over and access to multiple datasets is challenging to realise for real-world applications. To address these concerns, this paper proposes a single image, self-supervised (SS) CS-MRI framework that enables a joint deep and sparse regularisation of CS artefacts. The approach effectively dampens structured CS artefacts, which can be difficult to remove assuming sparse reconstruction, or relying solely on the inductive biases of CNN to produce noise-free images.

Unlike ordinary 2D images, 360-degree panoramic images capture the entire $360^\\circ\\times 180^\\circ$ field of view. So the rightmost and the leftmost sides of the 360 panoramic image should be continued, which is the main challenge in this field.

    "title": "Spanning Training Progress: Temporal Dual-Depth Scoring (TDDS) for Enhanced Dataset Pruning",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Dataset pruning aims to construct a coreset capable of achieving performance comparable to the original, full dataset. Most existing dataset pruning methods rely on snapshot-based criteria to identify representative samples, often resulting in poor generalization across various pruning and cross-architecture scenarios. Recent studies have addressed this issue by expanding the scope of training dynamics considered, including factors such as forgetting event and probability change, typically using an averaging approach. However, these works struggle to integrate a broader range of training dynamics without overlooking well-generalized samples, which may not be sufficiently highlighted in an averaging manner. In this study, we propose a novel dataset pruning method termed as Temporal Dual-Depth Scoring (TDDS), to tackle this problem. TDDS utilizes a dual-depth strategy to achieve a balance between incorporating extensive training dynamics and identifying representative samples for dataset pruning. In the first depth, we estimate the series of each sample's individual contributions spanning the training progress, ensuring comprehensive integration of training dynamics. In the second depth, we focus on the variability of the sample-wise contributions identified in the first depth to highlight well-generalized samples. Extensive experiments conducted on CIFAR and ImageNet datasets verify the superiority of TDDS over previous SOTA methods. Specifically on CIFAR-100, our method achieves 54.51% accuracy with only 10% training data, surpassing random selection by 7.83% and other comparison methods by at least 12.69%",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The compact cameras recording high-speed scenes with high resolution are highly demanded, but the required high bandwidth often leads to bulky, heavy systems, which limits their applications on low-capacity platforms. Adopting a coded exposure setup to encode a frame sequence into a blurry snapshot and retrieve the latent sharp video afterward can serve as a lightweight solution. However, restoring motion from blur is quite challenging due to the high ill-posedness of motion blur decomposition, intrinsic ambiguity in motion direction, and diverse motions in natural videos. In this work, by leveraging classical coded exposure imaging technique and emerging implicit neural representation for videos, we tactfully embed the motion direction cues into the blurry image during the imaging process and develop a novel self-recursive neural network to sequentially retrieve the latent video sequence from the blurry image utilizing the embedded motion direction cues. To validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework, we conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and real-captured blurry images. The results demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly outperforms existing methods in quality and flexibility. The code for our work is available at https://github.com/zhihongz/BDINR",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Oriented object detection, a specialized subfield in computer vision, finds applications across diverse scenarios, excelling particularly when dealing with objects of arbitrary orientations. Conversely, point annotation, which treats objects as single points, offers a cost-effective alternative to rotated and horizontal bounding boxes but sacrifices performance due to the loss of size and orientation information. In this study, we introduce the P2RBox network, which leverages point annotations and a mask generator to create mask proposals, followed by filtration through our Inspector Module and Constrainer Module. This process selects high-quality masks, which are subsequently converted into rotated box annotations for training a fully supervised detector. Specifically, we've thoughtfully crafted an Inspector Module rooted in multi-instance learning principles to evaluate the semantic score of masks. We've also proposed a more robust mask quality assessment in conjunction with the Constrainer Module. Furthermore, we've introduced a Symmetry Axis Estimation (SAE) Module inspired by the spectral theorem for symmetric matrices to transform the top-performing mask proposal into rotated bounding boxes. P2RBox performs well with three fully supervised rotated object detectors: RetinaNet, Rotated FCOS, and Oriented R-CNN. By combining with Oriented R-CNN, P2RBox achieves 62.26% on DOTA-v1.0 test dataset. As far as we know, this is the first attempt at training an oriented object detector with point supervision",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Text-to-image diffusion models allow seamless generation of personalized images from scant reference photos. Yet, these tools, in the wrong hands, can fabricate misleading or harmful content, endangering individuals. To address this problem, existing poisoning-based approaches perturb user images in an imperceptible way to render them \"unlearnable\" from malicious uses. We identify two limitations of these defending approaches: i) sub-optimal due to the hand-crafted heuristics for solving the intractable bilevel optimization and ii) lack of robustness against simple data transformations like Gaussian filtering. To solve these challenges, we propose MetaCloak, which solves the bi-level poisoning problem with a meta-learning framework with an additional transformation sampling process to craft transferable and robust perturbation. Specifically, we employ a pool of surrogate diffusion models to craft transferable and model-agnostic perturbation. Furthermore, by incorporating an additional transformation process, we design a simple denoising-error maximization loss that is sufficient for causing transformation-robust semantic distortion and degradation in a personalized generation. Extensive experiments on the VGGFace2 and CelebA-HQ datasets show that MetaCloak outperforms existing approaches. Notably, MetaCloak can successfully fool online training services like Replicate, in a black-box manner, demonstrating the effectiveness of MetaCloak in real-world scenarios.

To maximize the expressive power of the part templates, we introduce a per-part deformation network to enable the modeling of diverse parts with substantial geometry variations, while imposing constraints on the deformation capacity to ensure fidelity to the originally represented parts. We also propose a training scheme to effectively overcome local minima. Architecturally, our network is a branched autoencoder, with a CNN encoder taking a voxel shape as input and producing per-part transformation matrices, latent codes, and part existence scores, and the decoder outputting point occupancies to define the reconstruction loss. Our network, coined DAE-Net for Deforming Auto-Encoder, can achieve unsupervised 3D shape co-segmentation that yields fine-grained, compact, and meaningful parts that are consistent across diverse shapes.

    "abstract": "Scene text recognition (STR) in the wild frequently encounters challenges when coping with domain variations, font diversity, shape deformations, etc. A straightforward solution is performing model fine-tuning tailored to a specific scenario, but it is computationally intensive and requires multiple model copies for various scenarios. Recent studies indicate that large language models (LLMs) can learn from a few demonstration examples in a training-free manner, termed \"In-Context Learning\" (ICL). Nevertheless, applying LLMs as a text recognizer is unacceptably resource-consuming. Moreover, our pilot experiments on LLMs show that ICL fails in STR, mainly attributed to the insufficient incorporation of contextual information from diverse samples in the training stage. To this end, we introduce E$^2$STR, a STR model trained with context-rich scene text sequences, where the sequences are generated via our proposed in-context training strategy. E$^2$STR demonstrates that a regular-sized model is sufficient to achieve effective ICL capabilities in STR.

    "title": "White-Box Transformers via Sparse Rate Reduction: Compression Is All There Is?",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we contend that a natural objective of representation learning is to compress and transform the distribution of the data, say sets of tokens, towards a low-dimensional Gaussian mixture supported on incoherent subspaces. The goodness of such a representation can be evaluated by a principled measure, called sparse rate reduction, that simultaneously maximizes the intrinsic information gain and extrinsic sparsity of the learned representation. From this perspective, popular deep network architectures, including transformers, can be viewed as realizing iterative schemes to optimize this measure. Particularly, we derive a transformer block from alternating optimization on parts of this objective: the multi-head self-attention operator compresses the representation by implementing an approximate gradient descent step on the coding rate of the features, and the subsequent multi-layer perceptron sparsifies the features. This leads to a family of white-box transformer-like deep network architectures, named CRATE, which are mathematically fully interpretable. We show, by way of a novel connection between denoising and compression, that the inverse to the aforementioned compressive encoding can be realized by the same class of CRATE architectures. Thus, the so-derived white-box architectures are universal to both encoders and decoders. Experiments show that these networks, despite their simplicity, indeed learn to compress and sparsify representations of large-scale real-world image and text datasets, and achieve performance very close to highly engineered transformer-based models: ViT, MAE, DINO, BERT, and GPT2. We believe the proposed computational framework demonstrates great potential in bridging the gap between theory and practice of deep learning, from a unified perspective of data compression.

    "abstract": "Pericoronary adipose tissue (PCAT) is the deposition of fat in the vicinity of the coronary arteries. It is an indicator of coronary inflammation and associated with coronary artery disease. Non-invasive coronary CT angiography (CCTA) is presently used to obtain measures of the thickness, volume, and attenuation of fat deposition. However, prior works solely focus on measuring PCAT using semi-automated approaches at the right coronary artery (RCA) over the left coronary artery (LCA). In this pilot work, we developed a fully automated approach for the measurement of PCAT mean attenuation and volume in the region around both coronary arteries. First, we used a large subset of patients from the public ImageCAS dataset (n = 735) to train a 3D full resolution nnUNet to segment LCA and RCA. Then, we automatically measured PCAT in the surrounding arterial regions. We evaluated our method on a held-out test set of patients (n = 183) from the same dataset. A mean Dice score of 83% and PCAT attenuation of -73.81 $\\pm$ 12.69 HU was calculated for the RCA, while a mean Dice score of 81% and PCAT attenuation of -77.51 $\\pm$ 7.94 HU was computed for the LCA. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to develop a fully automated method to measure PCAT attenuation and volume at both the RCA and LCA.

Such meshless integration enables versatile simulations of complex and codimensional shapes. We adaptively place the least-square kernels according to the NeRF density field to significantly reduce the complexity of the nonlinear simulation.

    "abstract": "The open source of large amounts of image data promotes the development of deep learning techniques. Along with this comes the privacy risk of these open-source image datasets being exploited by unauthorized third parties to train deep learning models for commercial or illegal purposes. To avoid the abuse of public data, a poisoning-based technique, the unlearnable example, is proposed to significantly degrade the generalization performance of models by adding a kind of imperceptible noise to the data. To further enhance its robustness against adversarial training, existing works leverage iterative adversarial training on both the defensive noise and the surrogate model. However, it still remains unknown whether the robustness of unlearnable examples primarily comes from the effect of enhancement in the surrogate model or the defensive noise. Observing that simply removing the adversarial noise on the training process of the defensive noise can improve the performance of robust unlearnable examples, we identify that solely the surrogate model's robustness contributes to the performance. Furthermore, we found a negative correlation exists between the robustness of defensive noise and the protection performance, indicating defensive noise's instability issue. Motivated by this, to further boost the robust unlearnable example, we introduce stable error-minimizing noise (SEM), which trains the defensive noise against random perturbation instead of the time-consuming adversarial perturbation to improve the stability of defensive noise. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that SEM achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet Subset in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.

    "abstract": "Synthetic samples from diffusion models are promising for leveraging in training discriminative models as replications of real training datasets. However, we found that the synthetic datasets degrade classification performance over real datasets even when using state-of-the-art diffusion models. This means that modern diffusion models do not perfectly represent the data distribution for the purpose of replicating datasets for training discriminative tasks. This paper investigates the gap between synthetic and real samples by analyzing the synthetic samples reconstructed from real samples through the diffusion and reverse process. By varying the time steps starting the reverse process in the reconstruction, we can control the trade-off between the information in the original real data and the information added by diffusion models. Through assessing the reconstructed samples and trained models, we found that the synthetic data are concentrated in modes of the training data distribution as the reverse step increases, and thus, they are difficult to cover the outer edges of the distribution. Our findings imply that modern diffusion models are insufficient to replicate training data distribution perfectly, and there is room for the improvement of generative modeling in the replication of training datasets",

However, video synthesis methods recently started to develop. This paper presents a new two-stage latent diffusion text-to-video generation architecture based on the text-to-image diffusion model. The first stage concerns keyframes synthesis to figure the storyline of a video, while the second one is devoted to interpolation frames generation to make movements of the scene and objects smooth. We compare several temporal conditioning approaches for keyframes generation. The results show the advantage of using separate temporal blocks over temporal layers in terms of metrics reflecting video generation quality aspects and human preference. The design of our interpolation model significantly reduces computational costs compared to other masked frame interpolation approaches. Furthermore, we evaluate different configurations of MoVQ-based video decoding scheme to improve consistency and achieve higher PSNR, SSIM, MSE, and LPIPS scores. Finally, we compare our pipeline with existing solutions and achieve top-2 scores overall and top-1 among open-source solutions: CLIPSIM = 0.2976 and FVD = 433.054.

Additionally, FuseNet incorporates a cross-modal fusion technique that extends the principles of CLIP by replacing textual data with augmented images. This approach enables the model to learn complex visual representations, enhancing robustness against variations similar to CLIP's text invariance. To further improve edge alignment and spatial consistency between neighboring pixels, we introduce an edge refinement loss. This loss function considers edge information to enhance spatial coherence, facilitating the grouping of nearby pixels with similar visual features.

Inspired by these prior works, we present two more flexible methods called descriptor and word soups, which do not require an LLM at test time and can leverage training data to increase OOD target accuracy. Descriptor soup greedily selects a small set of textual descriptors using generic few-shot training data, then calculates robust class embeddings using the selected descriptors. Word soup greedily assembles a chain of words in a similar manner. Compared to existing few-shot soft prompt tuning methods, word soup requires fewer parameters by construction and less GPU memory, since it does not require backpropagation. Both soups outperform current published few-shot methods, even when combined with SoTA zero-shot methods, on cross-dataset and domain generalization benchmarks. Compared with SoTA prompt and descriptor ensembling methods, such as ProDA and WaffleCLIP, word soup achieves higher OOD accuracy with fewer ensemble members.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "High-resolution Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images are crucial for ophthalmology studies but are limited by their relatively narrow field of view (FoV). Image mosaicking is a technique for aligning multiple overlapping images to obtain a larger FoV. Current mosaicking pipelines often struggle with substantial noise and considerable displacement between the input sub-fields. In this paper, we propose a versatile pipeline for stitching multi-view OCT/OCTA \\textit{en face} projection images. Our method combines the strengths of learning-based feature matching and robust pixel-based registration to align multiple images effectively. Furthermore, we advance the application of a trained foundational model, Segment Anything Model (SAM), to validate mosaicking results in an unsupervised manner. The efficacy of our pipeline is validated using an in-house dataset and a large public dataset, where our method shows superior performance in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency. We also made our evaluation tool for image mosaicking and the corresponding pipeline publicly available at \\url{https://github.com/MedICL-VU/OCT-mosaicking}",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Monocular depth estimation is an important step in many downstream tasks in machine vision. We address the topic of estimating monocular depth from defocus blur which can yield more accurate results than the semantic based depth estimation methods. The existing monocular depth from defocus techniques are sensitive to the particular camera that the images are taken from. We show how several camera-related parameters affect the defocus blur using optical physics equations and how they make the defocus blur depend on these parameters. The simple correction procedure we propose can alleviate this problem which does not require any retraining of the original model. We created a synthetic dataset which can be used to test the camera independent performance of depth from defocus blur models. We evaluate our model on both synthetic and real datasets (DDFF12 and NYU depth V2) obtained with different cameras and show that our methods are significantly more robust to the changes of cameras.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "This paper introduces GeoMorph, a novel geometric deep-learning framework designed for image registration of cortical surfaces. The registration process consists of two main steps. First, independent feature extraction is performed on each input surface using graph convolutions, generating low-dimensional feature representations that capture important cortical surface characteristics. Subsequently, features are registered in a deep-discrete manner to optimize the overlap of common structures across surfaces by learning displacements of a set of control points. To ensure smooth and biologically plausible deformations, we implement regularization through a deep conditional random field implemented with a recurrent neural network. Experimental results demonstrate that GeoMorph surpasses existing deep-learning methods by achieving improved alignment with smoother deformations. Furthermore, GeoMorph exhibits competitive performance compared to classical frameworks. Such versatility and robustness suggest strong potential for various neuroscience applications",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Geographic privacy, a crucial aspect of personal security, often goes unnoticed in daily activities. This paper addresses the underestimation of this privacy in the context of increasing online data sharing and the advancements in information gathering technologies. With the surge in the use of Large Multimodal Models, such as GPT-4, for Open Source Intelligence (OSINT), the potential risks associated with geographic privacy breaches have intensified. This study highlights the criticality of these developments, focusing on their implications for individual privacy. The primary objective is to demonstrate the capabilities of advanced AI tools, specifically a GPT-4 based model named \"Dr. Watson,\" in identifying and potentially compromising geographic privacy through online shared content. We developed \"Dr. Watson\" to analyze and extract geographic information from publicly available data sources. The study involved five experimental cases, each offering different perspectives on the tool's application in extracting precise location data from partial images and social media content. The experiments revealed that \"Dr. Watson\" could successfully identify specific geographic details, thereby exposing the vulnerabilities in current geo-privacy measures. These findings underscore the ease with which geographic information can be unintentionally disclosed. The paper concludes with a discussion on the broader implications of these findings for individuals and the community at large. It emphasizes the urgency for enhanced awareness and protective measures against geo-privacy leakage in the era of advanced AI and widespread social media usage",

    "abstract": "Soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration is the transfer and storage of atmospheric carbon dioxide in soils, which plays an important role in climate change mitigation. SOC concentration can be improved by proper land use, thus it is beneficial if SOC can be estimated at a regional or global scale. As multispectral satellite data can provide SOC-related information such as vegetation and soil properties at a global scale, estimation of SOC through satellite data has been explored as an alternative to manual soil sampling. Although existing studies show promising results, they are mainly based on pixel-based approaches with traditional machine learning methods, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are uncommon. To study the use of CNNs on SOC remote sensing, here we propose the FNO-DenseNet based on the Fourier neural operator (FNO). By combining the advantages of the FNO and DenseNet, the FNO-DenseNet outperformed the FNO in our experiments with hundreds of times fewer parameters. The FNO-DenseNet also outperformed a pixel-based random forest by 18% in the mean absolute percentage error",

When it comes to mobile collaborative robots, this flexibility can be further increased due to the autonomous mobility and navigation capacity of the robotic agents, expanding their workspace and consequently, the personalizable assistance they can provide to the human operators. This however requires that the robot is capable of detecting and identifying the human counterpart in all stages of the collaborative task, and in particular while following a human in crowded workplaces. To respond to this need, we developed a unified perception and navigation framework, which enables the robot to identify and follow a target person using a combination of visual Re-Identification (Re-ID), hand gestures detection, and collision-free navigation. The Re-ID module can autonomously learn the features of a target person and use the acquired knowledge to visually re-identify the target. The navigation stack is used to follow the target avoiding obstacles and other individuals in the environment.

    "abstract": "Robustly evaluating deep learning image classifiers is challenging due to some limitations of standard datasets. Natural Adversarial Examples (NAEs), arising naturally from the environment and capable of deceiving classifiers, are instrumental in identifying vulnerabilities in trained models. Existing works collect such NAEs by filtering from a huge set of real images, a process that is passive and lacks control. In this work, we propose to actively synthesize NAEs with the state-of-the-art Stable Diffusion. Specifically, our method formulates a controlled optimization process, where we perturb the token embedding that corresponds to a specified class to synthesize NAEs. The generation is guided by the gradient of loss from the target classifier so that the created image closely mimics the ground-truth class yet fools the classifier. Named SD-NAE (Stable Diffusion for Natural Adversarial Examples), our innovative method is effective in producing valid and useful NAEs, which is demonstrated through a meticulously designed experiment. Our work thereby provides a valuable method for obtaining challenging evaluation data, which in turn can potentially advance the development of more robust deep learning models.

This study addresses the inherent challenges in this domain, notably the detection of small objects, managing densely packed elements, and accounting for diverse orientations. We present an in-depth evaluation of an object detection model that integrates the Large Selective Kernel Network (LSKNet)as its backbone with the DiffusionDet head, utilizing the iSAID dataset for empirical analysis. Our approach encompasses the introduction of novel methodologies and extensive ablation studies. These studies critically assess various aspects such as loss functions, box regression techniques, and classification strategies to refine the model's precision in object detection. The paper details the experimental application of the LSKNet backbone in synergy with the DiffusionDet heads, a combination tailored to meet the specific challenges in aerial image object detection. The findings of this research indicate a substantial enhancement in the model's performance, especially in the accuracy-time tradeoff. The proposed model achieves a mean average precision (MAP) of approximately 45.7%, which is a significant improvement, outperforming the RCNN model by 4.7% on the same dataset.

Shape-from-Template (SfT) methods aim to reconstruct a template-based geometry from RGB images or video sequences, often leveraging just a single monocular camera without depth information, such as regular smartphone recordings. Unfortunately, existing reconstruction methods are either unphysical and noisy or slow in optimization. To solve this problem, we propose a novel SfT reconstruction algorithm for cloth using a pre-trained neural surrogate model that is fast to evaluate, stable, and produces smooth reconstructions due to a regularizing physics simulation. Differentiable rendering of the simulated mesh enables pixel-wise comparisons between the reconstruction and a target video sequence that can be used for a gradient-based optimization procedure to extract not only shape information but also physical parameters such as stretching, shearing, or bending stiffness of the cloth. This allows to retain a precise, stable, and smooth reconstructed geometry while reducing the runtime by a factor of 400-500 compared to $\\phi$-SfT, a state-of-the-art physics-based SfT approach",

Generating highly accurate intrinsic decompositions is an inherently under-constrained task that requires precisely estimating continuous-valued shading and albedo. In this work, we achieve high-resolution intrinsic decomposition by breaking the problem into two parts. First, we present a dense ordinal shading formulation using a shift- and scale-invariant loss in order to estimate ordinal shading cues without restricting the predictions to obey the intrinsic model. We then combine low- and high-resolution ordinal estimations using a second network to generate a shading estimate with both global coherency and local details. We encourage the model to learn an accurate decomposition by computing losses on the estimated shading as well as the albedo implied by the intrinsic model. We develop a straightforward method for generating dense pseudo ground truth using our model's predictions and multi-illumination data, enabling generalization to in-the-wild imagery. We present an exhaustive qualitative and quantitative analysis of our predicted intrinsic components against state-of-the-art methods.

Leveraging large-scale datasets of web-crawled video-text pairs as weak supervision has become a pre-training paradigm for learning joint representations and showcased remarkable potential in video understanding tasks. However, videos can be multi-event and multi-grained, while these video-text pairs usually contain only broad-level video captions. This raises a question: with such weak supervision, can video representation in video-language models gain the ability to distinguish even factual discrepancies in textual description and understand fine-grained events? To address this, we introduce SPOT Prober, to benchmark existing video-language models's capacities of distinguishing event-level discrepancies as an indicator of models' event understanding ability. Our approach involves extracting events as tuples (<Subject, Predicate, Object, Attribute, Timestamps>) from videos and generating false event tuples by manipulating tuple components systematically. We reevaluate the existing video-language models with these positive and negative captions and find they fail to distinguish most of the manipulated events.

    "abstract": "We propose a method to allow precise and extremely fast mesh extraction from 3D Gaussian Splatting. Gaussian Splatting has recently become very popular as it yields realistic rendering while being significantly faster to train than NeRFs. It is however challenging to extract a mesh from the millions of tiny 3D gaussians as these gaussians tend to be unorganized after optimization and no method has been proposed so far. Our first key contribution is a regularization term that encourages the gaussians to align well with the surface of the scene. We then introduce a method that exploits this alignment to extract a mesh from the Gaussians using Poisson reconstruction, which is fast, scalable, and preserves details, in contrast to the Marching Cubes algorithm usually applied to extract meshes from Neural SDFs. Finally, we introduce an optional refinement strategy that binds gaussians to the surface of the mesh, and jointly optimizes these Gaussians and the mesh through Gaussian splatting rendering. This enables easy editing, sculpting, rigging, animating, compositing and relighting of the Gaussians using traditional softwares by manipulating the mesh instead of the gaussians themselves. Retrieving such an editable mesh for realistic rendering is done within minutes with our method, compared to hours with the state-of-the-art methods on neural SDFs, while providing a better rendering quality",

    "abstract": "Iris recognition systems, operating in the near infrared spectrum (NIR), have demonstrated vulnerability to presentation attacks, where an adversary uses artifacts such as cosmetic contact lenses, artificial eyes or printed iris images in order to circumvent the system. At the same time, a number of effective presentation attack detection (PAD) methods have been developed. These methods have demonstrated success in detecting artificial eyes (e.g., fake Van Dyke eyes) as presentation attacks. In this work, we seek to alter the optical characteristics of artificial eyes by affixing Vanadium Dioxide (VO2) films on their surface in various spatial configurations. VO2 films can be used to selectively transmit NIR light and can, therefore, be used to regulate the amount of NIR light from the object that is captured by the iris sensor. We study the impact of such images produced by the sensor on two state-of-the-art iris PA detection methods. We observe that the addition of VO2 films on the surface of artificial eyes can cause the PA detection methods to misclassify them as bonafide eyes in some cases.

To address this issue, we propose the Swift Parameter-free Attention Network (SPAN), a highly efficient SISR model that balances parameter count, inference speed, and image quality. SPAN employs a novel parameter-free attention mechanism, which leverages symmetric activation functions and residual connections to enhance high-contribution information and suppress redundant information. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of this design in achieving the attention mechanism's purpose. We evaluate SPAN on multiple benchmarks, showing that it outperforms existing efficient super-resolution models in terms of both image quality and inference speed, achieving a significant quality-speed trade-off. This makes SPAN highly suitable for real-world applications, particularly in resource-constrained scenarios. Notably, our model attains the best PSNR of 27.09 dB, and the test runtime of our team is reduced by 7.08ms in the NTIRE 2023 efficient super-resolution challenge.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) exhibit superior performance in various machine learning tasks, e.g., image classification, speech recognition, biometric recognition, object detection, etc. However, it is essential to analyze their sensitivity to parameter perturbations before deploying them in real-world applications. In this work, we assess the sensitivity of DNNs against perturbations to their weight and bias parameters. The sensitivity analysis involves three DNN architectures (VGG, ResNet, and DenseNet), three types of parameter perturbations (Gaussian noise, weight zeroing, and weight scaling), and two settings (entire network and layer-wise). We perform experiments in the context of iris presentation attack detection and evaluate on two publicly available datasets: LivDet-Iris-2017 and LivDet-Iris-2020. Based on the sensitivity analysis, we propose improved models simply by perturbing parameters of the network without undergoing training. We further combine these perturbed models at the score-level and at the parameter-level to improve the performance over the original model. The ensemble at the parameter-level shows an average improvement of 43.58% on the LivDet-Iris-2017 dataset and 9.25% on the LivDet-Iris-2020 dataset.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel method of classifying malware into families using high-resolution greyscale images and multiple instance learning to overcome adversarial binary enlargement. Current methods of visualisation-based malware classification largely rely on lossy transformations of inputs such as resizing to handle the large, variable-sized images. Through empirical analysis and experimentation, it is shown that these approaches cause crucial information loss that can be exploited. The proposed solution divides the images into patches and uses embedding-based multiple instance learning with a convolutional neural network and an attention aggregation function for classification. The implementation is evaluated on the Microsoft Malware Classification dataset and achieves accuracies of up to $96.6\\%$ on adversarially enlarged samples compared to the baseline of $22.8\\%$.

    "abstract": "A sketch is one of the most intuitive and versatile tools humans use to convey their ideas visually. An animated sketch opens another dimension to the expression of ideas and is widely used by designers for a variety of purposes. Animating sketches is a laborious process, requiring extensive experience and professional design skills. In this work, we present a method that automatically adds motion to a single-subject sketch (hence, \"breathing life into it\"), merely by providing a text prompt indicating the desired motion. The output is a short animation provided in vector representation, which can be easily edited. Our method does not require extensive training, but instead leverages the motion prior of a large pretrained text-to-video diffusion model using a score-distillation loss to guide the placement of strokes. To promote natural and smooth motion and to better preserve the sketch's appearance, we model the learned motion through two components. The first governs small local deformations and the second controls global affine transformations. Surprisingly, we find that even models that struggle to generate sketch videos on their own can still serve as a useful backbone for animating abstract representations",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "3D occupancy prediction is an important task for the robustness of vision-centric autonomous driving, which aims to predict whether each point is occupied in the surrounding 3D space. Existing methods usually require 3D occupancy labels to produce meaningful results. However, it is very laborious to annotate the occupancy status of each voxel. In this paper, we propose SelfOcc to explore a self-supervised way to learn 3D occupancy using only video sequences. We first transform the images into the 3D space (e.g., bird's eye view) to obtain 3D representation of the scene. We directly impose constraints on the 3D representations by treating them as signed distance fields. We can then render 2D images of previous and future frames as self-supervision signals to learn the 3D representations. We propose an MVS-embedded strategy to directly optimize the SDF-induced weights with multiple depth proposals. Our SelfOcc outperforms the previous best method SceneRF by 58.7% using a single frame as input on SemanticKITTI and is the first self-supervised work that produces reasonable 3D occupancy for surround cameras on Occ3D. SelfOcc produces high-quality depth and achieves state-of-the-art results on novel depth synthesis, monocular depth estimation, and surround-view depth estimation on the SemanticKITTI, KITTI-2015, and nuScenes, respectively.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The latest generation of transformer-based vision models have proven to be superior to Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based models across several vision tasks, largely attributed to their remarkable prowess in relation modeling. Deformable vision transformers significantly reduce the quadratic complexity of modeling attention by using sparse attention structures, enabling them to be used in larger scale applications such as multi-view vision systems. Recent work demonstrated adversarial attacks against transformers; we show that these attacks do not transfer to deformable transformers due to their sparse attention structure. Specifically, attention in deformable transformers is modeled using pointers to the most relevant other tokens. In this work, we contribute for the first time adversarial attacks that manipulate the attention of deformable transformers, distracting them to focus on irrelevant parts of the image. We also develop new collaborative attacks where a source patch manipulates attention to point to a target patch that adversarially attacks the system. In our experiments, we find that only 1% patched area of the input field can lead to 0% AP. We also show that the attacks provide substantial versatility to support different attacker scenarios because of their ability to redirect attention under the attacker control",

Our empirical evaluations on synthetic datasets reveal that Q-Seg offers better runtime performance against the classical optimizer Gurobi. Furthermore, we evaluate our method on segmentation of Earth Observation images, an area of application where the amount of labeled data is usually very limited. In this case, Q-Seg demonstrates near-optimal results in flood mapping detection with respect to classical supervised state-of-the-art machine learning methods. Also, Q-Seg provides enhanced segmentation for forest coverage compared to existing annotated masks. Thus, Q-Seg emerges as a viable alternative for real-world applications using available quantum hardware, particularly in scenarios where the lack of labeled data and computational runtime are critical",

These metrics should be chosen so as to capture the downstream impact of each module and the performance of the system as a whole. For example, high perception quality should enable prediction and planning to be performed safely. Even though this is true in general, we show here that it is possible to construct planner inputs that score very highly on various perception quality metrics but still lead to planning failures. In an analogy to adversarial attacks on image classifiers, we call such inputs \\textbf{adversarial perception errors} and show they can be systematically constructed using a simple boundary-attack algorithm. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this algorithm by finding attacks for two different black-box planners in several urban and highway driving scenarios using the CARLA simulator. Finally, we analyse the properties of these attacks and show that they are isolated in the input space of the planner, and discuss their implications for AD system deployment and testing",

In this work, we investigate the localisation of features learned via two varied learning paradigms and demonstrate the superiority of one learning approach with respect to localisation. Our analysis on medical and natural datasets show that the traditional end-to-end (E2E) learning strategy has a limited ability to localise discriminative features across multiple network layers. We show that a layer-wise learning strategy, namely cascade learning (CL), results in more localised features. Considering localisation accuracy, we not only show that CL outperforms E2E but that it is a promising method of predicting regions. On the YOLO object detection framework, our best result shows that CL outperforms the E2E scheme by $2\\%$ in mAP",

    "title": "Transferring to Real-World Layouts: A Depth-aware Framework for Scene Adaptation",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Scene segmentation via unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) enables the transfer of knowledge acquired from source synthetic data to real-world target data, which largely reduces the need for manual pixel-level annotations in the target domain. To facilitate domain-invariant feature learning, existing methods typically mix data from both the source domain and target domain by simply copying and pasting the pixels. Such vanilla methods are usually sub-optimal since they do not take into account how well the mixed layouts correspond to real-world scenarios. Real-world scenarios are with an inherent layout. We observe that semantic categories, such as sidewalks, buildings, and sky, display relatively consistent depth distributions, and could be clearly distinguished in a depth map. Based on such observation, we propose a depth-aware framework to explicitly leverage depth estimation to mix the categories and facilitate the two complementary tasks, i.e., segmentation and depth learning in an end-to-end manner. In particular, the framework contains a Depth-guided Contextual Filter (DCF) forndata augmentation and a cross-task encoder for contextual learning. DCF simulates the real-world layouts, while the cross-task encoder further adaptively fuses the complementing features between two tasks. Besides, it is worth noting that several public datasets do not provide depth annotation. Therefore, we leverage the off-the-shelf depth estimation network to generate the pseudo depth. Extensive experiments show that our proposed methods, even with pseudo depth, achieve competitive performance on two widely-used bench-marks, i.e. 77.7 mIoU on GTA to Cityscapes and 69.3 mIoU on Synthia to Cityscapes",

    "abstract": "Capturing smooth motions from videos using markerless techniques typically involves complex processes such as temporal constraints, multiple stages with data-driven regression and optimization, and bundle solving over temporal windows. These processes can be inefficient and require tuning multiple objectives across stages. In contrast, BundleMoCap introduces a novel and efficient approach to this problem. It solves the motion capture task in a single stage, eliminating the need for temporal smoothness objectives while still delivering smooth motions. BundleMoCap outperforms the state-of-the-art without increasing complexity. The key concept behind BundleMoCap is manifold interpolation between latent keyframes. By relying on a local manifold smoothness assumption, we can efficiently solve a bundle of frames using a single code. Additionally, the method can be implemented as a sliding window optimization and requires only the first frame to be properly initialized, reducing the overall computational burden. BundleMoCap's strength lies in its ability to achieve high-quality motion capture results with simplicity and efficiency. More details can be found at https://moverseai.github.io/bundle/",

In contrast to LLMs, human preference learning has not been widely explored in text-to-image diffusion models; the best existing approach is to fine-tune a pretrained model using carefully curated high quality images and captions to improve visual appeal and text alignment. We propose Diffusion-DPO, a method to align diffusion models to human preferences by directly optimizing on human comparison data. Diffusion-DPO is adapted from the recently developed Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), a simpler alternative to RLHF which directly optimizes a policy that best satisfies human preferences under a classification objective. We re-formulate DPO to account for a diffusion model notion of likelihood, utilizing the evidence lower bound to derive a differentiable objective. Using the Pick-a-Pic dataset of 851K crowdsourced pairwise preferences, we fine-tune the base model of the state-of-the-art Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL)-1.0 model with Diffusion-DPO. Our fine-tuned base model significantly outperforms both base SDXL-1.0 and the larger SDXL-1.0 model consisting of an additional refinement model in human evaluation, improving visual appeal and prompt alignment.

    "abstract": "Whenever a sensor is mounted on a robot hand it is important to know the relationship between the sensor and the hand. The problem of determining this relationship is referred to as hand-eye calibration, which is important in at least two types of tasks: (i) map sensor centered measurements into the robot workspace and (ii) allow the robot to precisely move the sensor. In the past some solutions were proposed in the particular case of a camera. With almost no exception, all existing solutions attempt to solve the homogeneous matrix equation AX=XB. First we show that there are two possible formulations of the hand-eye calibration problem. One formulation is the classical one that we just mentioned. A second formulation takes the form of the following homogeneous matrix equation: MY=M'YB. The advantage of the latter is that the extrinsic and intrinsic camera parameters need not be made explicit. Indeed, this formulation directly uses the 3 by 4 perspective matrices (M and M') associated with two positions of the camera. Moreover, this formulation together with the classical one cover a wider range of camera-based sensors to be calibrated with respect to the robot hand. Second, we develop a common mathematical framework to solve for the hand-eye calibration problem using either of the two formulations. We present two methods, (i) a rotation then translation and (ii) a non-linear solver for rotation and translation. Third, we perform a stability analysis both for our two methods and for the classical linear method of Tsai and Lenz (1989). In the light of this comparison, the non-linear optimization method, that solves for rotation and translation simultaneously, seems to be the most robust one with respect to noise and to measurement errors",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Precise and rapid delineation of sharp boundaries and robust semantics is essential for numerous downstream robotic tasks, such as robot grasping and manipulation, real-time semantic mapping, and online sensor calibration performed on edge computing units. Although boundary detection and semantic segmentation are complementary tasks, most studies focus on lightweight models for semantic segmentation but overlook the critical role of boundary detection. In this work, we introduce Mobile-Seed, a lightweight, dual-task framework tailored for simultaneous semantic segmentation and boundary detection. Our framework features a two-stream encoder, an active fusion decoder (AFD) and a dual-task regularization approach. The encoder is divided into two pathways: one captures category-aware semantic information, while the other discerns boundaries from multi-scale features. The AFD module dynamically adapts the fusion of semantic and boundary information by learning channel-wise relationships, allowing for precise weight assignment of each channel. Furthermore, we introduce a regularization loss to mitigate the conflicts in dual-task learning and deep diversity supervision. Compared to existing methods, the proposed Mobile-Seed offers a lightweight framework to simultaneously improve semantic segmentation performance and accurately locate object boundaries. Experiments on the Cityscapes dataset have shown that Mobile-Seed achieves notable improvement over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baseline by 2.2 percentage points (pp) in mIoU and 4.2 pp in mF-score, while maintaining an online inference speed of 23.9 frames-per-second (FPS) with 1024x2048 resolution input on an RTX 2080 Ti GPU.

The indexing problem is therefore the problem of determining whether a graph extracted from the image is present or absent in a database of model graphs. We introduce a novel method for performing this graph indexing process which is based both on polynomial characterization of binary and weighted graphs and on hashing. We describe in detail this polynomial characterization and then we show how it can be used in the context of polyhedral object recognition. Next we describe a practical recognition-by-indexing system that includes the organization of the database, the representation of polyhedral objects in terms of 2-D characteristic views, the representation of this views in terms of weighted graphs, and the associated image processing.

Furthermore, previous evaluation methods focus more on the comprehension and reasoning of language content but lack a comprehensive evaluation of multimodal interactions, thereby resulting in potential limitations. To this end, we propose a novel KNVQA-Eval, which is devoted to knowledge-based VQA task evaluation to reflect the factuality of multimodal LVLMs. To ensure the robustness and scalability of the evaluation, we develop a new KNVQA dataset by incorporating human judgment and perception, aiming to evaluate the accuracy of standard answers relative to AI-generated answers in knowledge-based VQA. This work not only comprehensively evaluates the contextual information of LVLMs using reliable human annotations, but also further analyzes the fine-grained capabilities of current methods to reveal potential avenues for subsequent optimization of LVLMs-based estimators. Our proposed VQA-Eval and corresponding dataset KNVQA will facilitate the development of automatic evaluation tools with the advantages of low cost, privacy protection, and reproducibility. Our code will be released upon publication",

    "title": "GPT4Motion: Scripting Physical Motions in Text-to-Video Generation via Blender-Oriented GPT Planning",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Recent advances in text-to-video generation have harnessed the power of diffusion models to create visually compelling content conditioned on text prompts. However, they usually encounter high computational costs and often struggle to produce videos with coherent physical motions. To tackle these issues, we propose GPT4Motion, a training-free framework that leverages the planning capability of large language models such as GPT, the physical simulation strength of Blender, and the excellent image generation ability of text-to-image diffusion models to enhance the quality of video synthesis. Specifically, GPT4Motion employs GPT-4 to generate a Blender script based on a user textual prompt, which commands Blender's built-in physics engine to craft fundamental scene components that encapsulate coherent physical motions across frames. Then these components are inputted into Stable Diffusion to generate a video aligned with the textual prompt. Experimental results on three basic physical motion scenarios, including rigid object drop and collision, cloth draping and swinging, and liquid flow, demonstrate that GPT4Motion can generate high-quality videos efficiently in maintaining motion coherency and entity consistency. GPT4Motion offers new insights in text-to-video research, enhancing its quality and broadening its horizon for future explorations",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "High Content Imaging (HCI) plays a vital role in modern drug discovery and development pipelines, facilitating various stages from hit identification to candidate drug characterization. Applying machine learning models to these datasets can prove challenging as they typically consist of multiple batches, affected by experimental variation, especially if different imaging equipment have been used. Moreover, as new data arrive, it is preferable that they are analyzed in an online fashion. To overcome this, we propose CODA, an online self-supervised domain adaptation approach. CODA divides the classifier's role into a generic feature extractor and a task-specific model. We adapt the feature extractor's weights to the new domain using cross-batch self-supervision while keeping the task-specific model unchanged. Our results demonstrate that this strategy significantly reduces the generalization gap, achieving up to a 300% improvement when applied to data from different labs utilizing different microscopes. CODA can be applied to new, unlabeled out-of-domain data sources of different sizes, from a single plate to multiple experimental batches",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Current 3D semi-supervised segmentation methods face significant challenges such as limited consideration of contextual information and the inability to generate reliable pseudo-labels for effective unsupervised data use. To address these challenges, we introduce two distinct subnetworks designed to explore and exploit the discrepancies between them, ultimately correcting the erroneous prediction results. More specifically, we identify regions of inconsistent predictions and initiate a targeted verification training process. This procedure strategically fine-tunes and harmonizes the predictions of the subnetworks, leading to enhanced utilization of contextual information. Furthermore, to adaptively fine-tune the network's representational capacity and reduce prediction uncertainty, we employ a self-supervised contrastive learning paradigm. For this, we use the network's confidence to distinguish between reliable and unreliable predictions. The model is then trained to effectively minimize unreliable predictions. Our experimental results for organ segmentation, obtained from clinical MRI and CT scans, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach when compared to state-of-the-art methods.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Starting with early successes in computer vision tasks, deep learning based techniques have since overtaken state of the art approaches in a multitude of domains. However, it has been demonstrated time and again that these techniques fail to capture semantic context and logical constraints, instead often relying on spurious correlations to arrive at the answer. Since application of deep learning techniques to critical scenarios are dependent on adherence to domain specific constraints, several attempts have been made to address this issue. One limitation holding back a thorough exploration of this area, is a lack of suitable datasets which feature a rich set of rules. In order to address this, we present the ChessVision Dataset, consisting of 200,000+ images of annotated chess games in progress, requiring recreation of the game state from its corresponding image. This is accompanied by a curated set of rules which constrains the set of predictions to \"reasonable\" game states, and are designed to probe key semantic abilities like localization and enumeration. Alongside standard metrics, additional metrics to measure performance with regards to logical consistency is presented. We analyze several popular and state of the art vision models on this task, and show that, although their performance on standard metrics are laudable, they produce a plethora of incoherent results, indicating that this dataset presents a significant challenge for future works",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Recently, dense pseudo-label, which directly selects pseudo labels from the original output of the teacher model without any complicated post-processing steps, has received considerable attention in semi-supervised object detection (SSOD). However, for the multi-oriented and dense objects that are common in aerial scenes, existing dense pseudo-label selection methods are inefficient and impede the performance in semi-supervised oriented object detection. Therefore, we propose Adaptive Dense Pseudo Label Selection (ADPLS) for semi-supervised oriented object detection. In ADPLS, we design a simple but effective adaptive mechanism to guide the selection of dense pseudo labels. Specifically, we propose the mean Feature-Richness Score (mFRS) to estimate the density of potential objects and use this score to adjust the number of dense pseudo labels. On the DOTA-v1.5 benchmark, the proposed method outperforms previous methods especially when labeled data are scarce. For example, it achieves 49.78 mAP given only 5% of annotated data, which surpasses previous state-of-the-art method given 10% of annotated data by 1.15 mAP. Our codes will be available soon",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "To assist surgeons in the operating theatre, surgical phase recognition is critical for developing computer-assisted surgical systems, which requires comprehensive understanding of surgical videos. Although existing studies made great progress, there are still two significant limitations worthy of improvement. First, due to the compromise of resource consumption, frame-wise visual features are extracted by 2D networks and disregard spatial and temporal knowledge of surgical actions, which hinders subsequent inter-frame modeling for phase prediction. Second, these works simply utilize ordinary classification loss with one-hot phase labels to optimize the phase predictions, and cannot fully explore surgical videos under inadequate supervision. To overcome these two limitations, we propose a Surgical Temporal Action-aware Network with sequence Regularization, named STAR-Net, to recognize surgical phases more accurately from input videos. Specifically, we propose an efficient multi-scale surgical temporal action (MS-STA) module, which integrates visual features with spatial and temporal knowledge of surgical actions at the cost of 2D networks. Moreover, we devise the dual-classifier sequence regularization (DSR) to facilitate the training of STAR-Net by the sequence guidance of an auxiliary classifier with a smaller capacity. Our STAR-Net with MS-STA and DSR can exploit visual features of surgical actions with effective regularization, thereby leading to the superior performance of surgical phase recognition. Extensive experiments on a large-scale gastrectomy surgery dataset and the public Cholec80 benchmark prove that our STAR-Net significantly outperforms state-of-the-arts of surgical phase recognition",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Humans rely on their visual and tactile senses to develop a comprehensive 3D understanding of their physical environment. Recently, there has been a growing interest in exploring and manipulating objects using data-driven approaches that utilise high-resolution vision-based tactile sensors. However, 3D shape reconstruction using tactile sensing has lagged behind visual shape reconstruction because of limitations in existing techniques, including the inability to generalise over unseen shapes, the absence of real-world testing, and limited expressive capacity imposed by discrete representations. To address these challenges, we propose TouchSDF, a Deep Learning approach for tactile 3D shape reconstruction that leverages the rich information provided by a vision-based tactile sensor and the expressivity of the implicit neural representation DeepSDF. Our technique consists of two components: (1) a Convolutional Neural Network that maps tactile images into local meshes representing the surface at the touch location, and (2) an implicit neural function that predicts a signed distance function to extract the desired 3D shape. This combination allows TouchSDF to reconstruct smooth and continuous 3D shapes from tactile inputs in simulation and real-world settings, opening up research avenues for robust 3D-aware representations and improved multimodal perception in robotics.

Calculating hypoxia levels can be an important step in understanding the biology of tumours, their clinical progression and response to treatment. This study demonstrates a novel application of deep learning to evaluate hypoxia in the context of breast cancer histomorphology. More precisely, we show that Weakly Supervised Deep Learning (WSDL) models can accurately detect hypoxia associated features in routine Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) whole slide images (WSI). We trained and evaluated a deep Multiple Instance Learning model on tiles from WSI H&E tissue from breast cancer primary sites (n=240) obtaining on average an AUC of 0.87 on a left-out test set. We also showed significant differences between features of hypoxic and normoxic tissue regions as distinguished by the WSDL models. Such DL hypoxia H&E WSI detection models could potentially be extended to other tumour types and easily integrated into the pathology workflow without requiring additional costly assays",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) methods facilitate knowledge transfer from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, navigating the obstacle of domain shift. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a staple in UDA, the rise of Vision Transformers (ViTs) provides new avenues for domain generalization. This paper presents an innovative method to bolster ViT performance in source-free target adaptation, beginning with an evaluation of how key, query, and value elements affect ViT outcomes. Experiments indicate that altering the key component has negligible effects on Transformer performance. Leveraging this discovery, we introduce Domain Representation Images (DRIs), feeding embeddings through the key element. DRIs act as domain-specific markers, effortlessly merging with the training regimen. To assess our method, we perform target adaptation tests on the Cross Instance DRI source-only (SO) control. We measure the efficacy of target adaptation with and without DRIs, against existing benchmarks like SHOT-B* and adaptations via CDTrans. Findings demonstrate that excluding DRIs offers limited gains over SHOT-B*, while their inclusion in the key segment boosts average precision promoting superior domain generalization. This research underscores the vital role of DRIs in enhancing ViT efficiency in UDA scenarios, setting a precedent for further domain adaptation explorations",

To circumvent this limitation, we present HiPose, which establishes 3D-3D correspondences in a coarse-to-fine manner with a hierarchical binary surface encoding. Unlike previous dense-correspondence methods, we estimate the correspondence surface by employing point-to-surface matching and iteratively constricting the surface until it becomes a correspondence point while gradually removing outliers. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks LM-O, YCB-V, and T-Less demonstrate that our method surpasses all refinement-free methods and is even on par with expensive refinement-based approaches. Crucially, our approach is computationally efficient and enables real-time critical applications with high accuracy requirements. Code and models will be released",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Spatial and intensity normalization are nowadays a prerequisite for neuroimaging analysis. Influenced by voxel-wise and other univariate comparisons, where these corrections are key, they are commonly applied to any type of analysis and imaging modalities. Nuclear imaging modalities such as PET-FDG or FP-CIT SPECT, a common modality used in Parkinson's Disease diagnosis, are especially dependent on intensity normalization. However, these steps are computationally expensive and furthermore, they may introduce deformations in the images, altering the information contained in them. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for their part, introduce position invariance to pattern recognition, and have been proven to classify objects regardless of their orientation, size, angle, etc. Therefore, a question arises: how well can CNNs account for spatial and intensity differences when analysing nuclear brain imaging? Are spatial and intensity normalization still needed? To answer this question, we have trained four different CNN models based on well-established architectures, using or not different spatial and intensity normalization preprocessing. The results show that a sufficiently complex model such as our three-dimensional version of the ALEXNET can effectively account for spatial differences, achieving a diagnosis accuracy of 94.1% with an area under the ROC curve of 0.984. The visualization of the differences via saliency maps shows that these models are correctly finding patterns that match those found in the literature, without the need of applying any complex spatial normalization procedure. However, the intensity normalization -- and its type -- is revealed as very influential in the results and accuracy of the trained model, and therefore must be well accounted",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Recent advances in Neural radiance fields (NeRF) have enabled high-fidelity scene reconstruction for novel view synthesis. However, NeRF requires hundreds of network evaluations per pixel to approximate a volume rendering integral, making it slow to train. Caching NeRFs into explicit data structures can effectively enhance rendering speed but at the cost of higher memory usage. To address these issues, we present Hyb-NeRF, a novel neural radiance field with a multi-resolution hybrid encoding that achieves efficient neural modeling and fast rendering, which also allows for high-quality novel view synthesis. The key idea of Hyb-NeRF is to represent the scene using different encoding strategies from coarse-to-fine resolution levels. Hyb-NeRF exploits memory-efficiency learnable positional features at coarse resolutions and the fast optimization speed and local details of hash-based feature grids at fine resolutions. In addition, to further boost performance, we embed cone tracing-based features in our learnable positional encoding that eliminates encoding ambiguity and reduces aliasing artifacts. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that Hyb-NeRF achieves faster rendering speed with better rending quality and even a lower memory footprint in comparison to previous state-of-the-art methods",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Accurate and automated segmentation of intervertebral discs (IVDs) in medical images is crucial for assessing spine-related disorders, such as osteoporosis, vertebral fractures, or IVD herniation. We present HCA-Net, a novel contextual attention network architecture for semantic labeling of IVDs, with a special focus on exploiting prior geometric information. Our approach excels at processing features across different scales and effectively consolidating them to capture the intricate spatial relationships within the spinal cord. To achieve this, HCA-Net models IVD labeling as a pose estimation problem, aiming to minimize the discrepancy between each predicted IVD location and its corresponding actual joint location. In addition, we introduce a skeletal loss term to reinforce the model's geometric dependence on the spine. This loss function is designed to constrain the model's predictions to a range that matches the general structure of the human vertebral skeleton. As a result, the network learns to reduce the occurrence of false predictions and adaptively improves the accuracy of IVD location estimation. Through extensive experimental evaluation on multi-center spine datasets, our approach consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on both MRI T1w and T2w modalities.

    "abstract": "Different studies have shown the importance of visual cues throughout the speech perception process. In fact, the development of audiovisual approaches has led to advances in the field of speech technologies. However, although noticeable results have recently been achieved, visual speech recognition remains an open research problem. It is a task in which, by dispensing with the auditory sense, challenges such as visual ambiguities and the complexity of modeling silence must be faced. Nonetheless, some of these challenges can be alleviated when the problem is approached from a speaker-dependent perspective. Thus, this paper studies, using the Spanish LIP-RTVE database, how the estimation of specialized end-to-end systems for a specific person could affect the quality of speech recognition. First, different adaptation strategies based on the fine-tuning technique were proposed. Then, a pre-trained CTC/Attention architecture was used as a baseline throughout our experiments. Our findings showed that a two-step fine-tuning process, where the VSR system is first adapted to the task domain, provided significant improvements when the speaker adaptation was addressed. Furthermore, results comparable to the current state of the art were reached even when only a limited amount of data was available",

    "abstract": "In this work, we tackle the challenging problem of unsupervised video domain adaptation (UVDA) for action recognition. We specifically focus on scenarios with a substantial domain gap, in contrast to existing works primarily deal with small domain gaps between labeled source domains and unlabeled target domains. To establish a more realistic setting, we introduce a novel UVDA scenario, denoted as Kinetics->BABEL, with a more considerable domain gap in terms of both temporal dynamics and background shifts. To tackle the temporal shift, i.e., action duration difference between the source and target domains, we propose a global-local view alignment approach. To mitigate the background shift, we propose to learn temporal order sensitive representations by temporal order learning and background invariant representations by background augmentation. We empirically validate that the proposed method shows significant improvement over the existing methods on the Kinetics->BABEL dataset with a large domain gap.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Synthesizing medical images while preserving their structural information is crucial in medical research. In such scenarios, the preservation of anatomical content becomes especially important. Although recent advances have been made by incorporating instance-level information to guide translation, these methods overlook the spatial coherence of structural-level representation and the anatomical invariance of content during translation. To address these issues, we introduce hierarchical granularity discrimination, which exploits various levels of semantic information present in medical images. Our strategy utilizes three levels of discrimination granularity: pixel-level discrimination using a Brain Memory Bank, structure-level discrimination on each brain structure with a re-weighting strategy to focus on hard samples, and global-level discrimination to ensure anatomical consistency during translation. The image translation performance of our strategy has been evaluated on three independent datasets (UK Biobank, IXI, and BraTS 2018), and it has outperformed state-of-the-art algorithms. Particularly, our model excels not only in synthesizing normal structures but also in handling abnormal (pathological) structures, such as brain tumors, despite the variations in contrast observed across different imaging modalities due to their pathological characteristics. The diagnostic value of synthesized MR images containing brain tumors has been evaluated by radiologists. This indicates that our model may offer an alternative solution in scenarios where specific MR modalities of patients are unavailable. Extensive experiments further demonstrate the versatility of our method, providing unique insights into medical image translation",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Deducing a 3D human pose from a single 2D image or 2D keypoints is inherently challenging, given the fundamental ambiguity wherein multiple 3D poses can correspond to the same 2D representation. The acquisition of 3D data, while invaluable for resolving pose ambiguity, is expensive and requires an intricate setup, often restricting its applicability to controlled lab environments. We improve performance of monocular human pose estimation models using multiview data for fine-tuning. We propose a novel loss function, multiview consistency, to enable adding additional training data with only 2D supervision. This loss enforces that the inferred 3D pose from one view aligns with the inferred 3D pose from another view under similarity transformations. Our consistency loss substantially improves performance for fine-tuning with no available 3D data. Our experiments demonstrate that two views offset by 90 degrees are enough to obtain good performance, with only marginal improvements by adding more views. Thus, we enable the acquisition of domain-specific data by capturing activities with off-the-shelf cameras, eliminating the need for elaborate calibration procedures. This research introduces new possibilities for domain adaptation in 3D pose estimation, providing a practical and cost-effective solution to customize models for specific applications.

    "abstract": "Our work focuses on tackling large-scale fine-grained image retrieval as ranking the images depicting the concept of interests (i.e., the same sub-category labels) highest based on the fine-grained details in the query. It is desirable to alleviate the challenges of both fine-grained nature of small inter-class variations with large intra-class variations and explosive growth of fine-grained data for such a practical task. In this paper, we propose attribute-aware hashing networks with self-consistency for generating attribute-aware hash codes to not only make the retrieval process efficient, but also establish explicit correspondences between hash codes and visual attributes. Specifically, based on the captured visual representations by attention, we develop an encoder-decoder structure network of a reconstruction task to unsupervisedly distill high-level attribute-specific vectors from the appearance-specific visual representations without attribute annotations. Our models are also equipped with a feature decorrelation constraint upon these attribute vectors to strengthen their representative abilities. Then, driven by preserving original entities' similarity, the required hash codes can be generated from these attribute-specific vectors and thus become attribute-aware. Furthermore, to combat simplicity bias in deep hashing, we consider the model design from the perspective of the self-consistency principle and propose to further enhance models' self-consistency by equipping an additional image reconstruction path. Comprehensive quantitative experiments under diverse empirical settings on six fine-grained retrieval datasets and two generic retrieval datasets show the superiority of our models over competing methods",

In this work, we apply classical and deep-learning modelling techniques to the 2016, 2017 and 2019 Moonboard datasets, achieving state of the art grade prediction performance with 0.87 MAE and 1.12 RMSE. We achieve this performance on a feature-set that does not require decomposing routes into individual moves, which is a method common in literature and introduces bias. We also demonstrate the generalization capability of this model between editions and introduce a novel vision-based method of grade prediction. While the generalization performance of these techniques is below human level performance currently, we propose these methods as a basis for future work.

    "abstract": "For intelligent quadcopter UAVs, a robust and reliable autonomous planning system is crucial. Most current trajectory planning methods for UAVs are suitable for static environments but struggle to handle dynamic obstacles, which can pose challenges and even dangers to flight. To address this issue, this paper proposes a vision-based planning system that combines tracking and trajectory prediction of dynamic obstacles to achieve efficient and reliable autonomous flight. We use a lightweight object detection algorithm to identify dynamic obstacles and then use Kalman Filtering to track and estimate their motion states. During the planning phase, we not only consider static obstacles but also account for the potential movements of dynamic obstacles. For trajectory generation, we use a B-spline-based trajectory search algorithm, which is further optimized with various constraints to enhance safety and alignment with the UAV's motion characteristics. We conduct experiments in both simulation and real-world environments, and the results indicate that our approach can successfully detect and avoid obstacles in dynamic environments in real-time, offering greater reliability compared to existing approaches. Furthermore, with the advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology demonstrating exceptional zero-shot generalization capabilities, more user-friendly human-machine interactions have become feasible, and this study also explores the integration of autonomous planning systems with Large Language Models (LLMs)",

Different from rigid objects, articulated objects have higher degrees of freedom and are rich in geometries, semantics, and part functions. Modeling different kinds of parts and articulations with nerual networks plays an essential role in articulated object understanding and manipulation, and will further benefit 3D vision and robotics communities. To model articulated objects, most previous works directly encode articulated objects into feature representations, without specific designs for parts, articulations and part motions. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that explicitly disentangles the part motion of articulated objects by predicting the transformation matrix of points on the part surface, using spatially continuous neural implicit representations to model the part motion smoothly in the space. More importantly, while many methods could only model a certain kind of joint motion (such as the revolution in the clockwise order), our proposed framework is generic to different kinds of joint motions in that transformation matrix can model diverse kinds of joint motions in the space.

CASR works out by reducing the difference in the causal adjacency matrix between we constructed and pre-segmentation results of backbone models. In addition, we propose a novel evaluation metric Causal Edit Distance (CED) to evaluate the causal interpretability.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Parallel imaging is a commonly used technique to accelerate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data acquisition. Mathematically, parallel MRI reconstruction can be formulated as an inverse problem relating the sparsely sampled k-space measurements to the desired MRI image. Despite the success of many existing reconstruction algorithms, it remains a challenge to reliably reconstruct a high-quality image from highly reduced k-space measurements. Recently, implicit neural representation has emerged as a powerful paradigm to exploit the internal information and the physics of partially acquired data to generate the desired object. In this study, we introduced IMJENSE, a scan-specific implicit neural representation-based method for improving parallel MRI reconstruction. Specifically, the underlying MRI image and coil sensitivities were modeled as continuous functions of spatial coordinates, parameterized by neural networks and polynomials, respectively. The weights in the networks and coefficients in the polynomials were simultaneously learned directly from sparsely acquired k-space measurements, without fully sampled ground truth data for training. Benefiting from the powerful continuous representation and joint estimation of the MRI image and coil sensitivities, IMJENSE outperforms conventional image or k-space domain reconstruction algorithms. With extremely limited calibration data, IMJENSE is more stable than supervised calibrationless and calibration-based deep-learning methods. Results show that IMJENSE robustly reconstructs the images acquired at 5$\\mathbf{\\times}$ and 6$\\mathbf{\\times}$ accelerations with only 4 or 8 calibration lines in 2D Cartesian acquisitions, corresponding to 22.0% and 19.5% undersampling rates. The high-quality results and scanning specificity make the proposed method hold the potential for further accelerating the data acquisition of parallel MRI",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Transparent objects are widely used in our daily lives, making it important to teach robots to interact with them. However, it's not easy because the reflective and refractive effects can make RGB-D cameras fail to give accurate geometry measurements. To solve this problem, this paper introduces RFTrans, an RGB-D-based method for surface normal estimation and manipulation of transparent objects. By leveraging refractive flow as an intermediate representation, RFTrans circumvents the drawbacks of directly predicting the geometry (e.g. surface normal) from RGB images and helps bridge the sim-to-real gap. RFTrans integrates the RFNet, which predicts refractive flow, object mask, and boundaries, followed by the F2Net, which estimates surface normal from the refractive flow. To make manipulation possible, a global optimization module will take in the predictions, refine the raw depth, and construct the point cloud with normal. An analytical grasp planning algorithm, ISF, is followed to generate the grasp poses. We build a synthetic dataset with physically plausible ray-tracing rendering techniques to train the networks. Results show that the RFTrans trained on the synthetic dataset can consistently outperform the baseline ClearGrasp in both synthetic and real-world benchmarks by a large margin. Finally, a real-world robot grasping task witnesses an 83% success rate, proving that refractive flow can help enable direct sim-to-real transfer.

    "title": "Rich and Poor Texture Contrast: A Simple yet Effective Approach for AI-generated Image Detection",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Recent generative models show impressive performance in generating photographic images. Humans can hardly distinguish such incredibly realistic-looking AI-generated images from real ones. AI-generated images may lead to ubiquitous disinformation dissemination. Therefore, it is of utmost urgency to develop a detector to identify AI-generated images. Most existing detectors suffer from sharp performance drops over unseen generative models. In this paper, we propose a novel AI-generated image detector capable of identifying fake images created by a wide range of generative models. Our approach leverages the inter-pixel correlation contrast between rich and poor texture regions within an image. Pixels in rich texture regions exhibit more significant fluctuations than those in poor texture regions. This discrepancy reflects that the entropy of rich texture regions is larger than that of poor ones. Consequently, synthesizing realistic rich texture regions proves to be more challenging for existing generative models. Based on this principle, we divide an image into multiple patches and reconstruct them into two images, comprising rich-texture and poor-texture patches respectively. Subsequently, we extract the inter-pixel correlation discrepancy feature between rich and poor texture regions. This feature serves as a universal fingerprint used for AI-generated image forensics across different generative models. In addition, we build a comprehensive AI-generated image detection benchmark, which includes 16 kinds of prevalent generative models, to evaluate the effectiveness of existing baselines and our approach. Our benchmark provides a leaderboard for follow-up studies. Extensive experimental results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by a significant margin.

    "abstract": "Addressing the challenge of adapting pre-trained vision-language models for generating insightful explanations for visual reasoning tasks with limited annotations, we present ReVisE: a $\\textbf{Re}$cursive $\\textbf{Vis}$ual $\\textbf{E}$xplanation algorithm. Our method iteratively computes visual features (conditioned on the text input), an answer, and an explanation, to improve the explanation quality step by step until the answer converges. We find that this multi-step approach guides the model to correct its own answers and outperforms single-step explanation generation. Furthermore, explanations generated by ReVisE also serve as valuable annotations for few-shot self-training. Our approach outperforms previous methods while utilizing merely 5% of the human-annotated explanations across 10 metrics, demonstrating up to a 4.2 and 1.3 increase in BLEU-1 score on the VCR and VQA-X datasets, underscoring the efficacy and data-efficiency of our method",

    "title": "Point, Segment and Count: A Generalized Framework for Object Counting",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Class-agnostic object counting aims to count all objects in an image with respect to example boxes or class names, \\emph{a.k.a} few-shot and zero-shot counting. Current state-of-the-art methods highly rely on density maps to predict object counts, which lacks model interpretability. In this paper, we propose a generalized framework for both few-shot and zero-shot object counting based on detection. Our framework combines the superior advantages of two foundation models without compromising their zero-shot capability: (\\textbf{i}) SAM to segment all possible objects as mask proposals, and (\\textbf{ii}) CLIP to classify proposals to obtain accurate object counts. However, this strategy meets the obstacles of efficiency overhead and the small crowded objects that cannot be localized and distinguished. To address these issues, our framework, termed PseCo, follows three steps: point, segment, and count. Specifically, we first propose a class-agnostic object localization to provide accurate but least point prompts for SAM, which consequently not only reduces computation costs but also avoids missing small objects. Furthermore, we propose a generalized object classification that leverages CLIP image/text embeddings as the classifier, following a hierarchical knowledge distillation to obtain discriminative classifications among hierarchical mask proposals. Extensive experimental results on FSC-147 dataset demonstrate that PseCo achieves state-of-the-art performance in both few-shot/zero-shot object counting/detection, with additional results on large-scale COCO and LVIS datasets.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel approach to synthesize texture to dress up a given 3D object, given a text prompt. Based on the pretrained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model, existing methods usually employ a project-and-inpaint approach, in which a view of the given object is first generated and warped to another view for inpainting. But it tends to generate inconsistent texture due to the asynchronous diffusion of multiple views. We believe such asynchronous diffusion and insufficient information sharing among views are the root causes of the inconsistent artifact. In this paper, we propose a synchronized multi-view diffusion approach that allows the diffusion processes from different views to reach a consensus of the generated content early in the process, and hence ensures the texture consistency. To synchronize the diffusion, we share the denoised content among different views in each denoising step, specifically blending the latent content in the texture domain from views with overlap. Our method demonstrates superior performance in generating consistent, seamless, highly detailed textures, comparing to state-of-the-art methods",

Current visual programming methods generate programs in a single pass for each task where the ability to evaluate and optimize based on feedback, unfortunately, is lacking, which consequentially limits their effectiveness for complex, multi-step problems. Drawing inspiration from benders decomposition, we introduce De-fine, a general framework that automatically decomposes complex tasks into simpler subtasks and refines programs through auto-feedback. This model-agnostic approach can improve logical reasoning performance by integrating the strengths of multiple models.

Specifically, we propose a Bayesian classification head that exploits an informative hierarchical structure. It jointly predicts the super-category or type of relationship between the two objects, along with the detailed relationship under each super-category. We design a commonsense validation pipeline that uses a large language model to critique the results from the scene graph prediction system and then use that feedback to enhance the model performance. The system requires no external large language model assistance at test time, making it more convenient for practical applications. Experiments on the Visual Genome and the OpenImage V6 datasets demonstrate that harnessing hierarchical relationships enhances the model performance by a large margin. The proposed Bayesian head can also be incorporated as a portable module in existing scene graph generation algorithms to improve their results. In addition, the commonsense validation enables the model to generate an extensive set of reasonable predictions beyond dataset annotations",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is a powerful technique for model compression, reducing the precision of neural networks without additional training overhead. Recent works have investigated adopting 8-bit floating-point quantization (FP8) in the context of PTQ for model inference. However, the exploration of floating-point formats smaller than 8 bits and their comparison with integer quantization remains relatively limited. In this work, we present minifloats, which are reduced-precision floating-point formats capable of further reducing the memory footprint, latency, and energy cost of a model while approaching full-precision model accuracy. Our work presents a novel PTQ design-space exploration, comparing minifloat and integer quantization schemes across a range of 3 to 8 bits for both weights and activations. We examine the applicability of various PTQ techniques to minifloats, including weight equalization, bias correction, SmoothQuant, gradient-based learned rounding, and the GPTQ method. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of low-precision minifloats when compared to their integer counterparts across a spectrum of accuracy-precision trade-offs on a set of reference deep learning vision workloads. Finally, we evaluate our results against an FPGA-based hardware cost model, showing that integer quantization often remains the Pareto-optimal option, given its relatively smaller hardware resource footprint",

Synthetic data offers a promising solution, especially with recent advances in diffusion-based methods like stable diffusion (SD). However, the direct application of diffusion methods to aerial domains poses unique challenges: stable diffusion's optimization for rich ground-level semantics doesn't align with the sparse nature of aerial objects, and the extraction of post-synthesis object coordinates remains problematic. To address these challenges, we introduce a synthetic data augmentation framework tailored for aerial images. It encompasses sparse-to-dense region of interest (ROI) extraction to bridge the semantic gap, fine-tuning the diffusion model with low-rank adaptation (LORA) to circumvent exhaustive retraining, and finally, a Copy-Paste method to compose synthesized objects with backgrounds, providing a nuanced approach to aerial object detection through synthetic data",

    "abstract": "Due to the distinctive characteristics of sensors, each modality exhibits unique physical properties. For this reason, in the context of multi-modal action recognition, it is important to consider not only the overall action content but also the complementary nature of different modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel network, named Modality Mixer (M-Mixer) network, which effectively leverages and incorporates the complementary information across modalities with the temporal context of actions for action recognition. A key component of our proposed M-Mixer is the Multi-modal Contextualization Unit (MCU), a simple yet effective recurrent unit. Our MCU is responsible for temporally encoding a sequence of one modality (e.g., RGB) with action content features of other modalities (e.g., depth and infrared modalities). This process encourages M-Mixer network to exploit global action content and also to supplement complementary information of other modalities. Furthermore, to extract appropriate complementary information regarding to the given modality settings, we introduce a new module, named Complementary Feature Extraction Module (CFEM). CFEM incorporates sepearte learnable query embeddings for each modality, which guide CFEM to extract complementary information and global action content from the other modalities. As a result, our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA datasets. Moreover, through comprehensive ablation studies, we further validate the effectiveness of our proposed method",

    "abstract": "Histopathology image analysis is the golden standard of clinical diagnosis for Cancers. In doctors daily routine and computer-aided diagnosis, the Whole Slide Image (WSI) of histopathology tissue is used for analysis. Because of the extremely large scale of resolution, previous methods generally divide the WSI into a large number of patches, then aggregate all patches within a WSI by Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) to make the slide-level prediction when developing computer-aided diagnosis tools. However, most previous WSI-MIL models using global-attention without pairwise interaction and any positional information, or self-attention with absolute position embedding can not well handle shape varying large WSIs, e.g. testing WSIs after model deployment may be larger than training WSIs, since the model development set is always limited due to the difficulty of histopathology WSIs collection. To deal with the problem, in this paper, we propose to amend position embedding for shape varying long-contextual WSI by introducing Linear Bias into Attention, and adapt it from 1-d long sequence into 2-d long-contextual WSI which helps model extrapolate position embedding to unseen or under-fitted positions. We further utilize Flash-Attention module to tackle the computational complexity of Transformer, which also keep full self-attention performance compared to previous attention approximation work.

    "abstract": "Arbitrary oriented object detection (AOOD) in aerial images is a widely concerned and highly challenging task, and plays an important role in many scenarios. The core of AOOD involves the representation, encoding, and feature augmentation of oriented bounding-boxes (Bboxes). Existing methods lack intuitive modeling of angle difference measurement in oriented Bbox representations. Oriented Bboxes under different representations exhibit rotational symmetry with varying periods due to angle periodicity. The angular boundary discontinuity (ABD) problem at periodic boundary positions is caused by rotational symmetry in measuring angular differences. In addition, existing methods also use additional encoding-decoding structures for oriented Bboxes. In this paper, we design an angular boundary free loss (ABFL) based on the von Mises distribution. The ABFL aims to solve the ABD problem when detecting oriented objects. Specifically, ABFL proposes to treat angles as circular data rather than linear data when measuring angle differences, aiming to introduce angle periodicity to alleviate the ABD problem and improve the accuracy of angle difference measurement. In addition, ABFL provides a simple and effective solution for various periodic boundary discontinuities caused by rotational symmetry in AOOD tasks, as it does not require additional encoding-decoding structures for oriented Bboxes. Extensive experiments on the DOTA and HRSC2016 datasets show that the proposed ABFL loss outperforms some state-of-the-art methods focused on addressing the ABD problem",

This paper delves into the intricacies of infant action recognition, a domain that has remained relatively uncharted despite the accomplishments in adult action recognition. In this study, we introduce a groundbreaking dataset called ``InfActPrimitive'', encompassing five significant infant milestone action categories, and we incorporate specialized preprocessing for infant data. We conducted an extensive comparative analysis employing cutting-edge skeleton-based action recognition models using this dataset. Our findings reveal that, although the PoseC3D model achieves the highest accuracy at approximately 71%, the remaining models struggle to accurately capture the dynamics of infant actions.

Reproducing representative volume elements for further analysis of deformation and failure in metals, like 316L stainless steel, is particularly important due to their wide use in manufacturing goods today. Two approaches, initially created for video games, were considered for the procedural generation of representative grain microstructures. The first is the Wave Function Collapse (WFC) algorithm, and the second is constraint propagation and probabilistic inference through Markov Junior, a free and open-source software. This study aimed to investigate these two algorithms' effectiveness in using reference electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) maps and recreating a statistically similar one that could be used in further research. It utilized two stainless steel EBSD maps as references to test both algorithms. First, the WFC algorithm was too constricting and, thus, incapable of producing images that resembled EBSDs. The second, MarkovJunior, was much more effective in creating a Voronoi tessellation that could be used to create an EBSD map in Python. When comparing the results between the reference and the generated EBSD, we discovered that the orientation and volume fractions were extremely similar.

    "title": "Boosting Audio-visual Zero-shot Learning with Large Language Models",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Audio-visual zero-shot learning aims to recognize unseen categories based on paired audio-visual sequences. Recent methods mainly focus on learning aligned and discriminative multi-modal features to boost generalization towards unseen categories. However, these approaches ignore the obscure action concepts in category names and may inevitably introduce complex network structures with difficult training objectives. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective framework named Knowledge-aware Distribution Adaptation (KDA) to help the model better grasp the novel action contents with an external knowledge base. Specifically, we first propose using large language models to generate rich descriptions from category names, which leads to a better understanding of unseen categories. Additionally, we propose a distribution alignment loss as well as a knowledge-aware adaptive margin loss to further improve the generalization ability towards unseen categories. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed KDA can outperform state-of-the-art methods on three popular audio-visual zero-shot learning datasets.

Our method consists of three key components: (1) panoramic furniture detection and removal, (2) automatic floor layout design, and (3) global rendering with scene geometry, new furniture objects, and a real-time outdoor photograph. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our workflow in rendering indoor scenes under different outdoor illumination conditions.

A defining characteristic of our method is the seamless integration between physical simulation and visual rendering: both components utilize the same 3D Gaussian kernels as their discrete representations. This negates the necessity for triangle/tetrahedron meshing, marching cubes, \"cage meshes,\" or any other geometry embedding, highlighting the principle of \"what you see is what you simulate (WS$^2$).\" Our method demonstrates exceptional versatility across a wide variety of materials--including elastic entities, metals, non-Newtonian fluids, and granular materials--showcasing its strong capabilities in creating diverse visual content with novel viewpoints and movements.

A key aspect of this realism originates from the physical accuracy of both a true-to-life body shape and clothing. While physical simulations can produce high-quality, realistic motions for clothed humans, they require precise estimation of body shape and high-quality garment assets with associated physical parameters for cloth simulations. However, manually creating these assets and calibrating their parameters is labor-intensive and requires specialized expertise. To address this gap, we propose DiffAvatar, a novel approach that performs body and garment co-optimization using differentiable simulation. By integrating physical simulation into the optimization loop and accounting for the complex nonlinear behavior of cloth and its intricate interaction with the body, our framework recovers body and garment geometry and extracts important material parameters in a physically plausible way. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach generates realistic clothing and body shape that can be easily used in downstream applications",

    "abstract": "We present a method for semantically transferring the visual appearance of one natural image to another. Specifically, our goal is to generate an image in which objects in a source structure image are \"painted\" with the visual appearance of their semantically related objects in a target appearance image. To integrate semantic information into our framework, our key idea is to leverage a pre-trained and fixed Vision Transformer (ViT) model. Specifically, we derive novel disentangled representations of structure and appearance extracted from deep ViT features. We then establish an objective function that splices the desired structure and appearance representations, interweaving them together in the space of ViT features. Based on our objective function, we propose two frameworks of semantic appearance transfer -- \"Splice\", which works by training a generator on a single and arbitrary pair of structure-appearance images, and \"SpliceNet\", a feed-forward real-time appearance transfer model trained on a dataset of images from a specific domain. Our frameworks do not involve adversarial training, nor do they require any additional input information such as semantic segmentation or correspondences. We demonstrate high-resolution results on a variety of in-the-wild image pairs, under significant variations in the number of objects, pose, and appearance.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The aim of video summarization is to shorten videos automatically while retaining the key information necessary to convey the overall story. Video summarization methods mainly rely on visual factors, such as visual consecutiveness and diversity, which may not be sufficient to fully understand the content of the video. There are other non-visual factors, such as interestingness, representativeness, and storyline consistency that should also be considered for generating high-quality video summaries. Current methods do not adequately take into account these non-visual factors, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this work, a new approach to video summarization is proposed based on insights gained from how humans create ground truth video summaries. The method utilizes a conditional modeling perspective and introduces multiple meaningful random variables and joint distributions to characterize the key components of video summarization. Helper distributions are employed to improve the training of the model. A conditional attention module is designed to mitigate potential performance degradation in the presence of multi-modal input. The proposed video summarization method incorporates the above innovative design choices that aim to narrow the gap between human-generated and machine-generated video summaries. Extensive experiments show that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance on commonly used video summarization datasets",

    "title": "Model-aware 3D Eye Gaze from Weak and Few-shot Supervisions",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The task of predicting 3D eye gaze from eye images can be performed either by (a) end-to-end learning for image-to-gaze mapping or by (b) fitting a 3D eye model onto images. The former case requires 3D gaze labels, while the latter requires eye semantics or landmarks to facilitate the model fitting. Although obtaining eye semantics and landmarks is relatively easy, fitting an accurate 3D eye model on them remains to be very challenging due to its ill-posed nature in general. On the other hand, obtaining large-scale 3D gaze data is cumbersome due to the required hardware setups and computational demands. In this work, we propose to predict 3D eye gaze from weak supervision of eye semantic segmentation masks and direct supervision of a few 3D gaze vectors. The proposed method combines the best of both worlds by leveraging large amounts of weak annotations--which are easy to obtain, and only a few 3D gaze vectors--which alleviate the difficulty of fitting 3D eye models on the semantic segmentation of eye images. Thus, the eye gaze vectors, used in the model fitting, are directly supervised using the few-shot gaze labels. Additionally, we propose a transformer-based network architecture, that serves as a solid baseline for our improvements. Our experiments in diverse settings illustrate the significant benefits of the proposed method, achieving about 5 degrees lower angular gaze error over the baseline, when only 0.05% 3D annotations of the training images are used.

We relax the intrinsic model bias (i.e. using MLPs to encode local features as opposed to convolutions) and constrain the hypothesis space instead with an auxiliary regularization related to the reconstruction task, i.e. denoising. The resulting model is the first only-MLP locally conditioned implicit shape reconstruction from point cloud network with fast feed forward inference. Point cloud borne features and denoising offsets are predicted from an exclusively MLP-made network in a single forward pass. A decoder predicts occupancy probabilities for queries anywhere in space by pooling nearby features from the point cloud order-invariantly, guided by denoised relative positional encoding.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Transformers have been successfully applied in the field of video-based 3D human pose estimation. However, the high computational costs of these video pose transformers (VPTs) make them impractical on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we present a plug-and-play pruning-and-recovering framework, called Hourglass Tokenizer (HoT), for efficient transformer-based 3D human pose estimation from videos. Our HoT begins with pruning pose tokens of redundant frames and ends with recovering full-length tokens, resulting in a few pose tokens in the intermediate transformer blocks and thus improving the model efficiency. To effectively achieve this, we propose a token pruning cluster (TPC) that dynamically selects a few representative tokens with high semantic diversity while eliminating the redundancy of video frames. In addition, we develop a token recovering attention (TRA) to restore the detailed spatio-temporal information based on the selected tokens, thereby expanding the network output to the original full-length temporal resolution for fast inference. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets (i.e., Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP) demonstrate that our method can achieve both high efficiency and estimation accuracy compared to the original VPT models. For instance, applying to MotionBERT and MixSTE on Human3.6M, our HoT can save nearly 50% FLOPs without sacrificing accuracy and nearly 40% FLOPs with only 0.2% accuracy drop, respectively.

Concept Sliders are plug-and-play: they can be composed efficiently and continuously modulated, enabling precise control over image generation. In quantitative experiments comparing to previous editing techniques, our sliders exhibit stronger targeted edits with lower interference. We showcase sliders for weather, age, styles, and expressions, as well as slider compositions. We show how sliders can transfer latents from StyleGAN for intuitive editing of visual concepts for which textual description is difficult. We also find that our method can help address persistent quality issues in Stable Diffusion XL including repair of object deformations and fixing distorted hands.

    "title": "DAS: A Deformable Attention to Capture Salient Information in CNNs",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel in local spatial pattern recognition. For many vision tasks, such as object recognition and segmentation, salient information is also present outside CNN's kernel boundaries. However, CNNs struggle in capturing such relevant information due to their confined receptive fields. Self-attention can improve a model's access to global information but increases computational overhead. We present a fast and simple fully convolutional method called DAS that helps focus attention on relevant information. It uses deformable convolutions for the location of pertinent image regions and separable convolutions for efficiency. DAS plugs into existing CNNs and propagates relevant information using a gating mechanism. Compared to the O(n^2) computational complexity of transformer-style attention, DAS is O(n). Our claim is that DAS's ability to pay increased attention to relevant features results in performance improvements when added to popular CNNs for Image Classification and Object Detection. For example, DAS yields an improvement on Stanford Dogs (4.47%), ImageNet (1.91%), and COCO AP (3.3%) with base ResNet50 backbone. This outperforms other CNN attention mechanisms while using similar or less FLOPs. Our code will be publicly available",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "We propose FrePolad: frequency-rectified point latent diffusion, a point cloud generation pipeline integrating a variational autoencoder (VAE) with a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) for the latent distribution. FrePolad simultaneously achieves high quality, diversity, and flexibility in point cloud cardinality for generation tasks while maintaining high computational efficiency. The improvement in generation quality and diversity is achieved through (1) a novel frequency rectification module via spherical harmonics designed to retain high-frequency content while learning the point cloud distribution; and (2) a latent DDPM to learn the regularized yet complex latent distribution. In addition, FrePolad supports variable point cloud cardinality by formulating the sampling of points as conditional distributions over a latent shape distribution. Finally, the low-dimensional latent space encoded by the VAE contributes to FrePolad's fast and scalable sampling. Our quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of FrePolad in terms of quality, diversity, and computational efficiency",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Lip segmentation is crucial in computer vision, especially for lip reading. Despite extensive face segmentation research, lip segmentation has received limited attention. The aim of this study is to compare state-of-the-art lip segmentation models using a standardized setting and a publicly available dataset. Five techniques, namely EHANet, Mask2Former, BiSeNet V2, PIDNet, and STDC1, are qualitatively selected based on their reported performance, inference time, code availability, recency, and popularity. The CelebAMask-HQ dataset, comprising manually annotated face images, is used to fairly assess the lip segmentation performance of the selected models. Inference experiments are conducted on a Raspberry Pi4 to emulate limited computational resources. The results show that Mask2Former and EHANet have the best performances in terms of mIoU score. BiSeNet V2 demonstrate competitive performance, while PIDNet excels in recall but has lower precision. Most models present inference time ranging from 1000 to around 3000 milliseconds on a Raspberry Pi4, with PIDNet having the lowest mean inference time. This study provides a comprehensive evaluation of lip segmentation models, highlighting their performance and inference times. The findings contribute to the development of lightweight techniques and establish benchmarks for future advances in lip segmentation, especially in IoT and edge computing scenarios",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Dogs have a unique evolutionary relationship with humans and serve many important roles e.g. search and rescue, blind assistance, emotional support. However, few datasets exist to categorize visual features and objects available to dogs, as well as how dogs direct their visual attention within their environment. We collect and study a dataset with over 11,698 gazes to categorize the objects available to be gazed at by 11 dogs in everyday outdoor environments i.e. a walk around a college campus and urban area. We explore the availability of these object categories and the visual attention of dogs over these categories using a head mounted eye tracking apparatus. A small portion (approx. 600 images or < 20% of total dataset) of the collected data is used to fine tune a MaskRCNN for the novel image domain to segment objects present in the scene, enabling further statistical analysis on the visual gaze tendencies of dogs. The MaskRCNN, with eye tracking apparatus, serves as an end to end model for automatically classifying the visual fixations of dogs. The fine tuned MaskRCNN performs far better than chance. There are few individual differences between the 11 dogs and we observe greater visual fixations on buses, plants, pavement, and construction equipment. This work takes a step towards understanding visual behavior of dogs and their interaction with the physical world",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "People naturally understand emotions, thus permitting a machine to do the same could open new paths for human-computer interaction. Facial expressions can be very useful for emotion recognition techniques, as these are the biggest transmitters of non-verbal cues capable of being correlated with emotions. Several techniques are based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to extract information in a machine learning process. However, simple CNNs are not always sufficient to locate points of interest on the face that can be correlated with emotions. In this work, we intend to expand the capacity of emotion recognition techniques by proposing the usage of Facial Action Units (AUs) recognition techniques to recognize emotions. This recognition will be based on the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) and computed by a machine learning system. In particular, our method expands over EmotiRAM, an approach for multi-cue emotion recognition, in which we improve over their facial encoding module",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In recent years, point cloud perception tasks have been garnering increasing attention. This paper presents the first attempt to estimate 3D human body mesh from sparse LiDAR point clouds. We found that the major challenge in estimating human pose and mesh from point clouds lies in the sparsity, noise, and incompletion of LiDAR point clouds. Facing these challenges, we propose an effective sparse-to-dense reconstruction scheme to reconstruct 3D human mesh. This involves estimating a sparse representation of a human (3D human pose) and gradually reconstructing the body mesh. To better leverage the 3D structural information of point clouds, we employ a cascaded graph transformer (graphormer) to introduce point cloud features during sparse-to-dense reconstruction. Experimental results on three publicly available databases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Code: https://github.com/soullessrobot/LiDAR-HMR/",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Segment Anything Model (SAM) has achieved impressive results for natural image segmentation with input prompts such as points and bounding boxes. Its success largely owes to massive labeled training data. However, directly applying SAM to medical image segmentation cannot perform well because SAM lacks medical knowledge -- it does not use medical images for training. To incorporate medical knowledge into SAM, we introduce SA-Med2D-20M, a large-scale segmentation dataset of 2D medical images built upon numerous public and private datasets. It consists of 4.6 million 2D medical images and 19.7 million corresponding masks, covering almost the whole body and showing significant diversity. This paper describes all the datasets collected in SA-Med2D-20M and details how to process these datasets. Furthermore, comprehensive statistics of SA-Med2D-20M are presented to facilitate the better use of our dataset, which can help the researchers build medical vision foundation models or apply their models to downstream medical applications. We hope that the large scale and diversity of SA-Med2D-20M can be leveraged to develop medical artificial intelligence for enhancing diagnosis, medical image analysis, knowledge sharing, and education.

    "title": "What Can AutoML Do For Continual Learning?",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "This position paper outlines the potential of AutoML for incremental (continual) learning to encourage more research in this direction. Incremental learning involves incorporating new data from a stream of tasks and distributions to learn enhanced deep representations and adapt better to new tasks. However, a significant limitation of incremental learners is that most current techniques freeze the backbone architecture, hyperparameters, and the order & structure of the learning tasks throughout the learning and adaptation process. We strongly believe that AutoML offers promising solutions to address these limitations, enabling incremental learning to adapt to more diverse real-world tasks. Therefore, instead of directly proposing a new method, this paper takes a step back by posing the question: \"What can AutoML do for incremental learning?\" We outline three key areas of research that can contribute to making incremental learners more dynamic, highlighting concrete opportunities to apply AutoML methods in novel ways as well as entirely new challenges for AutoML research",

    "title": "NNG-Mix: Improving Semi-supervised Anomaly Detection with Pseudo-anomaly Generation",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Anomaly detection (AD) is essential in identifying rare and often critical events in complex systems, finding applications in fields such as network intrusion detection, financial fraud detection, and fault detection in infrastructure and industrial systems. While AD is typically treated as an unsupervised learning task due to the high cost of label annotation, it is more practical to assume access to a small set of labeled anomaly samples from domain experts, as is the case for semi-supervised anomaly detection. Semi-supervised and supervised approaches can leverage such labeled data, resulting in improved performance. In this paper, rather than proposing a new semi-supervised or supervised approach for AD, we introduce a novel algorithm for generating additional pseudo-anomalies on the basis of the limited labeled anomalies and a large volume of unlabeled data. This serves as an augmentation to facilitate the detection of new anomalies. Our proposed algorithm, named Nearest Neighbor Gaussian Mixup (NNG-Mix), efficiently integrates information from both labeled and unlabeled data to generate pseudo-anomalies. We compare the performance of this novel algorithm with commonly applied augmentation techniques, such as Mixup and Cutout. We evaluate NNG-Mix by training various existing semi-supervised and supervised anomaly detection algorithms on the original training data along with the generated pseudo-anomalies. Through extensive experiments on 57 benchmark datasets in ADBench, reflecting different data types, we demonstrate that NNG-Mix outperforms other data augmentation methods. It yields significant performance improvements compared to the baselines trained exclusively on the original training data. Notably, NNG-Mix yields up to 16.4%, 8.8%, and 8.0% improvements on Classical, CV, and NLP datasets in ADBench. Our source code will be available at https://github.com/donghao51/NNG-Mix",

    "title": "An Image is Worth Multiple Words: Multi-attribute Inversion for Constrained Text-to-Image Synthesis",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "We consider the problem of constraining diffusion model outputs with a user-supplied reference image. Our key objective is to extract multiple attributes (e.g., color, object, layout, style) from this single reference image, and then generate new samples with them. One line of existing work proposes to invert the reference images into a single textual conditioning vector, enabling generation of new samples with this learned token. These methods, however, do not learn multiple tokens that are necessary to condition model outputs on the multiple attributes noted above. Another line of techniques expand the inversion space to learn multiple embeddings but they do this only along the layer dimension (e.g., one per layer of the DDPM model) or the timestep dimension (one for a set of timesteps in the denoising process), leading to suboptimal attribute disentanglement. To address the aforementioned gaps, the first contribution of this paper is an extensive analysis to determine which attributes are captured in which dimension of the denoising process. As noted above, we consider both the time-step dimension (in reverse denoising) as well as the DDPM model layer dimension. We observe that often a subset of these attributes are captured in the same set of model layers and/or across same denoising timesteps. For instance, color and style are captured across same U-Net layers, whereas layout and color are captured across same timestep stages. Consequently, an inversion process that is designed only for the time-step dimension or the layer dimension is insufficient to disentangle all attributes. This leads to our second contribution where we design a new multi-attribute inversion algorithm, MATTE, with associated disentanglement-enhancing regularization losses, that operates across both dimensions and explicitly leads to four disentangled tokens (color, style, layout, and object)",

    "abstract": "In previous works, a mobile application was developed using an unmodified commercial off-the-shelf smartphone to recognize whole-body exercises. The working principle was based on the ultrasound Doppler sensing with the device built-in hardware. Applying such a lab-environment trained model on realistic application variations causes a significant drop in performance, and thus decimate its applicability. The reason of the reduced performance can be manifold. It could be induced by the user, environment, and device variations in realistic scenarios. Such scenarios are often more complex and diverse, which can be challenging to anticipate in the initial training data. To study and overcome this issue, this paper presents a database with controlled and uncontrolled subsets of fitness exercises. We propose two concepts to utilize small adaption data to successfully improve model generalization in an uncontrolled environment, increasing the recognition accuracy by two to six folds compared to the baseline for different users",

    "abstract": "Continual learning is a sub-field of machine learning, which aims to allow machine learning models to continuously learn on new data, by accumulating knowledge without forgetting what was learned in the past. In this work, we take a step back, and ask: \"Why should one care about continual learning in the first place?\". We set the stage by surveying recent continual learning papers published at three major machine learning conferences, and show that memory-constrained settings dominate the field. Then, we discuss five open problems in machine learning, and even though they seem unrelated to continual learning at first sight, we show that continual learning will inevitably be part of their solution. These problems are model-editing, personalization, on-device learning, faster (re-)training and reinforcement learning. Finally, by comparing the desiderata from these unsolved problems and the current assumptions in continual learning, we highlight and discuss four future directions for continual learning research. We hope that this work offers an interesting perspective on the future of continual learning, while displaying its potential value and the paths we have to pursue in order to make it successful.

    "title": "LLMs as Visual Explainers: Advancing Image Classification with Evolving Visual Descriptions",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Vision-language models (VLMs) offer a promising paradigm for image classification by comparing the similarity between images and class embeddings. A critical challenge lies in crafting precise textual representations for class names. While previous studies have leveraged recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) to enhance these descriptors, their outputs often suffer from ambiguity and inaccuracy. We identify two primary causes: 1) The prevalent reliance on textual interactions with LLMs, leading to a mismatch between the generated text and the visual content in VLMs' latent space - a phenomenon we term the \"explain without seeing\" dilemma. 2) The oversight of the inter-class relationships, resulting in descriptors that fail to differentiate similar classes effectively. To address these issues, we propose a novel image classification framework combining VLMs with LLMs, named Iterative Optimization with Visual Feedback. In particular, our method develops an LLM-based agent, employing an evolutionary optimization strategy to refine class descriptors. Crucially, we incorporate visual feedback from VLM classification metrics, thereby guiding the optimization process with concrete visual data. Our method leads to improving accuracy on a wide range of image classification benchmarks, with 3.47\\% average gains over state-of-the-art methods. We also highlight the resulting descriptions serve as explainable and robust features that can consistently improve the performance across various backbone models",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Cereal grain plays a crucial role in the human diet as a major source of essential nutrients. Grain Appearance Inspection (GAI) serves as an essential process to determine grain quality and facilitate grain circulation and processing. However, GAI is routinely performed manually by inspectors with cumbersome procedures, which poses a significant bottleneck in smart agriculture. In this paper, we endeavor to develop an automated GAI system:AI4GrainInsp. By analyzing the distinctive characteristics of grain kernels, we formulate GAI as a ubiquitous problem: Anomaly Detection (AD), in which healthy and edible kernels are considered normal samples while damaged grains or unknown objects are regarded as anomalies. We further propose an AD model, called AD-GAI, which is trained using only normal samples yet can identify anomalies during inference. Moreover, we customize a prototype device for data acquisition and create a large-scale dataset including 220K high-quality images of wheat and maize kernels. Through extensive experiments, AD-GAI achieves considerable performance in comparison with advanced AD methods, and AI4GrainInsp has highly consistent performance compared to human experts and excels at inspection efficiency over 20x speedup.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Human facial data hold tremendous potential to address a variety of classification problems, including face recognition, age estimation, gender identification, emotion analysis, and race classification. However, recent privacy regulations, such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation and others, have restricted the ways in which human images may be collected and used for research. As a result, several previously published data sets containing human faces have been removed from the internet due to inadequate data collection methods that failed to meet privacy regulations. Data sets consisting of synthetic data have been proposed as an alternative, but they fall short of accurately representing the real data distribution. On the other hand, most available data sets are labeled for just a single task, which limits their applicability. To address these issues, we present the Multi-Task Faces (MTF) image data set, a meticulously curated collection of face images designed for various classification tasks, including face recognition, as well as race, gender, and age classification. The MTF data set has been ethically gathered by leveraging publicly available images of celebrities and strictly adhering to copyright regulations. In this paper, we present this data set and provide detailed descriptions of the followed data collection and processing procedures. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of five deep learning (DL) models on the MTF data set across the aforementioned classification tasks. Additionally, we compare the performance of DL models over the processed MTF data and over raw data crawled from the internet.

In this paper, we introduce a unified evaluation that encompasses multiple video tasks, including captioning, question and answering, retrieval, and action recognition. In addition to conventional metrics, we showcase how GPT-based evaluation can match human-like performance in assessing response quality across multiple aspects. We propose a simple baseline: Video-LLaVA, which uses a single linear projection and outperforms existing video LLMs. Finally, we evaluate video LLMs beyond academic datasets, which show encouraging recognition and reasoning capabilities in driving scenarios with only hundreds of video-instruction pairs for fine-tuning. We hope our work can serve as a unified evaluation for video LLMs, and help expand more practical scenarios. The evaluation code will be available soon",

    "title": "GP-NeRF: Generalized Perception NeRF for Context-Aware 3D Scene Understanding",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Applying NeRF to downstream perception tasks for scene understanding and representation is becoming increasingly popular. Most existing methods treat semantic prediction as an additional rendering task, \\textit{i.e.}, the \"label rendering\" task, to build semantic NeRFs. However, by rendering semantic/instance labels per pixel without considering the contextual information of the rendered image, these methods usually suffer from unclear boundary segmentation and abnormal segmentation of pixels within an object. To solve this problem, we propose Generalized Perception NeRF (GP-NeRF), a novel pipeline that makes the widely used segmentation model and NeRF work compatibly under a unified framework, for facilitating context-aware 3D scene perception. To accomplish this goal, we introduce transformers to aggregate radiance as well as semantic embedding fields jointly for novel views and facilitate the joint volumetric rendering of both fields. In addition, we propose two self-distillation mechanisms, i.e., the Semantic Distill Loss and the Depth-Guided Semantic Distill Loss, to enhance the discrimination and quality of the semantic field and the maintenance of geometric consistency. In evaluation, we conduct experimental comparisons under two perception tasks (\\textit{i.e.} semantic and instance segmentation) using both synthetic and real-world datasets. Notably, our method outperforms SOTA approaches by 6.94\\%, 11.76\\%, and 8.47\\% on generalized semantic segmentation, finetuning semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation, respectively",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have endowed LLMs with the ability to perceive and understand multi-modal signals. However, most of the existing MLLMs mainly adopt vision encoders pretrained on coarsely aligned image-text pairs, leading to insufficient extraction and reasoning of visual knowledge. To address this issue, we devise a dual-Level vIsual knOwledge eNhanced Multimodal Large Language Model (LION), which empowers the MLLM by injecting visual knowledge in two levels. 1) Progressive incorporation of fine-grained spatial-aware visual knowledge. We design a vision aggregator cooperated with region-level vision-language (VL) tasks to incorporate fine-grained spatial-aware visual knowledge into the MLLM. To alleviate the conflict between image-level and region-level VL tasks during incorporation, we devise a dedicated stage-wise instruction-tuning strategy with mixture-of-adapters. This progressive incorporation scheme contributes to the mutual promotion between these two kinds of VL tasks. 2) Soft prompting of high-level semantic visual evidence. We facilitate the MLLM with high-level semantic visual evidence by leveraging diverse image tags. To mitigate the potential influence caused by imperfect predicted tags, we propose a soft prompting method by embedding a learnable token into the tailored text instruction. Comprehensive experiments on several multi-modal benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our model (e.g., improvement of 5% accuracy on VSR and 3% CIDEr on TextCaps over InstructBLIP, 5% accuracy on RefCOCOg over Kosmos-2)",

In this paper, we introduce FATURA, a pivotal resource for researchers in the field of document analysis and understanding. FATURA is a highly diverse dataset featuring multi-layout, annotated invoice document images. Comprising $10,000$ invoices with $50$ distinct layouts, it represents the largest openly accessible image dataset of invoice documents known to date.

    "abstract": "Generalizable NeRF can directly synthesize novel views across new scenes, eliminating the need for scene-specific retraining in vanilla NeRF. A critical enabling factor in these approaches is the extraction of a generalizable 3D representation by aggregating source-view features. In this paper, we propose an Entangled View-Epipolar Information Aggregation method dubbed EVE-NeRF. Different from existing methods that consider cross-view and along-epipolar information independently, EVE-NeRF conducts the view-epipolar feature aggregation in an entangled manner by injecting the scene-invariant appearance continuity and geometry consistency priors to the aggregation process. Our approach effectively mitigates the potential lack of inherent geometric and appearance constraint resulting from one-dimensional interactions, thus further boosting the 3D representation generalizablity. EVE-NeRF attains state-of-the-art performance across various evaluation scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstate that, compared to prevailing single-dimensional aggregation, the entangled network excels in the accuracy of 3D scene geometry and appearance reconstruction.Our project page is https://github.com/tatakai1/EVENeRF",

    "title": "Kandinsky Conformal Prediction: Efficient Calibration of Image Segmentation Algorithms",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Image segmentation algorithms can be understood as a collection of pixel classifiers, for which the outcomes of nearby pixels are correlated. Classifier models can be calibrated using Inductive Conformal Prediction, but this requires holding back a sufficiently large calibration dataset for computing the distribution of non-conformity scores of the model's predictions. If one only requires only marginal calibration on the image level, this calibration set consists of all individual pixels in the images available for calibration. However, if the goal is to attain proper calibration for each individual pixel classifier, the calibration set consists of individual images. In a scenario where data are scarce (such as the medical domain), it may not always be possible to set aside sufficiently many images for this pixel-level calibration. The method we propose, dubbed ``Kandinsky calibration'', makes use of the spatial structure present in the distribution of natural images to simultaneously calibrate the classifiers of ``similar'' pixels. This can be seen as an intermediate approach between marginal (imagewise) and conditional (pixelwise) calibration, where non-conformity scores are aggregated over similar image regions, thereby making more efficient use of the images available for calibration. We run experiments on segmentation algorithms trained and calibrated on subsets of the public MS-COCO and Medical Decathlon datasets, demonstrating that Kandinsky calibration method can significantly improve the coverage. When compared to both pixelwise and imagewise calibration on little data, the Kandinsky method achieves much lower coverage errors, indicating the data efficiency of the Kandinsky calibration",

In this paper, we propose a novel approach for improving few-shot segmentation performance on multispectral images using reinforcement learning to generate representations. These representations are generated in the form of mathematical expressions between channels and are tailored to the specific class being segmented. Our methodology involves training an agent to identify the most informative expressions, updating the dataset using these expressions, and then using the updated dataset to perform segmentation. Due to the limited length of the expressions, the model receives useful representations without any added risk of overfitting. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on several multispectral datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in boosting the performance of segmentation algorithms",

    "abstract": "In this work, we use multi-view aerial images to reconstruct the geometry, lighting, and material of facades using neural signed distance fields (SDFs). Without the requirement of complex equipment, our method only takes simple RGB images captured by a drone as inputs to enable physically based and photorealistic novel-view rendering, relighting, and editing. However, a real-world facade usually has complex appearances ranging from diffuse rocks with subtle details to large-area glass windows with specular reflections, making it hard to attend to everything. As a result, previous methods can preserve the geometry details but fail to reconstruct smooth glass windows or verse vise. In order to address this challenge, we introduce three spatial- and semantic-adaptive optimization strategies, including a semantic regularization approach based on zero-shot segmentation techniques to improve material consistency, a frequency-aware geometry regularization to balance surface smoothness and details in different surfaces, and a visibility probe-based scheme to enable efficient modeling of the local lighting in large-scale outdoor environments. In addition, we capture a real-world facade aerial 3D scanning image set and corresponding point clouds for training and benchmarking. The experiment demonstrates the superior quality of our method on facade holistic inverse rendering, novel view synthesis, and scene editing compared to state-of-the-art baselines",

Exploring invariant graph representations remains a challenge for most existing graph representation learning methods. In this paper, we propose a cross-view graph consistency learning (CGCL) method that learns invariant graph representations for link prediction. First, two complementary augmented views are derived from an incomplete graph structure through a bidirectional graph structure augmentation scheme. This augmentation scheme mitigates the potential information loss that is commonly associated with various data augmentation techniques involving raw graph data, such as edge perturbation, node removal, and attribute masking. Second, we propose a CGCL model that can learn invariant graph representations. A cross-view training scheme is proposed to train the proposed CGCL model. This scheme attempts to maximize the consistency information between one augmented view and the graph structure reconstructed from the other augmented view. Furthermore, we offer a comprehensive theoretical CGCL analysis. This paper empirically and experimentally demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed CGCL method, achieving competitive results on graph datasets in comparisons with several state-of-the-art algorithms",

    "abstract": "4D Flow Magnetic Resonance Imaging (4D Flow MRI) is a non-invasive measurement technique capable of quantifying blood flow across the cardiovascular system. While practical use is limited by spatial resolution and image noise, incorporation of trained super-resolution (SR) networks has potential to enhance image quality post-scan. However, these efforts have predominantly been restricted to narrowly defined cardiovascular domains, with limited exploration of how SR performance extends across the cardiovascular system; a task aggravated by contrasting hemodynamic conditions apparent across the cardiovasculature. The aim of our study was to explore the generalizability of SR 4D Flow MRI using a combination of heterogeneous training sets and dedicated ensemble learning. With synthetic training data generated across three disparate domains (cardiac, aortic, cerebrovascular), varying convolutional base and ensemble learners were evaluated as a function of domain and architecture, quantifying performance on both in-silico and acquired in-vivo data from the same three domains. Results show that both bagging and stacking ensembling enhance SR performance across domains, accurately predicting high-resolution velocities from low-resolution input data in-silico. Likewise, optimized networks successfully recover native resolution velocities from downsampled in-vivo data, as well as show qualitative potential in generating denoised SR-images from clinical level input data. In conclusion, our work presents a viable approach for generalized SR 4D Flow MRI, with ensemble learning extending utility across various clinical areas of interest",

    "abstract": "Automatic pavement crack detection is an important task to ensure the functional performances of pavements during their service life. Inspired by deep learning (DL), the encoder-decoder framework is a powerful tool for crack detection. However, these models are usually open-loop (OL) systems that tend to treat thin cracks as the background. Meanwhile, these models can not automatically correct errors in the prediction, nor can it adapt to the changes of the environment to automatically extract and detect thin cracks. To tackle this problem, we embed closed-loop feedback (CLF) into the neural network so that the model could learn to correct errors on its own, based on generative adversarial networks (GAN). The resulting model is called CrackCLF and includes the front and back ends, i.e. segmentation and adversarial network. The front end with U-shape framework is employed to generate crack maps, and the back end with a multi-scale loss function is used to correct higher-order inconsistencies between labels and crack maps (generated by the front end) to address open-loop system issues. Empirical results show that the proposed CrackCLF outperforms others methods on three public datasets. Moreover, the proposed CLF can be defined as a plug and play module, which can be embedded into different neural network models to improve their performances",

The latter solves for both the hand-eye parameters and for the unknown scale factor inherent with structure-from-motion methods. The algebraic analysis that is made possible with such a linear formulation allows to investigate not only the well known case of general screw motions but also such singular motions as pure translations, pure rotations, and planar motions. In essence, the robot-mounted camera looks to an unknown rigid layout, tracks points over an image sequence and estimates the camera-to-robot relationship. Such a self calibration process is relevant for unmanned vehicles, robots working in remote places, and so forth.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have dramatically enhanced the field of language intelligence, as demonstrably evidenced by their formidable empirical performance across a spectrum of complex reasoning tasks. Additionally, theoretical proofs have illuminated their emergent reasoning capabilities, providing a compelling showcase of their advanced cognitive abilities in linguistic contexts. Critical to their remarkable efficacy in handling complex reasoning tasks, LLMs leverage the intriguing chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning techniques, obliging them to formulate intermediate steps en route to deriving an answer. The CoT reasoning approach has not only exhibited proficiency in amplifying reasoning performance but also in enhancing interpretability, controllability, and flexibility. In light of these merits, recent research endeavors have extended CoT reasoning methodologies to nurture the development of autonomous language agents, which adeptly adhere to language instructions and execute actions within varied environments. This survey paper orchestrates a thorough discourse, penetrating vital research dimensions, encompassing: (i) the foundational mechanics of CoT techniques, with a focus on elucidating the circumstances and justification behind its efficacy; (ii) the paradigm shift in CoT; and (iii) the burgeoning of language agents fortified by CoT approaches. Prospective research avenues envelop explorations into generalization, efficiency, customization, scaling, and safety. This paper caters to a wide audience, including beginners seeking comprehensive knowledge of CoT reasoning and language agents, as well as experienced researchers interested in foundational mechanics and engaging in cutting-edge discussions on these topics.

However, despite their utility, these AI systems are vulnerable to a wide range of attacks such as adversarial, backdoor, data poisoning, membership inference, model inversion, and model stealing attacks. In particular, numerous attacks are designed to target a particular model or system, yet their effects can spread to additional targets, referred to as transferable attacks. Although considerable efforts have been directed toward developing transferable attacks, a holistic understanding of the advancements in transferable attacks remains elusive. In this paper, we comprehensively explore learning-based attacks from the perspective of transferability, particularly within the context of cyber-physical security. We delve into different domains -- the image, text, graph, audio, and video domains -- to highlight the ubiquitous and pervasive nature of transferable attacks. This paper categorizes and reviews the architecture of existing attacks from various viewpoints: data, process, model, and system. We further examine the implications of transferable attacks in practical scenarios such as autonomous driving, speech recognition, and large language models (LLMs). Additionally, we outline the potential research directions to encourage efforts in exploring the landscape of transferable attacks.

Utilising a novel dataset of infrared cocoa tree images, we demonstrate PhytNet's development and compare its performance with existing architectures. Data collection was informed by analysis of spectroscopy data, which provided useful insights into the spectral characteristics of cocoa trees. Such information could inform future data collection and model development.

ResNet18 showed some signs of overfitting, while EfficientNet variants showed distinct signs of overfitting.

    "title": "Robust Tumor Segmentation with Hyperspectral Imaging and Graph Neural Networks",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Segmenting the boundary between tumor and healthy tissue during surgical cancer resection poses a significant challenge. In recent years, Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) combined with Machine Learning (ML) has emerged as a promising solution. However, due to the extensive information contained within the spectral domain, most ML approaches primarily classify individual HSI (super-)pixels, or tiles, without taking into account their spatial context. In this paper, we propose an improved methodology that leverages the spatial context of tiles for more robust and smoother segmentation. To address the irregular shapes of tiles, we utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to propagate context information across neighboring regions. The features for each tile within the graph are extracted using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is trained simultaneously with the subsequent GNN. Moreover, we incorporate local image quality metrics into the loss function to enhance the training procedure's robustness against low-quality regions in the training images. We demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method using a clinical ex vivo dataset consisting of 51 HSI images from 30 patients. Despite the limited dataset, the GNN-based model significantly outperforms context-agnostic approaches, accurately distinguishing between healthy and tumor tissues, even in images from previously unseen patients. Furthermore, we show that our carefully designed loss function, accounting for local image quality, results in additional improvements. Our findings demonstrate that context-aware GNN algorithms can robustly find tumor demarcations on HSI images, ultimately contributing to better surgery success and patient outcome",

    "title": "Multimodal deep learning for mapping forest dominant height by fusing GEDI with earth observation data",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The integration of multisource remote sensing data and deep learning models offers new possibilities for accurately mapping high spatial resolution forest height. We found that GEDI relative heights (RH) metrics exhibited strong correlation with the mean of the top 10 highest trees (dominant height) measured in situ at the corresponding footprint locations. Consequently, we proposed a novel deep learning framework termed the multi-modal attention remote sensing network (MARSNet) to estimate forest dominant height by extrapolating dominant height derived from GEDI, using Setinel-1 data, ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 data, Sentinel-2 optical data and ancillary data. MARSNet comprises separate encoders for each remote sensing data modality to extract multi-scale features, and a shared decoder to fuse the features and estimate height. Using individual encoders for each remote sensing imagery avoids interference across modalities and extracts distinct representations. To focus on the efficacious information from each dataset, we reduced the prevalent spatial and band redundancies in each remote sensing data by incorporating the extended spatial and band reconstruction convolution modules in the encoders. MARSNet achieved commendable performance in estimating dominant height, with an R2 of 0.62 and RMSE of 2.82 m, outperforming the widely used random forest approach which attained an R2 of 0.55 and RMSE of 3.05 m. Finally, we applied the trained MARSNet model to generate wall-to-wall maps at 10 m resolution for Jilin, China. Through independent validation using field measurements, MARSNet demonstrated an R2 of 0.58 and RMSE of 3.76 m, compared to 0.41 and 4.37 m for the random forest baseline. Our research demonstrates the effectiveness of a multimodal deep learning approach fusing GEDI with SAR and passive optical imagery for enhancing the accuracy of high resolution dominant height estimation",

    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been widely used for illumination estimation, which is time-consuming and requires sensor-specific data collection. Our proposed method uses a dual-mapping strategy and only requires a simple white point from a test sensor under a D65 condition. This allows us to derive a mapping matrix, enabling the reconstructions of image data and illuminants. In the second mapping phase, we transform the re-constructed image data into sparse features, which are then optimized with a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model using the re-constructed illuminants as ground truths. This approach effectively reduces sensor discrepancies and delivers performance on par with leading cross-sensor methods. It only requires a small amount of memory (~0.003 MB), and takes ~1 hour training on an RTX3070Ti GPU. More importantly, the method can be implemented very fast, with ~0.3 ms and ~1 ms on a GPU or CPU respectively, and is not sensitive to the input image resolution. Therefore, it offers a practical solution to the great challenges of data recollection that is faced by the industry",

    "title": "A Good Feature Extractor Is All You Need for Weakly Supervised Learning in Histopathology",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Deep learning is revolutionising pathology, offering novel opportunities in disease prognosis and personalised treatment. Historically, stain normalisation has been a crucial preprocessing step in computational pathology pipelines, and persists into the deep learning era. Yet, with the emergence of feature extractors trained using self-supervised learning (SSL) on diverse pathology datasets, we call this practice into question. In an empirical evaluation of publicly available feature extractors, we find that omitting stain normalisation and image augmentations does not compromise downstream performance, while incurring substantial savings in memory and compute. Further, we show that the top-performing feature extractors are remarkably robust to variations in stain and augmentations like rotation in their latent space. Contrary to previous patch-level benchmarking studies, our approach emphasises clinical relevance by focusing on slide-level prediction tasks in a weakly supervised setting with external validation cohorts. This work represents the most comprehensive robustness evaluation of public pathology SSL feature extractors to date, involving more than 6,000 training runs across nine tasks, five datasets, three downstream architectures, and various preprocessing setups. Our findings stand to streamline digital pathology workflows by minimising preprocessing needs and informing the selection of feature extractors",

Current state-of-the-art implementations focus on RGB video, but this struggles in varying/noisy light conditions and is almost completely unfeasible in the dark.

This paper aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of an alternative Convolution Attention Network (CAN) architecture, to regress photoplethysmography (PPG) signal from a sequence of NIR frames. A combination of two publicly available datasets, which is split into train and test sets, is used for training the CAN. This combined dataset is augmented to reduce overfitting to the 'normal' 60 - 80 bpm heart rate range by providing the full range of heart rates along with corresponding videos for each subject. This CAN, when implemented over video cropped to the subject's head, achieved a Mean Average Error (MAE) of just 0.99 bpm, proving its effectiveness on NIR video and the architecture's feasibility to regress an accurate signal output",

    "abstract": "Evaluating the risk level of adversarial images is essential for safely deploying face authentication models in the real world. Popular approaches for physical-world attacks, such as print or replay attacks, suffer from some limitations, like including physical and geometrical artifacts. Recently, adversarial attacks have gained attraction, which try to digitally deceive the learning strategy of a recognition system using slight modifications to the captured image. While most previous research assumes that the adversarial image could be digitally fed into the authentication systems, this is not always the case for systems deployed in the real world. This paper demonstrates the vulnerability of face authentication systems to adversarial images in physical world scenarios. We propose AdvGen, an automated Generative Adversarial Network, to simulate print and replay attacks and generate adversarial images that can fool state-of-the-art PADs in a physical domain attack setting. Using this attack strategy, the attack success rate goes up to 82.01%. We test AdvGen extensively on four datasets and ten state-of-the-art PADs. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack by conducting experiments in a realistic, physical environment",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In the realm of medical imaging, precise segmentation of stroke lesions from brain MRI images stands as a critical challenge with significant implications for patient diagnosis and treatment. Addressing this, our study introduces an innovative approach using a Fuzzy Information Seeded Region Growing (FISRG) algorithm. Designed to effectively delineate the complex and irregular boundaries of stroke lesions, the FISRG algorithm combines fuzzy logic with Seeded Region Growing (SRG) techniques, aiming to enhance segmentation accuracy. The research involved three experiments to optimize the FISRG algorithm's performance, each focusing on different parameters to improve the accuracy of stroke lesion segmentation. The highest Dice score achieved in these experiments was 94.2\\%, indicating a high degree of similarity between the algorithm's output and the expert-validated ground truth. Notably, the best average Dice score, amounting to 88.1\\%, was recorded in the third experiment, highlighting the efficacy of the algorithm in consistently segmenting stroke lesions across various slices. Our findings reveal the FISRG algorithm's strengths in handling the heterogeneity of stroke lesions. However, challenges remain in areas of abrupt lesion topology changes and in distinguishing lesions from similar intensity brain regions. The results underscore the potential of the FISRG algorithm in contributing significantly to advancements in medical imaging analysis for stroke diagnosis and treatment",

We show that giving more weight to large objects leads to improved detection scores across all object sizes and so an overall improvement in Object Detectors performances (+2 p.p. of mAP on small objects, +2 p.p. on medium and +4 p.p. on large on COCO val 2017 with InternImage-T).

Specifically, we propose an adaptive expansion strategy that adds new or deletes noisy 3D Gaussian in order to efficiently reconstruct new observed scene geometry and improve the mapping of previously observed areas. This strategy is essential to extend 3D Gaussian representation to reconstruct the whole scene rather than synthesize a static object in existing methods. Moreover, in the pose tracking process, an effective coarse-to-fine technique is designed to select reliable 3D Gaussian representations to optimize camera pose, resulting in runtime reduction and robust estimation. Our method achieves competitive performance compared with existing state-of-the-art real-time methods on the Replica, TUM-RGBD datasets. The source code will be released soon",

While the text-driven video editing has demonstrated remarkable ability to generate highly diverse videos following given text prompts, the fine-grained semantic edits are hard to control by plain textual prompt only in terms of object details and edited region, and cumbersome long text descriptions are usually needed for the task. We therefore investigate subject-driven video editing for more precise control of both edited regions and background preservation, and fine-grained semantic generation. We achieve this goal by introducing an reference image as supplementary input to the text-driven video editing, which avoids racking your brain to come up with a cumbersome text prompt describing the detailed appearance of the object. To limit the editing area, we refer to a method of cross attention control in image editing and successfully extend it to video editing by fusing the attention map of adjacent frames, which strikes a balance between maintaining video background and spatio-temporal consistency. Compared with current methods, the whole process of our method is like ``cut\" the source object to be edited and then ``paste\" the target object provided by reference image. We demonstrate that our method performs favorably over prior arts for video editing under the guidance of text prompt and extra reference image, as measured by both quantitative and subjective evaluations",

Its innovative features include a CLIP-powered detector for accurate degradation classification, no-reference image quality evaluation for performance evaluation, region-specific processing for precise enhancements, and advanced fusion techniques for optimal restoration results. Clarity ChatGPT marks a significant advancement in integrating language and vision, enhancing image-text interactions, and providing a robust, high-performance IRE solution.

To address it, semi-supervised learning by exploiting abundant unlabeled data is highly desirable to boost the model training. However, most existing works still focus on limited medical tasks and underestimate the potential of learning across diverse tasks and multiple datasets. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a \\textbf{Ver}satile \\textbf{Semi}-supervised framework (VerSemi) to point out a new perspective that integrates various tasks into a unified model with a broad label space, to exploit more unlabeled data for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Specifically, we introduce a dynamic task-prompted design to segment various targets from different datasets. Next, this unified model is used to identify the foreground regions from all labeled data, to capture cross-dataset semantics. Particularly, we create a synthetic task with a cutmix strategy to augment foreground targets within the expanded label space. To effectively utilize unlabeled data, we introduce a consistency constraint. This involves aligning aggregated predictions from various tasks with those from the synthetic task, further guiding the model in accurately segmenting foreground regions during training. We evaluated our VerSemi model on four public benchmarking datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrated that VerSemi can consistently outperform the second-best method by a large margin (e.g., an average 2.69\\% Dice gain on four datasets), setting new SOTA performance for semi-supervised medical image segmentation.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Adversarial attacks are a major deterrent towards the reliable use of machine learning models. A powerful type of adversarial attacks is the patch-based attack, wherein the adversarial perturbations modify localized patches or specific areas within the images to deceive the trained machine learning model. In this paper, we introduce Outlier Detection and Dimension Reduction (ODDR), a holistic defense mechanism designed to effectively mitigate patch-based adversarial attacks. In our approach, we posit that input features corresponding to adversarial patches, whether naturalistic or otherwise, deviate from the inherent distribution of the remaining image sample and can be identified as outliers or anomalies. ODDR employs a three-stage pipeline: Fragmentation, Segregation, and Neutralization, providing a model-agnostic solution applicable to both image classification and object detection tasks. The Fragmentation stage parses the samples into chunks for the subsequent Segregation process. Here, outlier detection techniques identify and segregate the anomalous features associated with adversarial perturbations. The Neutralization stage utilizes dimension reduction methods on the outliers to mitigate the impact of adversarial perturbations without sacrificing pertinent information necessary for the machine learning task. Extensive testing on benchmark datasets and state-of-the-art adversarial patches demonstrates the effectiveness of ODDR. Results indicate robust accuracies matching and lying within a small range of clean accuracies (1%-3% for classification and 3%-5% for object detection), with only a marginal compromise of 1%-2% in performance on clean samples, thereby significantly outperforming other defenses",

To achieve this, we propose OmniSeg3D, an omniversal segmentation method aims for segmenting anything in 3D all at once. The key insight is to lift multi-view inconsistent 2D segmentations into a consistent 3D feature field through a hierarchical contrastive learning framework, which is accomplished by two steps. Firstly, we design a novel hierarchical representation based on category-agnostic 2D segmentations to model the multi-level relationship among pixels. Secondly, image features rendered from the 3D feature field are clustered at different levels, which can be further drawn closer or pushed apart according to the hierarchical relationship between different levels. In tackling the challenges posed by inconsistent 2D segmentations, this framework yields a global consistent 3D feature field, which further enables hierarchical segmentation, multi-object selection, and global discretization. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on high-quality 3D segmentation and accurate hierarchical structure understanding. A graphical user interface further facilitates flexible interaction for omniversal 3D segmentation",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Pansharpening, a pivotal task in remote sensing, involves integrating low-resolution multispectral images with high-resolution panchromatic images to synthesize an image that is both high-resolution and retains multispectral information. These pansharpened images enhance precision in land cover classification, change detection, and environmental monitoring within remote sensing data analysis. While deep learning techniques have shown significant success in pansharpening, existing methods often face limitations in their evaluation, focusing on restricted satellite data sources, single scene types, and low-resolution images. This paper addresses this gap by introducing PanBench, a high-resolution multi-scene dataset containing all mainstream satellites and comprising 5,898 pairs of samples. Each pair includes a four-channel (RGB + near-infrared) multispectral image of 256x256 pixels and a mono-channel panchromatic image of 1,024x1,024 pixels. To achieve high-fidelity synthesis, we propose a Cascaded Multiscale Fusion Network (CMFNet) for Pansharpening. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of CMFNet.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Recovering temporally consistent 3D human body pose, shape and motion from a monocular video is a challenging task due to (self-)occlusions, poor lighting conditions, complex articulated body poses, depth ambiguity, and limited availability of annotated data. Further, doing a simple perframe estimation is insufficient as it leads to jittery and implausible results. In this paper, we propose a novel method for temporally consistent motion estimation from a monocular video. Instead of using generic ResNet-like features, our method uses a body-aware feature representation and an independent per-frame pose and camera initialization over a temporal window followed by a novel spatio-temporal feature aggregation by using a combination of self-similarity and self-attention over the body-aware features and the perframe initialization. Together, they yield enhanced spatiotemporal context for every frame by considering remaining past and future frames. These features are used to predict the pose and shape parameters of the human body model, which are further refined using an LSTM. Experimental results on the publicly available benchmark data show that our method attains significantly lower acceleration error and outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods over all key quantitative evaluation metrics, including complex scenarios like partial occlusion, complex poses and even relatively low illumination",

    "abstract": "The rapidly emerging field of deep learning-based computational pathology has shown promising results in utilizing whole slide images (WSIs) to objectively prognosticate cancer patients. However, most prognostic methods are currently limited to either histopathology or genomics alone, which inevitably reduces their potential to accurately predict patient prognosis. Whereas integrating WSIs and genomic features presents three main challenges: (1) the enormous heterogeneity of gigapixel WSIs which can reach sizes as large as 150,000x150,000 pixels; (2) the absence of a spatially corresponding relationship between histopathology images and genomic molecular data; and (3) the existing early, late, and intermediate multimodal feature fusion strategies struggle to capture the explicit interactions between WSIs and genomics. To ameliorate these issues, we propose the Mutual-Guided Cross-Modality Transformer (MGCT), a weakly-supervised, attention-based multimodal learning framework that can combine histology features and genomic features to model the genotype-phenotype interactions within the tumor microenvironment. To validate the effectiveness of MGCT, we conduct experiments using nearly 3,600 gigapixel WSIs across five different cancer types sourced from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Extensive experimental results consistently emphasize that MGCT outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods",

    "abstract": "Object detection in aerial images is a pivotal task for various earth observation applications, whereas current algorithms learn to detect only a pre-defined set of object categories demanding sufficient bounding-box annotated training samples and fail to detect novel object categories. In this paper, we consider open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) in aerial images that enables the characterization of new objects beyond training categories on the earth surface without annotating training images for these new categories. The performance of OVD depends on the quality of class-agnostic region proposals and pseudo-labels that can generalize well to novel object categories. To simultaneously generate high-quality proposals and pseudo-labels, we propose CastDet, a CLIP-activated student-teacher open-vocabulary object Detection framework. Our end-to-end framework within the student-teacher mechanism employs the CLIP model as an extra omniscient teacher of rich knowledge into the student-teacher self-learning process. By doing so, our approach boosts novel object proposals and classification. Furthermore, we design a dynamic label queue technique to maintain high-quality pseudo labels during batch training and mitigate label imbalance. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple existing aerial object detection datasets, which are set up for the OVD task. Experimental results demonstrate our CastDet achieving superior open-vocabulary detection performance, e.g., reaching 40.0 HM (Harmonic Mean), which outperforms previous methods Detic/ViLD by 26.9/21.1 on the VisDroneZSD dataset",

To tackle the issues, we propose (1) a novel synthetic video dataset that features subjects across a diverse range of age groups; (2) a baseline architecture designed to validate the effectiveness of our proposed dataset, and (3) the development of three novel metrics tailored explicitly for evaluating the temporal consistency of video re-aging techniques.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Illumination degradation image restoration (IDIR) techniques aim to improve the visibility of degraded images and mitigate the adverse effects of deteriorated illumination. Among these algorithms, diffusion model (DM)-based methods have shown promising performance but are often burdened by heavy computational demands and pixel misalignment issues when predicting the image-level distribution. To tackle these problems, we propose to leverage DM within a compact latent space to generate concise guidance priors and introduce a novel solution called Reti-Diff for the IDIR task. Reti-Diff comprises two key components: the Retinex-based latent DM (RLDM) and the Retinex-guided transformer (RGformer). To ensure detailed reconstruction and illumination correction, RLDM is empowered to acquire Retinex knowledge and extract reflectance and illumination priors. These priors are subsequently utilized by RGformer to guide the decomposition of image features into their respective reflectance and illumination components. Following this, RGformer further enhances and consolidates the decomposed features, resulting in the production of refined images with consistent content and robustness to handle complex degradation scenarios. Extensive experiments show that Reti-Diff outperforms existing methods on three IDIR tasks, as well as downstream applications.

We use glaucoma diagnosis based on color fundus images as an example to show the possibility of performing segmentation and classification in real time on embedded boards and to highlight the different energy requirements of the studied implementations. Several other works develop the use of segmentation and feature extraction techniques to detect glaucoma, among many other pathologies, with deep neural networks. Memory limitations and low processing capabilities of embedded accelerated systems (EAS) limit their use for deep network-based system training. However, including specific acceleration hardware, such as NVIDIA's Maxwell GPU or Google's Edge TPU, enables them to perform inferences using complex pre-trained networks in very reasonable times. In this study, we evaluate the timing and energy performance of two EAS equipped with Machine Learning (ML) accelerators executing an example diagnostic tool developed in a previous work. For optic disc (OD) and cup (OC) segmentation, the obtained prediction times per image are under 29 and 43 ms using Edge TPUs and Maxwell GPUs, respectively. Prediction times for the classification subsystem are lower than 10 and 14 ms for Edge TPUs and Maxwell GPUs, respectively. Regarding energy usage, in approximate terms, for OD segmentation Edge TPUs and Maxwell GPUs use 38 and 190 mJ per image, respectively.

Ideally, these classifiers encode the salient features indicative for each disease class and can steer the diffusion model to show realistic disease signs or remove disease-related lesions in a realistic way.

Existing methods, devoted to semantic features representation, evolving towards robustness to a wide variety between query and reference, including illumination and viewpoint changes, as well as scale and seasonal variations. However, practical visual geolocalization approaches need to be robust in appearance changing and extreme viewpoint variation conditions, while providing accurate global location estimates. Therefore, inspired by curriculum design, human learn general knowledge first and then delve into professional expertise. We first recognize semantic scene and then measure geometric structure.

    "abstract": "In general, deep learning-based video frame interpolation (VFI) methods have predominantly focused on estimating motion vectors between two input frames and warping them to the target time. While this approach has shown impressive performance for linear motion between two input frames, it exhibits limitations when dealing with occlusions and nonlinear movements. Recently, generative models have been applied to VFI to address these issues. However, as VFI is not a task focused on generating plausible images, but rather on predicting accurate intermediate frames between two given frames, performance limitations still persist. In this paper, we propose a multi-in-single-out (MISO) based VFI method that does not rely on motion vector estimation, allowing it to effectively model occlusions and nonlinear motion. Additionally, we introduce a novel motion perceptual loss that enables MISO-VFI to better capture the spatio-temporal correlations within the video frames.

    "abstract": "Diffusion-based image restoration (IR) methods aim to use diffusion models to recover high-quality (HQ) images from degraded images and achieve promising performance. Due to the inherent property of diffusion models, most of these methods need long serial sampling chains to restore HQ images step-by-step. As a result, it leads to expensive sampling time and high computation costs. Moreover, such long sampling chains hinder understanding the relationship between the restoration results and the inputs since it is hard to compute the gradients in the whole chains. In this work, we aim to rethink the diffusion-based IR models through a different perspective, i.e., a deep equilibrium (DEQ) fixed point system. Specifically, we derive an analytical solution by modeling the entire sampling chain in diffusion-based IR models as a joint multivariate fixed point system. With the help of the analytical solution, we are able to conduct single-image sampling in a parallel way and restore HQ images without training. Furthermore, we compute fast gradients in DEQ and found that initialization optimization can boost performance and control the generation direction.

    "abstract": "Trees inside cities are important for the urban microclimate, contributing positively to the physical and mental health of the urban dwellers. Despite their importance, often only limited information about city trees is available. Therefore in this paper, we propose a method for mapping urban trees in high-resolution aerial imagery using limited datasets and deep learning. Deep learning has become best-practice for this task, however, existing approaches rely on large and accurately labelled training datasets, which can be difficult and expensive to obtain. However, often noisy and incomplete data may be available that can be combined and utilized to solve more difficult tasks than those datasets were intended for. This paper studies how to combine accurate point labels of urban trees along streets with crowd-sourced annotations from an open geographic database to delineate city trees in remote sensing images, a task which is challenging even for humans. To that end, we perform semantic segmentation of very high resolution aerial imagery using a fully convolutional neural network. The main challenge is that our segmentation maps are sparsely annotated and incomplete. Small areas around the point labels of the street trees coming from official and crowd-sourced data are marked as foreground class. Crowd-sourced annotations of streets, buildings, etc. define the background class. Since the tree data is incomplete, we introduce a masking to avoid class confusion. Our experiments in Hamburg, Germany, showed that the system is able to produce tree cover maps, not limited to trees along streets, without providing tree delineations. We evaluated the method on manually labelled trees and show that performance drastically deteriorates if the open geographic database is not used",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Knowledge distillation (KD) has been applied to various tasks successfully, and mainstream methods typically boost the student model via spatial imitation losses. However, the consecutive downsamplings induced in the spatial domain of teacher model is a type of corruption, hindering the student from analyzing what specific information needs to be imitated, which results in accuracy degradation. To better understand the underlying pattern of corrupted feature maps, we shift our attention to the frequency domain. During frequency distillation, we encounter a new challenge: the low-frequency bands convey general but minimal context, while the high are more informative but also introduce noise. Not each pixel within the frequency bands contributes equally to the performance. To address the above problem: (1) We propose the Frequency Prompt plugged into the teacher model, absorbing the semantic frequency context during finetuning. (2) During the distillation period, a pixel-wise frequency mask is generated via Frequency Prompt, to localize those pixel of interests (PoIs) in various frequency bands. Additionally, we employ a position-aware relational frequency loss for dense prediction tasks, delivering a high-order spatial enhancement to the student model. We dub our Frequency Knowledge Distillation method as FreeKD, which determines the optimal localization and extent for the frequency distillation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FreeKD not only outperforms spatial-based distillation methods consistently on dense prediction tasks (e.g., FreeKD brings 3.8 AP gains for RepPoints-R50 on COCO2017 and 4.55 mIoU gains for PSPNet-R18 on Cityscapes), but also conveys more robustness to the student.

In response to these challenges, our study introduces a new methodology for automatically generating images of historical arcade facades, utilizing Stable Diffusion models conditioned on textual descriptions. By classifying and tagging a variety of arcade styles, we have constructed several realistic arcade facade image datasets. We trained multiple low-rank adaptation (LoRA) models to control the stylistic aspects of the generated images, supplemented by ControlNet models for improved precision and authenticity. Our approach has demonstrated high levels of precision, authenticity, and diversity in the generated images, showing promising potential for real-world urban renewal projects. This new methodology offers a more efficient and accurate alternative to conventional design processes in urban renewal, bypassing issues of unconvincing image details, lack of precision, and limited stylistic variety. Future research could focus on integrating this two-dimensional image generation with three-dimensional modeling techniques, providing a more comprehensive solution for renovating architectural facades in historical districts",

    "title": "AKConv: Convolutional Kernel with Arbitrary Sampled Shapes and Arbitrary Number of Parameters",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Neural networks based on convolutional operations have achieved remarkable results in the field of deep learning, but there are two inherent flaws in standard convolutional operations. On the one hand, the convolution operation be confined to a local window and cannot capture information from other locations, and its sampled shapes is fixed. On the other hand, the size of the convolutional kernel is fixed to k $\\times$ k, which is a fixed square shape, and the number of parameters tends to grow squarely with size. It is obvious that the shape and size of targets are various in different datasets and at different locations. Convolutional kernels with fixed sample shapes and squares do not adapt well to changing targets. In response to the above questions, the Alterable Kernel Convolution (AKConv) is explored in this work, which gives the convolution kernel an arbitrary number of parameters and arbitrary sampled shapes to provide richer options for the trade-off between network overhead and performance. In AKConv, we define initial positions for convolutional kernels of arbitrary size by means of a new coordinate generation algorithm. To adapt to changes for targets, we introduce offsets to adjust the shape of the samples at each position. Moreover, we explore the effect of the neural network by using the AKConv with the same size and different initial sampled shapes. AKConv completes the process of efficient feature extraction by irregular convolutional operations and brings more exploration options for convolutional sampling shapes. Object detection experiments on representative datasets COCO2017, VOC 7+12 and VisDrone-DET2021 fully demonstrate the advantages of AKConv. AKConv can be used as a plug-and-play convolutional operation to replace convolutional operations to improve network performance.

    "title": "SeaDSC: A video-based unsupervised method for dynamic scene change detection in unmanned surface vehicles",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Recently, there has been an upsurge in the research on maritime vision, where a lot of works are influenced by the application of computer vision for Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs). Various sensor modalities such as camera, radar, and lidar have been used to perform tasks such as object detection, segmentation, object tracking, and motion planning. A large subset of this research is focused on the video analysis, since most of the current vessel fleets contain the camera's onboard for various surveillance tasks. Due to the vast abundance of the video data, video scene change detection is an initial and crucial stage for scene understanding of USVs. This paper outlines our approach to detect dynamic scene changes in USVs. To the best of our understanding, this work represents the first investigation of scene change detection in the maritime vision application. Our objective is to identify significant changes in the dynamic scenes of maritime video data, particularly those scenes that exhibit a high degree of resemblance. In our system for dynamic scene change detection, we propose completely unsupervised learning method. In contrast to earlier studies, we utilize a modified cutting-edge generative picture model called VQ-VAE-2 to train on multiple marine datasets, aiming to enhance the feature extraction. Next, we introduce our innovative similarity scoring technique for directly calculating the level of similarity in a sequence of consecutive frames by utilizing grid calculation on retrieved features. The experiments were conducted using a nautical video dataset called RoboWhaler to showcase the efficient performance of our technique",

    "abstract": "The crossMoDA2023 challenge aims to segment the vestibular schwannoma (sub-divided into intra- and extra-meatal components) and cochlea regions of unlabeled hrT2 scans by leveraging labeled ceT1 scans. In this work, we proposed a 3D multi-style cross-modality segmentation framework for the crossMoDA2023 challenge, including the multi-style translation and self-training segmentation phases. Considering heterogeneous distributions and various image sizes in multi-institutional scans, we first utilize the min-max normalization, voxel size resampling, and center cropping to obtain fixed-size sub-volumes from ceT1 and hrT2 scans for training. Then, we perform the multi-style image translation phase to overcome the intensity distribution discrepancy between unpaired multi-modal scans. Specifically, we design three different translation networks with 2D or 2.5D inputs to generate multi-style and realistic target-like volumes from labeled ceT1 volumes. Finally, we perform the self-training volumetric segmentation phase in the target domain, which employs the nnU-Net framework and iterative self-training method using pseudo-labels for training accurate segmentation models in the unlabeled target domain. On the crossMoDA2023 validation dataset, our method produces promising results and achieves the mean DSC values of 72.78% and 80.64% and ASSD values of 5.85 mm and 0.25 mm for VS tumor and cochlea regions, respectively. Moreover, for intra- and extra-meatal regions, our method achieves the DSC values of 59.77% and 77.14%, respectively",

Current works have significantly advanced the problem in terms of model and data. However, the overall performance of most FSOD methods still does not fulfill the desired accuracy. In this paper we improve the FSOD model to address the severe issue of sample imbalance and weak feature propagation. To alleviate modeling bias from data-sufficient base classes, we examine the effect of decoupling the parameters for classes with sufficient data and classes with few samples in various ways. We design a base-novel categories decoupled DETR (DeDETR) for FSOD. We also explore various types of skip connection between the encoder and decoder for DETR. Besides, we notice that the best outputs could come from the intermediate layer of the decoder instead of the last layer; therefore, we build a unified decoder module that could dynamically fuse the decoder layers as the output feature. We evaluate our model on commonly used datasets such as PASCAL VOC and MSCOCO. Our results indicate that our proposed module could achieve stable improvements of 5% to 10% in both fine-tuning and meta-learning paradigms and has outperformed the highest score in recent works",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly prominent in the field of artificial intelligence. These models not only excel in traditional vision-language tasks but also demonstrate impressive performance in contemporary multi-modal benchmarks. Although many of these benchmarks attempt to holistically evaluate MLLMs, they typically concentrate on basic reasoning tasks, often yielding only simple yes/no or multi-choice responses. These methods naturally lead to confusion and difficulties in conclusively determining the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. To mitigate this issue, we manually curate a benchmark dataset specifically designed for MLLMs, with a focus on complex reasoning tasks. Our benchmark comprises three key reasoning categories: deductive, abductive, and analogical reasoning. The queries in our dataset are intentionally constructed to engage the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs in the process of generating answers. For a fair comparison across various MLLMs, we incorporate intermediate reasoning steps into our evaluation criteria. In instances where an MLLM is unable to produce a definitive answer, its reasoning ability is evaluated by requesting intermediate reasoning steps. If these steps align with our manual annotations, appropriate scores are assigned. This evaluation scheme resembles methods commonly used in human assessments, such as exams or assignments, and represents what we consider a more effective assessment technique compared with existing benchmarks. We evaluate a selection of representative MLLMs using this rigorously developed open-ended multi-step elaborate reasoning benchmark, designed to challenge and accurately measure their reasoning capabilities.

NePF achieves this unification by fully utilizing the physical implication behind the weight function of neural implicit surfaces and the view-dependent radiance.

    "abstract": "Deepfake has emerged for several years, yet efficient detection techniques could generalize over different manipulation methods require further research. While current image-level detection method fails to generalize to unseen domains, owing to the domain-shift phenomenon brought by CNN's strong inductive bias towards Deepfake texture, video-level one shows its potential to have both generalization across multiple domains and robustness to compression. We argue that although distinct face manipulation tools have different inherent bias, they all disrupt the consistency between frames, which is a natural characteristic shared by authentic videos. Inspired by this, we proposed a detection approach by capturing frame inconsistency that broadly exists in different forgery techniques, termed unearthing-common-inconsistency (UCI). Concretely, the UCI network based on self-supervised contrastive learning can better distinguish temporal consistency between real and fake videos from multiple domains. We introduced a temporally-preserved module method to introduce spatial noise perturbations, directing the model's attention towards temporal information. Subsequently, leveraging a multi-view cross-correlation learning module, we extensively learn the disparities in temporal representations between genuine and fake samples.

    "abstract": "Single image super-resolution (SISR) has experienced significant advancements, primarily driven by deep convolutional networks. Traditional networks, however, are limited to upscaling images to a fixed scale, leading to the utilization of implicit neural functions for generating arbitrarily scaled images. Nevertheless, these methodologies have imposed substantial computational demands as they involve querying every target pixel to a single resource-intensive decoder. In this paper, we introduce a novel and efficient framework, the Mixture of Experts Implicit Super-Resolution (MoEISR), which enables super-resolution at arbitrary scales with significantly increased computational efficiency without sacrificing reconstruction quality. MoEISR dynamically allocates the most suitable decoding expert to each pixel using a lightweight mapper module, allowing experts with varying capacities to reconstruct pixels across regions with diverse complexities. Our experiments demonstrate that MoEISR successfully reduces up to 73% in floating point operations (FLOPs) while delivering comparable or superior peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR)",

To mitigate this sparsity issue, we encode an event image into event patch features, automatically mine contextual similarity relationships among patches, group the patch features into distinctive contexts, and enforce context-to-context similarities to learn discriminative event features. For training our framework, we curate a synthetic event camera dataset featuring diverse scene and motion patterns.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "This paper explores a novel setting called Generalized Category Discovery in Semantic Segmentation (GCDSS), aiming to segment unlabeled images given prior knowledge from a labeled set of base classes. The unlabeled images contain pixels of the base class or novel class. In contrast to Novel Category Discovery in Semantic Segmentation (NCDSS), there is no prerequisite for prior knowledge mandating the existence of at least one novel class in each unlabeled image. Besides, we broaden the segmentation scope beyond foreground objects to include the entire image. Existing NCDSS methods rely on the aforementioned priors, making them challenging to truly apply in real-world situations. We propose a straightforward yet effective framework that reinterprets the GCDSS challenge as a task of mask classification. Additionally, we construct a baseline method and introduce the Neighborhood Relations-Guided Mask Clustering Algorithm (NeRG-MaskCA) for mask categorization to address the fragmentation in semantic representation. A benchmark dataset, Cityscapes-GCD, derived from the Cityscapes dataset, is established to evaluate the GCDSS framework. Our method demonstrates the feasibility of the GCDSS problem and the potential for discovering and segmenting novel object classes in unlabeled images. We employ the generated pseudo-labels from our approach as ground truth to supervise the training of other models, thereby enabling them with the ability to segment novel classes. It paves the way for further research in generalized category discovery, broadening the horizons of semantic segmentation and its applications.

Subsequently, researchers and industries have been highly endorsed in the medical field, predicting and controlling diverse diseases at specific intervals. Liver tumor prediction is a vital chore in analyzing and treating liver diseases. This paper proposes a novel approach for predicting liver tumors using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and a depth-based variant search algorithm with advanced attention mechanisms (CNN-DS-AM).

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic make people wear masks more frequently than ever. Current general face recognition system suffers from serious performance degradation,when encountering occluded scenes. The potential reason is that face features are corrupted by occlusions on key facial regions. To tackle this problem, previous works either extract identity-related embeddings on feature level by additional mask prediction, or restore the occluded facial part by generative models. However, the former lacks visual results for model interpretation, while the latter suffers from artifacts which may affect downstream recognition. Therefore, this paper proposes a Multi-task gEnerative mask dEcoupling face Recognition (MEER) network to jointly handle these two tasks, which can learn occlusionirrelevant and identity-related representation while achieving unmasked face synthesis. We first present a novel mask decoupling module to disentangle mask and identity information, which makes the network obtain purer identity features from visible facial components. Then, an unmasked face is restored by a joint-training strategy, which will be further used to refine the recognition network with an id-preserving loss. Experiments on masked face recognition under realistic and synthetic occlusions benchmarks demonstrate that the MEER can outperform the state-ofthe-art methods",

    "abstract": "Studying backdoor attacks is valuable for model copyright protection and enhancing defenses. While existing backdoor attacks have successfully infected multimodal contrastive learning models such as CLIP, they can be easily countered by specialized backdoor defenses for MCL models. This paper reveals the threats in this practical scenario that backdoor attacks can remain effective even after defenses and introduces the \\emph{\\toolns} attack, which is resistant to backdoor detection and model fine-tuning defenses. To achieve this, we draw motivations from the perspective of the Bayesian rule and propose a dual-embedding guided framework for backdoor attacks. Specifically, we ensure that visual trigger patterns approximate the textual target semantics in the embedding space, making it challenging to detect the subtle parameter variations induced by backdoor learning on such natural trigger patterns. Additionally, we optimize the visual trigger patterns to align the poisoned samples with target vision features in order to hinder the backdoor unlearning through clean fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our attack significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines (+45.3% ASR) in the presence of SoTA backdoor defenses, rendering these mitigation and detection strategies virtually ineffective. Furthermore, our approach effectively attacks some more rigorous scenarios like downstream tasks.

In recent years, progress has been made towards high-NA (Numerical Aperture) EUVL (Extreme-Ultraviolet-Lithography) paradigm, which promises to advance pattern shrinking (2 nm node and beyond). However, a significant increase in stochastic defects and the complexity of defect detection becomes more pronounced with high-NA. Present defect inspection techniques (both non-machine learning and machine learning based), fail to achieve satisfactory performance at high-NA dimensions. In this work, we investigate the use of the Slicing Aided Hyper Inference (SAHI) framework for improving upon current techniques. Using SAHI, inference is performed on size-increased slices of the SEM images. This leads to the object detector's receptive field being more effective in capturing small defect instances. First, the performance on previously investigated semiconductor datasets is benchmarked across various configurations, and the SAHI approach is demonstrated to substantially enhance the detection of small defects, by approx. 2x. Afterwards, we also demonstrated application of SAHI leads to flawless detection rates on a new test dataset, with scenarios not encountered during training, whereas previous trained models failed.

    "abstract": "The use of appearance codes in recent work on generative modeling has enabled novel view renders with variable appearance and illumination, such as day-time and night-time renders of a scene. A major limitation of this technique is the need to re-train new appearance codes for every scene on inference, so in this work we address this problem proposing a framework that learns a joint embedding space for the appearance and structure of the scene by enforcing a contrastive loss constraint between different modalities. We apply our framework to a simple Variational Auto-Encoder model on the RADIATE dataset \\cite{sheeny2021radiate} and qualitatively demonstrate that we can generate new renders of night-time photos using day-time appearance codes without additional optimization iterations. Additionally, we compare our model to a baseline VAE that uses the standard per-image appearance code technique and show that our approach achieves generations of similar quality without learning appearance codes for any unseen images on inference",

    "title": "LifeLearner: Hardware-Aware Meta Continual Learning System for Embedded Computing Platforms",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Continual Learning (CL) allows applications such as user personalization and household robots to learn on the fly and adapt to context. This is an important feature when context, actions, and users change. However, enabling CL on resource-constrained embedded systems is challenging due to the limited labeled data, memory, and computing capacity. In this paper, we propose LifeLearner, a hardware-aware meta continual learning system that drastically optimizes system resources (lower memory, latency, energy consumption) while ensuring high accuracy. Specifically, we (1) exploit meta-learning and rehearsal strategies to explicitly cope with data scarcity issues and ensure high accuracy, (2) effectively combine lossless and lossy compression to significantly reduce the resource requirements of CL and rehearsal samples, and (3) developed hardware-aware system on embedded and IoT platforms considering the hardware characteristics. As a result, LifeLearner achieves near-optimal CL performance, falling short by only 2.8% on accuracy compared to an Oracle baseline. With respect to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) Meta CL method, LifeLearner drastically reduces the memory footprint (by 178.7x), end-to-end latency by 80.8-94.2%, and energy consumption by 80.9-94.2%. In addition, we successfully deployed LifeLearner on two edge devices and a microcontroller unit, thereby enabling efficient CL on resource-constrained platforms where it would be impractical to run SOTA methods and the far-reaching deployment of adaptable CL in a ubiquitous manner.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "This paper endeavors to advance the precision of snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) reconstruction for multispectral image (MSI). To achieve this, we integrate the advantageous attributes of established SCI techniques and an image generative model, propose a novel structured zero-shot diffusion model, dubbed DiffSCI. DiffSCI leverages the structural insights from the deep prior and optimization-based methodologies, complemented by the generative capabilities offered by the contemporary denoising diffusion model. Specifically, firstly, we employ a pre-trained diffusion model, which has been trained on a substantial corpus of RGB images, as the generative denoiser within the Plug-and-Play framework for the first time. This integration allows for the successful completion of SCI reconstruction, especially in the case that current methods struggle to address effectively. Secondly, we systematically account for spectral band correlations and introduce a robust methodology to mitigate wavelength mismatch, thus enabling seamless adaptation of the RGB diffusion model to MSIs. Thirdly, an accelerated algorithm is implemented to expedite the resolution of the data subproblem. This augmentation not only accelerates the convergence rate but also elevates the quality of the reconstruction process. We present extensive testing to show that DiffSCI exhibits discernible performance enhancements over prevailing self-supervised and zero-shot approaches, surpassing even supervised transformer counterparts across both simulated and real datasets.

Recent application of deep learning methods for image reconstruction provides a successful data-driven approach to addressing the challenges when reconstructing images with undersampled measurements or various types of noise. In this work, we propose a hybrid supervised-unsupervised learning framework for X-ray computed tomography (CT) image reconstruction. The proposed learning formulation leverages both sparsity or unsupervised learning-based priors and neural network reconstructors to simulate a fixed-point iteration process. Each proposed trained block consists of a deterministic MBIR solver and a neural network. The information flows in parallel through these two reconstructors and is then optimally combined. Multiple such blocks are cascaded to form a reconstruction pipeline. We demonstrate the efficacy of this learned hybrid model for low-dose CT image reconstruction with limited training data, where we use the NIH AAPM Mayo Clinic Low Dose CT Grand Challenge dataset for training and testing. In our experiments, we study combinations of supervised deep network reconstructors and MBIR solver with learned sparse representation-based priors or analytical priors.

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have demonstrated significant potential in producing high-quality images for medical image translation to aid disease diagnosis, localization, and treatment. Nevertheless, current diffusion models have limited success in achieving faithful image translations that can accurately preserve the anatomical structures of medical images, especially for unpaired datasets. The preservation of structural and anatomical details is essential to reliable medical diagnosis and treatment planning, as structural mismatches can lead to disease misidentification and treatment errors. In this study, we introduced a frequency-decoupled diffusion model (FDDM), a novel framework that decouples the frequency components of medical images in the Fourier domain during the translation process, to allow structure-preserved high-quality image conversion. FDDM applies an unsupervised frequency conversion module to translate the source medical images into frequency-specific outputs and then uses the frequency-specific information to guide a following diffusion model for final source-to-target image translation. We conducted extensive evaluations of FDDM using a public brain MR-to-CT translation dataset, showing its superior performance against other GAN-, VAE-, and diffusion-based models. Metrics including the Frechet inception distance (FID), the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and the structural similarity index measure (SSIM) were assessed. FDDM achieves an FID of 29.88, less than half of the second best. These results demonstrated FDDM's prowess in generating highly-realistic target-domain images while maintaining the faithfulness of translated anatomical structures",

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an important medical imaging modality with excellent soft tissue contrast and superb spatial resolution, which possesses unique opportunities for diffusion models. Although there is a recent surge of studies exploring DPMs in MRI, a survey paper of DPMs specifically designed for MRI applications is still lacking. This review article aims to help researchers in the MRI community to grasp the advances of DPMs in different applications. We first introduce the theory of two dominant kinds of DPMs, categorized according to whether the diffusion time step is discrete or continuous, and then provide a comprehensive review of emerging DPMs in MRI, including reconstruction, image generation, image translation, segmentation, anomaly detection, and further research topics. Finally, we discuss the general limitations as well as limitations specific to the MRI tasks of DPMs and point out potential areas that are worth further exploration",

    "abstract": "Uncertainty quantification of deep neural networks has become an active field of research and plays a crucial role in various downstream tasks such as active learning. Recent advances in evidential deep learning shed light on the direct quantification of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties with a single forward pass of the model. Most traditional approaches adopt an entropy-based method to derive evidential uncertainty in classification, quantifying uncertainty at the sample level. However, the variance-based method that has been widely applied in regression problems is seldom used in the classification setting. In this work, we adapt the variance-based approach from regression to classification, quantifying classification uncertainty at the class level. The variance decomposition technique in regression is extended to class covariance decomposition in classification based on the law of total covariance, and the class correlation is also derived from the covariance. Experiments on cross-domain datasets are conducted to illustrate that the variance-based approach not only results in similar accuracy as the entropy-based one in active domain adaptation but also brings information about class-wise uncertainties as well as between-class correlations. The code is available at https://github.com/KerryDRX/EvidentialADA.

This paper proposes a scale-aware competitive network (SAC-Net), which includes the Inner-Scale Competition Module (ISCM) and the Across-Scale Competition Module (ASCM) to capture texture characteristics related to orientation and scale. ISCM efficiently integrates learnable Gabor filters and a self-attention mechanism to extract rich orientation data and discern textures with long-range discriminative properties. Subsequently, ASCM leverages a competitive strategy across various scales to effectively encapsulate the competitive texture scale elements. By synergizing ISCM and ASCM, our method adeptly characterizes palmprint features. Rigorous experimentation across three benchmark datasets unequivocally demonstrates our proposed approach's exceptional recognition performance and resilience relative to state-of-the-art alternatives",

The former regulates motion by per-frame object distances and spatial layouts, while the later describes motion by cross-frame correspondences that help in preserving fine details and improving temporal consistency. More specifically, given a key frame that exists or generated from text prompts, we first design a diffusion model with spatio-temporal modules to generate the video depth and the corresponding optical flows. Then, the video is generated in the latent space by another spatio-temporal diffusion model under the guidance of depth, optical flow-based warped latent video and the calculated occlusion mask. Lastly, we use optical flows again to align and refine different frames for better video decoding from the latent space to the pixel space. In experiments, MoVideo achieves state-of-the-art results in both text-to-video and image-to-video generation, showing promising prompt consistency, frame consistency and visual quality",

To address these challenges, we propose Geographical SAM (GeoSAM), a novel SAM-based framework that implements a fine-tuning strategy using the dense visual prompt from zero-shot learning, and the sparse visual prompt from a pre-trained CNN segmentation model. The proposed GeoSAM outperforms existing approaches for geographical image segmentation, specifically by 20%, 14.29%, and 17.65% for road infrastructure, pedestrian infrastructure, and on average, respectively, representing a momentous leap in leveraging foundation models to segment mobility infrastructure including both road and pedestrian infrastructure in geographical images",

With close connections to previous axiomatic treatments of continuous and discrete scale-space theory, we consider three main ways discretizing these scale-space operations in terms of explicit discrete convolutions, based on either (i) sampling the Gaussian kernels and the Gaussian derivative kernels, (ii) locally integrating the Gaussian kernels and the Gaussian derivative kernels over each pixel support region and (iii) basing the scale-space analysis on the discrete analogue of the Gaussian kernel, and then computing derivative approximations by applying small-support central difference operators to the spatially smoothed image data. We study the properties of these three main discretization methods both theoretically and experimentally, and characterize their performance by quantitative measures, including the results they give rise to with respect to the task of scale selection, investigated for four different use cases, and with emphasis on the behaviour at fine scales. The results show that the sampled Gaussian kernels and derivatives as well as the integrated Gaussian kernels and derivatives perform very poorly at very fine scales. At very fine scales, the discrete analogue of the Gaussian kernel with its corresponding discrete derivative approximations performs substantially better. The sampled Gaussian kernel and the sampled Gaussian derivatives do, on the other hand, lead to numerically very good approximations of the corresponding continuous results, when the scale parameter is sufficiently large, in the experiments presented in the paper, when the scale parameter is greater than a value of about 1, in units of the grid spacing",

To address this, we propose the Multi-modal Interaction and Pooling Attention Network (MIPANet), a novel approach designed to harness the interactive synergy between RGB and depth modalities, optimizing the utilization of complementary information. Specifically, we incorporate a Multi-modal Interaction Fusion Module (MIM) into the deepest layers of the network. This module is engineered to facilitate the fusion of RGB and depth information, allowing for mutual enhancement and correction. Additionally, we introduce a Pooling Attention Module (PAM) at various stages of the encoder. This module serves to amplify the features extracted by the network and integrates the module's output into the decoder in a targeted manner, significantly improving semantic segmentation performance.

    "abstract": "With the increasing prevalence of smartphones and websites, Image Aesthetic Assessment (IAA) has become increasingly crucial. While the significance of attributes in IAA is widely recognized, many attribute-based methods lack consideration for the selection and utilization of aesthetic attributes. Our initial step involves the acquisition of aesthetic attributes from both intra- and inter-perspectives. Within the intra-perspective, we extract the direct visual attributes of images, constituting the absolute attribute. In the inter-perspective, our focus lies in modeling the relative score relationships between images within the same sequence, forming the relative attribute. Then, to better utilize image attributes in aesthetic assessment, we propose the Unified Multi-attribute Aesthetic Assessment Framework (UMAAF) to model both absolute and relative attributes of images. For absolute attributes, we leverage multiple absolute-attribute perception modules and an absolute-attribute interacting network. The absolute-attribute perception modules are first pre-trained on several absolute-attribute learning tasks and then used to extract corresponding absolute attribute features. The absolute-attribute interacting network adaptively learns the weight of diverse absolute-attribute features, effectively integrating them with generic aesthetic features from various absolute-attribute perspectives and generating the aesthetic prediction. To model the relative attribute of images, we consider the relative ranking and relative distance relationships between images in a Relative-Relation Loss function, which boosts the robustness of the UMAAF. Furthermore, UMAAF achieves state-of-the-art performance on TAD66K and AVA datasets, and multiple experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of each module and the model's alignment with human preference",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Change detection is a critical task in earth observation applications. Recently, deep learning-based methods have shown promising performance and are quickly adopted in change detection. However, the widely used multiple encoder and single decoder (MESD) as well as dual encoder-decoder (DED) architectures still struggle to effectively handle change detection well. The former has problems of bitemporal feature interference in the feature-level fusion, while the latter is inapplicable to intraclass change detection and multiview building change detection. To solve these problems, we propose a new strategy with an exchanging dual encoder-decoder structure for binary change detection with semantic guidance and spatial localization. The proposed strategy solves the problems of bitemporal feature inference in MESD by fusing bitemporal features in the decision level and the inapplicability in DED by determining changed areas using bitemporal semantic features. We build a binary change detection model based on this strategy, and then validate and compare it with 18 state-of-the-art change detection methods on six datasets in three scenarios, including intraclass change detection datasets (CDD, SYSU), single-view building change detection datasets (WHU, LEVIR-CD, LEVIR-CD+) and a multiview building change detection dataset (NJDS).

    "abstract": "Video prediction yields future frames by employing the historical frames and has exhibited its great potential in many applications, e.g., meteorological prediction, and autonomous driving. Previous works often decode the ultimate high-level semantic features to future frames without texture details, which deteriorates the prediction quality. Motivated by this, we develop a Pair-wise Layer Attention (PLA) module to enhance the layer-wise semantic dependency of the feature maps derived from the U-shape structure in Translator, by coupling low-level visual cues and high-level features. Hence, the texture details of predicted frames are enriched. Moreover, most existing methods capture the spatiotemporal dynamics by Translator, but fail to sufficiently utilize the spatial features of Encoder. This inspires us to design a Spatial Masking (SM) module to mask partial encoding features during pretraining, which adds the visibility of remaining feature pixels by Decoder. To this end, we present a Pair-wise Layer Attention with Spatial Masking (PLA-SM) framework for video prediction to capture the spatiotemporal dynamics, which reflect the motion trend.

This problem is especially prevalent as many methods base themselves on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). This paper identifies a notable deficiency in SDS, that it brings inconsistent and low-quality updating direction for the 3D model, causing the over-smoothing effect. To address this, we propose a novel approach called Interval Score Matching (ISM). ISM employs deterministic diffusing trajectories and utilizes interval-based score matching to counteract over-smoothing. Furthermore, we incorporate 3D Gaussian Splatting into our text-to-3D generation pipeline. Extensive experiments show that our model largely outperforms the state-of-the-art in quality and training efficiency",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Deepfake detection faces a critical generalization hurdle, with performance deteriorating when there is a mismatch between the distributions of training and testing data. A broadly received explanation is the tendency of these detectors to be overfitted to forgery-specific artifacts, rather than learning features that are widely applicable across various forgeries. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective detector called LSDA (\\underline{L}atent \\underline{S}pace \\underline{D}ata \\underline{A}ugmentation), which is based on a heuristic idea: representations with a wider variety of forgeries should be able to learn a more generalizable decision boundary, thereby mitigating the overfitting of method-specific features (see Figure. 1). Following this idea, we propose to enlarge the forgery space by constructing and simulating variations within and across forgery features in the latent space. This approach encompasses the acquisition of enriched, domain-specific features and the facilitation of smoother transitions between different forgery types, effectively bridging domain gaps. Our approach culminates in refining a binary classifier that leverages the distilled knowledge from the enhanced features, striving for a generalizable deepfake detector. Comprehensive experiments show that our proposed method is surprisingly effective and transcends state-of-the-art detectors across several widely used benchmarks",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) has seen burgeoning development and increasing attention recently. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, camo-perceptive vision-language framework (CPVLF), to explore whether LVLM can generalize to the challenging camouflaged object detection (COD) scenario in a training-free manner. During the process of generalization, we find that due to hallucination issues within LVLM, it can erroneously perceive objects in camouflaged scenes, producing counterfactual concepts. Moreover, as LVLM is not specifically trained for the precise localization of camouflaged objects, it exhibits a degree of uncertainty in accurately pinpointing these objects. Therefore, we propose chain of visual perception, which enhances LVLM's perception of camouflaged scenes from both linguistic and visual perspectives, reducing the hallucination issue and improving its capability in accurately locating camouflaged objects. We validate the effectiveness of CPVLF on three widely used COD datasets, and the experiments show the potential of LVLM in the COD task",

    "abstract": "Writing assistance is an application closely related to human life and is also a fundamental Natural Language Processing (NLP) research field. Its aim is to improve the correctness and quality of input texts, with character checking being crucial in detecting and correcting wrong characters. From the perspective of the real world where handwriting occupies the vast majority, characters that humans get wrong include faked characters (i.e., untrue characters created due to writing errors) and misspelled characters (i.e., true characters used incorrectly due to spelling errors). However, existing datasets and related studies only focus on misspelled characters mainly caused by phonological or visual confusion, thereby ignoring faked characters which are more common and difficult. To break through this dilemma, we present Visual-C$^3$, a human-annotated Visual Chinese Character Checking dataset with faked and misspelled Chinese characters. To the best of our knowledge, Visual-C$^3$ is the first real-world visual and the largest human-crafted dataset for the Chinese character checking scenario. Additionally, we also propose and evaluate novel baseline methods on Visual-C$^3$. Extensive empirical results and analyses show that Visual-C$^3$ is high-quality yet challenging. The Visual-C$^3$ dataset and the baseline methods will be publicly available to facilitate further research in the community",

However, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, particularly in the image modality, presenting considerable security risks. This paper introduces Adversarial Prompt Tuning (AdvPT), a novel technique to enhance the adversarial robustness of image encoders in VLMs. AdvPT innovatively leverages learnable text prompts and aligns them with adversarial image embeddings, to address the vulnerabilities inherent in VLMs without the need for extensive parameter training or modification of the model architecture. We demonstrate that AdvPT improves resistance against white-box and black-box adversarial attacks and exhibits a synergistic effect when combined with existing image-processing-based defense techniques, further boosting defensive capabilities. Comprehensive experimental analyses provide insights into adversarial prompt tuning, a novel paradigm devoted to improving resistance to adversarial images through textual input modifications, paving the way for future robust multimodal learning research. These findings open up new possibilities for enhancing the security of VLMs. Our code will be available upon publication of the paper",

    "abstract": "The fusion of AI and fashion design has emerged as a promising research area. However, the lack of extensive, interrelated data on clothing and try-on stages has hindered the full potential of AI in this domain. Addressing this, we present the Fashion-Diffusion dataset, a product of multiple years' rigorous effort. This dataset, the first of its kind, comprises over a million high-quality fashion images, paired with detailed text descriptions. Sourced from a diverse range of geographical locations and cultural backgrounds, the dataset encapsulates global fashion trends. The images have been meticulously annotated with fine-grained attributes related to clothing and humans, simplifying the fashion design process into a Text-to-Image (T2I) task. The Fashion-Diffusion dataset not only provides high-quality text-image pairs and diverse human-garment pairs but also serves as a large-scale resource about humans, thereby facilitating research in T2I generation. Moreover, to foster standardization in the T2I-based fashion design field, we propose a new benchmark comprising multiple datasets for evaluating the performance of fashion design models.

In this paper, we present the first submeter-level land cover mapping of Japan with eight classes, at a relatively low annotation cost. We introduce a human-in-the-loop deep learning framework leveraging OpenEarthMap, a recently introduced benchmark dataset for global submeter-level land cover mapping, with a U-Net model that achieves national-scale mapping with a small amount of additional labeled data. By adding a small amount of labeled data of areas or regions where a U-Net model trained on OpenEarthMap clearly failed and retraining the model, an overall accuracy of 80\\% was achieved, which is a nearly 16 percentage point improvement after retraining. Using aerial imagery provided by the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan, we create land cover classification maps of eight classes for the entire country of Japan. Our framework, with its low annotation cost and high-accuracy mapping results, demonstrates the potential to contribute to the automatic updating of national-scale land cover mapping using submeter-level optical remote sensing data.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Story visualization aims to generate a series of images that match the story described in texts, and it requires the generated images to satisfy high quality, alignment with the text description, and consistency in character identities. Given the complexity of story visualization, existing methods drastically simplify the problem by considering only a few specific characters and scenarios, or requiring the users to provide per-image control conditions such as sketches. However, these simplifications render these methods incompetent for real applications. To this end, we propose an automated story visualization system that can effectively generate diverse, high-quality, and consistent sets of story images, with minimal human interactions. Specifically, we utilize the comprehension and planning capabilities of large language models for layout planning, and then leverage large-scale text-to-image models to generate sophisticated story images based on the layout. We empirically find that sparse control conditions, such as bounding boxes, are suitable for layout planning, while dense control conditions, e.g., sketches and keypoints, are suitable for generating high-quality image content. To obtain the best of both worlds, we devise a dense condition generation module to transform simple bounding box layouts into sketch or keypoint control conditions for final image generation, which not only improves the image quality but also allows easy and intuitive user interactions. In addition, we propose a simple yet effective method to generate multi-view consistent character images, eliminating the reliance on human labor to collect or draw character images",

Many works has explored the utilization of pre-trained VLM for the challenging open-vocabulary dense prediction task that requires perceive diverse objects with novel classes at inference time. Existing methods construct experiments based on the public datasets of related tasks, which are not tailored for open vocabulary and rarely involves imperceptible objects camouflaged in complex scenes due to data collection bias and annotation costs. To fill in the gaps, we introduce a new task, open-vocabulary camouflaged object segmentation (OVCOS) and construct a large-scale complex scene dataset (\\textbf{OVCamo}) which containing 11,483 hand-selected images with fine annotations and corresponding object classes.

By integrating the guidance of class semantic knowledge and the supplement of visual structure cues from the edge and depth information, the proposed method can efficiently capture camouflaged objects. Moreover, this effective framework also surpasses previous state-of-the-arts of open-vocabulary semantic image segmentation by a large margin on our OVCamo dataset. With the proposed dataset and baseline, we hope that this new task with more practical value can further expand the research on open-vocabulary dense prediction tasks",

    "abstract": "Text-to-3D, known for its efficient generation methods and expansive creative potential, has garnered significant attention in the AIGC domain. However, the amalgamation of Nerf and 2D diffusion models frequently yields oversaturated images, posing severe limitations on downstream industrial applications due to the constraints of pixelwise rendering method. Gaussian splatting has recently superseded the traditional pointwise sampling technique prevalent in NeRF-based methodologies, revolutionizing various aspects of 3D reconstruction. This paper introduces a novel text to 3D content generation framework based on Gaussian splatting, enabling fine control over image saturation through individual Gaussian sphere transparencies, thereby producing more realistic images. The challenge of achieving multi-view consistency in 3D generation significantly impedes modeling complexity and accuracy. Taking inspiration from SJC, we explore employing multi-view noise distributions to perturb images generated by 3D Gaussian splatting, aiming to rectify inconsistencies in multi-view geometry. We ingeniously devise an efficient method to generate noise that produces Gaussian noise from diverse viewpoints, all originating from a shared noise source. Furthermore, vanilla 3D Gaussian-based generation tends to trap models in local minima, causing artifacts like floaters, burrs, or proliferative elements. To mitigate these issues, we propose the variational Gaussian splatting technique to enhance the quality and stability of 3D appearance. To our knowledge, our approach represents the first comprehensive utilization of Gaussian splatting across the entire spectrum of 3D content generation processes",

HiH features a main branch that utilizes Hierarchical Gait Decomposer (HGD) modules for depth-wise and intra-module hierarchical examination of general gait patterns from silhouette data. This approach captures motion hierarchies from overall body dynamics to detailed limb movements, facilitating the representation of gait attributes across multiple spatial resolutions. Complementing this, an auxiliary branch, based on 2D joint sequences, enriches the spatial and temporal aspects of gait analysis. It employs a Deformable Spatial Enhancement (DSE) module for pose-guided spatial attention and a Deformable Temporal Alignment (DTA) module for aligning motion dynamics through learned temporal offsets.

In addition to generating images of high visual quality, the task of structural design generation imposes more stringent constrains on the semantic expression, e.g., no floating material or missing part, which we refer to as plausibility in this work. We delve into the impact of noise schedules of diffusion models on the plausibility of the outcome: there exists a range of noise levels at which the model's performance decides the result plausibility. Also, we propose two techniques to determine such a range for a given image set and devise a novel parametric noise schedule for better plausibility. We apply this noise schedule to the training and sampling of the well-known diffusion model EDM and compare it to its default noise schedule. Compared to EDM, our schedule significantly improves the rate of plausible designs from 83.4% to 93.5% and Fr\\'echet Inception Distance (FID) from 7.84 to 4.87.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The process of annotating relevant data in the field of digital microscopy can be both time-consuming and especially expensive due to the required technical skills and human-expert knowledge. Consequently, large amounts of microscopic image data sets remain unlabeled, preventing their effective exploitation using deep-learning algorithms. In recent years it has been shown that a lot of relevant information can be drawn from unlabeled data. Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a promising solution based on learning intrinsic features under a pretext task that is similar to the main task without requiring labels. The trained result is transferred to the main task - image segmentation in our case. A ResNet50 U-Net was first trained to restore images of liver progenitor organoids from augmented images using the Structural Similarity Index Metric (SSIM), alone, and using SSIM combined with L1 loss. Both the encoder and decoder were trained in tandem. The weights were transferred to another U-Net model designed for segmentation with frozen encoder weights, using Binary Cross Entropy, Dice, and Intersection over Union (IoU) losses. For comparison, we used the same U-Net architecture to train two supervised models, one utilizing the ResNet50 encoder as well as a simple CNN. Results showed that self-supervised learning models using a 25\\% pixel drop or image blurring augmentation performed better than the other augmentation techniques using the IoU loss. When trained on only 114 images for the main task, the self-supervised learning approach outperforms the supervised method achieving an F1-score of 0.85, with higher stability, in contrast to an F1=0.78 scored by the supervised method. Furthermore, when trained with larger data sets (1,000 images), self-supervised learning is still able to perform better, achieving an F1-score of 0.92, contrasting to a score of 0.85 for the supervised method",

    "title": "Attention-Based Real-Time Defenses for Physical Adversarial Attacks in Vision Applications",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Deep neural networks exhibit excellent performance in computer vision tasks, but their vulnerability to real-world adversarial attacks, achieved through physical objects that can corrupt their predictions, raises serious security concerns for their application in safety-critical domains. Existing defense methods focus on single-frame analysis and are characterized by high computational costs that limit their applicability in multi-frame scenarios, where real-time decisions are crucial. To address this problem, this paper proposes an efficient attention-based defense mechanism that exploits adversarial channel-attention to quickly identify and track malicious objects in shallow network layers and mask their adversarial effects in a multi-frame setting. This work advances the state of the art by enhancing existing over-activation techniques for real-world adversarial attacks to make them usable in real-time applications. It also introduces an efficient multi-frame defense framework, validating its efficacy through extensive experiments aimed at evaluating both defense performance and computational cost",

    "title": "Few-Shot Classification & Segmentation Using Large Language Models Agent",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The task of few-shot image classification and segmentation (FS-CS) requires the classification and segmentation of target objects in a query image, given only a few examples of the target classes. We introduce a method that utilises large language models (LLM) as an agent to address the FS-CS problem in a training-free manner. By making the LLM the task planner and off-the-shelf vision models the tools, the proposed method is capable of classifying and segmenting target objects using only image-level labels. Specifically, chain-of-thought prompting and in-context learning guide the LLM to observe support images like human; vision models such as Segment Anything Model (SAM) and GPT-4Vision assist LLM understand spatial and semantic information at the same time. Ultimately, the LLM uses its summarizing and reasoning capabilities to classify and segment the query image. The proposed method's modular framework makes it easily extendable. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Pascal-5i dataset",
