    "title": "Video-Bench: A Comprehensive Benchmark and Toolkit for Evaluating Video-based Large Language Models",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Video-based large language models (Video-LLMs) have been recently introduced, targeting both fundamental improvements in perception and comprehension, and a diverse range of user inquiries. In pursuit of the ultimate goal of achieving artificial general intelligence, a truly intelligent Video-LLM model should not only see and understand the surroundings, but also possess human-level commonsense, and make well-informed decisions for the users. To guide the development of such a model, the establishment of a robust and comprehensive evaluation system becomes crucial. To this end, this paper proposes \\textit{Video-Bench}, a new comprehensive benchmark along with a toolkit specifically designed for evaluating Video-LLMs. The benchmark comprises 10 meticulously crafted tasks, evaluating the capabilities of Video-LLMs across three distinct levels: Video-exclusive Understanding, Prior Knowledge-based Question-Answering, and Comprehension and Decision-making. In addition, we introduce an automatic toolkit tailored to process model outputs for various tasks, facilitating the calculation of metrics and generating convenient final scores. We evaluate 8 representative Video-LLMs using \\textit{Video-Bench}. The findings reveal that current Video-LLMs still fall considerably short of achieving human-like comprehension and analysis of real-world videos, offering valuable insights for future research directions.

    "title": "Test-time Adaptation of Discriminative Models via Diffusion Generative Feedback",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The advancements in generative modeling, particularly the advent of diffusion models, have sparked a fundamental question: how can these models be effectively used for discriminative tasks? In this work, we find that generative models can be great test-time adapters for discriminative models. Our method, Diffusion-TTA, adapts pre-trained discriminative models such as image classifiers, segmenters and depth predictors, to each unlabelled example in the test set using generative feedback from a diffusion model. We achieve this by modulating the conditioning of the diffusion model using the output of the discriminative model. We then maximize the image likelihood objective by backpropagating the gradients to discriminative model's parameters. We show Diffusion-TTA significantly enhances the accuracy of various large-scale pre-trained discriminative models, such as, ImageNet classifiers, CLIP models, image pixel labellers and image depth predictors. Diffusion-TTA outperforms existing test-time adaptation methods, including TTT-MAE and TENT, and particularly shines in online adaptation setups, where the discriminative model is continually adapted to each example in the test set. We provide access to code, results, and visualizations on our website: https://diffusion-tta.github.io/",

    "title": "How Many Unicorns Are in This Image? A Safety Evaluation Benchmark for Vision LLMs",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "This work focuses on the potential of Vision LLMs (VLLMs) in visual reasoning. Different from prior studies, we shift our focus from evaluating standard performance to introducing a comprehensive safety evaluation suite, covering both out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization and adversarial robustness. For the OOD evaluation, we present two novel VQA datasets, each with one variant, designed to test model performance under challenging conditions. In exploring adversarial robustness, we propose a straightforward attack strategy for misleading VLLMs to produce visual-unrelated responses. Moreover, we assess the efficacy of two jailbreaking strategies, targeting either the vision or language component of VLLMs. Our evaluation of 21 diverse models, ranging from open-source VLLMs to GPT-4V, yields interesting observations: 1) Current VLLMs struggle with OOD texts but not images, unless the visual information is limited; and 2) These VLLMs can be easily misled by deceiving vision encoders only, and their vision-language training often compromise safety protocols. We release this safety evaluation suite at https://github.com/UCSC-VLAA/vllm-safety-benchmark",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Throughout history, we have successfully integrated various machines into our homes. Dishwashers, laundry machines, stand mixers, and robot vacuums are a few recent examples. However, these machines excel at performing only a single task effectively. The concept of a \"generalist machine\" in homes - a domestic assistant that can adapt and learn from our needs, all while remaining cost-effective - has long been a goal in robotics that has been steadily pursued for decades. In this work, we initiate a large-scale effort towards this goal by introducing Dobb-E, an affordable yet versatile general-purpose system for learning robotic manipulation within household settings. Dobb-E can learn a new task with only five minutes of a user showing it how to do it, thanks to a demonstration collection tool (\"The Stick\") we built out of cheap parts and iPhones. We use the Stick to collect 13 hours of data in 22 homes of New York City, and train Home Pretrained Representations (HPR). Then, in a novel home environment, with five minutes of demonstrations and fifteen minutes of adapting the HPR model, we show that Dobb-E can reliably solve the task on the Stretch, a mobile robot readily available on the market. Across roughly 30 days of experimentation in homes of New York City and surrounding areas, we test our system in 10 homes, with a total of 109 tasks in different environments, and finally achieve a success rate of 81%. Beyond success percentages, our experiments reveal a plethora of unique challenges absent or ignored in lab robotics. These range from effects of strong shadows, to variable demonstration quality by non-expert users. With the hope of accelerating research on home robots, and eventually seeing robot butlers in every home, we open-source Dobb-E software stack and models, our data, and our hardware designs at https://dobb-e.com",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "We propose CG-HOI, the first method to address the task of generating dynamic 3D human-object interactions (HOIs) from text. We model the motion of both human and object in an interdependent fashion, as semantically rich human motion rarely happens in isolation without any interactions. Our key insight is that explicitly modeling contact between the human body surface and object geometry can be used as strong proxy guidance, both during training and inference. Using this guidance to bridge human and object motion enables generating more realistic and physically plausible interaction sequences, where the human body and corresponding object move in a coherent manner. Our method first learns to model human motion, object motion, and contact in a joint diffusion process, inter-correlated through cross-attention. We then leverage this learned contact for guidance during inference synthesis of realistic, coherent HOIs. Extensive evaluation shows that our joint contact-based human-object interaction approach generates realistic and physically plausible sequences, and we show two applications highlighting the capabilities of our method. Conditioned on a given object trajectory, we can generate the corresponding human motion without re-training, demonstrating strong human-object interdependency learning. Our approach is also flexible, and can be applied to static real-world 3D scene scans",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Modeling animatable human avatars from RGB videos is a long-standing and challenging problem. Recent works usually adopt MLP-based neural radiance fields (NeRF) to represent 3D humans, but it remains difficult for pure MLPs to regress pose-dependent garment details. To this end, we introduce Animatable Gaussians, a new avatar representation that leverages powerful 2D CNNs and 3D Gaussian splatting to create high-fidelity avatars. To associate 3D Gaussians with the animatable avatar, we learn a parametric template from the input videos, and then parameterize the template on two front \\& back canonical Gaussian maps where each pixel represents a 3D Gaussian. The learned template is adaptive to the wearing garments for modeling looser clothes like dresses. Such template-guided 2D parameterization enables us to employ a powerful StyleGAN-based CNN to learn the pose-dependent Gaussian maps for modeling detailed dynamic appearances. Furthermore, we introduce a pose projection strategy for better generalization given novel poses. Overall, our method can create lifelike avatars with dynamic, realistic and generalized appearances. Experiments show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches. Code: https://github.com/lizhe00/AnimatableGaussians",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Virtual try-on has become a popular research topic, but most existing methods focus on studio images with a clean background. They can achieve plausible results for this studio try-on setting by learning to warp a garment image to fit a person's body from paired training data, i.e., garment images paired with images of people wearing the same garment. Such data is often collected from commercial websites, where each garment is demonstrated both by itself and on several models. By contrast, it is hard to collect paired data for in-the-wild scenes, and therefore, virtual try-on for casual images of people against cluttered backgrounds is rarely studied. In this work, we fill the gap in the current virtual try-on research by (1) introducing a Street TryOn benchmark to evaluate performance on street scenes and (2) proposing a novel method that can learn without paired data, from a set of in-the-wild person images directly. Our method can achieve robust performance across shop and street domains using a novel DensePose warping correction method combined with diffusion-based inpainting controlled by pose and semantic segmentation. Our experiments demonstrate competitive performance for standard studio try-on tasks and SOTA performance for street try-on and cross-domain try-on tasks",

    "title": "Interactive Autonomous Navigation with Internal State Inference and Interactivity Estimation",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) provides a promising way for intelligent agents (e.g., autonomous vehicles) to learn to navigate complex scenarios. However, DRL with neural networks as function approximators is typically considered a black box with little explainability and often suffers from suboptimal performance, especially for autonomous navigation in highly interactive multi-agent environments. To address these issues, we propose three auxiliary tasks with spatio-temporal relational reasoning and integrate them into the standard DRL framework, which improves the decision making performance and provides explainable intermediate indicators. We propose to explicitly infer the internal states (i.e., traits and intentions) of surrounding agents (e.g., human drivers) as well as to predict their future trajectories in the situations with and without the ego agent through counterfactual reasoning. These auxiliary tasks provide additional supervision signals to infer the behavior patterns of other interactive agents. Multiple variants of framework integration strategies are compared. We also employ a spatio-temporal graph neural network to encode relations between dynamic entities, which enhances both internal state inference and decision making of the ego agent. Moreover, we propose an interactivity estimation mechanism based on the difference between predicted trajectories in these two situations, which indicates the degree of influence of the ego agent on other agents. To validate the proposed method, we design an intersection driving simulator based on the Intelligent Intersection Driver Model (IIDM) that simulates vehicles and pedestrians. Our approach achieves robust and state-of-the-art performance in terms of standard evaluation metrics and provides explainable intermediate indicators (i.e., internal states, and interactivity scores) for decision making",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Text-to-image generation has witnessed significant progress with the advent of diffusion models. Despite the ability to generate photorealistic images, current text-to-image diffusion models still often struggle to accurately interpret and follow complex input text prompts. In contrast to existing models that aim to generate images only with their best effort, we introduce Self-correcting LLM-controlled Diffusion (SLD). SLD is a framework that generates an image from the input prompt, assesses its alignment with the prompt, and performs self-corrections on the inaccuracies in the generated image. Steered by an LLM controller, SLD turns text-to-image generation into an iterative closed-loop process, ensuring correctness in the resulting image. SLD is not only training-free but can also be seamlessly integrated with diffusion models behind API access, such as DALL-E 3, to further boost the performance of state-of-the-art diffusion models. Experimental results show that our approach can rectify a majority of incorrect generations, particularly in generative numeracy, attribute binding, and spatial relationships. Furthermore, by simply adjusting the instructions to the LLM, SLD can perform image editing tasks, bridging the gap between text-to-image generation and image editing pipelines.

    "title": "ViT-Lens-2: Gateway to Omni-modal Intelligence",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Aiming to advance AI agents, large foundation models significantly improve reasoning and instruction execution, yet the current focus on vision and language neglects the potential of perceiving diverse modalities in open-world environments. However, the success of data-driven vision and language models is costly or even infeasible to be reproduced for rare modalities. In this paper, we present ViT-Lens-2 that facilitates efficient omni-modal representation learning by perceiving novel modalities with a pretrained ViT and aligning them to a pre-defined space. Specifically, the modality-specific lens is tuned to project any-modal signals to an intermediate embedding space, which are then processed by a strong ViT with pre-trained visual knowledge. The encoded representations are optimized toward aligning with the modal-independent space, pre-defined by off-the-shelf foundation models. ViT-Lens-2 provides a unified solution for representation learning of increasing modalities with two appealing advantages: (i) Unlocking the great potential of pretrained ViTs to novel modalities effectively with efficient data regime; (ii) Enabling emergent downstream capabilities through modality alignment and shared ViT parameters. We tailor ViT-Lens-2 to learn representations for 3D point cloud, depth, audio, tactile and EEG, and set new state-of-the-art results across various understanding tasks, such as zero-shot classification. By seamlessly integrating ViT-Lens-2 into Multimodal Foundation Models, we enable Any-modality to Text and Image Generation in a zero-shot manner.

    "title": "DiffSLVA: Harnessing Diffusion Models for Sign Language Video Anonymization",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Since American Sign Language (ASL) has no standard written form, Deaf signers frequently share videos in order to communicate in their native language. However, since both hands and face convey critical linguistic information in signed languages, sign language videos cannot preserve signer privacy. While signers have expressed interest, for a variety of applications, in sign language video anonymization that would effectively preserve linguistic content, attempts to develop such technology have had limited success, given the complexity of hand movements and facial expressions. Existing approaches rely predominantly on precise pose estimations of the signer in video footage and often require sign language video datasets for training. These requirements prevent them from processing videos 'in the wild,' in part because of the limited diversity present in current sign language video datasets. To address these limitations, our research introduces DiffSLVA, a novel methodology that utilizes pre-trained large-scale diffusion models for zero-shot text-guided sign language video anonymization. We incorporate ControlNet, which leverages low-level image features such as HED (Holistically-Nested Edge Detection) edges, to circumvent the need for pose estimation. Additionally, we develop a specialized module dedicated to capturing facial expressions, which are critical for conveying essential linguistic information in signed languages. We then combine the above methods to achieve anonymization that better preserves the essential linguistic content of the original signer. This innovative methodology makes possible, for the first time, sign language video anonymization that could be used for real-world applications, which would offer significant benefits to the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing communities.

This enables users to generate multiple plausible edits per attribute. We capitalize on disentangled latent spaces of pretrained GANs and train a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) to learn the latent distribution for diverse edits. Specifically, we train DDPM over a dataset of edit latent directions obtained by embedding image pairs with a single attribute change. This leads to latent subspaces that enable diverse attribute editing. Applying diffusion in the highly compressed latent space allows us to model rich distributions of edits within limited computational resources.

    "abstract": "We present a novel differentiable point-based rendering framework for material and lighting decomposition from multi-view images, enabling editing, ray-tracing, and real-time relighting of the 3D point cloud. Specifically, a 3D scene is represented as a set of relightable 3D Gaussian points, where each point is additionally associated with a normal direction, BRDF parameters, and incident lights from different directions. To achieve robust lighting estimation, we further divide incident lights of each point into global and local components, as well as view-dependent visibilities. The 3D scene is optimized through the 3D Gaussian Splatting technique while BRDF and lighting are decomposed by physically-based differentiable rendering. Moreover, we introduce an innovative point-based ray-tracing approach based on the bounding volume hierarchy for efficient visibility baking, enabling real-time rendering and relighting of 3D Gaussian points with accurate shadow effects. Extensive experiments demonstrate improved BRDF estimation and novel view rendering results compared to state-of-the-art material estimation approaches. Our framework showcases the potential to revolutionize the mesh-based graphics pipeline with a relightable, traceable, and editable rendering pipeline solely based on point cloud.

Given a single RGB image or multiview images, our network infers a signed distance function (SDF) discretized on a tetrahedral mesh surrounding the body in a rest pose. Subsequently, inferred pose and camera parameters are used to generate a normal map from the SDF. A key aspect of our approach is the use of Marching Tetrahedra to (uniquely) compute a triangulated surface from the SDF on the tetrahedral mesh, facilitating straightforward differentiation (and thus backpropagation). Thus, given only ground truth normal maps (with no volumetric information ground truth information), we can train the network to produce SDF values from corresponding RGB images. Optionally, an additional multiview loss leads to improved results. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach for both network inference and 3D reconstruction",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Understanding how the 3D scene evolves is vital for making decisions in autonomous driving. Most existing methods achieve this by predicting the movements of object boxes, which cannot capture more fine-grained scene information. In this paper, we explore a new framework of learning a world model, OccWorld, in the 3D Occupancy space to simultaneously predict the movement of the ego car and the evolution of the surrounding scenes. We propose to learn a world model based on 3D occupancy rather than 3D bounding boxes and segmentation maps for three reasons: 1) expressiveness. 3D occupancy can describe the more fine-grained 3D structure of the scene; 2) efficiency. 3D occupancy is more economical to obtain (e.g., from sparse LiDAR points). 3) versatility. 3D occupancy can adapt to both vision and LiDAR. To facilitate the modeling of the world evolution, we learn a reconstruction-based scene tokenizer on the 3D occupancy to obtain discrete scene tokens to describe the surrounding scenes. We then adopt a GPT-like spatial-temporal generative transformer to generate subsequent scene and ego tokens to decode the future occupancy and ego trajectory. Extensive experiments on the widely used nuScenes benchmark demonstrate the ability of OccWorld to effectively model the evolution of the driving scenes. OccWorld also produces competitive planning results without using instance and map supervision. Code: https://github.com/wzzheng/OccWorld",

    "abstract": "Recently, impressive results have been achieved in 3D scene editing with text instructions based on a 2D diffusion model. However, current diffusion models primarily generate images by predicting noise in the latent space, and the editing is usually applied to the whole image, which makes it challenging to perform delicate, especially localized, editing for 3D scenes. Inspired by recent 3D Gaussian splatting, we propose a systematic framework, named GaussianEditor, to edit 3D scenes delicately via 3D Gaussians with text instructions. Benefiting from the explicit property of 3D Gaussians, we design a series of techniques to achieve delicate editing. Specifically, we first extract the region of interest (RoI) corresponding to the text instruction, aligning it to 3D Gaussians. The Gaussian RoI is further used to control the editing process. Our framework can achieve more delicate and precise editing of 3D scenes than previous methods while enjoying much faster training speed, i.e. within 20 minutes on a single V100 GPU, more than twice as fast as Instruct-NeRF2NeRF (45 minutes -- 2 hours)",

    "title": "Automated Measurement of Vascular Calcification in Femoral Endarterectomy Patients Using Deep Learning",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Atherosclerosis, a chronic inflammatory disease affecting the large arteries, presents a global health risk. Accurate analysis of diagnostic images, like computed tomographic angiograms (CTAs), is essential for staging and monitoring the progression of atherosclerosis-related conditions, including peripheral arterial disease (PAD). However, manual analysis of CTA images is time-consuming and tedious. To address this limitation, we employed a deep learning model to segment the vascular system in CTA images of PAD patients undergoing femoral endarterectomy surgery and to measure vascular calcification from the left renal artery to the patella. Utilizing proprietary CTA images of 27 patients undergoing femoral endarterectomy surgery provided by Prisma Health Midlands, we developed a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model to first segment the arterial system, starting from the descending aorta to the patella, and second, to provide a metric of arterial calcification. Our designed DNN achieved 83.4% average Dice accuracy in segmenting arteries from aorta to patella, advancing the state-of-the-art by 0.8%. Furthermore, our work is the first to present a robust statistical analysis of automated calcification measurement in the lower extremities using deep learning, attaining a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 9.5% and a correlation coefficient of 0.978 between automated and manual calcification scores. These findings underscore the potential of deep learning techniques as a rapid and accurate tool for medical professionals to assess calcification in the abdominal aorta and its branches above the patella.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "DNN-based image classification models are susceptible to adversarial attacks. Most previous adversarial attacks do not focus on the interpretability of the generated adversarial examples, and we cannot gain insights into the mechanism of the target classifier from the attacks. Therefore, we propose Adversarial Doodles, which have interpretable shapes. We optimize black b\\'ezier curves to fool the target classifier by overlaying them onto the input image. By introducing random perspective transformation and regularizing the doodled area, we obtain compact attacks that cause misclassification even when humans replicate them by hand. Adversarial doodles provide describable and intriguing insights into the relationship between our attacks and the classifier's output. We utilize adversarial doodles and discover the bias inherent in the target classifier, such as \"We add two strokes on its head, a triangle onto its body, and two lines inside the triangle on a bird image. Then, the classifier misclassifies the image as a butterfly",

    "title": "Unified Batch Normalization: Identifying and Alleviating the Feature Condensation in Batch Normalization and a Unified Framework",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Batch Normalization (BN) has become an essential technique in contemporary neural network design, enhancing training stability. Specifically, BN employs centering and scaling operations to standardize features along the batch dimension and uses an affine transformation to recover features. Although standard BN has shown its capability to improve deep neural network training and convergence, it still exhibits inherent limitations in certain cases. Most existing techniques that enhance BN consider a single or a few aspects of BN. In this paper, we first identify problems with BN from a feature perspective and explore that feature condensation exists in the learning when employing BN, which negatively affects testing performance. To tackle this problem, we propose a two-stage unified framework called Unified Batch Normalization (UBN). In the first stage, we utilize a simple feature condensation threshold to alleviate the feature condensation, which hinders inappropriate statistic updates in normalization. In the second stage, we unify various normalization variants to boost each component of BN. Our experimental results reveal that UBN significantly enhances performance across different visual backbones and notably expedites network training convergence, particularly in early training stages. Notably, our method improved about 3% in top-1 accuracy on ImageNet classification with large batch sizes, showing the effectiveness of our approach in real-world scenarios",

This uncertainty becomes even larger when predicting far into the future. However, the majority of existing action anticipation models adhere to a deterministic approach, neglecting to account for future uncertainties. In this work, we rethink action anticipation from a generative view, employing diffusion models to capture different possible future actions. In this framework, future actions are iteratively generated from standard Gaussian noise in the latent space, conditioned on the observed video, and subsequently transitioned into the action space. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets, i.e., Breakfast, 50Salads, EpicKitchens, and EGTEA Gaze+, are performed and the proposed method achieves superior or comparable results to state-of-the-art methods, showing the effectiveness of a generative approach for action anticipation.

    "title": "Direct2.5: Diverse Text-to-3D Generation via Multi-view 2.5D Diffusion",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Recent advances in generative AI have unveiled significant potential for the creation of 3D content. However, current methods either apply a pre-trained 2D diffusion model with the time-consuming score distillation sampling (SDS), or a direct 3D diffusion model trained on limited 3D data losing generation diversity. In this work, we approach the problem by employing a multi-view 2.5D diffusion fine-tuned from a pre-trained 2D diffusion model. The multi-view 2.5D diffusion directly models the structural distribution of 3D data, while still maintaining the strong generalization ability of the original 2D diffusion model, filling the gap between 2D diffusion-based and direct 3D diffusion-based methods for 3D content generation. During inference, multi-view normal maps are generated using the 2.5D diffusion, and a novel differentiable rasterization scheme is introduced to fuse the almost consistent multi-view normal maps into a consistent 3D model. We further design a normal-conditioned multi-view image generation module for fast appearance generation given the 3D geometry. Our method is a one-pass diffusion process and does not require any SDS optimization as post-processing. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that, our direct 2.5D generation with the specially-designed fusion scheme can achieve diverse, mode-seeking-free, and high-fidelity 3D content generation in only 10 seconds.

Text2Loc follows a coarse-to-fine localization pipeline: text-submap global place recognition, followed by fine localization. In global place recognition, relational dynamics among each textual hint are captured in a hierarchical transformer with max-pooling (HTM), whereas a balance between positive and negative pairs is maintained using text-submap contrastive learning. Moreover, we propose a novel matching-free fine localization method to further refine the location predictions, which completely removes the need for complicated text-instance matching and is lighter, faster, and more accurate than previous methods. Extensive experiments show that Text2Loc improves the localization accuracy by up to $2\\times$ over the state-of-the-art on the KITTI360Pose dataset. We will make the code publicly available",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Continual Learning in semantic scene segmentation aims to continually learn new unseen classes in dynamic environments while maintaining previously learned knowledge. Prior studies focused on modeling the catastrophic forgetting and background shift challenges in continual learning. However, fairness, another major challenge that causes unfair predictions leading to low performance among major and minor classes, still needs to be well addressed. In addition, prior methods have yet to model the unknown classes well, thus resulting in producing non-discriminative features among unknown classes. This paper presents a novel Fairness Learning via Contrastive Attention Approach to continual learning in semantic scene understanding. In particular, we first introduce a new Fairness Contrastive Clustering loss to address the problems of catastrophic forgetting and fairness. Then, we propose an attention-based visual grammar approach to effectively model the background shift problem and unknown classes, producing better feature representations for different unknown classes. Through our experiments, our proposed approach achieves State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance on different continual learning settings of three standard benchmarks, i.e., ADE20K, Cityscapes, and Pascal VOC.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Procedural videos show step-by-step demonstrations of tasks like recipe preparation. Understanding such videos is challenging, involving the precise localization of steps and the generation of textual instructions. Manually annotating steps and writing instructions is costly, which limits the size of current datasets and hinders effective learning. Leveraging large but noisy video-transcript datasets for pre-training can boost performance, but demands significant computational resources. Furthermore, transcripts contain irrelevant content and exhibit style variation compared to instructions written by human annotators. To mitigate both issues, we propose a technique, Sieve-&-Swap, to automatically curate a smaller dataset: (i) Sieve filters irrelevant transcripts and (ii) Swap enhances the quality of the text instruction by automatically replacing the transcripts with human-written instructions from a text-only recipe dataset. The curated dataset, three orders of magnitude smaller than current web-scale datasets, enables efficient training of large-scale models with competitive performance. We complement our Sieve-\\&-Swap approach with a Procedure Transformer (ProcX) for end-to-end step localization and instruction generation for procedural videos. When this model is pre-trained on our curated dataset, it achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot and finetuning settings on YouCook2 and Tasty, while using a fraction of the computational resources",

Employing alternative initial weights from another screenshots dataset boosts accuracy for EfficientNetB2 and EfficientNetB3, with the latter reaching a peak accuracy of 76.36% and demonstrating reduced convergence epochs from 23.7 to 20.5 on average. Overall, the combination of optimal architecture and weights attains 77.67% accuracy, primarily led by EfficientNetB3 in 19 systems.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Nuclear instance segmentation in histology images is crucial for a broad spectrum of clinical applications. Current prevailing nuclear instance segmentation algorithms rely on regression of nuclei contours, distance maps, watershed markers or a proxy nuclear representation of star-convex polygons. Consequently, these methods necessitate sophisticated post-processing operations to distinguish nuclei instances, which are commonly acknowledged to be error-prone and parameter-sensitive. Recently, the segment anything model (SAM) has earned attracted huge attention within the domain of medical image segmentation due to its impressive generalization ability and promptable property. Nevertheless, its potential on nuclear instance segmentation remains largely underexplored. In this paper, we present a novel prompt-driven framework that consists of a point prompter and a SAM for automatic nuclei instance segmentation. Specifically, the prompter learns to generate a unique point prompt for each nucleus while the SAM is fine tuned to output the corresponding mask of the cued nucleus. Furthermore, we propose to add adjacent nuclei as negative prompts to promote the model's ability to recognize overlapping nuclei. Without bells and whistles, our proposed method sets a new state-of-the-art performance on three challenging benchmarks.

State-of-the-art pipelines focus on the aggregation of features extracted from a deep backbone, in order to form a global descriptor for each image. In this context, we introduce SALAD (Sinkhorn Algorithm for Locally Aggregated Descriptors), which reformulates NetVLAD's soft-assignment of local features to clusters as an optimal transport problem. In SALAD, we consider both feature-to-cluster and cluster-to-feature relations and we also introduce a 'dustbin' cluster, designed to selectively discard features deemed non-informative, enhancing the overall descriptor quality. Additionally, we leverage and fine-tune DINOv2 as a backbone, which provides enhanced description power for the local features, and dramatically reduces the required training time. As a result, our single-stage method not only surpasses single-stage baselines in public VPR datasets, but also surpasses two-stage methods that add a re-ranking with significantly higher cost.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "This paper addresses the challenge of point-supervised temporal action detection, in which only one frame per action instance is annotated in the training set. Self-training aims to provide supplementary supervision for the training process by generating pseudo-labels (action proposals) from a base model. However, most current methods generate action proposals by applying manually designed thresholds to action classification probabilities and treating adjacent snippets as independent entities. As a result, these methods struggle to generate complete action proposals, exhibit sensitivity to fluctuations in action classification scores, and generate redundant and overlapping action proposals. This paper proposes a novel framework termed ADM-Loc, which stands for Actionness Distribution Modeling for point-supervised action Localization. ADM-Loc generates action proposals by fitting a composite distribution, comprising both Gaussian and uniform distributions, to the action classification signals. This fitting process is tailored to each action class present in the video and is applied separately for each action instance, ensuring the distinctiveness of their distributions. ADM-Loc significantly enhances the alignment between the generated action proposals and ground-truth action instances and offers high-quality pseudo-labels for self-training. Moreover, to model action boundary snippets, it enforces consistency in action classification scores during training by employing Gaussian kernels, supervised with the proposed loss functions.

PATRIOT (Panoramic Asset Tracking of Real-Time Information for the Ouija Tabletop) is a research effort and proposed solution to performing deck tracking with passive sensing and without the need for GPS sensors.

The authors have developed and tested algorithms to perform pose estimations of assets in real-time including OpenPifPaf, High-Resolution Network (HRNet), HigherHRNet (HHRNet), Faster R-CNN, and in-house developed encoder-decoder network.

TCM uses Temporal Texture Guidance, which provides spatially-aligned and detail-rich texture information synthesized in adjacent frames. This guides the generative process of the current frame toward high-quality and temporally-consistent results.

Therefore, a novel meta-learning method based on domain enhancement and feature alignment (MetaDefa) is proposed to improve the model generalization performance. First, the background substitution and visual corruptions techniques are used to generate diverse and effective augmented domains. Then, the multi-channel feature alignment module based on class activation maps and class agnostic activation maps is designed to effectively extract adequate transferability knowledge. In this module, domain-invariant features can be fully explored by focusing on similar target regions between source and augmented domains feature space and suppressing the feature representation of non-similar target regions.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel approach to post-Optical Character Recognition Correction (POC) for handwritten Cyrillic text, addressing a significant gap in current research methodologies. This gap is due to the lack of large text corporas that provide OCR errors for further training of language-based POC models, which are demanding in terms of corpora size. Our study primarily focuses on the development and application of a synthetic handwriting generation engine based on B\\'ezier curves. Such an engine generates highly realistic handwritten text in any amounts, which we utilize to create a substantial dataset by transforming Russian text corpora sourced from the internet. We apply a Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) model to this dataset to identify OCR errors, forming the basis for our POC model training. The correction model is trained on a 90-symbol input context, utilizing a pre-trained T5 architecture with a seq2seq correction task. We evaluate our approach on HWR200 and School_notebooks_RU datasets as they provide significant challenges in the HTR domain. Furthermore, POC can be used to highlight errors for teachers, evaluating student performance. This can be done simply by comparing sentences before and after correction, displaying differences in text. Our primary contribution lies in the innovative use of B\\'ezier curves for Cyrillic text generation and subsequent error correction using a specialized POC model. We validate our approach by presenting Word Accuracy Rate (WAR) and Character Accuracy Rate (CAR) results, both with and without post-OCR correction, using real open corporas of handwritten Cyrillic text. These results, coupled with our methodology, are designed to be reproducible, paving the way for further advancements in the field of OCR and handwritten text analysis.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs)-based image captioning has the capability of describing objects not explicitly observed in training data; yet novel objects occur frequently, necessitating the requirement of sustaining up-to-date object knowledge for open-world comprehension. Instead of relying on large amounts of data and scaling up network parameters, we introduce a highly effective retrieval-augmented image captioning method that prompts LLMs with object names retrieved from External Visual--name memory (EVCap). We build ever-changing object knowledge memory using objects' visuals and names, enabling us to (i) update the memory at a minimal cost and (ii) effortlessly augment LLMs with retrieved object names utilizing a lightweight and fast-to-train model. Our model, which was trained only on the COCO dataset, can be adapted to out-domain data without additional fine-tuning or retraining. Our comprehensive experiments conducted on various benchmarks and synthetic commonsense-violating data demonstrate that EVCap, comprising solely 3.97M trainable parameters, exhibits superior performance compared to other methods of equivalent model size scale. Notably, it achieves competitive performance against specialist SOTAs with an enormous number of parameters. Our code is available at https://jiaxuan-li.github.io/EVCap",

However, most AI models are constrained to execute uni-modal tasks, in stark contrast to the comprehensive approaches utilized by medical professionals. To address this, here we present RO-LLaMA, a versatile generalist large language model (LLM) tailored for the field of radiation oncology. This model seamlessly covers a wide range of the workflow of radiation oncologists, adept at various tasks such as clinical report summarization, radiation therapy plan suggestion, and plan-guided therapy target volume segmentation. In particular, to maximize the end-to-end performance, we further present a novel Consistency Embedding Fine-Tuning (CEFTune) technique, which boosts LLM's robustness to additional errors at the intermediates while preserving the capability of handling clean inputs, and creatively transform this concept into LLM-driven segmentation framework as Consistency Embedding Segmentation (CESEG).

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging represents an important diagnostic modality; however, its inherently slow acquisition process poses challenges in obtaining fully sampled k-space data under motion in clinical scenarios such as abdominal, cardiac, and prostate imaging. In the absence of fully sampled acquisitions, which can serve as ground truth data, training deep learning algorithms in a supervised manner to predict the underlying ground truth image becomes an impossible task. To address this limitation, self-supervised methods have emerged as a viable alternative, leveraging available subsampled k-space data to train deep learning networks for MRI reconstruction. Nevertheless, these self-supervised approaches often fall short when compared to supervised methodologies. In this paper, we introduce JSSL (Joint Supervised and Self-supervised Learning), a novel training approach for deep learning-based MRI reconstruction algorithms aimed at enhancing reconstruction quality in scenarios where target dataset(s) containing fully sampled k-space measurements are unavailable. Our proposed method operates by simultaneously training a model in a self-supervised learning setting, using subsampled data from the target dataset(s), and in a supervised learning manner, utilizing data from other datasets, referred to as proxy datasets, where fully sampled k-space data is accessible. To demonstrate the efficacy of JSSL, we utilized subsampled prostate parallel MRI measurements as the target dataset, while employing fully sampled brain and knee k-space acquisitions as proxy datasets. Our results showcase a substantial improvement over conventional self-supervised training methods, thereby underscoring the effectiveness of our joint approach. We provide a theoretical motivation for JSSL and establish a practical \"rule-of-thumb\" for selecting the most appropriate training approach for deep MRI reconstruction",

At the core of our method lies the decomposition of the ill-posed single-view reconstruction problem into hallucination and reconstruction subproblems. For the former, we employ a powerful generative diffusion model to hallucinate back appearances from the input images. For the latter, we leverage skinned body meshes as guidance to recover full-body texture meshes from the input and back-view images. Our designs enable training of the pipeline with only about 500 3D human scans while maintaining its generality and robustness.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In the realm of video object tracking, auxiliary modalities such as depth, thermal, or event data have emerged as valuable assets to complement the RGB trackers. In practice, most existing RGB trackers learn a single set of parameters to use them across datasets and applications. However, a similar single-model unification for multi-modality tracking presents several challenges. These challenges stem from the inherent heterogeneity of inputs -- each with modality-specific representations, the scarcity of multi-modal datasets, and the absence of all the modalities at all times. In this work, we introduce Un-Track, a \\underline{Un}ified Tracker of a single set of parameters for any modality. To handle any modality, our method learns their common latent space through low-rank factorization and reconstruction techniques. More importantly, we use only the RGB-X pairs to learn the common latent space. This unique shared representation seamlessly binds all modalities together, enabling effective unification and accommodating any missing modality, all within a single transformer-based architecture and without the need for modality-specific fine-tuning. Our Un-Track achieves +8.1 absolute F-score gain, on the DepthTrack dataset, by introducing only +2.14 (over 21.50) GFLOPs with +6.6M (over 93M) parameters, through a simple yet efficient prompting strategy. Extensive comparisons on five benchmark datasets with different modalities show that Un-Track surpasses both SOTA unified trackers and modality-specific finetuned counterparts, validating our effectiveness and practicality",

Our model's strength lies in its comprehensive consideration of cellular spatial patterns, where it first generates cell maps from Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) whole slide images (WSIs), which are then fed into a convolutional neural network classification model. Exploiting these cell maps provides the model with robust generalizability to new data, achieving approximately 30% higher accuracy on unseen test-sets compared to current state of the art approaches.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Learning based image quality assessment (IQA) models have obtained impressive performance with the help of reliable subjective quality labels, where mean opinion score (MOS) is the most popular choice. However, in view of the subjective bias of individual annotators, the labor-abundant MOS (LA-MOS) typically requires a large collection of opinion scores from multiple annotators for each image, which significantly increases the learning cost. In this paper, we aim to learn robust IQA models from low-cost MOS (LC-MOS), which only requires very few opinion scores or even a single opinion score for each image. More specifically, we consider the LC-MOS as the noisy observation of LA-MOS and enforce the IQA model learned from LC-MOS to approach the unbiased estimation of LA-MOS. In this way, we represent the subjective bias between LC-MOS and LA-MOS, and the model bias between IQA predictions learned from LC-MOS and LA-MOS (i.e., dual-bias) as two latent variables with unknown parameters. By means of the expectation-maximization based alternating optimization, we can jointly estimate the parameters of the dual-bias, which suppresses the misleading of LC-MOS via a gated dual-bias calibration (GDBC) module. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first exploration of robust IQA model learning from noisy low-cost labels. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on four popular IQA datasets show that the proposed method is robust toward different bias rates and annotation numbers and significantly outperforms the other learning based IQA models when only LC-MOS is available. Furthermore, we also achieve comparable performance with respect to the other models learned with LA-MOS",

    "abstract": "This study focuses on a novel task in text-to-image (T2I) generation, namely action customization. The objective of this task is to learn the co-existing action from limited data and generalize it to unseen humans or even animals. Experimental results show that existing subject-driven customization methods fail to learn the representative characteristics of actions and struggle in decoupling actions from context features, including appearance. To overcome the preference for low-level features and the entanglement of high-level features, we propose an inversion-based method Action-Disentangled Identifier (ADI) to learn action-specific identifiers from the exemplar images. ADI first expands the semantic conditioning space by introducing layer-wise identifier tokens, thereby increasing the representational richness while distributing the inversion across different features. Then, to block the inversion of action-agnostic features, ADI extracts the gradient invariance from the constructed sample triples and masks the updates of irrelevant channels. To comprehensively evaluate the task, we present an ActionBench that includes a variety of actions, each accompanied by meticulously selected samples. Both quantitative and qualitative results show that our ADI outperforms existing baselines in action-customized T2I generation",

We introduce Audio-based Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (A-JEPA), a simple extension method for self-supervised learning from the audio spectrum. Following the design of I-JPEA, our A-JEPA encodes visible audio spectrogram patches with a curriculum masking strategy via context encoder, and predicts the representations of regions sampled at well-designed locations. The target representations of those regions are extracted by the exponential moving average of context encoder, \\emph{i.e.}, target encoder, on the whole spectrogram. We find it beneficial to transfer random block masking into time-frequency aware masking in a curriculum manner, considering the complexity of highly correlated in local time and frequency in audio spectrograms. To enhance contextual semantic understanding and robustness, we fine-tune the encoder with a regularized masking on target datasets, instead of input dropping or zero. Empirically, when built with Vision Transformers structure, we find A-JEPA to be highly scalable and sets new state-of-the-art performance on multiple audio and speech classification tasks, outperforming other recent models that use externally supervised pre-training",

While contrastively trained VLMs show impressive zero-shot generalization performance, their effectiveness is limited when dealing with diverse domains during training and testing. Existing prompt learning techniques overlook the importance of incorporating domain and content information into the prompts, which results in a drop in performance while dealing with such multi-domain data. To address these challenges, we propose a solution that ensures domain-invariant prompt learning while enhancing the expressiveness of visual features. We observe that CLIP's vision encoder struggles to identify contextual image information, particularly when image patches are jumbled up. This issue is especially severe in optical remote sensing images, where land-cover classes exhibit well-defined contextual appearances. To this end, we introduce C-SAW, a method that complements CLIP with a self-supervised loss in the visual space and a novel prompt learning technique that emphasizes both visual domain and content-specific features. We keep the CLIP backbone frozen and introduce a small set of projectors for both the CLIP encoders to train C-SAW contrastively.

However, such techniques suffer from their lack of adaptability to the target devices, as a hardware typically only support specific bit widths. Thus, to adapt to a variety of devices, a quantization method shall be flexible enough to find good accuracy v.s. speed trade-offs for every bit width and target device. To achieve this, we propose PIPE, a quantization method that leverages residual error expansion, along with group sparsity and an ensemble approximation for better parallelization.

    "title": "Stable Segment Anything Model",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The Segment Anything Model (SAM) achieves remarkable promptable segmentation given high-quality prompts which, however, often require good skills to specify. To make SAM robust to casual prompts, this paper presents the first comprehensive analysis on SAM's segmentation stability across a diverse spectrum of prompt qualities, notably imprecise bounding boxes and insufficient points. Our key finding reveals that given such low-quality prompts, SAM's mask decoder tends to activate image features that are biased towards the background or confined to specific object parts. To mitigate this issue, our key idea consists of adjusting the sampling locations of image feature using learnable deformable offsets, while the original SAM model architecture and weights remain unchanged. Consequently, our deformable sampling plugin (DSP) enables SAM to adaptively shift attention to the prompted target regions in a data-driven manner, facilitated by our effective robust training strategy (RTS). During inference, dynamic routing plugin (DRP) is proposed that toggles SAM between the deformable and regular grid sampling modes, conditioned on the input prompt quality. Thus, our solution, termed Stable-SAM, is one of its kind focusing on solely adjusting feature sampling locations, which offers several advantages: 1) improved SAM's segmentation stability across a wide range of prompt qualities, while 2) retaining SAM's powerful promptable segmentation efficiency and generality, with 3) minimal learnable parameters (0.08 M) and fast adaptation (by 1 training epoch). Extensive experiments across multiple datasets validate the effectiveness and advantages of our approach, underscoring Stable-SAM as a more robust solution for segmenting anything.

To align the generated image with layout instructions, we present a training-free layout calibration system SimM that intervenes in the generative process on the fly during inference time. Specifically, following a \"check-locate-rectify\" pipeline, the system first analyses the prompt to generate the target layout and compares it with the intermediate outputs to automatically detect errors. Then, by moving the located activations and making intra- and inter-map adjustments, the rectification process can be performed with negligible computational overhead. To evaluate SimM over a range of layout requirements, we present a benchmark SimMBench that compensates for the lack of superlative spatial relations in existing datasets. And both quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SimM in calibrating the layout inconsistencies",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Large pre-trained vision models achieve impressive success in computer vision. However, fully fine-tuning large models for downstream tasks, particularly in video understanding, can be prohibitively computationally expensive. Recent studies turn their focus towards efficient image-to-video transfer learning. Nevertheless, existing efficient fine-tuning methods lack attention to training memory usage and exploration of transferring a larger model to the video domain. In this paper, we present a novel Spatial-Temporal Side Network for memory-efficient fine-tuning large image models to video understanding, named Side4Video. Specifically, we introduce a lightweight spatial-temporal side network attached to the frozen vision model, which avoids the backpropagation through the heavy pre-trained model and utilizes multi-level spatial features from the original image model. Extremely memory-efficient architecture enables our method to reduce 75% memory usage than previous adapter-based methods. In this way, we can transfer a huge ViT-E (4.4B) for video understanding tasks which is 14x larger than ViT-L (304M). Our approach achieves remarkable performance on various video datasets across unimodal and cross-modal tasks (i.e., action recognition and text-video retrieval), especially in Something-Something V1&V2 (67.3% & 74.6%), Kinetics-400 (88.6%), MSR-VTT (52.3%), MSVD (56.1%) and VATEX (68.8%).

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved significant multimodal generation capabilities, akin to GPT-4. These models predominantly map visual information into language representation space, leveraging the vast knowledge and powerful text generation abilities of LLMs to produce multimodal instruction-following responses. We could term this method as LLMs for Vision because of its employing LLMs for visual-language understanding, yet observe that these MLLMs neglect the potential of harnessing visual knowledge to enhance overall capabilities of LLMs, which could be regraded as Vision Enhancing LLMs. In this paper, we propose an approach called MKS2, aimed at enhancing LLMs through empowering Multimodal Knowledge Storage and Sharing in LLMs. Specifically, we introduce the Modular Visual Memory, a component integrated into the internal blocks of LLMs, designed to store open-world visual information efficiently. Additionally, we present a soft Mixtures-of-Multimodal Experts architecture in LLMs to invoke multimodal knowledge collaboration during generation. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MKS2 substantially augments the reasoning capabilities of LLMs in contexts necessitating physical or commonsense knowledge.

This interconnection extends to the manifestation of interplanar spacings within a crystalline lattice. Analysis of these interplanar spacings and the comprehension of any deviations, whether it be lattice compression or expansion, commonly referred to as strain, hold paramount significance in unraveling various unknowns within the field. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) is widely used to capture atomic-scale ordering, facilitating direct investigation of interplanar spacings. However, creating critical contour maps for visualizing and interpreting lattice stresses in TEM images remains a challenging task. Here we developed a Python code for TEM image processing that can handle a wide range of materials including nanoparticles, 2D materials, pure crystals and solid solutions. This algorithm converts local differences in interplanar spacings into contour maps allowing for a visual representation of lattice expansion and compression. The tool is very generic and can significantly aid in analyzing material properties using TEM images, allowing for a more in-depth exploration of the underlying science behind strain engineering via strain contour maps at the atomic level",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "It is well known that many open-released foundational diffusion models have difficulty in generating images that substantially depart from average brightness, despite such images being present in the training data. This is due to an inconsistency: while denoising starts from pure Gaussian noise during inference, the training noise schedule retains residual data even in the final timestep distribution, due to difficulties in numerical conditioning in mainstream formulation, leading to unintended bias during inference. To mitigate this issue, certain $\\epsilon$-prediction models are combined with an ad-hoc offset-noise methodology. In parallel, some contemporary models have adopted zero-terminal SNR noise schedules together with $\\mathbf{v}$-prediction, which necessitate major alterations to pre-trained models. However, such changes risk destabilizing a large multitude of community-driven applications anchored on these pre-trained models. In light of this, our investigation revisits the fundamental causes, leading to our proposal of an innovative and principled remedy, called One More Step (OMS). By integrating a compact network and incorporating an additional simple yet effective step during inference, OMS elevates image fidelity and harmonizes the dichotomy between training and inference, while preserving original model parameters. Once trained, various pre-trained diffusion models with the same latent domain can share the same OMS module",

The advent of machine learning has opened up new avenues for tackling these diseases effectively. Early detection and diagnosis are essential for successful crop management. While no automated systems have yet been developed specifically for jamun leaf disease detection, various automated systems have been implemented for similar types of disease detection using image processing techniques. This paper presents a comprehensive review of machine learning methodologies employed for diagnosing plant leaf diseases through image classification, which can be adapted for jamun leaf disease detection.

    "abstract": "Linked Data is used in various fields as a new way of structuring and connecting data. Cultural heritage institutions have been using linked data to improve archival descriptions and facilitate the discovery of information. Most archival records have digital representations of physical artifacts in the form of scanned images that are non-machine-readable. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) recognizes text in images and translates it into machine-encoded text. This paper evaluates the impact of image processing methods and parameter tuning in OCR applied to typewritten cultural heritage documents. The approach uses a multi-objective problem formulation to minimize Levenshtein edit distance and maximize the number of words correctly identified with a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) to tune the methods' parameters. Evaluation results show that parameterization by digital representation typology benefits the performance of image pre-processing algorithms in OCR. Furthermore, our findings suggest that employing image pre-processing algorithms in OCR might be more suitable for typologies where the text recognition task without pre-processing does not produce good results. In particular, Adaptive Thresholding, Bilateral Filter, and Opening are the best-performing algorithms for the theatre plays' covers, letters, and overall dataset, respectively, and should be applied before OCR to improve its performance",

Instead, it delves into an essential, yet must-know baseline in light of the latest advancements in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI): the utilization of GPT-4 for visual understanding. Our study centers on the evaluation of GPT-4's linguistic and visual capabilities in zero-shot visual recognition tasks. Specifically, we explore the potential of its generated rich textual descriptions across various categories to enhance recognition performance without any training. Additionally, we evaluate its visual proficiency in directly recognizing diverse visual content. To achieve this, we conduct an extensive series of experiments, systematically quantifying the performance of GPT-4 across three modalities: images, videos, and point clouds. This comprehensive evaluation encompasses a total of 16 widely recognized benchmark datasets, providing top-1 and top-5 accuracy metrics. Our study reveals that leveraging GPT-4's advanced linguistic knowledge to generate rich descriptions markedly improves zero-shot recognition. In terms of visual proficiency, GPT-4V's average performance across 16 datasets sits roughly between the capabilities of OpenAI-CLIP's ViT-L and EVA-CLIP's ViT-E.

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative influence, engendering paradigm shifts in global societies, spanning academia and industry. However, in light of these rapid advances, addressing the underrepresentation of black communities and African countries in AI is crucial. Boosting enthusiasm for AI can be effectively accomplished by showcasing straightforward applications around tasks like identifying and categorizing traditional symbols, such as Adinkra symbols, or familiar objects within the community. In this research endeavor, we dived into classical machine learning and harnessed the power of deep learning models to tackle the intricate task of classifying and recognizing Adinkra symbols. The idea led to a newly constructed ADINKRA dataset comprising 174,338 images meticulously organized into 62 distinct classes, each representing a singular and emblematic symbol. We constructed a CNN model for classification and recognition using six convolutional layers, three fully connected (FC) layers, and optional dropout regularization. The model is a simpler and smaller version of VGG, with fewer layers, smaller channel sizes, and a fixed kernel size. Additionally, we tap into the transfer learning capabilities provided by pre-trained models like VGG and ResNet. These models assist us in both classifying images and extracting features that can be used with classical machine learning models. We assess the model's performance by measuring its accuracy and convergence rate and visualizing the areas that significantly influence its predictions. These evaluations serve as a foundational benchmark for future assessments of the ADINKRA dataset.

Existing methods incorporate linguistic features into visual features and obtain multi-modal features for mask decoding. However, these methods may segment the visually salient entity instead of the correct referring region, as the multi-modal features are dominated by the abundant visual context. In this paper, we propose MARIS, a referring image segmentation method that leverages the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and introduces a mutual-aware attention mechanism to enhance the cross-modal fusion via two parallel branches. Specifically, our mutual-aware attention mechanism consists of Vision-Guided Attention and Language-Guided Attention, which bidirectionally model the relationship between visual and linguistic features. Correspondingly, we design a Mask Decoder to enable explicit linguistic guidance for more consistent segmentation with the language expression. To this end, a multi-modal query token is proposed to integrate linguistic information and interact with visual information simultaneously.

    "abstract": "As black-box machine learning models grow in complexity and find applications in high-stakes scenarios, it is imperative to provide explanations for their predictions. Although Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) [22] is a widely adpoted method for understanding model behaviors, it is unstable with respect to random seeds [35,24,3] and exhibits low local fidelity (i.e., how well the explanation approximates the model's local behaviors) [21,16]. Our study shows that this instability problem stems from small sample weights, leading to the dominance of regularization and slow convergence. Additionally, LIME's sampling neighborhood is non-local and biased towards the reference, resulting in poor local fidelity and sensitivity to reference choice. To tackle these challenges, we introduce GLIME, an enhanced framework extending LIME and unifying several prior methods. Within the GLIME framework, we derive an equivalent formulation of LIME that achieves significantly faster convergence and improved stability. By employing a local and unbiased sampling distribution, GLIME generates explanations with higher local fidelity compared to LIME. GLIME explanations are independent of reference choice. Moreover, GLIME offers users the flexibility to choose a sampling distribution based on their specific scenarios",

This study investigates the application Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), a type of generative AI model, to lung cancer lesions. Proposed models were trained on lesions extracted from 3D CT scans in the LIDC-IDRI public dataset. Latent vector representations of 2D slices produced by the VAEs were explored through clustering to justify their quality and used in an MLP classifier model for lung cancer diagnosis, the best model achieved state-of-the-art metrics of AUC 0.98 and 93.1% accuracy. Cluster analysis shows the VAE latent space separates the dataset of malignant and benign lesions based on meaningful feature components including tumour size, shape, patient and malignancy class. We also include a comparative analysis of the standard Gaussian VAE (GVAE) and the more recent Dirichlet VAE (DirVAE), which replaces the prior with a Dirichlet distribution to encourage a more explainable latent space with disentangled feature representation.

Fortunately, the recent Segment Anything Model (SAM) has showcased remarkable zero-shot transfer performance, which provides a promising solution to tackle this task. Motivated by this, we introduce SAM-6D, a novel framework designed to realize the task through two steps, including instance segmentation and pose estimation. Given the target objects, SAM-6D employs two dedicated sub-networks, namely Instance Segmentation Model (ISM) and Pose Estimation Model (PEM), to perform these steps on cluttered RGB-D images. ISM takes SAM as an advanced starting point to generate all possible object proposals and selectively preserves valid ones through meticulously crafted object matching scores in terms of semantics, appearance and geometry. By treating pose estimation as a partial-to-partial point matching problem, PEM performs a two-stage point matching process featuring a novel design of background tokens to construct dense 3D-3D correspondence, ultimately yielding the pose estimates. Without bells and whistles, SAM-6D outperforms the existing methods on the seven core datasets of the BOP Benchmark for both instance segmentation and pose estimation of novel objects",

    "abstract": "As for human avatar reconstruction, contemporary techniques commonly necessitate the acquisition of costly data and struggle to achieve satisfactory results from a small number of casual images. In this paper, we investigate this task from a few-shot unconstrained photo album. The reconstruction of human avatars from such data sources is challenging because of limited data amount and dynamic articulated poses. For handling dynamic data, we integrate a skinning mechanism with deep marching tetrahedra (DMTet) to form a drivable tetrahedral representation, which drives arbitrary mesh topologies generated by the DMTet for the adaptation of unconstrained images. To effectively mine instructive information from few-shot data, we devise a two-phase optimization method with few-shot reference and few-shot guidance. The former focuses on aligning avatar identity with reference images, while the latter aims to generate plausible appearances for unseen regions. Overall, our framework, called HaveFun, can undertake avatar reconstruction, rendering, and animation. Extensive experiments on our developed benchmarks demonstrate that HaveFun exhibits substantially superior performance in reconstructing the human body and hand.

Shape matching identifies correspondences between two shapes and is a fundamental step in many computer vision and graphics applications. Our approach is designed to be particularly robust when matching shapes digitized using 3D scanners that contain fine geometric detail and suffer from different types of noise including topological noise caused by the coalescence of spatially close surface regions. We build on two strategies. First, using a hierarchical patch based shape representation we match shapes consistently in a coarse to fine manner, allowing for robustness to noise. This multi-scale representation drastically reduces the dimensionality of the problem when matching at the coarsest scale, rendering unsupervised learning feasible. Second, we constrain this hierarchical matching to be reflected in 3D by fitting a patch-wise near-rigid deformation model. Using this constraint, we leverage spatial continuity at different scales to capture global shape properties, resulting in matchings that generalize well to data with different deformations and noise characteristics. Experiments demonstrate that our approach obtains significantly better results on raw 3D scans than state-of-the-art methods, while performing on-par on standard test scenarios",

    "title": "Enhancing Diffusion Models with Text-Encoder Reinforcement Learning",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Text-to-image diffusion models are typically trained to optimize the log-likelihood objective, which presents challenges in meeting specific requirements for downstream tasks, such as image aesthetics and image-text alignment. Recent research addresses this issue by refining the diffusion U-Net using human rewards through reinforcement learning or direct backpropagation. However, many of them overlook the importance of the text encoder, which is typically pretrained and fixed during training. In this paper, we demonstrate that by finetuning the text encoder through reinforcement learning, we can enhance the text-image alignment of the results, thereby improving the visual quality. Our primary motivation comes from the observation that the current text encoder is suboptimal, often requiring careful prompt adjustment. While fine-tuning the U-Net can partially improve performance, it remains suffering from the suboptimal text encoder. Therefore, we propose to use reinforcement learning with low-rank adaptation to finetune the text encoder based on task-specific rewards, referred as \\textbf{TexForce}. We first show that finetuning the text encoder can improve the performance of diffusion models. Then, we illustrate that TexForce can be simply combined with existing U-Net finetuned models to get much better results without additional training. Finally, we showcase the adaptability of our method in diverse applications, including the generation of high-quality face and hand images",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Large vision-language models are steadily gaining personalization capabilities at the cost of fine-tuning or data augmentation. We present two models for image generation using model-agnostic learning that align semantic priors with generative capabilities. RLDF, or Reinforcement Learning from Diffusion Feedback, is a singular approach for visual imitation through prior-preserving reward function guidance. This employs Q-learning (with standard Q*) for generation and follows a semantic-rewarded trajectory for image search through finite encoding-tailored actions. The second proposed method, noisy diffusion gradient, is optimization driven. At the root of both methods is a special CFG encoding that we propose for continual semantic guidance. Using only a single input image and no text input, RLDF generates high-quality images over varied domains including retail, sports and agriculture showcasing class-consistency and strong visual diversity.

    "abstract": "We present Paint Neural Stroke Field (PaintNeSF), a novel technique to generate stylized images of a 3D scene at arbitrary novel views from multi-view 2D images. Different from existing methods which apply stylization to trained neural radiance fields at the voxel level, our approach draws inspiration from image-to-painting methods, simulating the progressive painting process of human artwork with vector strokes. We develop a palette of stylized 3D strokes from basic primitives and splines, and consider the 3D scene stylization task as a multi-view reconstruction process based on these 3D stroke primitives. Instead of directly searching for the parameters of these 3D strokes, which would be too costly, we introduce a differentiable renderer that allows optimizing stroke parameters using gradient descent, and propose a training scheme to alleviate the vanishing gradient issue. The extensive evaluation demonstrates that our approach effectively synthesizes 3D scenes with significant geometric and aesthetic stylization while maintaining a consistent appearance across different views. Our method can be further integrated with style loss and image-text contrastive models to extend its applications, including color transfer and text-driven 3D scene drawing",

    "title": "Only Positive Cases: 5-fold High-order Attention Interaction Model for Skin Segmentation Derived Classification",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Computer-aided diagnosis of skin diseases is an important tool. However, the interpretability of computer-aided diagnosis is currently poor. Dermatologists and patients cannot intuitively understand the learning and prediction process of neural networks, which will lead to a decrease in the credibility of computer-aided diagnosis. In addition, traditional methods need to be trained using negative samples in order to predict the presence or absence of a lesion, but medical data is often in short supply. In this paper, we propose a multiple high-order attention interaction model (MHA-UNet) for use in a highly explainable skin lesion segmentation task. MHA-UNet is able to obtain the presence or absence of a lesion by explainable reasoning without the need for training on negative samples. Specifically, we propose a high-order attention interaction mechanism that introduces squeeze attention to a higher level for feature attention. In addition, a multiple high-order attention interaction (MHAblock) module is proposed by combining the different features of different orders. For classifying the presence or absence of lesions, we conducted classification experiments on several publicly available datasets in the absence of negative samples, based on explainable reasoning about the interaction of 5 attention orders of MHAblock. The highest positive detection rate obtained from the experiments was 81.0% and the highest negative detection rate was 83.5%. For segmentation experiments, comparison experiments of the proposed method with 13 medical segmentation models and external validation experiments with 8 state-of-the-art models in three public datasets and our clinical dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our model.

    "title": "Align before Adapt: Leveraging Entity-to-Region Alignments for Generalizable Video Action Recognition",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Large-scale visual-language pre-trained models have achieved significant success in various video tasks. However, most existing methods follow an \"adapt then align\" paradigm, which adapts pre-trained image encoders to model video-level representations and utilizes one-hot or text embedding of the action labels for supervision. This paradigm overlooks the challenge of mapping from static images to complicated activity concepts. In this paper, we propose a novel \"Align before Adapt\" (ALT) paradigm. Prior to adapting to video representation learning, we exploit the entity-to-region alignments for each frame. The alignments are fulfilled by matching the region-aware image embeddings to an offline-constructed text corpus. With the aligned entities, we feed their text embeddings to a transformer-based video adapter as the queries, which can help extract the semantics of the most important entities from a video to a vector. This paradigm reuses the visual-language alignment of VLP during adaptation and tries to explain an action by the underlying entities. This helps understand actions by bridging the gap with complex activity semantics, particularly when facing unfamiliar or unseen categories. ALT achieves competitive performance and superior generalizability while requiring significantly low computational costs. In fully supervised scenarios, it achieves 88.1% top-1 accuracy on Kinetics-400 with only 4947 GFLOPs. In 2-shot experiments, ALT outperforms the previous state-of-the-art by 7.1% and 9.2% on HMDB-51 and UCF-101, respectively",

High-resolution manometry (HRM) is a clinically commonly used technique for detection of esophageal dynamic function comprehensively and objectively. However, after the results of HRM are obtained, doctors still need to evaluate by a variety of parameters. This work is burdensome, and the process is complex.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Medical images are often characterized by their structured anatomical representations and spatially inhomogeneous contrasts. Leveraging anatomical priors in neural networks can greatly enhance their utility in resource-constrained clinical settings. Prior research has harnessed such information for image segmentation, yet progress in deformable image registration has been modest. Our work introduces textSCF, a novel method that integrates spatially covariant filters and textual anatomical prompts encoded by visual-language models, to fill this gap. This approach optimizes an implicit function that correlates text embeddings of anatomical regions to filter weights, relaxing the typical translation-invariance constraint of convolutional operations. TextSCF not only boosts computational efficiency but can also retain or improve registration accuracy. By capturing the contextual interplay between anatomical regions, it offers impressive inter-regional transferability and the ability to preserve structural discontinuities during registration. TextSCF's performance has been rigorously tested on inter-subject brain MRI and abdominal CT registration tasks, outperforming existing state-of-the-art models in the MICCAI Learn2Reg 2021 challenge and leading the leaderboard. In abdominal registrations, textSCF's larger model variant improved the Dice score by 11.3% over the second-best model, while its smaller variant maintained similar accuracy but with an 89.13% reduction in network parameters and a 98.34\\% decrease in computational operations",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "As 3D perception problems grow in popularity and the need for large-scale labeled datasets for LiDAR semantic segmentation increase, new methods arise that aim to reduce the necessity for dense annotations by employing weakly-supervised training. However these methods continue to show weak boundary estimation and high false negative rates for small objects and distant sparse regions. We argue that such weaknesses can be compensated by using RGB images which provide a denser representation of the scene. We propose an image-guidance network (IGNet) which builds upon the idea of distilling high level feature information from a domain adapted synthetically trained 2D semantic segmentation network. We further utilize a one-way contrastive learning scheme alongside a novel mixing strategy called FOVMix, to combat the horizontal field-of-view mismatch between the two sensors and enhance the effects of image guidance. IGNet achieves state-of-the-art results for weakly-supervised LiDAR semantic segmentation on ScribbleKITTI, boasting up to 98% relative performance to fully supervised training with only 8% labeled points, while introducing no additional annotation burden or computational/memory cost during inference. Furthermore, we show that our contributions also prove effective for semi-supervised training, where IGNet claims state-of-the-art results on both ScribbleKITTI and SemanticKITTI",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Large-kernel convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) have recently received extensive research attention, but there are two unresolved and critical issues that demand further investigation. 1) The architectures of existing large-kernel ConvNets largely follow the design principles of conventional ConvNets or transformers, while the architectural design for large-kernel ConvNets remains under-addressed. 2) As transformers have dominated multiple modalities, it remains to be investigated whether ConvNets also have a strong universal perception ability in domains beyond vision. In this paper, we contribute from two aspects. 1) We propose four architectural guidelines for designing large-kernel ConvNets, the core of which is to exploit the essential characteristics of large kernels that distinguish them from small kernels - they can see wide without going deep. Following such guidelines, our proposed large-kernel ConvNet shows leading performance in image recognition. For example, our models achieve an ImageNet accuracy of 88.0%, ADE20K mIoU of 55.6%, and COCO box AP of 56.4%, demonstrating better performance and higher speed than a number of recently proposed powerful competitors. 2) We discover that large kernels are the key to unlocking the exceptional performance of ConvNets in domains where they were originally not proficient. With certain modality-related preprocessing approaches, the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on time-series forecasting and audio recognition tasks even without modality-specific customization to the architecture.

    "abstract": "Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently shown promising results in traditional downstream tasks. Evaluation studies have emerged to assess their abilities, with the majority focusing on the third-person perspective, and only a few addressing specific tasks from the first-person perspective. However, the capability of VLMs to \"think\" from a first-person perspective, a crucial attribute for advancing autonomous agents and robotics, remains largely unexplored. To bridge this research gap, we introduce EgoThink, a novel visual question-answering benchmark that encompasses six core capabilities with twelve detailed dimensions. The benchmark is constructed using selected clips from egocentric videos, with manually annotated question-answer pairs containing first-person information. To comprehensively assess VLMs, we evaluate eighteen popular VLMs on EgoThink. Moreover, given the open-ended format of the answers, we use GPT-4 as the automatic judge to compute single-answer grading. Experimental results indicate that although GPT-4V leads in numerous dimensions, all evaluated VLMs still possess considerable potential for improvement in first-person perspective tasks. Meanwhile, enlarging the number of trainable parameters has the most significant impact on model performance on EgoThink. In conclusion, EgoThink serves as a valuable addition to existing evaluation benchmarks for VLMs, providing an indispensable resource for future research in the realm of embodied artificial intelligence and robotics",

    "abstract": "Visible-infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID) aims to match persons captured by visible and infrared cameras, allowing person retrieval and tracking in 24-hour surveillance systems. Previous methods focus on learning from cross-modality person images in different cameras. However, temporal information and single-camera samples tend to be neglected. To crack this nut, in this paper, we first contribute a large-scale VI-ReID dataset named BUPTCampus. Different from most existing VI-ReID datasets, it 1) collects tracklets instead of images to introduce rich temporal information, 2) contains pixel-aligned cross-modality sample pairs for better modality-invariant learning, 3) provides one auxiliary set to help enhance the optimization, in which each identity only appears in a single camera. Based on our constructed dataset, we present a two-stream framework as baseline and apply Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to narrow the gap between the two modalities. To exploit the advantages introduced by the auxiliary set, we propose a curriculum learning based strategy to jointly learn from both primary and auxiliary sets. Moreover, we design a novel temporal k-reciprocal re-ranking method to refine the ranking list with fine-grained temporal correlation cues. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. We also reproduce 9 state-of-the-art image-based and video-based VI-ReID methods on BUPTCampus and our methods show substantial superiority to them.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Conventional Federated Domain Adaptation (FDA) approaches usually demand an abundance of assumptions, such as label set consistency, which makes them significantly less feasible for real-world situations and introduces security hazards. In this work, we propose a more practical scenario named Universal Federated Domain Adaptation (UFDA). It only requires the black-box model and the label set information of each source domain, while the label sets of different source domains could be inconsistent and the target-domain label set is totally blind. This relaxes the assumptions made by FDA, which are often challenging to meet in real-world cases and diminish model security. To address the UFDA scenario, we propose a corresponding framework called Hot-Learning with Contrastive Label Disambiguation (HCLD), which tackles UFDA's domain shifts and category gaps problem by using one-hot outputs from the black-box models of various source domains. Moreover, to better distinguish the shared and unknown classes, we further present a cluster-level strategy named Mutual-Voting Decision (MVD) to extract robust consensus knowledge across peer classes from both source and target domains. The extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that our HCLD achieves comparable performance for our UFDA scenario with much fewer assumptions, compared to the previous methodologies with many additional assumptions",

In this paper, we empirically analyze how VLMs behave when using vision and text prompts, adapters, and a combination of these components, marking a novel exploration by our study. Our observations find that utilizing vision prompts for class separability and text adapters for task adaptation is crucial for adaptability and generalizability. Moreover, to improve generalization across every domain, we propose an adaptive ensemble method that effectively combines the general knowledge of VLMs with task-specific knowledge according to transfer difficulty.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Recent breakthroughs in text-to-image generation has shown encouraging results via large generative models. Due to the scarcity of 3D assets, it is hardly to transfer the success of text-to-image generation to that of text-to-3D generation. Existing text-to-3D generation methods usually adopt the paradigm of DreamFusion, which conducts per-asset optimization by distilling a pretrained text-to-image diffusion model. The generation speed usually ranges from several minutes to tens of minutes per 3D asset, which degrades the user experience and also imposes a burden to the service providers due to the high computational budget. In this work, we present an efficient text-to-3D generation method, which requires only around 8 $ms$ to generate a 3D asset given the text prompt on a consumer graphic card. The main insight is that we exploit the images generated by a large pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model, to supervise the training of a text conditioned 3D generative adversarial network. Once the network is trained, we are able to efficiently generate a 3D asset via a single forward pass. Our method requires no 3D training data and provides an alternative approach for efficient text-to-3D generation by distilling pre-trained image diffusion models",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "With the development of image generation technology, AI-based image generation has been applied in various fields. However, the development of AIGC image generative models also brings new problems and challenges. A significant challenge is that AI-generated images (AIGI) compared to natural images may have some unique distortions, and not all generated images meet the requirements of the real world, so it is of great significance to evaluate AI-generated images more comprehensively. Although previous work has established some human perception-based AIGC image quality assessment databases for text-generated images, the AI image generation technology includes scenarios like text-to-image and image-to-image, and assessing only the images generated by text-to-image models is insufficient. To address this issue, we have established a human perception-based image-to-image AIGC image quality assessment database, named PKU-I2IQA. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of the PKU-I2IQA database. Furthermore, we introduced two benchmark models: NR-AIGCIQA based on no-reference image quality assessment and FR-AIGCIQA based on full-reference image quality assessment.Finally, leveraging this database, we conducted benchmark experiments and compared the performance of the proposed benchmark models. The PKU-I2IQA database and benchmarks will be released to facilitate future research on https://github.com/jiquan123/I2IQA.

    "abstract": "Dataset distillation (DD) is a newly emerging research area aiming at alleviating the heavy computational load in training models on large datasets. It tries to distill a large dataset into a small and condensed one so that models trained on the distilled dataset can perform comparably with those trained on the full dataset when performing downstream tasks. Among the previous works in this area, there are three key problems that hinder the performance and availability of the existing DD methods: high time complexity, high space complexity, and low info-compactness. In this work, we simultaneously attempt to settle these three problems by moving the DD processes from conventionally used pixel space to latent space. Encoded by a pretrained generic autoencoder, latent codes in the latent space are naturally info-compact representations of the original images in much smaller sizes. After transferring three mainstream DD algorithms to latent space, we significantly reduce time and space consumption while achieving similar performance, allowing us to distill high-resolution datasets or target at greater data ratio that previous methods have failed. Besides, within the same storage budget, we can also quantitatively deliver more latent codes than pixel-level images, which further boosts the performance of our methods",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In the field of computer graphics, the use of vector graphics, particularly Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), represents a notable development from traditional pixel-based imagery. SVGs, with their XML-based format, are distinct in their ability to directly and explicitly represent visual elements such as shape, color, and path. This direct representation facilitates a more accurate and logical depiction of graphical elements, enhancing reasoning and interpretability. Recognizing the potential of SVGs, the machine learning community has introduced multiple methods for image vectorization. However, transforming images into SVG format while retaining the relational properties and context of the original scene remains a key challenge. Most vectorization methods often yield SVGs that are overly complex and not easily interpretable. In response to this challenge, we introduce our method, Simple-SVG-Generation (S\\textsuperscript{2}VG\\textsuperscript{2}). Our method focuses on producing SVGs that are both accurate and simple, aligning with human readability and understanding. With simple images, we evaluate our method with reasoning tasks together with advanced language models, the results show a clear improvement over previous SVG generation methods. We also conducted surveys for human evaluation on the readability of our generated SVGs, the results also favor our methods",

    "abstract": "In the face of rapid advances in medical imaging, cross-domain adaptive medical image detection is challenging due to the differences in lesion representations across various medical imaging technologies. To address this issue, we draw inspiration from large language models to propose EAFP-Med, an efficient adaptive feature processing module based on prompts for medical image detection. EAFP-Med can efficiently extract lesion features of different scales from a diverse range of medical images based on prompts while being flexible and not limited by specific imaging techniques. Furthermore, it serves as a feature preprocessing module that can be connected to any model front-end to enhance the lesion features in input images. Moreover, we propose a novel adaptive disease detection model named EAFP-Med ST, which utilizes the Swin Transformer V2 - Tiny (SwinV2-T) as its backbone and connects it to EAFP-Med. We have compared our method to nine state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results demonstrate that EAFP-Med ST achieves the best performance on all three datasets (chest X-ray images, cranial magnetic resonance imaging images, and skin images). EAFP-Med can efficiently extract lesion features from various medical images based on prompts, enhancing the model's performance.

    "title": "SED: A Simple Encoder-Decoder for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation strives to distinguish pixels into different semantic groups from an open set of categories. Most existing methods explore utilizing pre-trained vision-language models, in which the key is to adopt the image-level model for pixel-level segmentation task. In this paper, we propose a simple encoder-decoder, named SED, for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, which comprises a hierarchical encoder-based cost map generation and a gradual fusion decoder with category early rejection. The hierarchical encoder-based cost map generation employs hierarchical backbone, instead of plain transformer, to predict pixel-level image-text cost map. Compared to plain transformer, hierarchical backbone better captures local spatial information and has linear computational complexity with respect to input size. Our gradual fusion decoder employs a top-down structure to combine cost map and the feature maps of different backbone levels for segmentation. To accelerate inference speed, we introduce a category early rejection scheme in the decoder that rejects many no-existing categories at the early layer of decoder, resulting in at most 4.7 times acceleration without accuracy degradation. Experiments are performed on multiple open-vocabulary semantic segmentation datasets, which demonstrates the efficacy of our SED method. When using ConvNeXt-B, our SED method achieves mIoU score of 31.6\\% on ADE20K with 150 categories at 82 millisecond ($ms$) per image on a single A6000.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Background and Objective: The lack of benchmark datasets has impeded the development of slice-to-volume registration algorithms. Such datasets are difficult to annotate, primarily due to the dimensional difference within data and the dearth of task-specific software. We aim to develop a user-friendly tool to streamline dataset annotation for slice-to-volume registration. Methods: The proposed tool, named SVRDA, is an installation-free web application for platform-agnostic collaborative dataset annotation. It enables efficient transformation manipulation via keyboard shortcuts and smooth case transitions with auto-saving. SVRDA supports configuration-based data loading and adheres to the separation of concerns, offering great flexibility and extensibility for future research. Various supplementary features have been implemented to facilitate slice-to-volume registration. Results: We validated the effectiveness of SVRDA by indirectly evaluating the post-registration segmentation quality on UK Biobank data, observing a dramatic overall improvement (24.02% in the Dice Similarity Coefficient and 48.93% in the 95th percentile Hausdorff distance, respectively) supported by highly statistically significant evidence ($p<0.001$).We further showcased the clinical usage of SVRDA by integrating it into test-retest T1 quantification on in-house magnetic resonance images, leading to more consistent results after registration. Conclusions: SVRDA can facilitate collaborative annotation of benchmark datasets while being potentially applicable to other pipelines incorporating slice-to-volume registration.

    "title": "Efficient Dataset Distillation via Minimax Diffusion",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Dataset distillation reduces the storage and computational consumption of training a network by generating a small surrogate dataset that encapsulates rich information of the original large-scale one. However, previous distillation methods heavily rely on the sample-wise iterative optimization scheme. As the images-per-class (IPC) setting or image resolution grows larger, the necessary computation will demand overwhelming time and resources. In this work, we intend to incorporate generative diffusion techniques for computing the surrogate dataset. Observing that key factors for constructing an effective surrogate dataset are representativeness and diversity, we design additional minimax criteria in the generative training to enhance these facets for the generated images of diffusion models. We present a theoretical model of the process as hierarchical diffusion control demonstrating the flexibility of the diffusion process to target these criteria without jeopardizing the faithfulness of the sample to the desired distribution. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art validation performance while demanding much less computational resources. Under the 100-IPC setting on ImageWoof, our method requires less than one-twentieth the distillation time of previous methods, yet yields even better performance.

Recent work utilizes pedestrian character information, \\textit{i.e.}, action and appearance, to improve the learned trajectory embedding and achieves state-of-the-art performance. However, it neglects the invalid and negative pedestrian character information, which is harmful to trajectory representation and thus leads to performance degradation. To address this issue, we present a two-stream sparse-character-based network~(TSNet) for pedestrian trajectory prediction. Specifically, TSNet learns the negative-removed characters in the sparse character representation stream to improve the trajectory embedding obtained in the trajectory representation stream. Moreover, to model the negative-removed characters, we propose a novel sparse character graph, including the sparse category and sparse temporal character graphs, to learn the different effects of various characters in category and temporal dimensions, respectively. Extensive experiments on two first-person view datasets, PIE and JAAD, show that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. In addition, ablation studies demonstrate different effects of various characters and prove that TSNet outperforms approaches without eliminating negative characters",

We leverage the pretrained text-to-2D image stable diffusion model as prior knowledge of the 3D world. The model is finetuned in two steps to optimize for the text embedding and the UNet that reconstruct the input image and its inverse perspective mapping respectively. The inverse perspective mapping creates variance within the text-image space of the diffusion model, while providing weak guidance for aerial view synthesis. At inference, we steer the contents of the generated image towards the input image using novel mutual information guidance that maximizes the information content between the probability distributions of the two images. We evaluate our approach on a wide spectrum of real and synthetic data, including natural scenes, indoor scenes, human action, etc. Through extensive experiments and ablation studies, we demonstrate the effectiveness of AerialBooth and also its generalizability to other text-controlled views.

Despite their capabilities, these models face limitations in creating new, detailed creatures within specific categories (e.g., virtual dog or bird species), which are valuable in digital asset creation and biodiversity analysis. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel task, Virtual Creatures Generation: Given a set of unlabeled images of the target concepts (e.g., 200 bird species), we aim to train a T2I model capable of creating new, hybrid concepts within diverse backgrounds and contexts. We propose a new method called DreamCreature, which identifies and extracts the underlying sub-concepts (e.g., body parts of a specific species) in an unsupervised manner. The T2I thus adapts to generate novel concepts (e.g., new bird species) with faithful structures and photorealistic appearance by seamlessly and flexibly composing learned sub-concepts. To enhance sub-concept fidelity and disentanglement, we extend the textual inversion technique by incorporating an additional projector and tailored attention loss regularization. Extensive experiments on two fine-grained image benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of DreamCreature over prior methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluation.

We first learn a vocabulary of latent quantized embeddings, using graph convolutions, which inform these embeddings of the local mesh geometry and topology. These embeddings are sequenced and decoded into triangles by a decoder, ensuring that they can effectively reconstruct the mesh. A transformer is then trained on this learned vocabulary to predict the index of the next embedding given previous embeddings. Once trained, our model can be autoregressively sampled to generate new triangle meshes, directly generating compact meshes with sharp edges, more closely imitating the efficient triangulation patterns of human-crafted meshes.

This work for the first time attempts to utilize the foundation model as an instructive teacher for initialization in FL, assessing its impact on the performance of FL models, especially in non-IID data scenarios. Our empirical evaluation on chest x-ray lung segmentation showcases that FL with foundation model instructed initialization not only achieves faster convergence but also improves performance in complex data contexts.

    "abstract": "Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (UAD) techniques aim to identify and localize anomalies without relying on annotations, only leveraging a model trained on a dataset known to be free of anomalies. Diffusion models learn to modify inputs $x$ to increase the probability of it belonging to a desired distribution, i.e., they model the score function $\\nabla_x \\log p(x)$. Such a score function is potentially relevant for UAD, since $\\nabla_x \\log p(x)$ is itself a pixel-wise anomaly score. However, diffusion models are trained to invert a corruption process based on Gaussian noise and the learned score function is unlikely to generalize to medical anomalies. This work addresses the problem of how to learn a score function relevant for UAD and proposes DISYRE: Diffusion-Inspired SYnthetic REstoration. We retain the diffusion-like pipeline but replace the Gaussian noise corruption with a gradual, synthetic anomaly corruption so the learned score function generalizes to medical, naturally occurring anomalies.

While diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have been shown to achieve remarkable performance for face image restoration, they often fail to preserve temporally coherent, high-quality videos, compromising the fidelity of reconstructed faces. We present a new conditional diffusion framework called FLAIR for FVR. FLAIR ensures temporal consistency across frames in a computationally efficient fashion by converting a traditional image DPM into a video DPM. The proposed conversion uses a recurrent video refinement layer and a temporal self-attention at different scales. FLAIR also uses a conditional iterative refinement process to balance the perceptual and distortion quality during inference. This process consists of two key components: a data-consistency module that analytically ensures that the generated video precisely matches its degraded observation and a coarse-to-fine image enhancement module specifically for facial regions. Our extensive experiments show superiority of FLAIR over the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) for video super-resolution, deblurring, JPEG restoration, and space-time frame interpolation on two high-quality face video datasets",

    "title": "Efficient Encoding of Graphics Primitives with Simplex-based Structures",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Grid-based structures are commonly used to encode explicit features for graphics primitives such as images, signed distance functions (SDF), and neural radiance fields (NeRF) due to their simple implementation. However, in $n$-dimensional space, calculating the value of a sampled point requires interpolating the values of its $2^n$ neighboring vertices. The exponential scaling with dimension leads to significant computational overheads. To address this issue, we propose a simplex-based approach for encoding graphics primitives. The number of vertices in a simplex-based structure increases linearly with dimension, making it a more efficient and generalizable alternative to grid-based representations. Using the non-axis-aligned simplicial structure property, we derive and prove a coordinate transformation, simplicial subdivision, and barycentric interpolation scheme for efficient sampling, which resembles transformation procedures in the simplex noise algorithm. Finally, we use hash tables to store multiresolution features of all interest points in the simplicial grid, which are passed into a tiny fully connected neural network to parameterize graphics primitives. We implemented a detailed simplex-based structure encoding algorithm in C++ and CUDA using the methods outlined in our approach. In the 2D image fitting task, the proposed method is capable of fitting a giga-pixel image with 9.4% less time compared to the baseline method proposed by instant-ngp, while maintaining the same quality and compression rate. In the volumetric rendering setup, we observe a maximum 41.2% speedup when the samples are dense enough",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "We propose ProtoArgNet, a novel interpretable deep neural architecture for image classification in the spirit of prototypical-part-learning as found, e.g. in ProtoPNet. While earlier approaches associate every class with multiple prototypical-parts, ProtoArgNet uses super-prototypes that combine prototypical-parts into single prototypical class representations. Furthermore, while earlier approaches use interpretable classification layers, e.g. logistic regression in ProtoPNet, ProtoArgNet improves accuracy with multi-layer perceptrons while relying upon an interpretable reading thereof based on a form of argumentation. ProtoArgNet is customisable to user cognitive requirements by a process of sparsification of the multi-layer perceptron/argumentation component. Also, as opposed to other prototypical-part-learning approaches, ProtoArgNet can recognise spatial relations between different prototypical-parts that are from different regions in images, similar to how CNNs capture relations between patterns recognized in earlier layers",

    "title": "Data-Driven Modelling for Harmonic Current Emission in Low-Voltage Grid Using MCReSANet with Interpretability Analysis",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Even though the use of power electronics PE loads offers enhanced electrical energy conversion efficiency and control, they remain the primary sources of harmonics in grids. When diverse loads are connected in the distribution system, their interactions complicate establishing analytical models for the relationship between harmonic voltages and currents. To solve this, our paper presents a data-driven model using MCReSANet to construct the highly nonlinear between harmonic voltage and current. Two datasets from PCCs in Finland and Germany are utilized, which demonstrates that MCReSANet is capable of establishing accurate nonlinear mappings, even in the presence of various network characteristics for selected Finland and Germany datasets. The model built by MCReSANet can improve the MAE by 10% and 14% compared to the CNN, and by 8% and 17% compared to the MLP for both Finnish and German datasets, also showing much lower model uncertainty than others. This is a crucial prerequisite for more precise SHAP value-based feature importance analysis, which is a method for the model interpretability analysis in this paper. The results by feature importance analysis show the detailed relationships between each order of harmonic voltage and current in the distribution system. There is an interactive impact on each order of harmonic current, but some orders of harmonic voltages have a dominant influence on harmonic current emissions: positive sequence and zero sequence harmonics have the dominant importance in the Finnish and German networks, respectively, which conforms to the pattern of connected load types in two selected Finnish and German datasets. This paper enhances the potential for understanding and predicting harmonic current emissions by diverse PE loads in distribution systems, which is beneficial to more effective management for optimizing power quality in diverse grid environments",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Drawing inspiration from prompt tuning techniques applied to Large Language Models, recent methods based on pre-trained ViT networks have achieved remarkable results in the field of Continual Learning. Specifically, these approaches propose to maintain a set of prompts and allocate a subset of them to learn each task using a key-query matching strategy. However, they may encounter limitations when lacking control over the correlations between old task queries and keys of future tasks, the shift of features in the latent space, and the relative separation of latent vectors learned in independent tasks. In this work, we introduce a novel key-query learning strategy based on orthogonal projection, inspired by model-agnostic meta-learning, to enhance prompt matching efficiency and address the challenge of shifting features. Furthermore, we introduce a One-Versus-All (OVA) prototype-based component that enhances the classification head distinction.

    "abstract": "Constrained clustering allows the training of classification models using pairwise constraints only, which are weak and relatively easy to mine, while still yielding full-supervision-level model performance. While they perform well even in the absence of the true underlying class labels, constrained clustering models still require large amounts of binary constraint annotations for training. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised context whereby a large amount of \\textit{unconstrained} data is available alongside a smaller set of constraints, and propose \\textit{ConstraintMatch} to leverage such unconstrained data. While a great deal of progress has been made in semi-supervised learning using full labels, there are a number of challenges that prevent a naive application of the resulting methods in the constraint-based label setting. Therefore, we reason about and analyze these challenges, specifically 1) proposing a \\textit{pseudo-constraining} mechanism to overcome the confirmation bias, a major weakness of pseudo-labeling, 2) developing new methods for pseudo-labeling towards the selection of \\textit{informative} unconstrained samples, 3) showing that this also allows the use of pairwise loss functions for the initial and auxiliary losses which facilitates semi-constrained model training. In extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of ConstraintMatch over relevant baselines in both the regular clustering and overclustering scenarios on five challenging benchmarks and provide analyses of its several components",

Furthermore, we develop an innovative language-object correlation module to extend the scope of existing 3D object detectors into open-vocabulary scenarios.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In weakly supervised video anomaly detection (WVAD), where only video-level labels indicating the presence or absence of abnormal events are available, the primary challenge arises from the inherent ambiguity in temporal annotations of abnormal occurrences. Inspired by the statistical insight that temporal features of abnormal events often exhibit outlier characteristics, we propose a novel method, BN-WVAD, which incorporates BatchNorm into WVAD. In the proposed BN-WVAD, we leverage the Divergence of Feature from Mean vector (DFM) of BatchNorm as a reliable abnormality criterion to discern potential abnormal snippets in abnormal videos. The proposed DFM criterion is also discriminative for anomaly recognition and more resilient to label noise, serving as the additional anomaly score to amend the prediction of the anomaly classifier that is susceptible to noisy labels. Moreover, a batch-level selection strategy is devised to filter more abnormal snippets in videos where more abnormal events occur. The proposed BN-WVAD model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on UCF-Crime with an AUC of 87.24%, and XD-Violence, where AP reaches up to 84.93%.

    "abstract": "Hand gestures play a significant role in human interactions where non-verbal intentions, thoughts and commands are conveyed. In Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), hand gestures offer a similar and efficient medium for conveying clear and rapid directives to a robotic agent. However, state-of-the-art vision-based methods for gesture recognition have been shown to be effective only up to a user-camera distance of seven meters. Such a short distance range limits practical HRI with, for example, service robots, search and rescue robots and drones. In this work, we address the Ultra-Range Gesture Recognition (URGR) problem by aiming for a recognition distance of up to 25 meters and in the context of HRI. We propose a novel deep-learning framework for URGR using solely a simple RGB camera. First, a novel super-resolution model termed HQ-Net is used to enhance the low-resolution image of the user. Then, we propose a novel URGR classifier termed Graph Vision Transformer (GViT) which takes the enhanced image as input. GViT combines the benefits of a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and a modified Vision Transformer (ViT). Evaluation of the proposed framework over diverse test data yields a high recognition rate of 98.1%. The framework has also exhibited superior performance compared to human recognition in ultra-range distances. With the framework, we analyze and demonstrate the performance of an autonomous quadruped robot directed by human gestures in complex ultra-range indoor and outdoor environments",

To address this hypothesis, we propose a certification process mimicking selective attention and test if it could make DL models more robust.

    "abstract": "Adversarial attacks meticulously generate minuscule, imperceptible perturbations to images to deceive neural networks. Counteracting these, adversarial purification methods seek to transform adversarial input samples into clean output images to defend against adversarial attacks. Nonetheless, extent generative models fail to effectively eliminate adversarial perturbations, yielding less-than-ideal purification results. We emphasize the potential threat of residual adversarial perturbations to target models, quantitatively establishing a relationship between perturbation scale and attack capability. Notably, the residual perturbations on the purified image primarily stem from the same-position patch and similar patches of the adversarial sample. We propose a novel adversarial purification approach named Information Mask Purification (IMPure), aims to extensively eliminate adversarial perturbations. To obtain an adversarial sample, we first mask part of the patches information, then reconstruct the patches to resist adversarial perturbations from the patches. We reconstruct all patches in parallel to obtain a cohesive image. Then, in order to protect the purified samples against potential similar regional perturbations, we simulate this risk by randomly mixing the purified samples with the input samples before inputting them into the feature extraction network. Finally, we establish a combined constraint of pixel loss and perceptual loss to augment the model's reconstruction adaptability. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset with three classifier models demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results against nine adversarial attack methods.

Therefore, ViTs are well suited for sequential decision-making, e.g. in the Active Visual Exploration problem.

To reduce this computational inefficiency, we introduce the TOken REcycling (TORE) modification for the ViT inference, which can be used with any architecture. TORE divides ViT into two parts, iterator and aggregator. An iterator processes sequential information separately into midway tokens, which are cached. The aggregator processes midway tokens jointly to obtain the prediction. This way, we can reuse the results of computations made by iterator. Except for efficient sequential inference, we propose a complementary training policy, which significantly reduces the computational burden associated with sequential decision-making while achieving state-of-the-art accuracy",

Here, we look at two commonly held adages i) more data gives better results and ii) transfer learning will aid you when you don't have enough data. These are widely assumed to be true and used as evidence for choosing how to solve a problem when Deep Learning is involved. We evaluate six medical datasets and six general datasets. Training a ResNet18 network on varying subsets of these datasets to evaluate `more data gives better results'. We take eleven of these datasets as the sources for Transfer Learning on subsets of the twelfth dataset -- Chest -- in order to determine whether Transfer Learning is universally beneficial. We go further to see whether multi-stage Transfer Learning provides a consistent benefit. Our analysis shows that the real situation is more complex than these simple adages -- more data could lead to a case of diminishing returns and an incorrect choice of dataset for transfer learning can lead to worse performance, with datasets which we would consider highly similar to the Chest dataset giving worse results than datasets which are more dissimilar.

    "abstract": "Chest X-rays (CXRs) are commonly utilized as a low-dose modality for lung screening. Nonetheless, the efficacy of CXRs is somewhat impeded, given that approximately 75% of the lung area overlaps with bone, which in turn hampers the detection and diagnosis of diseases. As a remedial measure, bone suppression techniques have been introduced. The current dual-energy subtraction imaging technique in the clinic requires costly equipment and subjects being exposed to high radiation. To circumvent these issues, deep learning-based image generation algorithms have been proposed. However, existing methods fall short in terms of producing high-quality images and capturing texture details, particularly with pulmonary vessels. To address these issues, this paper proposes a new bone suppression framework, termed BS-Diff, that comprises a conditional diffusion model equipped with a U-Net architecture and a simple enhancement module to incorporate an autoencoder. Our proposed network cannot only generate soft tissue images with a high bone suppression rate but also possesses the capability to capture fine image details. Additionally, we compiled the largest dataset since 2010, including data from 120 patients with high-definition, high-resolution paired CXRs and soft tissue images collected by our affiliated hospital. Extensive experiments, comparative analyses, ablation studies, and clinical evaluations indicate that the proposed BS-Diff outperforms several bone-suppression models across multiple metrics",

The need for efficient FR models on devices with limited computational resources has led to the development of models with reduced memory footprints and computational demands without sacrificing accuracy. Our research delves into the impact of dataset selection, model architecture, and optimization algorithms on the performance of FR models. We highlight our participation in the EFaR-2023 competition, where our models showcased exceptional performance, particularly in categories restricted by the number of parameters. By employing a subset of the Webface42M dataset and integrating sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) optimization, we achieved significant improvements in accuracy across various benchmarks, including those that test for cross-pose, cross-age, and cross-ethnicity performance.

    "abstract": "The detection and localization of highly realistic deepfake audio-visual content are challenging even for the most advanced state-of-the-art methods. While most of the research efforts in this domain are focused on detecting high-quality deepfake images and videos, only a few works address the problem of the localization of small segments of audio-visual manipulations embedded in real videos. In this research, we emulate the process of such content generation and propose the AV-Deepfake1M dataset. The dataset contains content-driven (i) video manipulations, (ii) audio manipulations, and (iii) audio-visual manipulations for more than 2K subjects resulting in a total of more than 1M videos. The paper provides a thorough description of the proposed data generation pipeline accompanied by a rigorous analysis of the quality of the generated data. The comprehensive benchmark of the proposed dataset utilizing state-of-the-art deepfake detection and localization methods indicates a significant drop in performance compared to previous datasets. The proposed dataset will play a vital role in building the next-generation deepfake localization methods.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Eye diseases have posed significant challenges for decades, but advancements in technology have opened new avenues for their detection and treatment. Machine learning and deep learning algorithms have become instrumental in this domain, particularly when combined with Optical Coherent Technology (OCT) imaging. We propose a novel method for efficient detection of eye diseases from OCT images. Our technique enables the classification of patients into disease free (normal eyes) or affected by specific conditions such as Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV), Diabetic Macular Edema (DME), or Drusen. In this work, we introduce an end to end web application that utilizes machine learning and deep learning techniques for efficient eye disease prediction. The application allows patients to submit their raw OCT scanned images, which undergo segmentation using a trained custom UNet model. The segmented images are then fed into an ensemble model, comprising InceptionV3 and Xception networks, enhanced with a self attention layer. This self attention approach leverages the feature maps of individual models to achieve improved classification accuracy. The ensemble model's output is aggregated to predict and classify various eye diseases. Extensive experimentation and optimization have been conducted to ensure the application's efficiency and optimal performance. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in accurate eye disease prediction. The developed web application holds significant potential for early detection and timely intervention, thereby contributing to improved eye healthcare outcomes",

However, extracting a radiance field of one specific object from multi-view images encounters substantial challenges due to occlusion and background complexity, thereby presenting difficulties in downstream applications such as NeRF editing and 3D mesh extraction. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose Obj-NeRF, a comprehensive pipeline that recovers the 3D geometry of a specific object from multi-view images using a single prompt. This method combines the 2D segmentation capabilities of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) in conjunction with the 3D reconstruction ability of NeRF. Specifically, we first obtain multi-view segmentation for the indicated object using SAM with a single prompt. Then, we use the segmentation images to supervise NeRF construction, integrating several effective techniques. Additionally, we construct a large object-level NeRF dataset containing diverse objects, which can be useful in various downstream tasks. To demonstrate the practicality of our method, we also apply Obj-NeRF to various applications, including object removal, rotation, replacement, and recoloring",

This challenge arises due to the tendency of previously learned weights to be adjusted to suit the objectives of new tasks, resulting in a phenomenon called catastrophic forgetting. Most approaches to this problem seek a balance between maximizing performance on the new tasks and minimizing the forgetting of previous tasks. In contrast, our approach attempts to maximize the performance of the new task, while ensuring zero forgetting. This is accomplished by creating a task-specific modulation parameters for each task. Only these would be learnable parameters during learning of consecutive tasks. Through comprehensive experimental evaluations, our model demonstrates superior performance in acquiring and retaining novel tasks that pose difficulties for other multi-task models.

However, many existing methods for HMER may fail to accurately read formulas with complex structures, as the attention results can be inaccurate due to illegible handwriting or large variations in writing styles. Our proposed Intelligent-Detection Network (IDN) for HMER differs from traditional encoder-decoder methods by utilizing object detection techniques. Specifically, we have developed an enhanced YOLOv7 network that can accurately detect both digital and symbolic objects. The detection results are then integrated into the bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU) and the baseline symbol relationship tree (BSRT) to determine the relationships between symbols and numbers. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms those encoder-decoder networks in recognizing complex handwritten mathematical expressions. This is due to the precise detection of symbols and numbers. Our research has the potential to make valuable contributions to the field of HMER.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Unlike color photography images, which are consistently encoded into RGB channels, biological images encompass various modalities, where the type of microscopy and the meaning of each channel varies with each experiment. Importantly, the number of channels can range from one to a dozen and their correlation is often comparatively much lower than RGB, as each of them brings specific information content. This aspect is largely overlooked by methods designed out of the bioimage field, and current solutions mostly focus on intra-channel spatial attention, often ignoring the relationship between channels, yet crucial in most biological applications. Importantly, the variable channel type and count prevent the projection of several experiments to a unified representation for large scale pre-training. In this study, we propose ChAda-ViT, a novel Channel Adaptive Vision Transformer architecture employing an Inter-Channel Attention mechanism on images with an arbitrary number, order and type of channels. We also introduce IDRCell100k, a bioimage dataset with a rich set of 79 experiments covering 7 microscope modalities, with a multitude of channel types, and channel counts varying from 1 to 10 per experiment. Our proposed architecture, trained in a self-supervised manner, outperforms existing approaches in several biologically relevant downstream tasks. Additionally, it can be used to bridge the gap for the first time between assays with different microscopes, channel numbers or types by embedding various image and experimental modalities into a unified biological image representation. The latter should facilitate interdisciplinary studies and pave the way for better adoption of deep learning in biological image-based analyses. Code and Data to be released soon",

Our method features simple network design, extensive sensor modeling for both camera and lidar -- including rolling shutter, beam divergence and ray dropping -- and is applicable to multiple datasets out of the box. We verify its performance on five popular AD datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance across the board. To encourage further development, we openly release the NeuRAD source code.

    "abstract": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods often exploit auxiliary outliers to train model identifying OOD samples, especially discovering challenging outliers from auxiliary outliers dataset to improve OOD detection. However, they may still face limitations in effectively distinguishing between the most challenging OOD samples that are much like in-distribution (ID) data, i.e., ID-like samples. To this end, we propose a novel OOD detection framework that discovers ID-like outliers using CLIP from the vicinity space of the ID samples, thus helping to identify these most challenging OOD samples. Then a prompt learning framework is proposed that utilizes the identified ID-like outliers to further leverage the capabilities of CLIP for OOD detection. Benefiting from the powerful CLIP, we only need a small number of ID samples to learn the prompts of the model without exposing other auxiliary outlier datasets. By focusing on the most challenging ID-like OOD samples and elegantly exploiting the capabilities of CLIP, our method achieves superior few-shot learning performance on various real-world image datasets (e.g., in 4-shot OOD detection on the ImageNet-1k dataset, our method reduces the average FPR95 by 12.16% and improves the average AUROC by 2.76%, compared to state-of-the-art methods)",

The performance of such fusion-based algorithms largely depends on the accuracy of sensor calibration, which is challenging due to the difficulty of identifying common features across different data modalities. Previously, many calibration methods involved specific targets and/or manual intervention, which has proven to be cumbersome and costly. Learning-based online calibration methods have been proposed, but their performance is barely satisfactory in most cases. These methods usually suffer from issues such as sparse feature maps, unreliable cross-modality association, inaccurate calibration parameter regression, etc. In this paper, to address these issues, we propose CalibFormer, an end-to-end network for automatic LiDAR-camera calibration. We aggregate multiple layers of camera and LiDAR image features to achieve high-resolution representations. A multi-head correlation module is utilized to identify correlations between features more accurately. Lastly, we employ transformer architectures to estimate accurate calibration parameters from the correlation information.

Then, the Adaptive Weight Assignment (AWA) module is designed to adaptively assign two reverse-changing weights based on the network performance, allowing the student network to better benefit from both teachers.

Previous methods have relied on domain-specific heuristics such as warping-based motion representation and 3D Morphable Models, which limit the naturalness and diversity of the generated avatars. In this work, we introduce GAIA (Generative AI for Avatar), which eliminates the domain priors in talking avatar generation. In light of the observation that the speech only drives the motion of the avatar while the appearance of the avatar and the background typically remain the same throughout the entire video, we divide our approach into two stages: 1) disentangling each frame into motion and appearance representations; 2) generating motion sequences conditioned on the speech and reference portrait image. We collect a large-scale high-quality talking avatar dataset and train the model on it with different scales (up to 2B parameters). Experimental results verify the superiority, scalability, and flexibility of GAIA as 1) the resulting model beats previous baseline models in terms of naturalness, diversity, lip-sync quality, and visual quality; 2) the framework is scalable since larger models yield better results; 3) it is general and enables different applications like controllable talking avatar generation and text-instructed avatar generation",

    "title": "One-bit Supervision for Image Classification: Problem, Solution, and Beyond",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "This paper presents one-bit supervision, a novel setting of learning with fewer labels, for image classification. Instead of training model using the accurate label of each sample, our setting requires the model to interact with the system by predicting the class label of each sample and learn from the answer whether the guess is correct, which provides one bit (yes or no) of information. An intriguing property of the setting is that the burden of annotation largely alleviates in comparison to offering the accurate label. There are two keys to one-bit supervision, which are (i) improving the guess accuracy and (ii) making good use of the incorrect guesses. To achieve these goals, we propose a multi-stage training paradigm and incorporate negative label suppression into an off-the-shelf semi-supervised learning algorithm. Theoretical analysis shows that one-bit annotation is more efficient than full-bit annotation in most cases and gives the conditions of combining our approach with active learning. Inspired by this, we further integrate the one-bit supervision framework into the self-supervised learning algorithm which yields an even more efficient training schedule. Different from training from scratch, when self-supervised learning is used for initialization, both hard example mining and class balance are verified effective in boosting the learning performance. However, these two frameworks still need full-bit labels in the initial stage. To cast off this burden, we utilize unsupervised domain adaptation to train the initial model and conduct pure one-bit annotations on the target dataset. In multiple benchmarks, the learning efficiency of the proposed approach surpasses that using full-bit, semi-supervised supervision",

    "title": "Leveraging Anatomical Constraints with Uncertainty for Pneumothorax Segmentation",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Pneumothorax is a medical emergency caused by abnormal accumulation of air in the pleural space - the potential space between the lungs and chest wall. On 2D chest radiographs, pneumothorax occurs within the thoracic cavity and outside of the mediastinum and we refer to this area as \"lung+ space\". While deep learning (DL) has increasingly been utilized to segment pneumothorax lesions in chest radiographs, many existing DL models employ an end-to-end approach. These models directly map chest radiographs to clinician-annotated lesion areas, often neglecting the vital domain knowledge that pneumothorax is inherently location-sensitive. We propose a novel approach that incorporates the lung+ space as a constraint during DL model training for pneumothorax segmentation on 2D chest radiographs. To circumvent the need for additional annotations and to prevent potential label leakage on the target task, our method utilizes external datasets and an auxiliary task of lung segmentation. This approach generates a specific constraint of lung+ space for each chest radiograph. Furthermore, we have incorporated a discriminator to eliminate unreliable constraints caused by the domain shift between the auxiliary and target datasets. Our results demonstrated significant improvements, with average performance gains of 4.6%, 3.6%, and 3.3% regarding Intersection over Union (IoU), Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), and Hausdorff Distance (HD).

The current machine vision model requires a large volume of data to achieve high performance. However, there are approximately 5.5 million different insect species in the world. None of the existing insect datasets can cover even a fraction of them due to varying geographic locations and acquisition costs. In this paper, we introduce a novel ``Insect-1M'' dataset, a game-changing resource poised to revolutionize insect-related foundation model training. Covering a vast spectrum of insect species, our dataset, including 1 million images with dense identification labels of taxonomy hierarchy and insect descriptions, offers a panoramic view of entomology, enabling foundation models to comprehend visual and semantic information about insects like never before. Then, to efficiently establish an Insect Foundation Model, we develop a micro-feature self-supervised learning method with a Patch-wise Relevant Attention mechanism capable of discerning the subtle differences among insect images. In addition, we introduce Description Consistency loss to improve micro-feature modeling via insect descriptions. Through our experiments, we illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in insect modeling and achieve State-of-the-Art performance on standard benchmarks of insect-related tasks.

To address these issues, we propose a novel dual-stream contrastive predictive network (DCPNet), which consists of two asymmetric task designs and the false negative sample elimination module. The first task is to construct positive sample pairs, guiding the core encoder to learn more general representations. The second task is to encourage adaptive capture of the correspondence between deep features and handcrated features, achieving knowledge transfer within the model, and effectively improving the redundancy caused by the feature fusion. To increase the separability between clusters, we also design a cluster-level tasks. The experimental results on OpenSARShip and FUSAR-Ship datasets demonstrate the improvement in classification accuracy of supervised models and confirm the capability of learning effective representations of DCPNet",

    "title": "SpliceMix: A Cross-scale and Semantic Blending Augmentation Strategy for Multi-label Image Classification",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Recently, Mix-style data augmentation methods (e.g., Mixup and CutMix) have shown promising performance in various visual tasks. However, these methods are primarily designed for single-label images, ignoring the considerable discrepancies between single- and multi-label images, i.e., a multi-label image involves multiple co-occurred categories and fickle object scales. On the other hand, previous multi-label image classification (MLIC) methods tend to design elaborate models, bringing expensive computation. In this paper, we introduce a simple but effective augmentation strategy for multi-label image classification, namely SpliceMix. The \"splice\" in our method is two-fold: 1) Each mixed image is a splice of several downsampled images in the form of a grid, where the semantics of images attending to mixing are blended without object deficiencies for alleviating co-occurred bias; 2) We splice mixed images and the original mini-batch to form a new SpliceMixed mini-batch, which allows an image with different scales to contribute to training together. Furthermore, such splice in our SpliceMixed mini-batch enables interactions between mixed images and original regular images. We also offer a simple and non-parametric extension based on consistency learning (SpliceMix-CL) to show the flexible extensibility of our SpliceMix. Extensive experiments on various tasks demonstrate that only using SpliceMix with a baseline model (e.g., ResNet) achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the generalizability of our SpliceMix is further validated by the improvements in current MLIC methods when married with our SpliceMix.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Predicting the trajectory of pedestrians in crowd scenarios is indispensable in self-driving or autonomous mobile robot field because estimating the future locations of pedestrians around is beneficial for policy decision to avoid collision. It is a challenging issue because humans have different walking motions and the interactions between humans and objects in the current environment, especially between human themselves, are complex. Previous researches have focused on how to model the human-human interactions, however, neglecting the relative importance of interactions. In order to address this issue, we introduce a novel mechanism based on the correntropy, which not only can measure the relative importance of human-human interactions, but also can build personal space for each pedestrian. We further propose an Interaction Module including this data-driven mechanism that can effectively extract feature representations of dynamic human-human interactions in the scene and calculate corresponding weights to represent the importance of different interactions. To share such social messages among pedestrians, we design an interaction-aware architecture based on the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for trajectory prediction. We demonstrate the performance of our model on two public datasets and the experimental results demonstrate that our model can achieve better performance than several latest methods with good performance",

    "title": "HumanRecon: Neural Reconstruction of Dynamic Human Using Geometric Cues and Physical Priors",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Recent methods for dynamic human reconstruction have attained promising reconstruction results. Most of these methods rely only on RGB color supervision without considering explicit geometric constraints. This leads to existing human reconstruction techniques being more prone to overfitting to color and causes geometrically inherent ambiguities, especially in the sparse multi-view setup. Motivated by recent advances in the field of monocular geometry prediction, we consider the geometric constraints of estimated depth and normals in the learning of neural implicit representation for dynamic human reconstruction. As a geometric regularization, this provides reliable yet explicit supervision information, and improves reconstruction quality. We also exploit several beneficial physical priors, such as adding noise into view direction and maximizing the density on the human surface. These priors ensure the color rendered along rays to be robust to view direction and reduce the inherent ambiguities of density estimated along rays. Experimental results demonstrate that depth and normal cues, predicted by human-specific monocular estimators, can provide effective supervision signals and render more accurate images. Finally, we also show that the proposed physical priors significantly reduce overfitting and improve the overall quality of novel view synthesis.

Learning-based self-supervised methods for structure-preserving noise reduction have demonstrated superior performance over traditional methods but face unique challenges in OCT imaging. The high correlation of voxels generated by coherent A-scan beams undermines the efficacy of self-supervised learning methods as it violates the assumption of independent pixel noise. We conduct experiments demonstrating limitations of existing models due to this independence assumption. We then introduce a new end-to-end self-supervised learning framework specifically tailored for OCT image denoising, integrating slice-by-slice training and registration modules into one network. An extensive ablation study is conducted for the proposed approach. Comparison to previously published self-supervised denoising models demonstrates improved performance of the proposed framework, potentially serving as a preprocessing step towards superior segmentation performance and quantitative analysis",

    "abstract": "Machine learning models have recently found tremendous success in data-driven control systems. However, standard learning models often suffer from an accuracy-robustness trade-off, which is a limitation that must be overcome in the control of safety-critical systems that require both high performance and rigorous robustness guarantees. In this work, we build upon the recent \"locally biased smoothing\" method to develop classifiers that simultaneously inherit high accuracy from standard models and high robustness from robust models. Specifically, we extend locally biased smoothing to the multi-class setting, and then overcome its performance bottleneck by generalizing the formulation to \"mix\" the outputs of a standard neural network and a robust neural network. We prove that when the robustness of the robust base model is certifiable, within a closed-form $\\ell_p$ radius, no alteration or attack on an input can result in misclassification of the mixed classifier; the proposed model inherits the certified robustness. Moreover, we use numerical experiments on the CIFAR-10 benchmark dataset to verify that the mixed model noticeably improves the accuracy-robustness trade-off",

    "title": "Deep Learning-Based Approaches for Contactless Fingerprints Segmentation and Extraction",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Fingerprints are widely recognized as one of the most unique and reliable characteristics of human identity. Most modern fingerprint authentication systems rely on contact-based fingerprints, which require the use of fingerprint scanners or fingerprint sensors for capturing fingerprints during the authentication process. Various types of fingerprint sensors, such as optical, capacitive, and ultrasonic sensors, employ distinct techniques to gather and analyze fingerprint data. This dependency on specific hardware or sensors creates a barrier or challenge for the broader adoption of fingerprint based biometric systems. This limitation hinders the widespread adoption of fingerprint authentication in various applications and scenarios. Border control, healthcare systems, educational institutions, financial transactions, and airport security face challenges when fingerprint sensors are not universally available. To mitigate the dependence on additional hardware, the use of contactless fingerprints has emerged as an alternative. Developing precise fingerprint segmentation methods, accurate fingerprint extraction tools, and reliable fingerprint matchers are crucial for the successful implementation of a robust contactless fingerprint authentication system. This paper focuses on the development of a deep learning-based segmentation tool for contactless fingerprint localization and segmentation. Our system leverages deep learning techniques to achieve high segmentation accuracy and reliable extraction of fingerprints from contactless fingerprint images. In our evaluation, our segmentation method demonstrated an average mean absolute error (MAE) of 30 pixels, an error in angle prediction (EAP) of 5.92 degrees, and a labeling accuracy of 97.46%. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our novel contactless fingerprint segmentation and extraction tools",

    "title": "Advancing Vision Transformers with Group-Mix Attention",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Vision Transformers (ViTs) have been shown to enhance visual recognition through modeling long-range dependencies with multi-head self-attention (MHSA), which is typically formulated as Query-Key-Value computation. However, the attention map generated from the Query and Key captures only token-to-token correlations at one single granularity. In this paper, we argue that self-attention should have a more comprehensive mechanism to capture correlations among tokens and groups (i.e., multiple adjacent tokens) for higher representational capacity. Thereby, we propose Group-Mix Attention (GMA) as an advanced replacement for traditional self-attention, which can simultaneously capture token-to-token, token-to-group, and group-to-group correlations with various group sizes. To this end, GMA splits the Query, Key, and Value into segments uniformly and performs different group aggregations to generate group proxies. The attention map is computed based on the mixtures of tokens and group proxies and used to re-combine the tokens and groups in Value. Based on GMA, we introduce a powerful backbone, namely GroupMixFormer, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation with fewer parameters than existing models. For instance, GroupMixFormer-L (with 70.3M parameters and 384^2 input) attains 86.2% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K without external data, while GroupMixFormer-B (with 45.8M parameters) attains 51.2% mIoU on ADE20K",

Recently, latent diffusion models trained for 2D image synthesis have been turned into generative video models by inserting temporal layers and finetuning them on small, high-quality video datasets. However, training methods in the literature vary widely, and the field has yet to agree on a unified strategy for curating video data. In this paper, we identify and evaluate three different stages for successful training of video LDMs: text-to-image pretraining, video pretraining, and high-quality video finetuning. Furthermore, we demonstrate the necessity of a well-curated pretraining dataset for generating high-quality videos and present a systematic curation process to train a strong base model, including captioning and filtering strategies. We then explore the impact of finetuning our base model on high-quality data and train a text-to-video model that is competitive with closed-source video generation. We also show that our base model provides a powerful motion representation for downstream tasks such as image-to-video generation and adaptability to camera motion-specific LoRA modules. Finally, we demonstrate that our model provides a strong multi-view 3D-prior and can serve as a base to finetune a multi-view diffusion model that jointly generates multiple views of objects in a feedforward fashion, outperforming image-based methods at a fraction of their compute budget.

For this analysis to be reliable and reproducible, identification of individual fibres within microscopy images (segmentation) of SM tissue should be automatic and precise. Biomedical scientists in this field currently rely on custom tools and general machine learning (ML) models, both followed by labour intensive and subjective manual interventions to fine-tune segmentation. We believe that fully automated, precise, reproducible segmentation is possible by training ML models. However, in this important biomedical domain, there are currently no good quality, publicly available annotated imaging datasets available for ML model training. In this paper we release NCL-SM: a high quality bioimaging dataset of 46 human SM tissue cross-sections from both healthy control subjects and from patients with genetically diagnosed muscle pathology. These images include $>$ 50k manually segmented muscle fibres (myofibres). In addition we also curated high quality myofibre segmentations, annotating reasons for rejecting low quality myofibres and low quality regions in SM tissue images, making these annotations completely ready for downstream analysis. This, we believe, will pave the way for development of a fully automatic pipeline that identifies individual myofibres within images of tissue sections and, in particular, also classifies individual myofibres that are fit for further analysis",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Identifying anatomical structures (e.g., lesions or landmarks) in medical images plays a fundamental role in medical image analysis. As an exemplar-based landmark detection method, Self-supervised Anatomical eMbedding (SAM) learns a discriminative embedding for each voxel in the image and has shown promising results on various tasks. However, SAM still faces challenges in: (1) differentiating voxels with similar appearance but different semantic meanings (\\textit{e.g.}, two adjacent structures without clear borders); (2) matching voxels with similar semantics but markedly different appearance (e.g., the same vessel before and after contrast injection); and (3) cross-modality matching (e.g., CT-MRI registration). To overcome these challenges, we propose SAMv2, which is a unified framework designed to learn appearance, semantic, and cross-modality anatomical embeddings. Specifically, SAMv2 incorporates three key innovations: (1) semantic embedding learning with prototypical contrastive loss; (2) a fixed-point-based matching strategy; and (3) an iterative approach for cross-modality embedding learning. We thoroughly evaluated SAMv2 across three tasks, including one-shot landmark detection, lesion tracking on longitudinal CT scans, and CT-MRI affine/rigid registration with varying field of view. Our results suggest that SAMv2 outperforms SAM and other state-of-the-art methods, offering a robust and versatile approach for landmark based medical image analysis tasks.

    "abstract": "Computer vision models have been known to encode harmful biases, leading to the potentially unfair treatment of historically marginalized groups, such as people of color. However, there remains a lack of datasets balanced along demographic traits that can be used to evaluate the downstream fairness of these models. In this work, we demonstrate that diffusion models can be leveraged to create such a dataset. We first use a diffusion model to generate a large set of images depicting various occupations. Subsequently, each image is edited using inpainting to generate multiple variants, where each variant refers to a different perceived race. Using this dataset, we benchmark several vision-language models on a multi-class occupation classification task. We find that images generated with non-Caucasian labels have a significantly higher occupation misclassification rate than images generated with Caucasian labels, and that several misclassifications are suggestive of racial biases. We measure a model's downstream fairness by computing the standard deviation in the probability of predicting the true occupation label across the different perceived identity groups. Using this fairness metric, we find significant disparities between the evaluated vision-and-language models. We hope that our work demonstrates the potential value of diffusion methods for fairness evaluations",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In optimal transport (OT), a Monge map is known as a mapping that transports a source distribution to a target distribution in the most cost-efficient way. Recently, multiple neural estimators for Monge maps have been developed and applied in diverse unpaired domain translation tasks, e.g. in single-cell biology and computer vision. However, the classic OT framework enforces mass conservation, which makes it prone to outliers and limits its applicability in real-world scenarios. The latter can be particularly harmful in OT domain translation tasks, where the relative position of a sample within a distribution is explicitly taken into account. While unbalanced OT tackles this challenge in the discrete setting, its integration into neural Monge map estimators has received limited attention. We propose a theoretically grounded method to incorporate unbalancedness into any Monge map estimator. We improve existing estimators to model cell trajectories over time and to predict cellular responses to perturbations. Moreover, our approach seamlessly integrates with the OT flow matching (OT-FM) framework. While we show that OT-FM performs competitively in image translation, we further improve performance by incorporating unbalancedness (UOT-FM), which better preserves relevant features. We hence establish UOT-FM as a principled method for unpaired image translation",

Aligning the intraoperatively acquired X-ray image with the preoperatively acquired 3D model of a computed tomography (CT) scan reduces the mental burden on surgeons induced by the overlapping anatomical structures in the acquired images. This paper proposes a fully automatic registration method that is robust to extreme viewpoints and does not require manual annotation of landmark points during training. It is based on a fully convolutional neural network (CNN) that regresses the scene coordinates for a given X-ray image. The scene coordinates are defined as the intersection of the back-projected rays from a pixel toward the 3D model. Training data for a patient-specific model were generated through a realistic simulation of a C-arm device using preoperative CT scans. In contrast, intraoperative registration was achieved by solving the perspective-n-point (PnP) problem with a random sample and consensus (RANSAC) algorithm. Experiments were conducted using a pelvic CT dataset that included several real fluoroscopic (X-ray) images with ground truth annotations. The proposed method achieved an average mean target registration error (mTRE) of 3.79 mm in the 50th percentile of the simulated test dataset and projected mTRE of 9.65 mm in the 50th percentile of real fluoroscopic images for pelvis registration",

Previous work applied a comprehensive manually designed architecture with countless pixel-wise accurate masks as supervision. However, these pixel-level masks are expensive and not available in all cases. In this work, we aim to simplify the supervision as the instance-level annotation, i.e., weakly-supervised audio-visual segmentation. We present a novel Weakly-Supervised Audio-Visual Segmentation framework, namely WS-AVS, that can learn multi-scale audio-visual alignment with multi-scale multiple-instance contrastive learning for audio-visual segmentation. Extensive experiments on AVSBench demonstrate the effectiveness of our WS-AVS in the weakly-supervised audio-visual segmentation of single-source and multi-source scenarios",

    "title": "Mug-STAN: Adapting Image-Language Pretrained Models for General Video Understanding",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Large-scale image-language pretrained models, e.g., CLIP, have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in acquiring general multi-modal knowledge through web-scale image-text data. Despite the impressive performance of image-language models on various image tasks, how to effectively expand them on general video understanding remains an area of ongoing exploration. In this paper, we investigate the image-to-video transferring from the perspective of the model and the data, unveiling two key obstacles impeding the adaptation of image-language models: non-generalizable temporal modeling and partially misaligned video-text data. To address these challenges, we propose Spatial-Temporal Auxiliary Network with Mutual-guided alignment module (Mug-STAN), a simple yet effective framework extending image-text model to diverse video tasks and video-text data.Specifically, STAN adopts a branch structure with decomposed spatial-temporal modules to enable generalizable temporal modeling, while Mug suppresses misalignment by introducing token-wise feature aggregation of either modality from the other. Extensive experimental results verify Mug-STAN significantly improves adaptation of language-image pretrained models such as CLIP and CoCa at both video-text post-pretraining and finetuning stages. With our solution, state-of-the-art zero-shot and finetuning results on various downstream datasets, including MSR-VTT, DiDeMo, LSMDC, Kinetics-400, Something-Something-2, HMDB-51, UCF- 101, and AVA, are achieved. Moreover, by integrating pretrained Mug-STAN with the emerging multimodal dialogue model, we can realize zero-shot video chatting. Codes are available at https://github.com/farewellthree/STAN",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Conventionally, evaluation for the diagnosis of Autism spectrum disorder is done by a trained specialist through questionnaire-based formal assessments and by observation of behavioral cues under various settings to capture the early warning signs of autism. These evaluation techniques are highly subjective and their accuracy relies on the experience of the specialist. In this regard, machine learning-based methods for automated capturing of early signs of autism from the recorded videos of the children is a promising alternative. In this paper, the authors propose a novel pipelined deep learning architecture to detect certain self-stimulatory behaviors that help in the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The authors also supplement their tool with an augmented version of the Self Stimulatory Behavior Dataset (SSBD) and also propose a new label in SSBD Action detection: no-class. The deep learning model with the new dataset is made freely available for easy adoption to the researchers and developers community. An overall accuracy of around 81% was achieved from the proposed pipeline model that is targeted for real-time and hands-free automated diagnosis.

Neural codes capture general statistical regularities in the world, while dynamically adjusting to reflect current goals. One aspect of this adaptation is stochastically co-modulating neurons' gains based on their task relevance. These fluctuations then propagate downstream to guide decision-making. Here, we test the computational viability of such a scheme in the context of multi-task learning. We show that fine-tuning convolutional networks by stochastic gain modulation improves on deterministic gain modulation, achieving state-of-the-art results on the CelebA dataset. To better understand the mechanisms supporting this improvement, we explore how fine-tuning performance is affected by architecture using Cifar-100. Overall, our results suggest that stochastic comodulation can enhance learning efficiency and performance in multi-task learning, without additional learnable parameters.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Stylized text-to-image generation focuses on creating images from textual descriptions while adhering to a style specified by a few reference images. However, subtle style variations within different reference images can hinder the model from accurately learning the target style. In this paper, we propose InstaStyle, a novel approach that excels in generating high-fidelity stylized images with only a single reference image. Our approach is based on the finding that the inversion noise from a stylized reference image inherently carries the style signal, as evidenced by their non-zero signal-to-noise ratio. We employ DDIM inversion to extract this noise from the reference image and leverage a diffusion model to generate new stylized images from the ``style\" noise. Additionally, the inherent ambiguity and bias of textual prompts impede the precise conveying of style. To address this, we introduce a learnable style token via prompt refinement, which enhances the accuracy of the style description for the reference image. Qualitative and quantitative experimental results demonstrate that InstaStyle achieves superior performance compared to current benchmarks. Furthermore, our approach also showcases its capability in the creative task of style combination with mixed inversion noise",

In this work, we present methods to reduce the size of this data, scaling it from gigabytes to megabytes, enabling the micro-CT dataset to be delivered in real-time. In addition, arthropods can be identified by scientists even after implementing data reduction methodologies. Our initial step is to devise three distinct visual previews that comply with the best practices of data exploration. Subsequently, each visual preview warrants its own design consideration, thereby necessitating an individual data processing pipeline for each. We aim to present data reduction algorithms applied across the data processing pipelines. Particularly, we reduce size by using the multi-resolution slicemaps, the server-side rendering, and the histogram filtering approaches. In the evaluation, we examine the disparities of each method to identify the most favorable arrangement for our operation, which can then be adjusted for other experiments that have comparable necessities. Our demonstration proved that reducing the dataset size to the megabyte range is achievable without compromising the arthropod's geometry information",

    "title": "Double-Flow-based Steganography without Embedding for Image-to-Image Hiding",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "As an emerging concept, steganography without embedding (SWE) hides a secret message without directly embedding it into a cover. Thus, SWE has the unique advantage of being immune to typical steganalysis methods and can better protect the secret message from being exposed. However, existing SWE methods are generally criticized for their poor payload capacity and low fidelity of recovered secret messages. In this paper, we propose a novel steganography-without-embedding technique, named DF-SWE, which addresses the aforementioned drawbacks and produces diverse and natural stego images. Specifically, DF-SWE employs a reversible circulation of double flow to build a reversible bijective transformation between the secret image and the generated stego image. Hence, it provides a way to directly generate stego images from secret images without a cover image. Besides leveraging the invertible property, DF-SWE can invert a secret image from a generated stego image in a nearly lossless manner and increases the fidelity of extracted secret images. To the best of our knowledge, DF-SWE is the first SWE method that can hide large images and multiple images into one image with the same size, significantly enhancing the payload capacity. According to the experimental results, the payload capacity of DF-SWE achieves 24-72 BPP is 8000-16000 times compared to its competitors while producing diverse images to minimize the exposure risk. Importantly, DF-SWE can be applied in the steganography of secret images in various domains without requiring training data from the corresponding domains. This domain-agnostic property suggests that DF-SWE can 1) be applied to hiding private data and 2) be deployed in resource-limited systems",

In this study, we introduce the Occlusion Sensitivity Analysis with Deep Feature Augmentation Subspace (OSA-DAS), a novel perturbation-based interpretability approach for computer vision. While traditional perturbation methods make only use of occlusions to explain the model predictions, OSA-DAS extends standard occlusion sensitivity analysis by enabling the integration with diverse image augmentations. Distinctly, our method utilizes the output vector of a DNN to build low-dimensional subspaces within the deep feature vector space, offering a more precise explanation of the model prediction. The structural similarity between these subspaces encompasses the influence of diverse augmentations and occlusions.

    "abstract": "Pre-training & fine-tuning can enhance the transferring efficiency and performance in visual tasks. Recent delta-tuning methods provide more options for visual classification tasks. Despite their success, existing visual delta-tuning art fails to exceed the upper limit of full fine-tuning on challenging tasks like instance segmentation and semantic segmentation. To find a competitive alternative to full fine-tuning, we propose the Multi-cognitive Visual Adapter (Mona) tuning, a novel adapter-based tuning method. First, we introduce multiple vision-friendly filters into the adapter to enhance its ability to process visual signals, while previous methods mainly rely on language-friendly linear filters. Second, we add the scaled normalization layer in the adapter to regulate the distribution of input features for visual filters. To fully demonstrate the practicality and generality of Mona, we conduct experiments on multiple representative visual tasks, including instance segmentation on COCO, semantic segmentation on ADE20K, object detection on Pascal VOC, and image classification on several common datasets. Exciting results illustrate that Mona surpasses full fine-tuning on all these tasks and is the only delta-tuning method outperforming full fine-tuning on instance segmentation and semantic segmentation tasks. For example, Mona achieves a 1% performance gain on the COCO dataset compared to full fine-tuning. Comprehensive results suggest that Mona-tuning is more suitable for retaining and utilizing the capabilities of pre-trained models than full fine-tuning.

    "title": "Coordinate-Aware Modulation for Neural Fields",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Neural fields, mapping low-dimensional input coordinates to corresponding signals, have shown promising results in representing various signals. Numerous methodologies have been proposed, and techniques employing MLPs and grid representations have achieved substantial success. MLPs allow compact and high expressibility, yet often suffer from spectral bias and slow convergence speed. On the other hand, methods using grids are free from spectral bias and achieve fast training speed, however, at the expense of high spatial complexity. In this work, we propose a novel way for exploiting both MLPs and grid representations in neural fields. Unlike the prevalent methods that combine them sequentially (extract features from the grids first and feed them to the MLP), we inject spectral bias-free grid representations into the intermediate features in the MLP. More specifically, we suggest a Coordinate-Aware Modulation (CAM), which modulates the intermediate features using scale and shift parameters extracted from the grid representations. This can maintain the strengths of MLPs while mitigating any remaining potential biases, facilitating the rapid learning of high-frequency components. In addition, we empirically found that the feature normalizations, which have not been successful in neural filed literature, proved to be effective when applied in conjunction with the proposed CAM. Experimental results demonstrate that CAM enhances the performance of neural representation and improves learning stability across a range of signals. Especially in the novel view synthesis task, we achieved state-of-the-art performance with the least number of parameters and fast training speed for dynamic scenes and the best performance under 1MB memory for static scenes. CAM also outperforms the best-performing video compression methods using neural fields by a large margin",

To address this, we propose a novel preprocessing and intensity augmentation scheme inspired by how radiologists leverage multiple viewing windows when evaluating CT images. Our proposed method, window shifting, randomly places the viewing windows around the region of interest during training.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Image registration is a fundamental medical image analysis task. Ideally, registration should focus on aligning semantically corresponding voxels, i.e., the same anatomical locations. However, existing methods often optimize similarity measures computed directly on intensities or on hand-crafted features, which lack anatomical semantic information. These similarity measures may lead to sub-optimal solutions where large deformations, complex anatomical differences, or cross-modality imagery exist. In this work, we introduce a fast and accurate method for unsupervised 3D medical image registration building on top of a Self-supervised Anatomical eMbedding (SAM) algorithm, which is capable of computing dense anatomical correspondences between two images at the voxel level. We name our approach SAM-Enhanced registration (SAME++), which decomposes image registration into four steps: affine transformation, coarse deformation, deep non-parametric transformation, and instance optimization. Using SAM embeddings, we enhance these steps by finding more coherent correspondence and providing features with better semantic guidance. We extensively evaluated SAME++ using more than 50 labeled organs on three challenging inter-subject registration tasks of different body parts. As a complete registration framework, SAME++ markedly outperforms leading methods by $4.2\\%$ - $8.2\\%$ in terms of Dice score while being orders of magnitude faster than numerical optimization-based methods.

However, most existing planar reconstruction models either neglect semantic predictions or do not run efficiently enough for real-time applications.

    "abstract": "Video captioning models easily suffer from long-tail distribution of phrases, which makes captioning models prone to generate vague sentences instead of accurate ones. However, existing debiasing strategies tend to export external knowledge to build dependency trees of words or refine frequency distribution by complex losses and extra input features, which lack interpretability and are hard to train. To mitigate the impact of granularity bias on the model, we introduced a statistical-based bias extractor. This extractor quantifies the information content within sentences and videos, providing an estimate of the likelihood that a video-sentence pair is affected by granularity bias. Furthermore, with the growing trend of integrating contrastive learning methods into video captioning tasks, we use a bidirectional triplet loss to get more negative samples in a batch. Subsequently, we incorporate the margin score into the contrastive learning loss, establishing distinct training objectives for head and tail sentences. This approach facilitates the model's training effectiveness on tail samples. Our simple yet effective loss, incorporating Granularity bias, is referred to as the Margin-Contrastive Loss (GMC Loss).

Our segmentation model combines a U-Net-based tissue detection with a Shifted windows-transformer architecture to reach excellent segmentation results for even the most severely altered glomeruli, arterioles and arteries, even on unseen staining domains from a different nephropathology lab. With accurate automatic segmentation of the decisive renal biopsy compartments in human renal vasculopathies, we have laid the foundation for large-scale compartment-specific machine learning and computer vision analysis of renal biopsy repositories with TMAs",

    "title": "Point Cloud Pre-training with Diffusion Models",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Pre-training a model and then fine-tuning it on downstream tasks has demonstrated significant success in the 2D image and NLP domains. However, due to the unordered and non-uniform density characteristics of point clouds, it is non-trivial to explore the prior knowledge of point clouds and pre-train a point cloud backbone. In this paper, we propose a novel pre-training method called Point cloud Diffusion pre-training (PointDif). We consider the point cloud pre-training task as a conditional point-to-point generation problem and introduce a conditional point generator. This generator aggregates the features extracted by the backbone and employs them as the condition to guide the point-to-point recovery from the noisy point cloud, thereby assisting the backbone in capturing both local and global geometric priors as well as the global point density distribution of the object. We also present a recurrent uniform sampling optimization strategy, which enables the model to uniformly recover from various noise levels and learn from balanced supervision. Our PointDif achieves substantial improvement across various real-world datasets for diverse downstream tasks such as classification, segmentation and detection. Specifically, PointDif attains 70.0% mIoU on S3DIS Area 5 for the segmentation task and achieves an average improvement of 2.4% on ScanObjectNN for the classification task compared to TAP. Furthermore, our pre-training framework can be flexibly applied to diverse point cloud backbones and bring considerable gains",

    "title": "Effective Backdoor Mitigation Depends on the Pre-training Objective",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Despite the advanced capabilities of contemporary machine learning (ML) models, they remain vulnerable to adversarial and backdoor attacks. This vulnerability is particularly concerning in real-world deployments, where compromised models may exhibit unpredictable behavior in critical scenarios. Such risks are heightened by the prevalent practice of collecting massive, internet-sourced datasets for pre-training multimodal models, as these datasets may harbor backdoors. Various techniques have been proposed to mitigate the effects of backdooring in these models such as CleanCLIP which is the current state-of-the-art approach. In this work, we demonstrate that the efficacy of CleanCLIP in mitigating backdoors is highly dependent on the particular objective used during model pre-training. We observe that stronger pre-training objectives correlate with harder to remove backdoors behaviors. We show this by training multimodal models on two large datasets consisting of 3 million (CC3M) and 6 million (CC6M) datapoints, under various pre-training objectives, followed by poison removal using CleanCLIP. We find that CleanCLIP is ineffective when stronger pre-training objectives are used, even with extensive hyperparameter tuning. Our findings underscore critical considerations for ML practitioners who pre-train models using large-scale web-curated data and are concerned about potential backdoor threats. Notably, our results suggest that simpler pre-training objectives are more amenable to effective backdoor removal. This insight is pivotal for practitioners seeking to balance the trade-offs between using stronger pre-training objectives and security against backdoor attacks",

    "abstract": "Automated driving object detection has always been a challenging task in computer vision due to environmental uncertainties. These uncertainties include significant differences in object sizes and encountering the class unseen. It may result in poor performance when traditional object detection models are directly applied to automated driving detection. Because they usually presume fixed categories of common traffic participants, such as pedestrians and cars. Worsely, the huge class imbalance between common and novel classes further exacerbates performance degradation. To address the issues stated, we propose OpenNet to moderate the class imbalance with the Balanced Loss, which is based on Cross Entropy Loss. Besides, we adopt an inductive layer based on gradient reshaping to fast learn new classes with limited samples during incremental learning. To against catastrophic forgetting, we employ normalized feature distillation. By the way, we improve multi-scale detection robustness and unknown class recognition through FPN and energy-based detection, respectively. The Experimental results upon the CODA dataset show that the proposed method can obtain better performance than that of the existing methods",

Unlike existing methods that require either training auxiliary networks or fine-tuning a large pre-trained backbone, or both, to harmonize a foreground object with a painterly-style background image, our FreePIH tames the denoising process as a plug-in module for foreground image style transfer. Specifically, we find that the very last few steps of the denoising (i.e., generation) process strongly correspond to the stylistic information of images, and based on this, we propose to augment the latent features of both the foreground and background images with Gaussians for a direct denoising-based harmonization. To guarantee the fidelity of the harmonized image, we make use of multi-scale features to enforce the consistency of the content and stability of the foreground objects in the latent space, and meanwhile, aligning both fore-/back-grounds with the same style. Moreover, to accommodate the generation with more structural and textural details, we further integrate text prompts to attend to the latent features, hence improving the generation quality.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Predicting pedestrian trajectories is crucial for improving the safety and effectiveness of autonomous driving and mobile robots. However, this task is nontrivial due to the inherent stochasticity of human motion, which naturally requires the predictor to generate multi-model prediction. Previous works have used various generative methods, such as GAN and VAE, for pedestrian trajectory prediction. Nevertheless, these methods may suffer from problems, including mode collapse and relatively low-quality results. The denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) has recently been applied to trajectory prediction due to its simple training process and powerful reconstruction ability. However, current diffusion-based methods are straightforward without fully leveraging input information and usually require many denoising iterations leading to a long inference time or an additional network for initialization. To address these challenges and promote the application of diffusion models in trajectory prediction, we propose a novel scene-aware multi-modal pedestrian trajectory prediction framework called GBD. GBD combines goal prediction with the diffusion network. First, the goal predictor produces multiple goals, and then the diffusion network generates multi-modal trajectories conditioned on these goals. Furthermore, we introduce a new diffusion sampling algorithm named tree sampling (TS), which leverages common feature to reduce the inference time and improve accuracy for multi-modal prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that our GBD-TS method achieves state-of-the-art performance with real-time inference speed",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Explicit Caption Editing (ECE) -- refining reference image captions through a sequence of explicit edit operations (e.g., KEEP, DETELE) -- has raised significant attention due to its explainable and human-like nature. After training with carefully designed reference and ground-truth caption pairs, state-of-the-art ECE models exhibit limited generalization ability beyond the original training data distribution, i.e., they are tailored to refine content details only in in-domain samples but fail to correct errors in out-of-domain samples. To this end, we propose a new Diffusion-based Explicit Caption editing method: DECap. Specifically, we reformulate the ECE task as a denoising process under the diffusion mechanism, and introduce innovative edit-based noising and denoising processes. Thanks to this design, the noising process can help to eliminate the need for meticulous paired data selection by directly introducing word-level noises for training, learning diverse distribution over input reference caption. The denoising process involves the explicit predictions of edit operations and corresponding content words, refining reference captions through iterative step-wise editing. To further efficiently implement our diffusion process and improve the inference speed, DECap discards the prevalent multi-stage design and directly generates edit operations and content words simultaneously. Extensive ablations have demonstrated the strong generalization ability of DECap in various scenarios. More interestingly, it even shows great potential in improving the quality and controllability of caption generation",

We apply this innovative technique to localize fine-scale motion-selective sites in the early visual areas. Detection of these sites typically requires a resolution higher than 1 mm isotropic, whereas here, we visualize them based on lower resolution (2-3mm isotropic) fMRI data. Remarkably, the super-resolved fMRI is able to recover high-frequency detail of the interdigitated organization of these sites (relative to the color-selective sites), even with training data sourced from different subjects and experimental paradigms -- including non-visual resting-state fMRI, underscoring its robustness and versatility.

The experiments under the UCL paradigm indicate a phenomenon where the results on the first few tasks are suboptimal. This phenomenon can render the model inappropriate for practical applications. To address this issue, after analyzing the phenomenon and identifying the lack of diversity as a vital factor, we propose a method named Codebook for Unsupervised Continual Learning (CUCL) which promotes the model to learn discriminative features to complete the class boundary. Specifically, we first introduce a Product Quantization to inject diversity into the representation and apply a cross quantized contrastive loss between the original representation and the quantized one to capture discriminative information. Then, based on the quantizer, we propose an effective Codebook Rehearsal to address catastrophic forgetting.

While promising performance has been demonstrated, existing REC algorithms make a strong assumption that training data feeding into a model are given upfront, which degrades its practicality for real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose Continual Referring Expression Comprehension (CREC), a new setting for REC, where a model is learning on a stream of incoming tasks. In order to continuously improve the model on sequential tasks without forgetting prior learned knowledge and without repeatedly re-training from a scratch, we propose an effective baseline method named Dual Modular Memorization (DMM), which alleviates the problem of catastrophic forgetting by two memorization modules: Implicit-Memory and Explicit-Memory. Specifically, the former module aims to constrain drastic changes to important parameters learned on old tasks when learning a new task; while the latter module maintains a buffer pool to dynamically select and store representative samples of each seen task for future rehearsal. We create three benchmarks for the new CREC setting, by respectively re-splitting three widely-used REC datasets RefCOCO, RefCOCO+ and RefCOCOg into sequential tasks. Extensive experiments on the constructed benchmarks demonstrate that our DMM method significantly outperforms other alternatives, based on two popular REC backbones.

The comprehensiveness of AutoEval-Video is demonstrated in two aspects: 1) AutoEval-Video constructs open-ended video-questions across 9 skill dimensions, addressing capabilities of perception, comprehension, and generation. 2) AutoEval-Video contains newly collected videos that cover over 40 distinct themes. To efficiently evaluate responses to the open-ended questions, we employ an LLM-based evaluation approach, but instead of merely providing a reference answer, we annotate unique evaluation rules for every single instance (video-question pair). To maximize the robustness of these rules, we develop a novel adversarial annotation mechanism. By using instance-specific rules as prompt, GPT-4, as an automatic evaluator, can achieve a stable evaluation accuracy of around 97.0\\%, comparable to the 94.9\\% - 97.5\\% accuracy of a human evaluator. Furthermore, we assess the performance of eight large vision-language models on AutoEval-Video. Among them, GPT-4V(ision) significantly outperforms other models, achieving an accuracy of 32.2\\%. However, there is still substantial room for improvement compared to human accuracy of 72.8\\%. By conducting an extensive case study, we uncover several drawbacks of GPT-4V, such as limited temporal and dynamic comprehension, and overly general responses.

    "title": "Class Gradient Projection For Continual Learning",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Catastrophic forgetting is one of the most critical challenges in Continual Learning (CL). Recent approaches tackle this problem by projecting the gradient update orthogonal to the gradient subspace of existing tasks. While the results are remarkable, those approaches ignore the fact that these calculated gradients are not guaranteed to be orthogonal to the gradient subspace of each class due to the class deviation in tasks, e.g., distinguishing \"Man\" from \"Sea\" v.s. differentiating \"Boy\" from \"Girl\". Therefore, this strategy may still cause catastrophic forgetting for some classes. In this paper, we propose Class Gradient Projection (CGP), which calculates the gradient subspace from individual classes rather than tasks. Gradient update orthogonal to the gradient subspace of existing classes can be effectively utilized to minimize interference from other classes. To improve the generalization and efficiency, we further design a Base Refining (BR) algorithm to combine similar classes and refine class bases dynamically. Moreover, we leverage a contrastive learning method to improve the model's ability to handle unseen tasks.

    "abstract": "Recently, 3D anomaly detection, a crucial problem involving fine-grained geometry discrimination, is getting more attention. However, the lack of abundant real 3D anomaly data limits the scalability of current models. To enable scalable anomaly data collection, we propose a 3D anomaly synthesis pipeline to adapt existing large-scale 3Dmodels for 3D anomaly detection. Specifically, we construct a synthetic dataset, i.e., Anomaly-ShapeNet, basedon ShapeNet. Anomaly-ShapeNet consists of 1600 point cloud samples under 40 categories, which provides a rich and varied collection of data, enabling efficient training and enhancing adaptability to industrial scenarios. Meanwhile,to enable scalable representation learning for 3D anomaly localization, we propose a self-supervised method, i.e., Iterative Mask Reconstruction Network (IMRNet). During training, we propose a geometry-aware sample module to preserve potentially anomalous local regions during point cloud down-sampling. Then, we randomly mask out point patches and sent the visible patches to a transformer for reconstruction-based self-supervision. During testing, the point cloud repeatedly goes through the Mask Reconstruction Network, with each iteration's output becoming the next input. By merging and contrasting the final reconstructed point cloud with the initial input, our method successfully locates anomalies. Experiments show that IMRNet outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving 66.1% in I-AUC on Anomaly-ShapeNet dataset and 72.5% in I-AUC on Real3D-AD dataset.

    "abstract": "Robust uncertainty estimations are necessary in safety-critical applications of Deep Learning. One such example is the semantic segmentation of medical images, whilst deep-learning approaches have high-performance in such tasks they lack interpretability as they give no indication of their confidence when making classification decisions. Robust and interpretable segmentation is a critical first stage in automatically screening for pathologies hence the optimal solution is one which can provide highly accuracy but also capture the underlying uncertainty. In this work we present an uncertainty-aware segmentation model, BA U-Net, for use on MRI data that incorporates Bayesian Neural Networks and Attention Mechanisms to provide accurate and interpretable segmentations. We evaluated our model on the publicly available BraTS 2020 dataset using F1 Score and Intersection Over Union (IoU) as evaluation metrics",

    "title": "Unified Medical Image Pre-training in Language-Guided Common Semantic Space",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) has shown the merits of analysing medical images, by leveraging the semantic congruence between medical images and their corresponding reports. It efficiently learns visual representations, which in turn facilitates enhanced analysis and interpretation of intricate imaging data. However, such observation is predominantly justified on single-modality data (mostly 2D images like X-rays), adapting VLP to learning unified representations for medical images in real scenario remains an open challenge. This arises from medical images often encompass a variety of modalities, especially modalities with different various number of dimensions (e.g., 3D images like Computed Tomography). To overcome the aforementioned challenges, we propose an Unified Medical Image Pre-training framework, namely UniMedI, which utilizes diagnostic reports as common semantic space to create unified representations for diverse modalities of medical images (especially for 2D and 3D images). Under the text's guidance, we effectively uncover visual modality information, identifying the affected areas in 2D X-rays and slices containing lesion in sophisticated 3D CT scans, ultimately enhancing the consistency across various medical imaging modalities. To demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of UniMedI, we evaluate its performance on both 2D and 3D images across 10 different datasets, covering a wide range of medical image tasks such as classification, segmentation, and retrieval. UniMedI has demonstrated superior performance in downstream tasks, showcasing its effectiveness in establishing a universal medical visual representation",

    "abstract": "Text-image composed retrieval aims to retrieve the target image through the composed query, which is specified in the form of an image plus some text that describes desired modifications to the input image. It has recently attracted attention due to its ability to leverage both information-rich images and concise language to precisely express the requirements for target images. However, the robustness of these approaches against real-world corruptions or further text understanding has never been studied. In this paper, we perform the first robustness study and establish three new diversified benchmarks for systematic analysis of text-image composed retrieval against natural corruptions in both vision and text and further probe textural understanding. For natural corruption analysis, we introduce two new large-scale benchmark datasets, CIRR-C and FashionIQ-C for testing in open domain and fashion domain respectively, both of which apply 15 visual corruptions and 7 textural corruptions. For textural understanding analysis, we introduce a new diagnostic dataset CIRR-D by expanding the original raw data with synthetic data, which contains modified text to better probe textual understanding ability including numerical variation, attribute variation, object removal, background variation, and fine-grained evaluation.

    "abstract": "Accurate Defect detection is crucial for ensuring the trustworthiness of intelligent railway systems. Current approaches rely on single deep-learning models, like CNNs, which employ a large amount of data to capture underlying patterns. Training a new defect classifier with limited samples often leads to overfitting and poor performance on unseen images. To address this, researchers have advocated transfer learning and fine-tuning the pre-trained models. However, using a single backbone network in transfer learning still may cause bottleneck issues and inconsistent performance if it is not suitable for a specific problem domain. To overcome these challenges, we propose a reusable AI-enabled defect detection approach. By combining ensemble learning with transfer learning models (VGG-19, MobileNetV3, and ResNet-50), we improved the classification accuracy and achieved consistent performance at a certain phase of training. Our empirical analysis demonstrates better and more consistent performance compared to other state-of-the-art approaches. The consistency substantiates the reusability of the defect detection system for newly evolved defected rail parts. Therefore we anticipate these findings to benefit further research and development of reusable AI-enabled solutions for railway systems",

Segmentation benefits by humans-in-the-loop to provide additional input of objects to segment using a combination of foreground or background clicks. Tasks include photoediting or novel dataset annotation, where human annotators leverage an existing segmentation model instead of drawing raw pixel level annotations. We propose a new segmentation process, Text + Click segmentation, where a model takes as input an image, a text phrase describing a class to segment, and a single foreground click specifying the instance to segment. Compared to previous approaches, we leverage open-vocabulary image-text models to support a wide-range of text prompts. Conditioning segmentations on text prompts improves the accuracy of segmentations on novel or unseen classes. We demonstrate that the combination of a single user-specified foreground click and a text prompt allows a model to better disambiguate overlapping or co-occurring semantic categories, such as \"tie\", \"suit\", and \"person\".

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In-context segmentation aims at segmenting novel images using a few labeled example images, termed as \"in-context examples\", exploring content similarities between examples and the target. The resulting models can be generalized seamlessly to novel segmentation tasks, significantly reducing the labeling and training costs compared with conventional pipelines. However, in-context segmentation is more challenging than classic ones due to its meta-learning nature, requiring the model to learn segmentation rules conditioned on a few samples, not just the segmentation. Unlike previous work with ad-hoc or non-end-to-end designs, we propose SEGIC, an end-to-end segment-in-context framework built upon a single vision foundation model (VFM). In particular, SEGIC leverages the emergent correspondence within VFM to capture dense relationships between target images and in-context samples. As such, information from in-context samples is then extracted into three types of instructions, i.e. geometric, visual, and meta instructions, serving as explicit conditions for the final mask prediction. SEGIC is a straightforward yet effective approach that yields state-of-the-art performance on one-shot segmentation benchmarks. Notably, SEGIC can be easily generalized to diverse tasks, including video object segmentation and open-vocabulary segmentation. Code will be available at \\url{https://github.com/MengLcool/SEGIC}",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown great promise in natural image domains, allowing users to hold a dialogue about given visual content. However, such general-domain VLMs perform poorly for Remote Sensing (RS) scenarios, leading to inaccurate or fabricated information when presented with RS domain-specific queries. Such a behavior emerges due to the unique challenges introduced by RS imagery. For example, to handle high-resolution RS imagery with diverse scale changes across categories and many small objects, region-level reasoning is necessary alongside holistic scene interpretation. Furthermore, the lack of domain-specific multimodal instruction following data as well as strong backbone models for RS make it hard for the models to align their behavior with user queries. To address these limitations, we propose GeoChat - the first versatile remote sensing VLM that offers multitask conversational capabilities with high-resolution RS images. Specifically, GeoChat can not only answer image-level queries but also accepts region inputs to hold region-specific dialogue. Furthermore, it can visually ground objects in its responses by referring to their spatial coordinates. To address the lack of domain-specific datasets, we generate a novel RS multimodal instruction-following dataset by extending image-text pairs from existing diverse RS datasets. We establish a comprehensive benchmark for RS multitask conversations and compare with a number of baseline methods. GeoChat demonstrates robust zero-shot performance on various RS tasks, e.g., image and region captioning, visual question answering, scene classification, visually grounded conversations and referring detection.

Although these vision-based models have shown promising results, they face limitations in effectively capturing and utilizing the dynamic spatio-temporal interactions between the target pedestrian and its surrounding traffic elements, crucial for accurate reasoning. Additionally, training these models requires manually annotating domain-specific datasets, a process that is expensive, time-consuming, and difficult to generalize to new environments and scenarios. The recent emergence of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) offers potential solutions to these limitations due to their superior visual understanding and causal reasoning capabilities, which can be harnessed through semi-supervised training.

Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate GPT-4V(ision)'s promise in zero-shot pedestrian behavior prediction and driving scene understanding ability for autonomous driving.

To this end, we first dissect the text encoder's integration in the image generation process to identify the feature-dense space of the encoder. Afterward, we concatenate embeddings on the Keys and Values in this space to learn the gap between the personalized concept and its base class. In this way, the concatenated embeddings ultimately manifest as a residual on the original attention output. To more accurately and unbiasedly quantify the results of personalized image generation, we improve the CLIP image alignment score based on masks.

Initially, a static model is optimized using the reference image, guided by 2D and 3D diffusion priors, which serves as the initialization for the dynamic NeRF. Subsequently, a video diffusion model is employed to learn the motion specific to the subject. However, the object in the 3D videos tends to drift away from the reference image over time. This drift is mainly due to the misalignment between the text prompt and the reference image in the video diffusion model.

Specifically, for data curation, Auto-Bench utilizes LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) to automatically generate a vast set of question-answer-reasoning triplets via prompting on visual symbolic representations (e.g., captions, object locations, instance relationships, and etc.). The curated data closely matches human intent, owing to the extensive world knowledge embedded in LLMs. Through this pipeline, a total of 28.5K human-verified and 3,504K unfiltered question-answer-reasoning triplets have been curated, covering 4 primary abilities and 16 sub-abilities. We subsequently engage LLMs like GPT-3.5 to serve as judges, implementing the quantitative and qualitative automated assessments to facilitate a comprehensive evaluation of VLMs. Our validation results reveal that LLMs are proficient in both evaluation data curation and model assessment, achieving an average agreement rate of 85%. We envision Auto-Bench as a flexible, scalable, and comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the evolving sophisticated VLMs",

    "abstract": "Replicating the innate human ability to detect all objects based on free-form texts at any granularity remains a formidable challenge for Vision-Language models. Current Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) are predominantly constrained to grounding a single, pre-existing object, relying solely on data from Referring Expression Comprehension tasks. The limitation leads to a compromise in model design, necessitating the introduction of visual expert models or the integration of customized head structures. Beyond these constraints, our research delves into the untapped potential of LVLMs and uncover their inherent capability for basic object perception, allowing them to accurately identify and locate objects of interest. Building on this insight, we introduce a novel language-prompted localization dataset designed to fully unleash the capabilities of LVLMs in integrating fine-grained object perception with precise location awareness. More importantly, we present $\\textbf{Griffon}$, a purely LVLM-based baseline, which does not require the introduction of any special tokens, expert models, or additional detection modules. It simply maintains a consistent structure with popular LVLMs by unifying data formats across various localization-related scenarios and is trained end-to-end through a well-designed pipeline. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that $\\textbf{Griffon}$ not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on the fine-grained RefCOCO series but also approaches the capabilities of the expert model Faster RCNN on the detection benchmark MSCOCO",

Recent works add text as an extra modality to enhance the performance of these models. Most of these approaches treat text as an auxiliary modality without fully exploring its potential to elucidate the underlying class visual features distribution. In this paper, we present a novel approach that leverages text-derived statistics to predict the mean and covariance of the visual feature distribution for each class. This predictive framework enriches the latent space, yielding more robust and generalizable few-shot learning models. We demonstrate the efficacy of incorporating both mean and covariance statistics in improving few-shot classification performance across various datasets.

    "abstract": "An accurate and efficient epileptic seizure onset detection system can significantly benefit patients. Traditional diagnostic methods, primarily relying on electroencephalograms (EEGs), often result in cumbersome and non-portable solutions, making continuous patient monitoring challenging. The video-based seizure detection system is expected to free patients from the constraints of scalp or implanted EEG devices and enable remote monitoring in residential settings. Previous video-based methods neither enable all-day monitoring nor provide short detection latency due to insufficient resources and ineffective patient action recognition techniques. Additionally, skeleton-based action recognition approaches remain limitations in identifying subtle seizure-related actions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel skeleton-based spatiotemporal vision graph neural network (STViG) for efficient, accurate, and timely REal-time Automated Detection of epileptic Seizures from surveillance Videos (READS-V). Our experimental results indicate STViG outperforms previous state-of-the-art action recognition models on our collected patients' video data with higher accuracy (5.9% error) and lower FLOPs (0.4G). Furthermore, by integrating a decision-making rule that combines output probabilities and an accumulative function, our READS-V system achieves a 5.1 s EEG onset detection latency, a 13.1 s advance in clinical onset detection, and zero false detection rate",

    "abstract": "3D editing plays a crucial role in many areas such as gaming and virtual reality. Traditional 3D editing methods, which rely on representations like meshes and point clouds, often fall short in realistically depicting complex scenes. On the other hand, methods based on implicit 3D representations, like Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), render complex scenes effectively but suffer from slow processing speeds and limited control over specific scene areas. In response to these challenges, our paper presents GaussianEditor, an innovative and efficient 3D editing algorithm based on Gaussian Splatting (GS), a novel 3D representation. GaussianEditor enhances precision and control in editing through our proposed Gaussian semantic tracing, which traces the editing target throughout the training process. Additionally, we propose Hierarchical Gaussian splatting (HGS) to achieve stabilized and fine results under stochastic generative guidance from 2D diffusion models. We also develop editing strategies for efficient object removal and integration, a challenging task for existing methods. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate GaussianEditor's superior control, efficacy, and rapid performance, marking a significant advancement in 3D editing.

To precisely control the shapes and views of generated images, we innovatively propose a new conditioning mechanism that predicts an embedding encapsulating the input spatial and view conditions, which is then injected to the network globally. Once MVControl is trained, score-distillation (SDS) loss based optimization can be performed to generate 3D content, in which process we propose to use a hybrid diffusion prior.

Many leading methods discover anomalies by detecting an unusual part of a sample. For example, state-of-the-art segmentation-based approaches, first classify each element of the sample (e.g., image patch) as normal or anomalous and then classify the entire sample as anomalous if it contains anomalous elements. However, such approaches do not extend well to scenarios where the anomalies are expressed by an unusual combination of normal elements. In this paper, we overcome this limitation by proposing set features that model each sample by the distribution of its elements. We compute the anomaly score of each sample using a simple density estimation method, using fixed features.

    "abstract": "Deep learning has revolutionized the accurate segmentation of diseases in medical imaging. However, achieving such results requires training with numerous manual voxel annotations. This requirement presents a challenge for whole-body Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging, where lesions are scattered throughout the body. To tackle this problem, we introduce SW-FastEdit - an interactive segmentation framework that accelerates the labeling by utilizing only a few user clicks instead of voxelwise annotations. While prior interactive models crop or resize PET volumes due to memory constraints, we use the complete volume with our sliding window-based interactive scheme. Our model outperforms existing non-sliding window interactive models on the AutoPET dataset and generalizes to the previously unseen HECKTOR dataset. A user study revealed that annotators achieve high-quality predictions with only 10 click iterations and a low perceived NASA-TLX workload.

    "title": "Trainwreck: A damaging adversarial attack on image classifiers",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Adversarial attacks are an important security concern for computer vision (CV), as they enable malicious attackers to reliably manipulate CV models. Existing attacks aim to elicit an output desired by the attacker, but keep the model fully intact on clean data. With CV models becoming increasingly valuable assets in applied practice, a new attack vector is emerging: disrupting the models as a form of economic sabotage. This paper opens up the exploration of damaging adversarial attacks (DAAs) that seek to damage the target model and maximize the total cost incurred by the damage. As a pioneer DAA, this paper proposes Trainwreck, a train-time attack that poisons the training data of image classifiers to degrade their performance. Trainwreck conflates the data of similar classes using stealthy ($\\epsilon \\leq 8/255$) class-pair universal perturbations computed using a surrogate model. Trainwreck is a black-box, transferable attack: it requires no knowledge of the target model's architecture, and a single poisoned dataset degrades the performance of any model trained on it. The experimental evaluation on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 demonstrates that Trainwreck is indeed an effective attack across various model architectures including EfficientNetV2, ResNeXt-101, and a finetuned ViT-L-16. The strength of the attack can be customized by the poison rate parameter. Finally, data redundancy with file hashing and/or pixel difference are identified as a reliable defense technique against Trainwreck or similar DAAs.

CT-xCOV adopts an end-to-end approach from lung segmentation to COVID-19 detection and explanations of the detection model's prediction. For lung segmentation, we used the well-known U-Net model. For COVID-19 detection, we compared three different CNN architectures: a standard CNN, ResNet50, and DenseNet121. After the detection, visual and textual explanations are provided. For visual explanations, we applied three different XAI techniques, namely, Grad-Cam, Integrated Gradient (IG), and LIME. Textual explanations are added by computing the percentage of infection by lungs. To assess the performance of the used XAI techniques, we propose a ground-truth-based evaluation method, measuring the similarity between the visualization outputs and the ground-truth infections. The performed experiments show that the applied DL models achieved good results. The U-Net segmentation model achieved a high Dice coefficient (98%). The performance of our proposed classification model (standard CNN) was validated using 5-fold cross-validation (acc of 98.40% and f1-score 98.23%). Lastly, the results of the comparison of XAI techniques show that Grad-Cam gives the best explanations compared to LIME and IG, by achieving a Dice coefficient of 55%, on COVID-19 positive scans, compared to 29% and 24% obtained by IG and LIME respectively.

As compared to other adverse weather datasets, we provide i.) more annotated images, ii.) paired Near-Infrared (NIR) image for each frame, iii.) larger label set with a 4-level label hierarchy to capture unstructured traffic conditions. We benchmark state-of-the-art models for semantic segmentation in IDD-AW.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "General purpose segmentation models are able to generate (semantic) segmentation masks from a variety of prompts, including visual (points, boxed, etc.) and textual (object names) ones. In particular, input images are pre-processed by an image encoder to obtain embedding vectors which are later used for mask predictions. Existing adversarial attacks target the end-to-end tasks, i.e. aim at altering the segmentation mask predicted for a specific image-prompt pair. However, this requires running an individual attack for each new prompt for the same image. We propose instead to generate prompt-agnostic adversarial attacks by maximizing the $\\ell_2$-distance, in the latent space, between the embedding of the original and perturbed images. Since the encoding process only depends on the image, distorted image representations will cause perturbations in the segmentation masks for a variety of prompts. We show that even imperceptible $\\ell_\\infty$-bounded perturbations of radius $\\epsilon=1/255$ are often sufficient to drastically modify the masks predicted with point, box and text prompts by recently proposed foundation models for segmentation. Moreover, we explore the possibility of creating universal, i.e. non image-specific, attacks which can be readily applied to any input without further computational cost",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "For debugging and verification of computer vision convolutional deep neural networks (CNNs) human inspection of the learned latent representations is imperative. Therefore, state-of-the-art eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods globally associate given natural language semantic concepts with representing vectors or regions in the CNN latent space supporting manual inspection. Yet, this approach comes with two major disadvantages: They are locally inaccurate when reconstructing a concept label and discard information about the distribution of concept instance representations. The latter, though, is of particular interest for debugging, like finding and understanding outliers, learned notions of sub-concepts, and concept confusion. Furthermore, current single-layer approaches neglect that information about a concept may be spread over the CNN depth. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce the local-to-global Guided Concept Projection Vectors (GCPV) approach: It (1) generates local concept vectors that each precisely reconstruct a concept segmentation label, and then (2) generalizes these to global concept and even sub-concept vectors by means of hiearchical clustering. Our experiments on object detectors demonstrate improved performance compared to the state-of-the-art, the benefit of multi-layer concept vectors, and robustness against low-quality concept segmentation labels.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Diffusion models, as a type of generative models, have achieved impressive results in generating images and videos conditioned on textual conditions. However, the generation process of diffusion models involves denoising for dozens of steps to produce photorealistic images/videos, which is computationally expensive. Unlike previous methods that design ``one-size-fits-all'' approaches for speed up, we argue denoising steps should be sample-specific conditioned on the richness of input texts. To this end, we introduce AdaDiff, a lightweight framework designed to learn instance-specific step usage policies, which are then used by the diffusion model for generation. AdaDiff is optimized using a policy gradient method to maximize a carefully designed reward function, balancing inference time and generation quality. We conduct experiments on three image generation and two video generation benchmarks and demonstrate that our approach achieves similar results in terms of visual quality compared to the baseline using a fixed 50 denoising steps while reducing inference time by at least 33%, going as high as 40%. Furthermore, our qualitative analysis shows that our method allocates more steps to more informative text conditions and fewer steps to simpler text conditions",

This study explores an automated multi-modal image registration technique utilizing deep learning principles to align snapshot breast specimen images with corresponding histology images.

An unsupervised and supervised learning approach, based on the VoxelMorph model, was explored, making use of a dataset with manually registered images used as ground truth.

Thereby, the similarity of all segmentation tasks and the implicit relationship between them have not been utilized effectively. This paper presents a unified, simple, and effective model addressing all these tasks jointly. The model, named OneFormer3D, performs instance and semantic segmentation consistently, using a group of learnable kernels, where each kernel is responsible for generating a mask for either an instance or a semantic category. These kernels are trained with a transformer-based decoder with unified instance and semantic queries passed as an input. Such a design enables training a model end-to-end in a single run, so that it achieves top performance on all three segmentation tasks simultaneously. Specifically, our OneFormer3D ranks 1st and sets a new state-of-the-art (+2.1 mAP50) in the ScanNet test leaderboard.

While the existing well works primarily focus on minimizing the modal discrepancies, the modality information can not thoroughly be leveraged. To solve this problem, a Multi-scale Semantic Correlation Mining network (MSCMNet) is proposed to comprehensively exploit semantic features at multiple scales and simultaneously reduce modality information loss as small as possible in feature extraction. The proposed network contains three novel components. Firstly, after taking into account the effective utilization of modality information, the Multi-scale Information Correlation Mining Block (MIMB) is designed to explore semantic correlations across multiple scales. Secondly, in order to enrich the semantic information that MIMB can utilize, a quadruple-stream feature extractor (QFE) with non-shared parameters is specifically designed to extract information from different dimensions of the dataset. Finally, the Quadruple Center Triplet Loss (QCT) is further proposed to address the information discrepancy in the comprehensive features. Extensive experiments on the SYSU-MM01, RegDB, and LLCM datasets demonstrate that the proposed MSCMNet achieves the greatest accuracy",

In this paper, we propose a synchronized multi-frame diffusion framework to maintain both the visual details and the temporal consistency. Frames are denoised in a synchronous fashion, and more importantly, information of different frames is shared since the beginning of the denoising process. Such information sharing ensures that a consensus, in terms of the overall structure and color distribution, among frames can be reached in the early stage of the denoising process before it is too late. The optical flow from the original video serves as the connection, and hence the venue for information sharing, among frames.

In this work, we show that vision-language models can be used to alleviate the dependence on a large number of concept-annotated samples. In particular, we propose an embedding learning strategy to adapt CLIP to the downstream task of skin lesion classification using concept-based descriptions as textual embeddings.

In this paper, for the first time, we investigate how to search in a training-free manner with the help of teacher models and devise an effective Training-free ViT (TVT) search framework.

Additionally, TVT employs the L2-Norm of the student's weights as the student-capability metric to improve ranking consistency. Finally, TVT searches for the best ViT for distilling with ConvNet teachers via our teacher-aware metric and student-capability metric, resulting in impressive gains in efficiency and effectiveness.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "To apply the latest computer vision techniques that require a large computational cost in real industrial applications, knowledge distillation methods (KDs) are essential. Existing logit-based KDs apply the constant temperature scaling to all samples in dataset, limiting the utilization of knowledge inherent in each sample individually. In our approach, we classify the dataset into two categories (i.e., low energy and high energy samples) based on their energy score. Through experiments, we have confirmed that low energy samples exhibit high confidence scores, indicating certain predictions, while high energy samples yield low confidence scores, meaning uncertain predictions. To distill optimal knowledge by adjusting non-target class predictions, we apply a higher temperature to low energy samples to create smoother distributions and a lower temperature to high energy samples to achieve sharper distributions. When compared to previous logit-based and feature-based methods, our energy-based KD (Energy KD) achieves better performance on various datasets. Especially, Energy KD shows significant improvements on CIFAR-100-LT and ImageNet datasets, which contain many challenging samples. Furthermore, we propose high energy-based data augmentation (HE-DA) for further improving the performance. We demonstrate that meaningful performance improvement could be achieved by augmenting only 20-50% of dataset, suggesting that it can be employed on resource-limited devices. To the best of our knowledge, this paper represents the first attempt to make use of energy scores in KD and DA, and we believe it will greatly contribute to future research",

Although powerful deep learning models have achieved accurate estimation in this task, they require enormous memory and computational resources. Consequently, these methods can hardly be deployed on resource-limited edge devices. In this work, we propose a Binarized Dual Residual Network (BiDRN), a novel quantization method to estimate the 3D human body, face, and hands parameters efficiently. Specifically, we design a basic unit Binarized Dual Residual Block (BiDRB) composed of Local Convolution Residual (LCR) and Block Residual (BR), which can preserve full-precision information as much as possible. For LCR, we generalize it to four kinds of convolutional modules so that full-precision information can be propagated even between mismatched dimensions. We also binarize the face and hands box-prediction network as Binaried BoxNet, which can further reduce the model redundancy. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of BiDRN, which has a significant improvement over state-of-the-art binarization algorithms. Moreover, our proposed BiDRN achieves comparable performance with full-precision method Hand4Whole while using just 22.1% parameters and 14.8% operations.

    "title": "Stable Cluster Discrimination for Deep Clustering",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Deep clustering can optimize representations of instances (i.e., representation learning) and explore the inherent data distribution (i.e., clustering) simultaneously, which demonstrates a superior performance over conventional clustering methods with given features. However, the coupled objective implies a trivial solution that all instances collapse to the uniform features. To tackle the challenge, a two-stage training strategy is developed for decoupling, where it introduces an additional pre-training stage for representation learning and then fine-tunes the obtained model for clustering. Meanwhile, one-stage methods are developed mainly for representation learning rather than clustering, where various constraints for cluster assignments are designed to avoid collapsing explicitly. Despite the success of these methods, an appropriate learning objective tailored for deep clustering has not been investigated sufficiently. In this work, we first show that the prevalent discrimination task in supervised learning is unstable for one-stage clustering due to the lack of ground-truth labels and positive instances for certain clusters in each mini-batch. To mitigate the issue, a novel stable cluster discrimination (SeCu) task is proposed and a new hardness-aware clustering criterion can be obtained accordingly. Moreover, a global entropy constraint for cluster assignments is studied with efficient optimization. Extensive experiments are conducted on benchmark data sets and ImageNet. SeCu achieves state-of-the-art performance on all of them, which demonstrates the effectiveness of one-stage deep clustering. Code is available at \\url{https://github.com/idstcv/SeCu}",

    "abstract": "Previous logits-based Knowledge Distillation (KD) have utilized predictions about multiple categories within each sample (i.e., class predictions) and have employed Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to reduce the discrepancy between the student and teacher predictions. Despite the proliferation of KD techniques, the student model continues to fall short of achieving a similar level as teachers. In response, we introduce a novel and effective KD method capable of achieving results on par with or superior to the teacher models performance. We utilize teacher and student predictions about multiple samples for each category (i.e., batch predictions) and apply cosine similarity, a commonly used technique in Natural Language Processing (NLP) for measuring the resemblance between text embeddings. This metric's inherent scale-invariance property, which relies solely on vector direction and not magnitude, allows the student to dynamically learn from the teacher's knowledge, rather than being bound by a fixed distribution of the teacher's knowledge. Furthermore, we propose a method called cosine similarity weighted temperature (CSWT) to improve the performance. CSWT reduces the temperature scaling in KD when the cosine similarity between the student and teacher models is high, and conversely, it increases the temperature scaling when the cosine similarity is low. This adjustment optimizes the transfer of information from the teacher to the student model. Extensive experimental results show that our proposed method serves as a viable alternative to existing methods.

Additionally, the efficiency of generating videos in pixel space is quite low.In this paper, we propose a novel approach to address these challenges by disentangling the target RGB pixels into two distinct components: spatial content and temporal motions. Specifically, we predict temporal motions which include motion vector and residual based on a 3D-UNet diffusion model. By explicitly modeling temporal motions and warping them to the starting image, we improve the temporal consistency of generated videos. This results in a reduction of spatial redundancy, emphasizing temporal details.

In this paper, we introduce an information-enriched diffusion model for paragraph-to-image generation task, termed ParaDiffusion, which delves into the transference of the extensive semantic comprehension capabilities of large language models to the task of image generation. At its core is using a large language model (e.g., Llama V2) to encode long-form text, followed by fine-tuning with LORA to alignthe text-image feature spaces in the generation task. To facilitate the training of long-text semantic alignment, we also curated a high-quality paragraph-image pair dataset, namely ParaImage. This dataset contains a small amount of high-quality, meticulously annotated data, and a large-scale synthetic dataset with long text descriptions being generated using a vision-language model. Experiments demonstrate that ParaDiffusion outperforms state-of-the-art models (SD XL, DeepFloyd IF) on ViLG-300 and ParaPrompts, achieving up to 15% and 45% human voting rate improvements for visual appeal and text faithfulness, respectively.

However, extracting degradation information from low-resolution images is challenging, which limits the model performance. To boost image SR performance, one feasible approach is to introduce additional priors. Inspired by advancements in multi-modal methods and text prompt image processing, we introduce text prompts to image SR to provide degradation priors. Specifically, we first design a text-image generation pipeline to integrate text into SR dataset through the text degradation representation and degradation model. The text representation applies a discretization manner based on the binning method to describe the degradation abstractly. This representation method can also maintain the flexibility of language. Meanwhile, we propose the PromptSR to realize the text prompt SR. The PromptSR employs the diffusion model and the pre-trained language model (e.g., T5 and CLIP). We train the model on the generated text-image dataset. Extensive experiments indicate that introducing text prompts into image SR, yields excellent results on both synthetic and real-world images.

    "abstract": "Unsupervised cross-domain action recognition aims at adapting the model trained on an existing labeled source domain to a new unlabeled target domain. Most existing methods solve the task by directly aligning the feature distributions of source and target domains. However, this would cause negative transfer during domain adaptation due to some negative training samples in both domains. In the source domain, some training samples are of low-relevance to target domain due to the difference in viewpoints, action styles, etc. In the target domain, there are some ambiguous training samples that can be easily classified as another type of action under the case of source domain. The problem of negative transfer has been explored in cross-domain object detection, while it remains under-explored in cross-domain action recognition. Therefore, we propose a Multi-modal Instance Refinement (MMIR) method to alleviate the negative transfer based on reinforcement learning. Specifically, a reinforcement learning agent is trained in both domains for every modality to refine the training data by selecting out negative samples from each domain. Our method finally outperforms several other state-of-the-art baselines in cross-domain action recognition on the benchmark EPIC-Kitchens dataset, which demonstrates the advantage of MMIR in reducing negative transfer",

This paper presents an open-source solution using the Robot Operating System 2, specifically its open-source navigation stack, to address these challenges in autonomous Formula Student race cars. We compare off-the-shelf navigation libraries that this stack comprises of against traditional custom-made programs developed by QUT Motorsport to evaluate their applicability in autonomous racing scenarios and integrate them onto an autonomous race car. Our contributions include quantitative and qualitative comparisons of these packages against traditional navigation solutions, aiming to lower the entry barrier for autonomous racing. This paper also serves as a comprehensive tutorial for teams participating in similar racing disciplines and other autonomous mobile robot applications",

    "title": "Cooperative Dual Attention for Audio-Visual Speech Enhancement with Facial Cues",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In this work, we focus on leveraging facial cues beyond the lip region for robust Audio-Visual Speech Enhancement (AVSE). The facial region, encompassing the lip region, reflects additional speech-related attributes such as gender, skin color, nationality, etc., which contribute to the effectiveness of AVSE. However, static and dynamic speech-unrelated attributes also exist, causing appearance changes during speech. To address these challenges, we propose a Dual Attention Cooperative Framework, DualAVSE, to ignore speech-unrelated information, capture speech-related information with facial cues, and dynamically integrate it with the audio signal for AVSE. Specifically, we introduce a spatial attention-based visual encoder to capture and enhance visual speech information beyond the lip region, incorporating global facial context and automatically ignoring speech-unrelated information for robust visual feature extraction. Additionally, a dynamic visual feature fusion strategy is introduced by integrating a temporal-dimensional self-attention module, enabling the model to robustly handle facial variations. The acoustic noise in the speaking process is variable, impacting audio quality. Therefore, a dynamic fusion strategy for both audio and visual features is introduced to address this issue. By integrating cooperative dual attention in the visual encoder and audio-visual fusion strategy, our model effectively extracts beneficial speech information from both audio and visual cues for AVSE. Thorough analysis and comparison on different datasets, including normal and challenging cases with unreliable or absent visual information, consistently show our model outperforming existing methods across multiple metrics",

    "title": "CRISP: Hybrid Structured Sparsity for Class-aware Model Pruning",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Machine learning pipelines for classification tasks often train a universal model to achieve accuracy across a broad range of classes. However, a typical user encounters only a limited selection of classes regularly. This disparity provides an opportunity to enhance computational efficiency by tailoring models to focus on user-specific classes. Existing works rely on unstructured pruning, which introduces randomly distributed non-zero values in the model, making it unsuitable for hardware acceleration. Alternatively, some approaches employ structured pruning, such as channel pruning, but these tend to provide only minimal compression and may lead to reduced model accuracy. In this work, we propose CRISP, a novel pruning framework leveraging a hybrid structured sparsity pattern that combines both fine-grained N:M structured sparsity and coarse-grained block sparsity. Our pruning strategy is guided by a gradient-based class-aware saliency score, allowing us to retain weights crucial for user-specific classes. CRISP achieves high accuracy with minimal memory consumption for popular models like ResNet-50, VGG-16, and MobileNetV2 on ImageNet and CIFAR-100 datasets. Moreover, CRISP delivers up to 14$\\times$ reduction in latency and energy consumption compared to existing pruning methods while maintaining comparable accuracy.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Advancing event-driven vision through spiking neural networks (SNNs) is crucial to empowering high-speed and efficient perception. While directly converting the pre-trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) - by replacing the non-linear activation with spiking neurons - can provide SNNs with good performance, the resultant SNNs typically demand long timesteps and high energy consumption to achieve their optimal performance. To address this challenge, we introduce the burst-spike mechanism inspired by the biological nervous system, allowing multiple spikes per timestep to reduce conversion errors and produce low-latency SNNs. To further bolster this enhancement, we leverage the Pareto Frontier-driven algorithm to reallocate burst-firing patterns. Moreover, to reduce energy consumption during the conversion process, we propose a sensitivity-driven spike compression technique, which automatically locates the optimal threshold ratio according to layer-specific sensitivity. Extensive experiments demonstrate our approach outperforms state-of-the-art SNN methods, showcasing superior performance and reduced energy usage across classification and object detection.

The main idea of our approach is to explore the natural relationship between multi-view correspondences and the prompt mechanism of foundational models and build bridges on it. Our pipeline consists of two components: 1) a self-extension component that extends 2D groups from a single viewpoint to spatial global-level 3D groups; 2) a multi-modal labeling component that introduces a two-dimensional checking mechanism to vote each 2D predicted bounding box to the best matching 3D part, and a Class Non-highest Vote Penalty function to refine the Vote Matrix. Additionally, a merging algorithm is included to merge part-level 3D groups. Extensive evaluation of three zero-shot segmentation tasks on PartnetE datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results with significant improvements (+19.6%, +5.2% and +4.9%, respectively) over existing methods.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In the domain of 3D Human Pose Estimation, which finds widespread daily applications, the requirement for convenient acquisition equipment continues to grow. To satisfy this demand, we set our sights on a short-baseline binocular setting that offers both portability and a geometric measurement property that radically mitigates depth ambiguity. However, as the binocular baseline shortens, two serious challenges emerge: first, the robustness of 3D reconstruction against 2D errors deteriorates; and second, occlusion reoccurs due to the limited visual differences between two views. To address the first challenge, we propose the Stereo Co-Keypoints Estimation module to improve the view consistency of 2D keypoints and enhance the 3D robustness. In this module, the disparity is utilized to represent the correspondence of binocular 2D points and the Stereo Volume Feature is introduced to contain binocular features across different disparities. Through the regression of SVF, two-view 2D keypoints are simultaneously estimated in a collaborative way which restricts their view consistency. Furthermore, to deal with occlusions, a Pre-trained Pose Transformer module is introduced. Through this module, 3D poses are refined by perceiving pose coherence, a representation of joint correlations. This perception is injected by the Pose Transformer network and learned through a pre-training task that recovers iterative masked joints. Comprehensive experiments carried out on H36M and MHAD datasets, complemented by visualizations, validate the effectiveness of our approach in the short-baseline binocular 3D Human Pose Estimation and occlusion handling",

    "title": "SafeSea: Synthetic Data Generation for Adverse & Low Probability Maritime Conditions",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "High-quality training data is essential for enhancing the robustness of object detection models. Within the maritime domain, obtaining a diverse real image dataset is particularly challenging due to the difficulty of capturing sea images with the presence of maritime objects , especially in stormy conditions. These challenges arise due to resource limitations, in addition to the unpredictable appearance of maritime objects. Nevertheless, acquiring data from stormy conditions is essential for training effective maritime detection models, particularly for search and rescue, where real-world conditions can be unpredictable. In this work, we introduce SafeSea, which is a stepping stone towards transforming actual sea images with various Sea State backgrounds while retaining maritime objects. Compared to existing generative methods such as Stable Diffusion Inpainting~\\cite{stableDiffusion}, this approach reduces the time and effort required to create synthetic datasets for training maritime object detection models. The proposed method uses two automated filters to only pass generated images that meet the criteria. In particular, these filters will first classify the sea condition according to its Sea State level and then it will check whether the objects from the input image are still preserved. This method enabled the creation of the SafeSea dataset, offering diverse weather condition backgrounds to supplement the training of maritime models. Lastly, we observed that a maritime object detection model faced challenges in detecting objects in stormy sea backgrounds, emphasizing the impact of weather conditions on detection accuracy.

    "abstract": "The high capacity of deep learning models to learn complex patterns poses a significant challenge when confronted with label noise. The inability to differentiate clean and noisy labels ultimately results in poor generalization. We approach this problem by reassigning the label for each image using a new teacher-student based framework termed P-LC (pseudo-label correction). Traditional teacher-student networks are composed of teacher and student classifiers for knowledge distillation. In our novel approach, we reconfigure the teacher network into a triple encoder, leveraging the triplet loss to establish a pseudo-label correction system. As the student generates pseudo labels for a set of given images, the teacher learns to choose between the initially assigned labels and the pseudo labels. Experiments on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and SVHN demonstrate P-LC's superior performance over existing state-of-the-art methods across all noise levels, most notably in high noise. In addition, we introduce a noise level estimation to help assess model performance and inform the need for additional data cleaning procedures",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The novel 2019 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) global pandemic is a defining health crisis. Recent efforts have been increasingly directed towards achieving quick and accurate detection of COVID-19 across symptomatic patients to mitigate the intensity and spread of the disease. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms applied to chest X-ray (CXR) images have emerged as promising diagnostic tools, and previous work has demonstrated impressive classification performances. However, such methods have faced criticisms from physicians due to their black-box reasoning process and unpredictable nature. In contrast to professional radiologist diagnosis, AI systems often lack generalizability, explainability, and robustness in the clinical decision making process. In our work, we address these issues by first proposing an extensive baseline study, training and evaluating 21 convolutional neural network (CNN) models on a diverse set of 33,000+ CXR images to classify between healthy, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 pneumonia CXRs. Our resulting models achieved a 3-way classification accuracy, recall, and precision of up to 97.03\\%, 97.97\\%, and 99.95\\%, respectively. Next, we investigate the effectiveness of adversarial training on model robustness and explainability via Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) heatmaps. We find that adversarially trained models not only significantly outperform their standard counterparts on classifying perturbed images, but also yield saliency maps that 1) better specify clinically relevant features, 2) are robust against extraneous artifacts, and 3) agree considerably more with expert radiologist findings",

Moreover, compression-based IMD approaches face difficulties in cases of double compression of identical quality factors. To investigate the State-of-The-Art (SoTA) IMD methods in those challenging conditions, we introduce a new Challenging Image Manipulation Detection (CIMD) benchmark dataset, which consists of two subsets, for evaluating editing-based and compression-based IMD methods, respectively. The dataset images were manually taken and tampered with high-quality annotations. In addition, we propose a new two-branch network model based on HRNet that can better detect both the image-editing and compression artifacts in those challenging conditions.

    "abstract": "Explicit feature-grid based NeRF models have shown promising results in terms of rendering quality and significant speed-up in training. However, these methods often require a significant amount of data to represent a single scene or object. In this work, we present a compression model that aims to minimize the entropy in the frequency domain in order to effectively reduce the data size. First, we propose using the discrete cosine transform (DCT) on the tensorial radiance fields to compress the feature-grid. This feature-grid is transformed into coefficients, which are then quantized and entropy encoded, following a similar approach to the traditional video coding pipeline. Furthermore, to achieve a higher level of sparsity, we propose using an entropy parameterization technique for the frequency domain, specifically for DCT coefficients of the feature-grid. Since the transformed coefficients are optimized during the training phase, the proposed model does not require any fine-tuning or additional information. Our model only requires a lightweight compression pipeline for encoding and decoding, making it easier to apply volumetric radiance field methods for real-world applications. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed frequency domain entropy model can achieve superior compression performance across various datasets.

    "abstract": "Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI) is a common and challenging condition to diagnose accurately. Timely and precise diagnosis is essential for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes. Traditional diagnostic methods for mTBI often have limitations in terms of accuracy and sensitivity. In this study, we introduce an innovative approach to enhance mTBI diagnosis using 3D Computed Tomography (CT) images and a metric learning technique trained with triplet loss. To address these challenges, we propose a Residual Triplet Convolutional Neural Network (RTCNN) model to distinguish between mTBI cases and healthy ones by embedding 3D CT scans into a feature space. The triplet loss function maximizes the margin between similar and dissimilar image pairs, optimizing feature representations. This facilitates better context placement of individual cases, aids informed decision-making, and has the potential to improve patient outcomes. Our RTCNN model shows promising performance in mTBI diagnosis, achieving an average accuracy of 94.3%, a sensitivity of 94.1%, and a specificity of 95.2%, as confirmed through a five-fold cross-validation. Importantly, when compared to the conventional Residual Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN) model, the RTCNN exhibits a significant improvement, showcasing a remarkable 22.5% increase in specificity, a notable 16.2% boost in accuracy, and an 11.3% enhancement in sensitivity. Moreover, RTCNN requires lower memory resources, making it not only highly effective but also resource-efficient in minimizing false positives while maximizing its diagnostic accuracy in distinguishing normal CT scans from mTBI cases. The quantitative performance metrics provided and utilization of occlusion sensitivity maps to visually explain the model's decision-making process further enhance the interpretability and transparency of our approach",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Reconstructing hand-held objects from a single RGB image without known 3D object templates, category prior, or depth information is a vital yet challenging problem in computer vision. In contrast to prior works that utilize deterministic modeling paradigms, which make it hard to account for the uncertainties introduced by hand- and self-occlusion, we employ a probabilistic point cloud denoising diffusion model to tackle the above challenge. In this work, we present Hand-Aware Conditional Diffusion for monocular hand-held object reconstruction (HACD), modeling the hand-object interaction in two aspects. First, we introduce hand-aware conditioning to model hand-object interaction from both semantic and geometric perspectives. Specifically, a unified hand-object semantic embedding compensates for the 2D local feature deficiency induced by hand occlusion, and a hand articulation embedding further encodes the relationship between object vertices and hand joints. Second, we propose a hand-constrained centroid fixing scheme, which utilizes hand vertices priors to restrict the centroid deviation of partially denoised point cloud during diffusion and reverse process. Removing the centroid bias interference allows the diffusion models to focus on the reconstruction of shape, thus enhancing the stability and precision of local feature projection.

    "abstract": "In the era of big data in scientific research, there is a necessity to leverage techniques which reduce human effort in labeling and categorizing large datasets by involving sophisticated machine tools. To combat this problem, we present a novel, general purpose model for 3D segmentation that leverages patch-wise adversariality and Long Short-Term Memory to encode sequential information. Using this model alongside citizen science projects which use 3D datasets (image cubes) on the Zooniverse platforms, we propose an iterative human-machine optimization framework where only a fraction of the 2D slices from these cubes are seen by the volunteers. We leverage the patch-wise discriminator in our model to provide an estimate of which slices within these image cubes have poorly generalized feature representations, and correspondingly poor machine performance. These images with corresponding machine proposals would be presented to volunteers on Zooniverse for correction, leading to a drastic reduction in the volunteer effort on citizen science projects. We trained our model on ~2300 liver tissue 3D electron micrographs. Lipid droplets were segmented within these images through human annotation via the `Etch A Cell - Fat Checker' citizen science project, hosted on the Zooniverse platform. In this work, we demonstrate this framework and the selection methodology which resulted in a measured reduction in volunteer effort by more than 60%.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Human eye gaze estimation is an important cognitive ingredient for successful human-robot interaction, enabling the robot to read and predict human behavior. We approach this problem using artificial neural networks and build a modular system estimating gaze from separately cropped eyes, taking advantage of existing well-functioning components for face detection (RetinaFace) and head pose estimation (6DRepNet). Our proposed method does not require any special hardware or infrared filters but uses a standard notebook-builtin RGB camera, as often approached with appearance-based methods. Using the MetaHuman tool, we also generated a large synthetic dataset of more than 57,000 human faces and made it publicly available. The inclusion of this dataset (with eye gaze and head pose information) on top of the standard Columbia Gaze dataset into training the model led to better accuracy with a mean average error below two degrees in eye pitch and yaw directions, which compares favourably to related methods. We also verified the feasibility of our model by its preliminary testing in real-world setting using the builtin 4K camera in NICO semi-humanoid robot's eye",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "We present GigaPose, a fast, robust, and accurate method for CAD-based novel object pose estimation in RGB images. GigaPose first leverages discriminative templates, rendered images of the CAD models, to recover the out-of-plane rotation and then uses patch correspondences to estimate the four remaining parameters. Our approach samples templates in only a two-degrees-of-freedom space instead of the usual three and matches the input image to the templates using fast nearest neighbor search in feature space, results in a speedup factor of 38x compared to the state of the art. Moreover, GigaPose is significantly more robust to segmentation errors. Our extensive evaluation on the seven core datasets of the BOP challenge demonstrates that it achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and can be seamlessly integrated with a refinement method. Additionally, we show the potential of GigaPose with 3D models predicted by recent work on 3D reconstruction from a single image, relaxing the need for CAD models and making 6D pose object estimation much more convenient.

We demonstrate the capabilities of our TCuP-GAN on the data from four segmentation challenges (Adult Glioma, Meningioma, Pediatric Tumors, and Sub-Saharan Africa subset) featured within the 2023 Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) Challenge and quantify its performance using LesionWise Dice similarity and $95\\%$ Hausdorff Distance metrics. We demonstrate the successful learning of our framework to predict robust multi-class segmentation masks across all the challenges.

    "abstract": "Domain adaptive active learning is leading the charge in label-efficient training of neural networks. For semantic segmentation, state-of-the-art models jointly use two criteria of uncertainty and diversity to select training labels, combined with a pixel-wise acquisition strategy. However, we show that such methods currently suffer from a class imbalance issue which degrades their performance for larger active learning budgets. We then introduce Class Balanced Dynamic Acquisition (CBDA), a novel active learning method that mitigates this issue, especially in high-budget regimes. The more balanced labels increase minority class performance, which in turn allows the model to outperform the previous baseline by 0.6, 1.7, and 2.4 mIoU for budgets of 5%, 10%, and 20%, respectively. Additionally, the focus on minority classes leads to improvements of the minimum class performance of 0.5, 2.9, and 4.6 IoU respectively. The top-performing model even exceeds the fully supervised baseline, showing that a more balanced label than the entire ground truth can be beneficial",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Though diffusion models excel in image generation, their step-by-step denoising leads to slow generation speeds. Consistency training addresses this issue with single-step sampling but often produces lower-quality generations and requires high training costs. In this paper, we show that optimizing consistency training loss minimizes the Wasserstein distance between target and generated distributions. As timestep increases, the upper bound accumulates previous consistency training losses. Therefore, larger batch sizes are needed to reduce both current and accumulated losses. We propose Adversarial Consistency Training (ACT), which directly minimizes the Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence between distributions at each timestep using a discriminator. Theoretically, ACT enhances generation quality, and convergence. By incorporating a discriminator into the consistency training framework, our method achieves improved FID scores on CIFAR10 and ImageNet 64$\\times$64, retains zero-shot image inpainting capabilities, and uses less than $1/6$ of the original batch size and fewer than $1/2$ of the model parameters and training steps compared to the baseline method, this leads to a substantial reduction in resource consumption",

    "abstract": "Accounting for the increased concern for public safety, automatic abnormal event detection and recognition in a surveillance scene is crucial. It is a current open study subject because of its intricacy and utility. The identification of aberrant events automatically, it's a difficult undertaking because everyone's idea of abnormality is different. A typical occurrence in one circumstance could be seen as aberrant in another. Automatic anomaly identification becomes particularly challenging in the surveillance footage with a large crowd due to congestion and high occlusion. With the use of machine learning techniques, this thesis study aims to offer the solution for this use case so that human resources won't be required to keep an eye out for any unusual activity in the surveillance system records. We have developed a novel generative adversarial network (GAN) based anomaly detection model. This model is trained such that it learns together about constructing a high dimensional picture space and determining the latent space from the video's context. The generator uses a residual Autoencoder architecture made up of a multi-stage channel attention-based decoder and a two-stream, deep convolutional encoder that can realise both spatial and temporal data. We have also offered a technique for refining the GAN model that reduces training time while also generalising the model by utilising transfer learning between datasets. Using a variety of assessment measures, we compare our model to the current state-of-the-art techniques on four benchmark datasets. The empirical findings indicate that, in comparison to existing techniques, our network performs favourably on all datasets",

    "abstract": "Class-wise characteristics of training examples affect the performance of deep classifiers. A well-studied example is when the number of training examples of classes follows a long-tailed distribution, a situation that is likely to yield sub-optimal performance for under-represented classes. This class imbalance problem is conventionally addressed by approaches relying on the class-wise cardinality of training examples, such as data resampling. In this paper, we demonstrate that considering solely the cardinality of classes does not cover all issues causing class imbalance. To measure class imbalance, we propose \"Class Uncertainty\" as the average predictive uncertainty of the training examples, and we show that this novel measure captures the differences across classes better than cardinality. We also curate SVCI-20 as a novel dataset in which the classes have equal number of training examples but they differ in terms of their hardness; thereby causing a type of class imbalance which cannot be addressed by the approaches relying on cardinality. We incorporate our \"Class Uncertainty\" measure into a diverse set of ten class imbalance mitigation methods to demonstrate its effectiveness on long-tailed datasets as well as on our SVCI-20.

    "title": "AI-Generated Images Introduce Invisible Relevance Bias to Text-Image Retrieval",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "With the advancement of generation models, AI-generated content (AIGC) is becoming more realistic, flooding the Internet. A recent study suggests that this phenomenon has elevated the issue of source bias in text retrieval for web searches. Specifically, neural retrieval models tend to rank generated texts higher than human-written texts. In this paper, we extend the study of this bias to cross-modal retrieval. Firstly, we successfully construct a suitable benchmark to explore the existence of the bias. Subsequent extensive experiments on this benchmark reveal that AI-generated images introduce an invisible relevance bias to text-image retrieval models. Specifically, our experiments show that text-image retrieval models tend to rank the AI-generated images higher than the real images, even though the AI-generated images do not exhibit more visually relevant features to the query than real images. This invisible relevance bias is prevalent across retrieval models with varying training data and architectures. Furthermore, our subsequent exploration reveals that the inclusion of AI-generated images in the training data of the retrieval models exacerbates the invisible relevance bias. The above phenomenon triggers a vicious cycle, which makes the invisible relevance bias become more and more serious. To elucidate the potential causes of invisible relevance and address the aforementioned issues, we introduce an effective training method aimed at alleviating the invisible relevance bias. Subsequently, we apply our proposed debiasing method to retroactively identify the causes of invisible relevance, revealing that the AI-generated images induce the image encoder to embed additional information into their representation. This information exhibits a certain consistency across generated images with different semantics and can make the retriever estimate a higher relevance score",

    "title": "SinSR: Diffusion-Based Image Super-Resolution in a Single Step",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "While super-resolution (SR) methods based on diffusion models exhibit promising results, their practical application is hindered by the substantial number of required inference steps. Recent methods utilize degraded images in the initial state, thereby shortening the Markov chain. Nevertheless, these solutions either rely on a precise formulation of the degradation process or still necessitate a relatively lengthy generation path (e.g., 15 iterations). To enhance inference speed, we propose a simple yet effective method for achieving single-step SR generation, named SinSR. Specifically, we first derive a deterministic sampling process from the most recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) method for accelerating diffusion-based SR. This allows the mapping between the input random noise and the generated high-resolution image to be obtained in a reduced and acceptable number of inference steps during training. We show that this deterministic mapping can be distilled into a student model that performs SR within only one inference step. Additionally, we propose a novel consistency-preserving loss to simultaneously leverage the ground-truth image during the distillation process, ensuring that the performance of the student model is not solely bound by the feature manifold of the teacher model, resulting in further performance improvement. Extensive experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve comparable or even superior performance compared to both previous SOTA methods and the teacher model, in just one sampling step, resulting in a remarkable up to x10 speedup for inference.

    "abstract": "With the rapidly increasing demand for oriented object detection (OOD), recent research involving weakly-supervised detectors for learning rotated box (RBox) from the horizontal box (HBox) has attracted more and more attention. In this paper, we explore a more challenging yet label-efficient setting, namely single point-supervised OOD, and present our approach called Point2RBox. Specifically, we propose to leverage two principles: 1) Synthetic pattern knowledge combination: By sampling around each labelled point on the image, we transfer the object feature to synthetic visual patterns with the known bounding box to provide the knowledge for box regression. 2) Transform self-supervision: With a transformed input image (e.g. scaled/rotated), the output RBoxes are trained to follow the same transformation so that the network can perceive the relative size/rotation between objects. The detector is further enhanced by a few devised techniques to cope with peripheral issues, e.g. the anchor/layer assignment as the size of the object is not available in our point supervision setting. To our best knowledge, Point2RBox is the first end-to-end solution for point-supervised OOD. In particular, our method uses a lightweight paradigm, yet it achieves a competitive performance among point-supervised alternatives, 41.05%/27.62%/80.01% on DOTA/DIOR/HRSC datasets",

    "abstract": "Single point-supervised object detection is gaining attention due to its cost-effectiveness. However, existing approaches focus on generating horizontal bounding boxes (HBBs) while ignoring oriented bounding boxes (OBBs) commonly used for objects in aerial images. This paper proposes PointOBB, the first single Point-based OBB generation method, for oriented object detection. PointOBB operates through the collaborative utilization of three distinctive views: an original view, a resized view, and a rotated/flipped (rot/flp) view. Upon the original view, we leverage the resized and rot/flp views to build a scale augmentation module and an angle acquisition module, respectively. In the former module, a Scale-Sensitive Consistency (SSC) loss is designed to enhance the deep network's ability to perceive the object scale. For accurate object angle predictions, the latter module incorporates self-supervised learning to predict angles, which is associated with a scale-guided Dense-to-Sparse (DS) matching strategy for aggregating dense angles corresponding to sparse objects. The resized and rot/flp views are switched using a progressive multi-view switching strategy during training to achieve coupled optimization of scale and angle. Experimental results on the DIOR-R and DOTA-v1.0 datasets demonstrate that PointOBB achieves promising performance, and significantly outperforms potential point-supervised baselines",

    "abstract": "Object categories are typically organized into a multi-granularity taxonomic hierarchy. When classifying categories at different hierarchy levels, traditional uni-modal approaches focus primarily on image features, revealing limitations in complex scenarios. Recent studies integrating Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with class hierarchies have shown promise, yet they fall short of fully exploiting the hierarchical relationships. These efforts are constrained by their inability to perform effectively across varied granularity of categories. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel framework (HGCLIP) that effectively combines CLIP with a deeper exploitation of the Hierarchical class structure via Graph representation learning. We explore constructing the class hierarchy into a graph, with its nodes representing the textual or image features of each category. After passing through a graph encoder, the textual features incorporate hierarchical structure information, while the image features emphasize class-aware features derived from prototypes through the attention mechanism.

We then evaluate and analyse the extent to which the current VSR models generalize to the new test data. We evaluate a broad range of publicly available VSR models and find significant drops in performance on our test set, compared to their corresponding LRS3 results. Our results suggest that the increase in word error rates is caused by the models inability to generalize to slightly harder and in the wild lip sequences than those found in the LRS3 test set.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In recent years, a variety of deep learning networks for cardiac MRI (CMR) segmentation have been developed and analyzed. However, nearly all of them are focused on cine CMR under breathold. In this work, accuracy of deep learning methods is assessed for volumetric analysis (via segmentation) of the left ventricle in real-time free-breathing CMR at rest and under exercise stress. Data from healthy volunteers (n=15) for cine and real-time free-breathing CMR were analyzed retrospectively. Segmentations of a commercial software (comDL) and a freely available neural network (nnU-Net), were compared to a reference created via the manual correction of comDL segmentation. Segmentation of left ventricular endocardium (LV), left ventricular myocardium (MYO), and right ventricle (RV) is evaluated for both end-systolic and end-diastolic phases and analyzed with Dice's coefficient (DC). The volumetric analysis includes LV end-diastolic volume (EDV), LV end-systolic volume (ESV), and LV ejection fraction (EF). For cine CMR, nnU-Net and comDL achieve a DC above 0.95 for LV and 0.9 for MYO, and RV. For real-time CMR, the accuracy of nnU-Net exceeds that of comDL overall. For real-time CMR at rest, nnU-Net achieves a DC of 0.94 for LV, 0.89 for MYO, and 0.90 for RV; mean absolute differences between nnU-Net and reference are 2.9mL for EDV, 3.5mL for ESV and 2.6% for EF. For real-time CMR under exercise stress, nnU-Net achieves a DC of 0.92 for LV, 0.85 for MYO, and 0.83 for RV; mean absolute differences between nnU-Net and reference are 11.4mL for EDV, 2.9mL for ESV and 3.6% for EF. Deep learning methods designed or trained for cine CMR segmentation can perform well on real-time CMR. For real-time free-breathing CMR at rest, the performance of deep learning methods is comparable to inter-observer variability in cine CMR and is usable or fully automatic segmentation",

We demonstrate that CLIP is vulnerable to change in image quality under compression. This surprising result is further analysed using an attribution method-Integrated Gradients. Using this attribution method, we are able to better understand both quantitatively and qualitatively exactly the nature in which the compression affects the zero-shot recognition accuracy of this model. We evaluate this extensively on CIFAR-10 and STL-10. Our work provides the basis to understand this vulnerability of CLIP and can help us develop more effective methods to improve the robustness of CLIP and other vision-language models",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Diffusion models are powerful generative models that achieve state-of-the-art performance in tasks such as image synthesis. However, training them demands substantial amounts of data and computational resources. Continual learning would allow for incrementally learning new tasks and accumulating knowledge, thus reusing already trained models would be possible. One potentially suitable approach is generative replay, where a copy of a generative model trained on previous tasks produces synthetic data that are interleaved with data from the current task. However, standard generative replay applied to diffusion models results in a catastrophic loss in denoising capabilities. In this paper, we propose generative distillation, an approach that distils the entire reverse process of a diffusion model. We demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the continual learning performance of generative replay with only a moderate increase in the computational costs",

    "title": "Creating and Benchmarking a Synthetic Dataset for Cloud Optical Thickness Estimation",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Cloud formations often obscure optical satellite-based monitoring of the Earth's surface, thus limiting Earth observation (EO) activities such as land cover mapping, ocean color analysis, and cropland monitoring. The integration of machine learning (ML) methods within the remote sensing domain has significantly improved performance on a wide range of EO tasks, including cloud detection and filtering, but there is still much room for improvement. A key bottleneck is that ML methods typically depend on large amounts of annotated data for training, which is often difficult to come by in EO contexts. This is especially true for the task of cloud optical thickness (COT) estimation. A reliable estimation of COT enables more fine-grained and application-dependent control compared to using pre-specified cloud categories, as is commonly done in practice. To alleviate the COT data scarcity problem, in this work we propose a novel synthetic dataset for COT estimation, where top-of-atmosphere radiances have been simulated for 12 of the spectral bands of the Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) sensor onboard Sentinel-2 platforms. These data points have been simulated under consideration of different cloud types, COTs, and ground surface and atmospheric profiles. Extensive experimentation of training several ML models to predict COT from the measured reflectivity of the spectral bands demonstrates the usefulness of our proposed dataset. Generalization to real data is also demonstrated on two satellite image datasets -- one that is publicly available, and one which we have collected and annotated. The synthetic data, the newly collected real dataset, code and models have been made publicly available at https://github.com/aleksispi/ml-cloud-opt-thick",

    "abstract": "Despite significant recent advances in similarity detection tasks, existing approaches pose substantial challenges under memory constraints. One of the primary reasons for this is the use of computationally expensive metric learning loss functions such as Triplet Loss in Siamese networks. In this paper, we present a novel loss function called Shadow Loss that compresses the dimensions of an embedding space during loss calculation without loss of performance. The distance between the projections of the embeddings is learned from inputs on a compact projection space where distances directly correspond to a measure of class similarity. Projecting on a lower-dimension projection space, our loss function converges faster, and the resulting classified image clusters have higher inter-class and smaller intra-class distances. Shadow Loss not only reduces embedding dimensions favoring memory constraint devices but also consistently performs better than the state-of-the-art Triplet Margin Loss by an accuracy of 5\\%-10\\% across diverse datasets. The proposed loss function is also model agnostic, upholding its performance across several tested models. Its effectiveness and robustness across balanced, imbalanced, medical, and non-medical image datasets suggests that it is not specific to a particular model or dataset but demonstrates superior performance consistently while using less memory and computation",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Detailed population maps play an important role in diverse fields ranging from humanitarian action to urban planning. Generating such maps in a timely and scalable manner presents a challenge, especially in data-scarce regions. To address it we have developed POPCORN, a population mapping method whose only inputs are free, globally available satellite images from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2; and a small number of aggregate population counts over coarse census districts for calibration. Despite the minimal data requirements our approach surpasses the mapping accuracy of existing schemes, including several that rely on building footprints derived from high-resolution imagery. E.g., we were able to produce population maps for Rwanda with 100m GSD based on less than 400 regional census counts. In Kigali, those maps reach an $R^2$ score of 66% w.r.t. a ground truth reference map, with an average error of only $\\pm$10 inhabitants/ha. Conveniently, POPCORN retrieves explicit maps of built-up areas and of local building occupancy rates, making the mapping process interpretable and offering additional insights, for instance about the distribution of built-up, but unpopulated areas, e.g., industrial warehouses. Moreover, we find that, once trained, the model can be applied repeatedly to track population changes; and that it can be transferred to geographically similar regions, e.g., from Uganda to Rwanda). With our work we aim to democratize access to up-to-date and high-resolution population maps, recognizing that some regions faced with particularly strong population dynamics may lack the resources for costly micro-census campaigns",

    "abstract": "Segmentation of three-dimensional (3D) point clouds is an important task for autonomous systems. However, success of segmentation algorithms depends greatly on the quality of the underlying point clouds (resolution, completeness etc.). In particular, incomplete point clouds might reduce a downstream model's performance. GRNet is proposed as a novel and recent deep learning solution to complete point clouds, but it is not capable of part segmentation. On the other hand, our proposed solution, GRJointNet, is an architecture that can perform joint completion and segmentation on point clouds as a successor of GRNet. Features extracted for the two tasks are also utilized by each other to increase the overall performance. We evaluated our proposed network on the ShapeNet-Part dataset and compared its performance to GRNet. Our results demonstrate GRJointNet can outperform GRNet on point completion. It should also be noted that GRNet is not capable of segmentation while GRJointNet is. This study1, therefore, holds a promise to enhance practicality and utility of point clouds in 3D vision for autonomous systems",

    "abstract": "Information Extraction (IE) from document images is challenging due to the high variability of layout formats. Deep models such as LayoutLM and BROS have been proposed to address this problem and have shown promising results. However, they still require a large amount of field-level annotations for training these models. Other approaches using rule-based methods have also been proposed based on the understanding of the layout and semantics of a form such as geometric position, or type of the fields, etc. In this work, we propose a novel approach, EIGEN (Expert-Informed Joint Learning aGgrEatioN), which combines rule-based methods with deep learning models using data programming approaches to circumvent the requirement of annotation of large amounts of training data. Specifically, EIGEN consolidates weak labels induced from multiple heuristics through generative models and use them along with a small number of annotated labels to jointly train a deep model. In our framework, we propose the use of labeling functions that include incorporating contextual information thus capturing the visual and language context of a word for accurate categorization. We empirically show that our EIGEN framework can significantly improve the performance of state-of-the-art deep models with the availability of very few labeled data instances.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Low-latency instance segmentation of LiDAR point clouds is crucial in real-world applications because it serves as an initial and frequently-used building block in a robot's perception pipeline, where every task adds further delay. Particularly in dynamic environments, this total delay can result in significant positional offsets of dynamic objects, as seen in highway scenarios. To address this issue, we employ continuous clustering of obstacle points in order to obtain an instance-segmented point cloud. Unlike most existing approaches, which use a full revolution of the LiDAR sensor, we process the data stream in a continuous and seamless fashion. More specifically, each column of a range image is processed as soon it is available. Obstacle points are clustered to existing instances in real-time and it is checked at a high-frequency which instances are completed and are ready to be published. An additional advantage is that no problematic discontinuities between the points of the start and the end of a scan are observed. In this work we describe the two-layered data structure and the corresponding algorithm for continuous clustering, which is able to cluster the incoming data in real time. We explain the importance of a large perceptive field of view. Furthermore, we describe and evaluate important architectural design choices, which could be relevant to design an architecture for deep learning based low-latency instance segmentation.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Purpose: To develop and assess a deep learning (DL) pipeline to learn dynamic MR image reconstruction from publicly available natural videos (Inter4K). Materials and Methods: Learning was performed for a range of DL architectures (VarNet, 3D UNet, FastDVDNet) and corresponding sampling patterns (Cartesian, radial, spiral) either from true multi-coil cardiac MR data (N=692) or from pseudo-MR data simulated from Inter4K natural videos (N=692). Real-time undersampled dynamic MR images were reconstructed using DL networks trained with cardiac data and natural videos, and compressed sensing (CS). Differences were assessed in simulations (N=104 datasets) in terms of MSE, PSNR, and SSIM and prospectively for cardiac (short axis, four chambers, N=20) and speech (N=10) data in terms of subjective image quality ranking, SNR and Edge sharpness. Friedman Chi Square tests with post-hoc Nemenyi analysis were performed to assess statistical significance. Results: For all simulation metrics, DL networks trained with cardiac data outperformed DL networks trained with natural videos, which outperformed CS (p<0.05). However, in prospective experiments DL reconstructions using both training datasets were ranked similarly (and higher than CS) and presented no statistical differences in SNR and Edge Sharpness for most conditions. Additionally, high SSIM was measured between the DL methods with cardiac data and natural videos (SSIM>0.85). Conclusion: The developed pipeline enabled learning dynamic MR reconstruction from natural videos preserving DL reconstruction advantages such as high quality fast and ultra-fast reconstructions while overcoming some limitations (data scarcity or sharing). The natural video dataset, code and pre-trained networks are made readily available on github. Key Words: real-time; dynamic MRI; deep learning; image reconstruction; machine learning;",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The task of out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for deploying machine learning models in real-world settings. In this paper, we observe that the singular value distributions of the in-distribution (ID) and OOD features are quite different: the OOD feature matrix tends to have a larger dominant singular value than the ID feature, and the class predictions of OOD samples are largely determined by it. This observation motivates us to propose \\texttt{RankFeat}, a simple yet effective \\emph{post hoc} approach for OOD detection by removing the rank-1 matrix composed of the largest singular value and the associated singular vectors from the high-level feature. \\texttt{RankFeat} achieves \\emph{state-of-the-art} performance and reduces the average false positive rate (FPR95) by 17.90\\% compared with the previous best method. The success of \\texttt{RankFeat} motivates us to investigate whether a similar phenomenon would exist in the parameter matrices of neural networks. We thus propose \\texttt{RankWeight} which removes the rank-1 weight from the parameter matrices of a single deep layer. Our \\texttt{RankWeight}is also \\emph{post hoc} and only requires computing the rank-1 matrix once. As a standalone approach, \\texttt{RankWeight} has very competitive performance against other methods across various backbones. Moreover, \\texttt{RankWeight} enjoys flexible compatibility with a wide range of OOD detection methods. The combination of \\texttt{RankWeight} and \\texttt{RankFeat} refreshes the new \\emph{state-of-the-art} performance, achieving the FPR95 as low as 16.13\\% on the ImageNet-1k benchmark.

However, these methods often suffer from performance degradation when confronted with high-order tensor data exhibiting non-smooth changes, commonly observed in real-world scenarios but ignored by the traditional t-SVD-based methods. Our objective in this study is to provide an effective tensor recovery technique for handling non-smooth changes in tensor data and efficiently explore the correlations of high-order tensor data across its various dimensions without introducing numerous variables and weights. To this end, we introduce a new tensor decomposition and a new tensor norm called the Tensor $U_1$ norm. We utilize these novel techniques in solving the problem of high-order tensor completion problem and provide theoretical guarantees for the exact recovery of the resulting tensor completion models. An optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the resulting tensor completion model iteratively by combining the proximal algorithm with the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers. Theoretical analysis showed the convergence of the algorithm to the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point of the optimization problem. Numerical experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method in high-order tensor completion, especially for tensor data with non-smooth changes",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The improvement in the performance of efficient and lightweight models (i.e., the student model) is achieved through knowledge distillation (KD), which involves transferring knowledge from more complex models (i.e., the teacher model). However, most existing KD techniques rely on Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, which has certain limitations. First, if the teacher distribution has high entropy, the KL divergence's mode-averaging nature hinders the transfer of sufficient target information. Second, when the teacher distribution has low entropy, the KL divergence tends to excessively focus on specific modes, which fails to convey an abundant amount of valuable knowledge to the student. Consequently, when dealing with datasets that contain numerous confounding or challenging samples, student models may struggle to acquire sufficient knowledge, resulting in subpar performance. Furthermore, in previous KD approaches, we observed that data augmentation, a technique aimed at enhancing a model's generalization, can have an adverse impact. Therefore, we propose a Robustness-Reinforced Knowledge Distillation (R2KD) that leverages correlation distance and network pruning. This approach enables KD to effectively incorporate data augmentation for performance improvement.

    "abstract": "Source-free object detection (SFOD) aims to adapt the source detector to unlabeled target domain data in the absence of source domain data. Most SFOD methods follow the same self-training paradigm using mean-teacher (MT) framework where the student model is guided by only one single teacher model. However, such paradigm can easily fall into a training instability problem that when the teacher model collapses uncontrollably due to the domain shift, the student model also suffers drastic performance degradation. To address this issue, we propose the Periodically Exchange Teacher-Student (PETS) method, a simple yet novel approach that introduces a multiple-teacher framework consisting of a static teacher, a dynamic teacher, and a student model. During the training phase, we periodically exchange the weights between the static teacher and the student model. Then, we update the dynamic teacher using the moving average of the student model that has already been exchanged by the static teacher. In this way, the dynamic teacher can integrate knowledge from past periods, effectively reducing error accumulation and enabling a more stable training process within the MT-based framework. Further, we develop a consensus mechanism to merge the predictions of two teacher models to provide higher-quality pseudo labels for student model. Extensive experiments on multiple SFOD benchmarks show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with other related methods, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of our method on SFOD task",

    "abstract": "Generalized Zero-shot Learning (GZSL) has yielded remarkable performance by designing a series of unbiased visual-semantics mappings, wherein, the precision relies heavily on the completeness of extracted visual features from both seen and unseen classes. However, as a common practice in GZSL, the pre-trained feature extractor may easily exhibit difficulty in capturing domain-specific traits of the downstream tasks/datasets to provide fine-grained discriminative features, i.e., domain bias, which hinders the overall recognition performance, especially for unseen classes. Recent studies partially address this issue by fine-tuning feature extractors, while may inevitably incur catastrophic forgetting and overfitting issues. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective Attribute-Aware Representation Rectification framework for GZSL, dubbed $\\mathbf{(AR)^{2}}$, to adaptively rectify the feature extractor to learn novel features while keeping original valuable features. Specifically, our method consists of two key components, i.e., Unseen-Aware Distillation (UAD) and Attribute-Guided Learning (AGL). During training, UAD exploits the prior knowledge of attribute texts that are shared by both seen/unseen classes with attention mechanisms to detect and maintain unseen class-sensitive visual features in a targeted manner, and meanwhile, AGL aims to steer the model to focus on valuable features and suppress them to fit noisy elements in the seen classes by attribute-guided representation learning.

    "title": "MetaFBP: Learning to Learn High-Order Predictor for Personalized Facial Beauty Prediction",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Predicting individual aesthetic preferences holds significant practical applications and academic implications for human society. However, existing studies mainly focus on learning and predicting the commonality of facial attractiveness, with little attention given to Personalized Facial Beauty Prediction (PFBP). PFBP aims to develop a machine that can adapt to individual aesthetic preferences with only a few images rated by each user. In this paper, we formulate this task from a meta-learning perspective that each user corresponds to a meta-task. To address such PFBP task, we draw inspiration from the human aesthetic mechanism that visual aesthetics in society follows a Gaussian distribution, which motivates us to disentangle user preferences into a commonality and an individuality part. To this end, we propose a novel MetaFBP framework, in which we devise a universal feature extractor to capture the aesthetic commonality and then optimize to adapt the aesthetic individuality by shifting the decision boundary of the predictor via a meta-learning mechanism. Unlike conventional meta-learning methods that may struggle with slow adaptation or overfitting to tiny support sets, we propose a novel approach that optimizes a high-order predictor for fast adaptation. In order to validate the performance of the proposed method, we build several PFBP benchmarks by using existing facial beauty prediction datasets rated by numerous users. Extensive experiments on these benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MetaFBP method",

    "title": "Parameter Exchange for Robust Dynamic Domain Generalization",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Agnostic domain shift is the main reason of model degradation on the unknown target domains, which brings an urgent need to develop Domain Generalization (DG). Recent advances at DG use dynamic networks to achieve training-free adaptation on the unknown target domains, termed Dynamic Domain Generalization (DDG), which compensates for the lack of self-adaptability in static models with fixed weights. The parameters of dynamic networks can be decoupled into a static and a dynamic component, which are designed to learn domain-invariant and domain-specific features, respectively. Based on the existing arts, in this work, we try to push the limits of DDG by disentangling the static and dynamic components more thoroughly from an optimization perspective. Our main consideration is that we can enable the static component to learn domain-invariant features more comprehensively by augmenting the domain-specific information. As a result, the more comprehensive domain-invariant features learned by the static component can then enforce the dynamic component to focus more on learning adaptive domain-specific features. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective Parameter Exchange (PE) method to perturb the combination between the static and dynamic components. We optimize the model using the gradients from both the perturbed and non-perturbed feed-forward jointly to implicitly achieve the aforementioned disentanglement. In this way, the two components can be optimized in a mutually-beneficial manner, which can resist the agnostic domain shifts and improve the self-adaptability on the unknown target domain. Extensive experiments show that PE can be easily plugged into existing dynamic networks to improve their generalization ability without bells and whistles",

    "title": "Predicting Recovery or Decease of COVID-19 Patients with Clinical and RT-PCR Using Machine Learning Classification Algorithms",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the global economy and people's daily lives in unprecedented ways. To make appropriate decisions, it is necessary to diagnose COVID-19 rapidly and accurately. Clinical decision making is influenced by data collected from patients. With the aid of artificial intelligence, COVID-19 has been diagnosed quickly by analyzing symptoms, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), computed tomography scans, chest X-rays, routine laboratory blood tests and even cough sounds. Furthermore, these data can be used to predict a patient's morality, although there is a question about which data makes the most accurate predictions. Therefore, this study consists of two parts. Our first objective is to examine whether machine learning algorithms can predict the outcome of COVID-19 cases (recovery or death), based on the features present in the dataset. In the second part of the research, we investigated the impact of clinical and RT-PCR on prediction of recovery and decease to determine which one is more reliable. We defined four stages with different feature sets and use six machine learning methods to build prediction model. With an accuracy of 78.7%, random forest showed promising results for predicting death and recovery of patients. Based on this, it appears that recovery and decease of patients are predictable using machine learning. For second objective, results indicate that clinical alone (without using RT-PCR), trained with AdaBoost algorithm, is the most accurate with an accuracy of 82.1%. This study can provide guidance for medical professionals in the event of a crisis or outbreak similar to COVID-19",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Hyper-trabeculation or non-compaction in the left ventricle of the myocardium (LVNC) is a recently classified form of cardiomyopathy. Several methods have been proposed to quantify the trabeculae accurately in the left ventricle, but there is no general agreement in the medical community to use a particular approach. In previous work, we proposed DL-LVTQ, a deep learning approach for left ventricular trabecular quantification based on a U-Net CNN architecture. DL-LVTQ was an automatic diagnosis tool developed from a dataset of patients with the same cardiomyopathy (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). In this work, we have extended and adapted DL-LVTQ to cope with patients with different cardiomyopathies. The dataset consists of up 379 patients in three groups with different particularities and cardiomyopathies. Patient images were taken from different scanners and hospitals. We have modified and adapted the U-Net convolutional neural network to account for the different particularities of a heterogeneous group of patients with various unclassifiable or mixed and inherited cardiomyopathies. The inclusion of new groups of patients has increased the accuracy, specificity and kappa values while maintaining the sensitivity of the automatic deep learning method proposed. Therefore, a better-prepared diagnosis tool is ready for various cardiomyopathies with different characteristics. Cardiologists have considered that 98.9% of the evaluated outputs are verified clinically for diagnosis. Therefore, the high precision to segment the different cardiac structures allows us to make a robust diagnostic system objective and faster, decreasing human error and time spent",

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on activity retrieval from a video query in an imbalanced scenario. In current query-by-activity-video literature, a common assumption is that all activities have sufficient labelled examples when learning an embedding. This assumption does however practically not hold, as only a portion of activities have many examples, while other activities are only described by few examples. In this paper, we propose a visual-semantic embedding network that explicitly deals with the imbalanced scenario for activity retrieval. Our network contains two novel modules. The visual alignment module performs a global alignment between the input video and fixed-sized visual bank representations for all activities. The semantic module performs an alignment between the input video and fixed-sized semantic activity representations. By matching videos with both visual and semantic activity representations that are of equal size over all activities, we no longer ignore infrequent activities during retrieval. Experiments on a new imbalanced activity retrieval benchmark show the effectiveness of our approach for all types of activities",

    "title": "Compositional Zero-shot Learning via Progressive Language-based Observations",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Compositional zero-shot learning aims to recognize unseen state-object compositions by leveraging known primitives (state and object) during training. However, effectively modeling interactions between primitives and generalizing knowledge to novel compositions remains a perennial challenge. There are two key factors: object-conditioned and state-conditioned variance, i.e., the appearance of states (or objects) can vary significantly when combined with different objects (or states). For instance, the state \"old\" can signify a vintage design for a \"car\" or an advanced age for a \"cat\". In this paper, we argue that these variances can be mitigated by predicting composition categories based on pre-observed primitive. To this end, we propose Progressive Language-based Observations (PLO), which can dynamically determine a better observation order of primitives. These observations comprise a series of concepts or languages that allow the model to understand image content in a step-by-step manner. Specifically, PLO adopts pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to empower the model with observation capabilities. We further devise two variants: 1) PLO-VLM: a two-step method, where a pre-observing classifier dynamically determines the observation order of two primitives. 2) PLO-LLM: a multi-step scheme, which utilizes large language models (LLMs) to craft composition-specific prompts for step-by-step observing. Extensive ablations on three challenging datasets demonstrate the superiority of PLO compared with state-of-the-art methods, affirming its abilities in compositional recognition",

PointPCA proposed a set of perceptually-relevant descriptors based on PCA decomposition that were applied to both the geometry and texture data of point clouds for full reference PCQA. PointPCA+ employs PCA only on the geometry data while enriching existing geometry and texture descriptors, that are computed more efficiently. Similarly to PointPCA, a total quality score is obtained through a learning-based fusion of individual predictions from geometry and texture descriptors that capture local shape and appearance properties, respectively. Before feature fusion, a feature selection module is introduced to choose the most effective features from a proposed super-set. Experimental results show that PointPCA+ achieves high predictive performance against subjective ground truth scores obtained from publicly available datasets.

    "abstract": "The explosion of data has resulted in more and more associated text being transmitted along with images. Inspired by from distributed source coding, many works utilize image side information to enhance image compression. However, existing methods generally do not consider using text as side information to enhance perceptual compression of images, even though the benefits of multimodal synergy have been widely demonstrated in research. This begs the following question: How can we effectively transfer text-level semantic dependencies to help image compression, which is only available to the decoder? In this work, we propose a novel deep image compression method with text-guided side information to achieve a better rate-perception-distortion tradeoff. Specifically, we employ the CLIP text encoder and an effective Semantic-Spatial Aware block to fuse the text and image features. This is done by predicting a semantic mask to guide the learned text-adaptive affine transformation at the pixel level. Furthermore, we design a text-conditional generative adversarial networks to improve the perceptual quality of reconstructed images. Extensive experiments involving four datasets and ten image quality assessment metrics demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior results in terms of rate-perception trade-off and semantic distortion",

To ensure the network is more lightweight, we involves the integration of prompt networks with less convolutional layers. Exhaustive experiments show that compared to methods based on multiple models, which are optimized separately for different target rates, the proposed method arrives at the same performance with 80% savings in parameter storage and 90% savings in datasets. Meanwhile, our model outperforms all current variable bitrate image methods in terms of rate-distortion performance and approaches the state-of-the-art fixed bitrate image compression methods trained from scratch",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Diffusion models have revolutionized generative content creation and text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models in particular have increased the creative freedom of users by allowing scene synthesis using natural language. T2I models excel at synthesizing concepts such as nouns, appearances, and styles. To enable customized content creation based on a few example images of a concept, methods such as Textual Inversion and DreamBooth invert the desired concept and enable synthesizing it in new scenes. However, inverting more general concepts that go beyond object appearance and style (adjectives and verbs) through natural language, remains a challenge. Two key characteristics of these concepts contribute to the limitations of current inversion methods. 1) Adjectives and verbs are entangled with nouns (subject) and can hinder appearance-based inversion methods, where the subject appearance leaks into the concept embedding and 2) describing such concepts often extends beyond single word embeddings (being frozen in ice, walking on a tightrope, etc.) that current methods do not handle. In this study, we introduce Lego, a textual inversion method designed to invert subject entangled concepts from a few example images. Lego disentangles concepts from their associated subjects using a simple yet effective Subject Separation step and employs a Context Loss that guides the inversion of single/multi-embedding concepts. In a thorough user study, Lego-generated concepts were preferred over 70% of the time when compared to the baseline. Additionally, visual question answering using a large language model suggested Lego-generated concepts are better aligned with the text description of the concept",

Conventional zero-shot learning has difficulty managing unfamiliar combinations of seen and unseen classes because it depends on pre-defined class embeddings. In contrast, Compositional Zero-Shot Learning uses the inherent hierarchies and structural connections among classes, creating new class representations by combining attributes, components, or other semantic elements. In our paper, we propose a novel framework that for the first time combines the Modern Hopfield Network with a Mixture of Experts (HOMOE) to classify the compositions of previously unseen objects. Specifically, the Modern Hopfield Network creates a memory that stores label prototypes and identifies relevant labels for a given input image. Following this, the Mixture of Expert models integrates the image with the fitting prototype to produce the final composition classification.

Existing optimization-based methods, which leverage the powerful 2D prior of diffusion models to handle various parametric images, have mainly focused on generation. Unlike generation, editing requires a balance between conforming to the target attribute and preserving the identity of the source content. Recent 2D image editing methods have achieved this balance by leveraging the stochastic latent encoded in the generative process of diffusion models. To extend the editing capabilities of diffusion models shown in pixel space to parameter space, we reformulate the 2D image editing method into an optimization form named PDS. PDS matches the stochastic latents of the source and the target, enabling the sampling of targets in diverse parameter spaces that align with a desired attribute while maintaining the source's identity. We demonstrate that this optimization resembles running a generative process with the target attribute, but aligning this process with the trajectory of the source's generative process. Extensive editing results in Neural Radiance Fields and Scalable Vector Graphics representations demonstrate that PDS is capable of sampling targets to fulfill the aforementioned balance across various parameter spaces",

Recent approaches favor learning policies from simulated or collected data, wherein appropriate actions are more frequently selected when the recognition is accurate.

To address this issue, we propose treating active recognition as a sequential evidence-gathering process, providing by-step uncertainty quantification and reliable prediction under the evidence combination theory. Additionally, the reward function developed in this paper effectively characterizes the merit of actions when operating in open-world environments. To evaluate the performance, we collect a dataset from an indoor simulator, encompassing various recognition challenges such as distance, occlusion levels, and visibility.

In the reduced dimensional space, provided by a subset of the principal components, fewer computations are needed to process the data resulting in a faster run time. In this paper, we propose a way to further decrease the time required to use PCA by investigating how many principal components may be omitted with minimal impact on the detection rate. Using ACE to perform the detection, and then probability, and spectral fit for identification, we find that the number of principal components can be reduced by a substantial amount before seeing a noticeable change in detection rates",

To resolve this conflict, we propose to utilize both geometric and semantic features obtained from a pre-trained foundation model.Our approach projects 2D features from this foundation model into 3D for a single object model per category, and then performs matching against this for new single view observations of unseen object instances with a trained matching network.

However, the field of 3D medical image retrieval is still emerging, lacking established evaluation benchmarks, comprehensive datasets, and thorough studies. This paper attempts to bridge this gap by introducing a novel benchmark for 3D Medical Image Retrieval (3D-MIR) that encompasses four different anatomies imaged with computed tomography. Using this benchmark, we explore a diverse set of search strategies that use aggregated 2D slices, 3D volumes, and multi-modal embeddings from popular multi-modal foundation models as queries. Quantitative and qualitative assessments of each approach are provided alongside an in-depth discussion that offers insight for future research. To promote the advancement of this field, our benchmark, dataset, and code are made publicly available",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "This work proposes a unified self-supervised pre-training framework for transferable multi-modal perception representation learning via masked multi-modal reconstruction in Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), namely NeRF-Supervised Masked AutoEncoder (NS-MAE). Specifically, conditioned on certain view directions and locations, multi-modal embeddings extracted from corrupted multi-modal input signals, i.e., Lidar point clouds and images, are rendered into projected multi-modal feature maps via neural rendering. Then, original multi-modal signals serve as reconstruction targets for the rendered multi-modal feature maps to enable self-supervised representation learning. Extensive experiments show that the representation learned via NS-MAE shows promising transferability for diverse multi-modal and single-modal (camera-only and Lidar-only) perception models on diverse 3D perception downstream tasks (3D object detection and BEV map segmentation) with diverse amounts of fine-tuning labeled data. Moreover, we empirically find that NS-MAE enjoys the synergy of both the mechanism of masked autoencoder and neural radiance field. Our code shall be released upon acceptance",

Recently, a number of theoretical works \\citep{chen2022, Chen2022ImprovedAO, Chenetal23flowode, benton2023linear} have shown that diffusion models can efficiently sample, assuming $L^2$-accurate score estimates. The score-matching objective naturally approximates the true score in $L^2$, but the sample complexity of existing bounds depends \\emph{polynomially} on the data radius and desired Wasserstein accuracy. By contrast, the time complexity of sampling is only logarithmic in these parameters. We show that estimating the score in $L^2$ \\emph{requires} this polynomial dependence, but that a number of samples that scales polylogarithmically in the Wasserstein accuracy actually do suffice for sampling. We show that with a polylogarithmic number of samples, the ERM of the score-matching objective is $L^2$ accurate on all but a probability $\\delta$ fraction of the true distribution, and that this weaker guarantee is sufficient for efficient sampling",

    "abstract": "The quantification of biomarkers on immunohistochemistry breast cancer images is essential for defining appropriate therapy for breast cancer patients, as well as for extracting relevant information on disease prognosis. This is an arduous and time-consuming task that may introduce a bias in the results due to intra- and inter-observer variability which could be alleviated by making use of automatic quantification tools. However, this is not a simple processing task given the heterogeneity of breast tumors that results in non-uniformly distributed tumor cells exhibiting different staining colors and intensity, size, shape, and texture, of the nucleus, cytoplasm and membrane. In this research work, we demonstrate the feasibility of using a deep learning-based instance segmentation architecture for the automatic quantification of both nuclear and membrane biomarkers applied to IHC-stained slides. We have solved the cumbersome task of training set generation with the design and implementation of a web platform, which has served as a hub for communication and feedback between researchers and pathologists as well as a system for the validation of the automatic image processing models. Through this tool, we have collected annotations over samples of HE, ER and Ki-67 (nuclear biomarkers) and HER2 (membrane biomarker) IHC-stained images. Using the same deep learning network architecture, we have trained two models, so-called nuclei- and membrane-aware segmentation models, which, once successfully validated, have revealed to be a promising method to segment nuclei instances in IHC-stained images. The quantification method proposed in this work has been integrated into the developed web platform and is currently being used as a decision-support tool by pathologists",

This study aimed to compare state-of-the-art feature extractors for computing Fr\\'echet Distances (FDs) in medical imaging. A StyleGAN2 network was trained with data augmentation techniques tailored for limited data domains on datasets comprising three medical imaging modalities and four anatomical locations. Human evaluation of generative quality (via a visual Turing test) was compared to FDs calculated using ImageNet-trained InceptionV3, ResNet50, SwAV, DINO, and Swin Transformer architectures, in addition to an InceptionV3 network trained on a large medical dataset, RadImageNet. All ImageNet-based extractors were consistent with each other, but only SwAV was significantly correlated with medical expert judgment. The RadImageNet-based FD showed volatility and lacked correlation with human judgment. Caution is advised when using medical image-trained extraction networks in the FD calculation. These networks should be rigorously evaluated on the imaging modality under consideration and publicly released. ImageNet-based extractors, while imperfect, are consistent and widely understood.

However, most of the existing semi-supervised learning methods still lack efficient perturbation methods to promote diversity of features and the precision of pseudo labels during training. In order to fill this gap, we propose DiverseNet architectures which explore multi-head and multi-model semi-supervised learning algorithms by simultaneously promoting precision and diversity during training. The two proposed methods of DiverseNet, namely the DiverseHead and DiverseModel, achieve the highest semantic segmentation performance in four widely utilised remote sensing imagery data sets compared to state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning methods.

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging is emerging as a crucial tool to examine cardiac morphology and function. Essential to this endeavour are anatomical 3D surface and volumetric meshes derived from CMR images, which facilitate computational anatomy studies, biomarker discovery, and in-silico simulations. However, conventional surface mesh generation methods, such as active shape models and multi-atlas segmentation, are highly time-consuming and require complex processing pipelines to generate simulation-ready 3D meshes. In response, we introduce HybridVNet, a novel architecture for direct image-to-mesh extraction seamlessly integrating standard convolutional neural networks with graph convolutions, which we prove can efficiently handle surface and volumetric meshes by encoding them as graph structures. To further enhance accuracy, we propose a multiview HybridVNet architecture which processes both long axis and short axis CMR, showing that it can increase the performance of cardiac MR mesh generation. Our model combines traditional convolutional networks with variational graph generative models, deep supervision and mesh-specific regularisation. Experiments on a comprehensive dataset from the UK Biobank confirm the potential of HybridVNet to significantly advance cardiac imaging and computational cardiology by efficiently generating high-fidelity and simulation ready meshes from CMR images",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The classic metaphyseal lesion (CML) is a distinct injury that is highly specific for infant abuse. It commonly occurs in the distal tibia. To aid radiologists detect these subtle fractures, we need to develop a model that can flag abnormal distal tibial radiographs (i.e. those with CMLs). Unfortunately, the development of such a model requires a large and diverse training database, which is often not available. To address this limitation, we propose a novel generative model for data augmentation. Unlike previous models that fail to generate data that span the diverse radiographic appearance of the distal tibial CML, our proposed masked conditional diffusion model (MaC-DM) not only generates realistic-appearing and wide-ranging synthetic images of the distal tibial radiographs with and without CMLs, it also generates their associated segmentation labels. To achieve these tasks, MaC-DM combines the weighted segmentation masks of the tibias and the CML fracture sites as additional conditions for classifier guidance. The augmented images from our model improved the performances of ResNet-34 in classifying normal radiographs and those with CMLs. Further, the augmented images and their associated segmentation masks enhanced the performance of the U-Net in labeling areas of the CMLs on distal tibial radiographs",

In this work, we introduce Single-Shot PnP methods (SS-PnP), shifting the focus to solving inverse problems with minimal data. First, we integrate Single-Shot proximal denoisers into iterative methods, enabling training with single instances.

    "title": "Compact 3D Gaussian Representation for Radiance Field",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in capturing complex 3D scenes with high fidelity. However, one persistent challenge that hinders the widespread adoption of NeRFs is the computational bottleneck due to the volumetric rendering. On the other hand, 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as an alternative representation that leverages a 3D Gaussisan-based representation and adopts the rasterization pipeline to render the images rather than volumetric rendering, achieving very fast rendering speed and promising image quality. However, a significant drawback arises as 3DGS entails a substantial number of 3D Gaussians to maintain the high fidelity of the rendered images, which requires a large amount of memory and storage. To address this critical issue, we place a specific emphasis on two key objectives: reducing the number of Gaussian points without sacrificing performance and compressing the Gaussian attributes, such as view-dependent color and covariance. To this end, we propose a learnable mask strategy that significantly reduces the number of Gaussians while preserving high performance. In addition, we propose a compact but effective representation of view-dependent color by employing a grid-based neural field rather than relying on spherical harmonics. Finally, we learn codebooks to compactly represent the geometric attributes of Gaussian by vector quantization. In our extensive experiments, we consistently show over 10$\\times$ reduced storage and enhanced rendering speed, while maintaining the quality of the scene representation, compared to 3DGS. Our work provides a comprehensive framework for 3D scene representation, achieving high performance, fast training, compactness, and real-time rendering.

We improve the resultant encoder-free training method by incorporating an encoder network to provide an amortised warm-start to our Langevin sampling and test three different objectives for doing so. Finally, to increase robustness to the sampling step size and reduce sensitivity to curvature, we validate a lightweight and easily computable form of preconditioning, inspired by Riemann Manifold Langevin and adaptive optimizers from the SGD literature. We compare against VAEs by training like-for-like generative models using our technique against those trained with standard reparameterisation-trick-based ELBOs.

    "abstract": "Digital humans and, especially, 3D facial avatars have raised a lot of attention in the past years, as they are the backbone of several applications like immersive telepresence in AR or VR. Despite the progress, facial avatars reconstructed from commodity hardware are incomplete and miss out on parts of the side and back of the head, severely limiting the usability of the avatar. This limitation in prior work stems from their requirement of face tracking, which fails for profile and back views. To address this issue, we propose to learn person-specific animatable avatars from images without assuming to have access to precise facial expression tracking. At the core of our method, we leverage a 3D-aware generative model that is trained to reproduce the distribution of facial expressions from the training data. To train this appearance model, we only assume to have a collection of 2D images with the corresponding camera parameters. For controlling the model, we learn a mapping from 3DMM facial expression parameters to the latent space of the generative model. This mapping can be learned by sampling the latent space of the appearance model and reconstructing the facial parameters from a normalized frontal view, where facial expression estimation performs well. With this scheme, we decouple 3D appearance reconstruction and animation control to achieve high fidelity in image synthesis. In a series of experiments, we compare our proposed technique to state-of-the-art monocular methods and show superior quality while not requiring expression tracking of the training data",

Such an approach has been recently introduced for adversarial purification, achieving significant performance. We show that diffusion purification methods are well suited for counter-forensics tasks. Such approaches outperform already existing counter-forensics techniques both in deceiving forensics methods and in preserving the natural look of the purified images.

    "title": "Visual In-Context Prompting",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In-context prompting in large language models (LLMs) has become a prevalent approach to improve zero-shot capabilities, but this idea is less explored in the vision domain. Existing visual prompting methods focus on referring segmentation to segment the most relevant object, falling short of addressing many generic vision tasks like open-set segmentation and detection. In this paper, we introduce a universal visual in-context prompting framework for both tasks. In particular, we build on top of an encoder-decoder architecture, and develop a versatile prompt encoder to support a variety of prompts like strokes, boxes, and points. We further enhance it to take an arbitrary number of reference image segments as the context. Our extensive explorations show that the proposed visual in-context prompting elicits extraordinary referring and generic segmentation capabilities to refer and detect, yielding competitive performance to close-set in-domain datasets and showing promising results on many open-set segmentation datasets. By joint training on COCO and SA-1B, our model achieves $57.7$ PQ on COCO and $23.2$ PQ on ADE20K. Code will be available at https://github.com/UX-Decoder/DINOv",

    "abstract": "Methods for finetuning generative models for concept-driven personalization generally achieve strong results for subject-driven or style-driven generation. Recently, low-rank adaptations (LoRA) have been proposed as a parameter-efficient way of achieving concept-driven personalization. While recent work explores the combination of separate LoRAs to achieve joint generation of learned styles and subjects, existing techniques do not reliably address the problem; they often compromise either subject fidelity or style fidelity. We propose ZipLoRA, a method to cheaply and effectively merge independently trained style and subject LoRAs in order to achieve generation of any user-provided subject in any user-provided style. Experiments on a wide range of subject and style combinations show that ZipLoRA can generate compelling results with meaningful improvements over baselines in subject and style fidelity while preserving the ability to recontextualize.

Guided by the visual feedback from T-Rex, users can also interactively refine the counting results by prompting on missing or falsely-detected objects. T-Rex has achieved state-of-the-art performance on several class-agnostic counting benchmarks. To further exploit its potential, we established a new counting benchmark encompassing diverse scenarios and challenges.

However, existing methods focus on the control of major body joints, neglecting the manipulation of expressive attributes, such as facial expressions, jaw poses, hand poses, and so on. In this work, we present XAGen, the first 3D generative model for human avatars capable of expressive control over body, face, and hands. To enhance the fidelity of small-scale regions like face and hands, we devise a multi-scale and multi-part 3D representation that models fine details. Based on this representation, we propose a multi-part rendering technique that disentangles the synthesis of body, face, and hands to ease model training and enhance geometric quality. Furthermore, we design multi-part discriminators that evaluate the quality of the generated avatars with respect to their appearance and fine-grained control capabilities. Experiments show that XAGen surpasses state-of-the-art methods in terms of realism, diversity, and expressive control abilities.

    "title": "WildFusion: Learning 3D-Aware Latent Diffusion Models in View Space",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Modern learning-based approaches to 3D-aware image synthesis achieve high photorealism and 3D-consistent viewpoint changes for the generated images. Existing approaches represent instances in a shared canonical space. However, for in-the-wild datasets a shared canonical system can be difficult to define or might not even exist. In this work, we instead model instances in view space, alleviating the need for posed images and learned camera distributions. We find that in this setting, existing GAN-based methods are prone to generating flat geometry and struggle with distribution coverage. We hence propose WildFusion, a new approach to 3D-aware image synthesis based on latent diffusion models (LDMs). We first train an autoencoder that infers a compressed latent representation, which additionally captures the images' underlying 3D structure and enables not only reconstruction but also novel view synthesis. To learn a faithful 3D representation, we leverage cues from monocular depth prediction. Then, we train a diffusion model in the 3D-aware latent space, thereby enabling synthesis of high-quality 3D-consistent image samples, outperforming recent state-of-the-art GAN-based methods. Importantly, our 3D-aware LDM is trained without any direct supervision from multiview images or 3D geometry and does not require posed images or learned pose or camera distributions. It directly learns a 3D representation without relying on canonical camera coordinates. This opens up promising research avenues for scalable 3D-aware image synthesis and 3D content creation from in-the-wild image data.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Image style transfer occupies an important place in both computer graphics and computer vision. However, most current methods require reference to stylized images and cannot individually stylize specific objects. To overcome this limitation, we propose the \"Soulstyler\" framework, which allows users to guide the stylization of specific objects in an image through simple textual descriptions. We introduce a large language model to parse the text and identify stylization goals and specific styles. Combined with a CLIP-based semantic visual embedding encoder, the model understands and matches text and image content. We also introduce a novel localized text-image block matching loss that ensures that style transfer is performed only on specified target objects, while non-target regions remain in their original style. Experimental results demonstrate that our model is able to accurately perform style transfer on target objects according to textual descriptions without affecting the style of background regions.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Typically, autonomous driving adopts a modular design, which divides the full stack into perception, prediction, planning and control parts. Though interpretable, such modular design tends to introduce a substantial amount of redundancy. Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLM) and diffusion techniques have demonstrated their superior performance on comprehension and generation ability. In this paper, we first introduce the concept of interleaved vision-action pair, which unifies the format of visual features and control signals. Based on the vision-action pairs, we construct a general world model based on MLLM and diffusion model for autonomous driving, termed ADriver-I. It takes the vision-action pairs as inputs and autoregressively predicts the control signal of the current frame. The generated control signals together with the historical vision-action pairs are further conditioned to predict the future frames. With the predicted next frame, ADriver-I performs further control signal prediction. Such a process can be repeated infinite times, ADriver-I achieves autonomous driving in the world created by itself. Extensive experiments are conducted on nuScenes and our large-scale private datasets. ADriver-I shows impressive performance compared to several constructed baselines. We hope our ADriver-I can provide some new insights for future autonomous driving and embodied intelligence",

While earlier approaches focus on end-to-end learning directly from video pixels, we propose to revisit text-based representations, such as discrete action labels, or free-form video captions, which are interpretable and can be directly consumed by large language models (LLMs). Intuitively, different video understanding tasks may require representations that are complementary and at different granularities. To this end, we propose versatile action models (Vamos), a learning framework powered by a large language model as the \"reasoner\", and can flexibly leverage visual embeddings, action labels, and free-form descriptions extracted from videos as its input. We evaluate Vamos on four complementary video understanding benchmarks, Ego4D, Next-QA, IntentQA, and EgoSchema, on its capability to model temporal dynamics, encode visual history, and perform reasoning. Surprisingly, we observe that text-based representations consistently achieve competitive performance on all benchmarks, and that visual embeddings provide marginal or no performance improvement, demonstrating the effectiveness of text-based video representation in the LLM era. We perform extensive ablation study and qualitative analysis to support our observations, and achieve state-of-the-art performance on three benchmarks",

In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of employing four state-of-the-art pretrained models for medical image retrieval at modality, body region, and organ levels and compared the results of two similarity indexing approaches. Since the employed networks take 2D images, we analyzed the impacts of weighting and sampling strategies to incorporate 3D information during retrieval of 3D volumes.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce DiffusionMat, a novel image matting framework that employs a diffusion model for the transition from coarse to refined alpha mattes. Diverging from conventional methods that utilize trimaps merely as loose guidance for alpha matte prediction, our approach treats image matting as a sequential refinement learning process. This process begins with the addition of noise to trimaps and iteratively denoises them using a pre-trained diffusion model, which incrementally guides the prediction towards a clean alpha matte. The key innovation of our framework is a correction module that adjusts the output at each denoising step, ensuring that the final result is consistent with the input image's structures. We also introduce the Alpha Reliability Propagation, a novel technique designed to maximize the utility of available guidance by selectively enhancing the trimap regions with confident alpha information, thus simplifying the correction task. To train the correction module, we devise specialized loss functions that target the accuracy of the alpha matte's edges and the consistency of its opaque and transparent regions. We evaluate our model across several image matting benchmarks, and the results indicate that DiffusionMat consistently outperforms existing methods.

The extensive scan time is stressful for patients, who must remain motionless in a prolonged imaging procedure that prioritizes reduction of imaging artifacts. This is challenging for pediatric patients who may require measures for managing voluntary motions such as anesthesia. Several computational approaches reduce scan time (fast MRI), by recording fewer measurements and digitally recovering full information via post-acquisition reconstruction. However, most fast MRI approaches were developed for diagnostic imaging, without addressing reconstruction challenges specific to RT planning. In this work, we developed a deep learning-based method (DeepMRIRec) for MRI reconstruction from undersampled data acquired with RT-specific receiver coil arrangements. We evaluated our method against fully sampled data of T1-weighted MR images acquired from 73 children with brain tumors/surgical beds using loop and posterior coils (12 channels), with and without applying virtual compression of coil elements. DeepMRIRec reduced scanning time by a factor of four producing a structural similarity score surpassing the evaluated state-of-the-art method (0.960 vs 0.896), thereby demonstrating its potential for accelerating MRI scanning for RT planning",

The binary silhouettes and skeletal coordinates are two dominant representations in recent literature, achieving remarkable advances in many scenarios. However, inherent challenges remain, in which silhouettes are not always guaranteed in unconstrained scenes, and structural cues have not been fully utilized from skeletons. In this paper, we introduce a novel skeletal gait representation named Skeleton Map, together with SkeletonGait, a skeleton-based method to exploit structural information from human skeleton maps. Specifically, the skeleton map represents the coordinates of human joints as a heatmap with Gaussian approximation, exhibiting a silhouette-like image devoid of exact body structure. Beyond achieving state-of-the-art performances over five popular gait datasets, more importantly, SkeletonGait uncovers novel insights about how important structural features are in describing gait and when do they play a role. Furthermore, we propose a multi-branch architecture, named SkeletonGait++, to make use of complementary features from both skeletons and silhouettes. Experiments indicate that SkeletonGait++ outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin in various scenarios.

Addressing these gaps, we propose Video-LLaVA, the first LMM with pixel-level grounding capability, integrating audio cues by transcribing them into text to enrich video-context understanding. Our framework uses an off-the-shelf tracker and a novel grounding module, enabling it to spatially and temporally localize objects in videos following user instructions. We evaluate Video-LLaVA using video-based generative and question-answering benchmarks and introduce new benchmarks specifically designed to measure prompt-based object grounding performance in videos. Further, we propose the use of Vicuna over GPT-3.5, as utilized in Video-ChatGPT, for video-based conversation benchmarking, ensuring reproducibility of results which is a concern with the proprietary nature of GPT-3.5.

Compared to existing NeRF-based methods, the model owns better capability in synthesizing high-frequency details without the jittering problem across video frames. The core of our model is a novel augmented 3D Gaussian representation, which attaches each Gaussian with a learnable code. The learnable code serves as a pose-dependent appearance embedding for refining the erroneous appearance caused by geometric transformation of Gaussians, based on which an appearance refinement model is learned to produce residual Gaussian properties to match the appearance in target pose. To force the Gaussians to learn the foreground human only without background interference, we further design a novel alpha loss to explicitly constrain the Gaussians within the human body. We also propose to jointly optimize the human joint parameters to improve the appearance accuracy. The animatable 3D Gaussian model can be learned with shallow MLPs, so new human motions can be synthesized in real time (66 fps on avarage). Experiments show that our model has superior performance over NeRF-based methods",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a method to optimize Gaussian splatting with a limited number of images while avoiding overfitting. Representing a 3D scene by combining numerous Gaussian splats has yielded outstanding visual quality. However, it tends to overfit the training views when only a small number of images are available. To address this issue, we introduce a dense depth map as a geometry guide to mitigate overfitting. We obtained the depth map using a pre-trained monocular depth estimation model and aligning the scale and offset using sparse COLMAP feature points. The adjusted depth aids in the color-based optimization of 3D Gaussian splatting, mitigating floating artifacts, and ensuring adherence to geometric constraints. We verify the proposed method on the NeRF-LLFF dataset with varying numbers of few images. Our approach demonstrates robust geometry compared to the original method that relies solely on images",

Despite the remarkable progress achieved in medical image segmentation, there is still an absence of foundation segmentation model that can segment a wide range of anatomical categories with easy user interaction.

    "abstract": "With the widespread usage of VR devices and contents, demands for 3D scene generation techniques become more popular. Existing 3D scene generation models, however, limit the target scene to specific domain, primarily due to their training strategies using 3D scan dataset that is far from the real-world. To address such limitation, we propose LucidDreamer, a domain-free scene generation pipeline by fully leveraging the power of existing large-scale diffusion-based generative model. Our LucidDreamer has two alternate steps: Dreaming and Alignment. First, to generate multi-view consistent images from inputs, we set the point cloud as a geometrical guideline for each image generation. Specifically, we project a portion of point cloud to the desired view and provide the projection as a guidance for inpainting using the generative model. The inpainted images are lifted to 3D space with estimated depth maps, composing a new points. Second, to aggregate the new points into the 3D scene, we propose an aligning algorithm which harmoniously integrates the portions of newly generated 3D scenes. The finally obtained 3D scene serves as initial points for optimizing Gaussian splats. LucidDreamer produces Gaussian splats that are highly-detailed compared to the previous 3D scene generation methods, with no constraint on domain of the target scene",

Recently, Frey et al. provided an exciting deep learning method for learning eye movements from fMRI data. However, it needed to co-register fMRI into standard space to obtain eyeballs masks, and thus required additional templates and was time consuming. To resolve this issue, in this paper, we propose a framework named MRGazer for predicting eye gaze points from fMRI in individual space. The MRGazer consisted of eyeballs extraction module and a residual network-based eye gaze prediction. Compared to the previous method, the proposed framework skips the fMRI co-registration step, simplifies the processing protocol and achieves end-to-end eye gaze regression. The proposed method achieved superior performance in a variety of eye movement tasks than the co-registration-based method, and delivered objective results within a shorter time (~ 0.02 Seconds for each volume) than prior method (~0.3 Seconds for each volume)",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Classifying patterns of known classes and rejecting ambiguous and novel (also called as out-of-distribution (OOD)) inputs are involved in open world pattern recognition. Deep neural network models usually excel in closed-set classification while performing poorly in rejecting OOD. To tackle this problem, numerous methods have been designed to perform open set recognition (OSR) or OOD rejection/detection tasks. Previous methods mostly take post-training score transformation or hybrid models to ensure low scores on OOD inputs while separating known classes. In this paper, we attempt to build a unified framework for building open set classifiers for both classification and OOD rejection. We formulate the open set recognition of $ K $-known-class as a $ (K + 1) $-class classification problem with model trained on known-class samples only. By decomposing the $ K $-class problem into $ K $ one-versus-all (OVA) binary classification tasks and binding some parameters, we show that combining the scores of OVA classifiers can give $ (K + 1) $-class posterior probabilities, which enables classification and OOD rejection in a unified framework. To maintain the closed-set classification accuracy of the OVA trained classifier, we propose a hybrid training strategy combining OVA loss and multi-class cross-entropy loss. We implement the OVA framework and hybrid training strategy on the recently proposed convolutional prototype network. Experiments on popular OSR and OOD detection datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework, using a single multi-class classifier, yields competitive performance in closed-set classification, OOD detection, and misclassification detection",

    "abstract": "Caricature is an exaggerated form of artistic portraiture that accentuates unique yet subtle characteristics of human faces. Recently, advancements in deep end-to-end techniques have yielded encouraging outcomes in capturing both style and elevated exaggerations in creating face caricatures. Most of these approaches tend to produce cartoon-like results that could be more practical for real-world applications. In this study, we proposed a high-quality, unpaired face caricature method that is appropriate for use in the real world and uses computer vision techniques and GAN models. We attain the exaggeration of facial features and the stylization of appearance through a two-step process: Face caricature generation and face caricature projection. The face caricature generation step creates new caricature face datasets from real images and trains a generative model using the real and newly created caricature datasets. The Face caricature projection employs an encoder trained with real and caricature faces with the pretrained generator to project real and caricature faces. We perform an incremental facial exaggeration from the real image to the caricature faces using the encoder and generator's latent space. Our projection preserves the facial identity, attributes, and expressions from the input image. Also, it accounts for facial occlusions, such as reading glasses or sunglasses, to enhance the robustness of our model. Furthermore, we conducted a comprehensive comparison of our approach with various state-of-the-art face caricature methods, highlighting our process's distinctiveness and exceptional realism",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence has made significant progress in the Close World problem, being able to accurately recognize old knowledge through training and classification. However, AI faces significant challenges in the Open World problem, as it involves a new and unknown exploration journey. AI is not inherently proactive in exploration, and its challenge lies in not knowing how to approach and adapt to the unknown world. How do humans acquire knowledge of the unknown world. Humans identify new knowledge through intrinsic cognition. In the process of recognizing new colors, the cognitive cues are different from known color features and involve hue, saturation, brightness, and other characteristics. When AI encounters objects with different features in the new world, it faces another challenge: where are the distinguishing features between influential features of new and old objects? AI often mistakes a new world's brown bear for a known dog because it has not learned the differences in feature distributions between knowledge systems. This is because things in the new and old worlds have different units and dimensions for their features. This paper proposes an open-world model and elemental feature system that focuses on fundamentally recognizing the distribution differences in objective features between the new and old worlds. The quantum tunneling effect of learning ability in the new and old worlds is realized through the tractive force of meta-characteristic. The outstanding performance of the model system in learning new knowledge (using pedestrian re-identification datasets as an example) demonstrates that AI has acquired the ability to recognize the new world with an accuracy of $96.71\\%$ at most and has gained the capability to explore new knowledge, similar to humans",

    "abstract": "Automated blood vessel segmentation is vital for biomedical imaging, as vessel changes indicate many pathologies. Still, precise segmentation is difficult due to the complexity of vascular structures, anatomical variations across patients, the scarcity of annotated public datasets, and the quality of images. We present a thorough literature review, highlighting the state of machine learning techniques across diverse organs. Our goal is to provide a foundation on the topic and identify a robust baseline model for application to vascular segmentation in a new imaging modality, Hierarchical Phase Contrast Tomography (HiP CT). Introduced in 2020 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, HiP CT enables 3D imaging of complete organs at an unprecedented resolution of ca. 20mm per voxel, with the capability for localized zooms in selected regions down to 1mm per voxel without sectioning. We have created a training dataset with double annotator validated vascular data from three kidneys imaged with HiP CT in the context of the Human Organ Atlas Project. Finally, utilising the nnU Net model, we conduct experiments to assess the models performance on both familiar and unseen samples, employing vessel specific metrics. Our results show that while segmentations yielded reasonably high scores such as clDice values ranging from 0.82 to 0.88, certain errors persisted. Large vessels that collapsed due to the lack of hydrostatic pressure (HiP CT is an ex vivo technique) were segmented poorly. Moreover, decreased connectivity in finer vessels and higher segmentation errors at vessel boundaries were observed. Such errors obstruct the understanding of the structures by interrupting vascular tree connectivity. Through our review and outputs, we aim to set a benchmark for subsequent model evaluations using various modalities, especially with the HiP CT imaging database",

Previous works inherited the ideology of vision-to-language generation tasks,aiming to generate paragraphs with high consistency as reports.

Unfortunately, this confounder confuses the process of report generation worse because of the biased RRG data distribution. In this paper, to rethink this issue thoroughly, we reason about its causes and effects from a novel perspective of statistics and causality, where the Joint Vision Coupling and the Conditional Sentence Coherence Coupling are two aspects prone to implicitly decrease the accuracy of reports. Then, a counterfactual augmentation strategy that contains the Counterfactual Sample Synthesis and the Counterfactual Report Reconstruction sub-methods is proposed to break these two aspects of spurious effects.

Additionally, we observe that as data heterogeneity increases, the gap between higher feature norms for observed classes, obtained from local models, and feature norms of unobserved classes widens, in contrast to the behavior of classifier weight norms. This widening gap extends to encompass the feature norm disparities between local and the global models.

These deep learning based methods heavily rely on synthetic training data, and the performance will degrade when facing new tasks. In this paper, we propose a Transformer-style copy-move forgery detection network named as CMFDFormer, and provide a novel PCSD (Pooled Cube and Strip Distillation) continual learning framework to help CMFDFormer handle new tasks. CMFDFormer consists of a MiT (Mix Transformer) backbone network and a PHD (Pluggable Hybrid Decoder) mask prediction network. The MiT backbone network is a Transformer-style network which is adopted on the basis of comprehensive analyses with CNN-style and MLP-style backbones. The PHD network is constructed based on self-correlation computation, hierarchical feature integration, a multi-scale cycle fully-connected block and a mask reconstruction block. The PHD network is applicable to feature extractors of different styles for hierarchical multi-scale information extraction, achieving comparable performance. Last but not least, we propose a PCSD continual learning framework to improve the forgery detectability and avoid catastrophic forgetting when handling new tasks. Our continual learning framework restricts intermediate features from the PHD network, and takes advantage of both cube pooling and strip pooling.

    "abstract": "Digital pathology enables automatic analysis of histopathological sections using artificial intelligence (AI). Automatic evaluation could improve diagnostic efficiency and help find associations between morphological features and clinical outcome. For development of such prediction models, identifying invasive epithelial cells, and separating these from benign epithelial cells and in situ lesions would be the first step. In this study, we aimed to develop an AI model for segmentation of epithelial cells in sections from breast cancer. We generated epithelial ground truth masks by restaining hematoxylin and eosin (HE) sections with cytokeratin (CK) AE1/AE3, and by pathologists' annotations. HE/CK image pairs were used to train a convolutional neural network, and data augmentation was used to make the model more robust. Tissue microarrays (TMAs) from 839 patients, and whole slide images from two patients were used for training and evaluation of the models. The sections were derived from four cohorts of breast cancer patients. TMAs from 21 patients from a fifth cohort was used as a second test set. In quantitative evaluation, a mean Dice score of 0.70, 0.79, and 0.75 for invasive epithelial cells, benign epithelial cells, and in situ lesions, respectively, were achieved. In qualitative scoring (0-5) by pathologists, results were best for all epithelium and invasive epithelium, with scores of 4.7 and 4.4. Scores for benign epithelium and in situ lesions were 3.7 and 2.0. The proposed model segmented epithelial cells in HE stained breast cancer slides well, but further work is needed for accurate division between the classes. Immunohistochemistry, together with pathologists' annotations, enabled the creation of accurate ground truths.

In this work, we present ViStruct, a training framework to learn VLMs for effective visual structural knowledge extraction. Two novel designs are incorporated. First, we propose to leverage the inherent structure of programming language to depict visual structural information. This approach enables explicit and consistent representation of visual structural information of multiple granularities, such as concepts, relations, and events, in a well-organized structured format. Second, we introduce curriculum-based learning for VLMs to progressively comprehend visual structures, from fundamental visual concepts to intricate event structures. Our intuition is that lower-level knowledge may contribute to complex visual structure understanding. Furthermore, we compile and release a collection of datasets tailored for visual structural knowledge extraction. We adopt a weakly-supervised approach to directly generate visual event structures from captions for ViStruct training, capitalizing on abundant image-caption pairs from the web.

Our proposed framework overcomes these limitations by achieving superior average accuracy and time-space efficiency, bridging the performance gap between CL and classical machine learning. Specifically, we adopt an independent Generative Kernel Density Estimation (GKDE) model for each CL task. During the testing stage, the GKDEs utilize a self-reported max probability density value to determine which one is responsible for predicting incoming test instances. A GKDE-based learning objective can ensure that samples with the same label are grouped together, while dissimilar instances are pushed farther apart. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple CL datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. Our method outperforms popular CL approaches by a significant margin, while maintaining competitive time-space efficiency, making our framework suitable for real-world applications.

    "title": "DA-STC: Domain Adaptive Video Semantic Segmentation via Spatio-Temporal Consistency",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Video semantic segmentation is a pivotal aspect of video representation learning. However, significant domain shifts present a challenge in effectively learning invariant spatio-temporal features across the labeled source domain and unlabeled target domain for video semantic segmentation. To solve the challenge, we propose a novel DA-STC method for domain adaptive video semantic segmentation, which incorporates a bidirectional multi-level spatio-temporal fusion module and a category-aware spatio-temporal feature alignment module to facilitate consistent learning for domain-invariant features. Firstly, we perform bidirectional spatio-temporal fusion at the image sequence level and shallow feature level, leading to the construction of two fused intermediate video domains. This prompts the video semantic segmentation model to consistently learn spatio-temporal features of shared patch sequences which are influenced by domain-specific contexts, thereby mitigating the feature gap between the source and target domain. Secondly, we propose a category-aware feature alignment module to promote the consistency of spatio-temporal features, facilitating adaptation to the target domain. Specifically, we adaptively aggregate the domain-specific deep features of each category along spatio-temporal dimensions, which are further constrained to achieve cross-domain intra-class feature alignment and inter-class feature separation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which achieves state-of-the-art mIOUs on multiple challenging benchmarks. Furthermore, we extend the proposed DA-STC to the image domain, where it also exhibits superior performance for domain adaptive semantic segmentation.

    "title": "Towards Hetero-Client Federated Multi-Task Learning",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) enables joint training across distributed clients using their local data privately. Federated Multi-Task Learning (FMTL) builds on FL to handle multiple tasks, assuming model congruity that identical model architecture is deployed in each client. To relax this assumption and thus extend real-world applicability, we introduce a novel problem setting, Hetero-Client Federated Multi-Task Learning (HC-FMTL), to accommodate diverse task setups. The main challenge of HC-FMTL is the model incongruity issue that invalidates conventional aggregation methods. It also escalates the difficulties in accurate model aggregation to deal with data and task heterogeneity inherent in FMTL. To address these challenges, we propose the FedHCA$^2$ framework, which allows for federated training of personalized models by modeling relationships among heterogeneous clients. Drawing on our theoretical insights into the difference between multi-task and federated optimization, we propose the Hyper Conflict-Averse Aggregation scheme to mitigate conflicts during encoder updates. Additionally, inspired by task interaction in MTL, the Hyper Cross Attention Aggregation scheme uses layer-wise cross attention to enhance decoder interactions while alleviating model incongruity. Moreover, we employ learnable Hyper Aggregation Weights for each client to customize personalized parameter updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of FedHCA$^2$ in various HC-FMTL scenarios compared to representative methods. Our code will be made publicly available",

Accurate 3D tooth segmentation in IOSs is critical for various dental applications, while previous methods are error-prone at complicated boundaries and exhibit unsatisfactory results across patients. In this paper, we propose TSegFormer which captures both local and global dependencies among different teeth and the gingiva in the IOS point clouds with a multi-task 3D transformer architecture. Moreover, we design a geometry-guided loss based on a novel point curvature to refine boundaries in an end-to-end manner, avoiding time-consuming post-processing to reach clinically applicable segmentation. In addition, we create a dataset with 16,000 IOSs, the largest ever IOS dataset to the best of our knowledge. The experimental results demonstrate that our TSegFormer consistently surpasses existing state-of-the-art baselines.

    "title": "Using Human Feedback to Fine-tune Diffusion Models without Any Reward Model",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Using reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) has shown significant promise in fine-tuning diffusion models. Previous methods start by training a reward model that aligns with human preferences, then leverage RL techniques to fine-tune the underlying models. However, crafting an efficient reward model demands extensive datasets, optimal architecture, and manual hyperparameter tuning, making the process both time and cost-intensive. The direct preference optimization (DPO) method, effective in fine-tuning large language models, eliminates the necessity for a reward model. However, the extensive GPU memory requirement of the diffusion model's denoising process hinders the direct application of the DPO method. To address this issue, we introduce the Direct Preference for Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization (D3PO) method to directly fine-tune diffusion models. The theoretical analysis demonstrates that although D3PO omits training a reward model, it effectively functions as the optimal reward model trained using human feedback data to guide the learning process. This approach requires no training of a reward model, proving to be more direct, cost-effective, and minimizing computational overhead. In experiments, our method uses the relative scale of objectives as a proxy for human preference, delivering comparable results to methods using ground-truth rewards. Moreover, D3PO demonstrates the ability to reduce image distortion rates and generate safer images, overcoming challenges lacking robust reward models",

    "abstract": "Knowledge Distillation (KD) transfers knowledge from a larger \"teacher\" model to a compact \"student\" model, guiding the student with the \"dark knowledge\" $\\unicode{x2014}$ the implicit insights present in the teacher's soft predictions. Although existing KDs have shown the potential of transferring knowledge, the gap between the two parties still exists. With a series of investigations, we argue the gap is the result of the student's overconfidence in prediction, signaling an imbalanced focus on pronounced features while overlooking the subtle yet crucial dark knowledge. To overcome this, we introduce the Entropy-Reweighted Knowledge Distillation (ER-KD), a novel approach that leverages the entropy in the teacher's predictions to reweight the KD loss on a sample-wise basis. ER-KD precisely refocuses the student on challenging instances rich in the teacher's nuanced insights while reducing the emphasis on simpler cases, enabling a more balanced knowledge transfer. Consequently, ER-KD not only demonstrates compatibility with various state-of-the-art KD methods but also further enhances their performance at negligible cost. This approach offers a streamlined and effective strategy to refine the knowledge transfer process in KD, setting a new paradigm in the meticulous handling of dark knowledge.

    "abstract": "Retrieving textual information from natural scene images is an active research area in the field of computer vision with numerous practical applications. Detecting text regions and extracting text from signboards is a challenging problem due to special characteristics like reflecting lights, uneven illumination, or shadows found in real-life natural scene images. With the advent of deep learning-based methods, different sophisticated techniques have been proposed for text detection and text recognition from the natural scene. Though a significant amount of effort has been devoted to extracting natural scene text for resourceful languages like English, little has been done for low-resource languages like Bangla. In this research work, we have proposed an end-to-end system with deep learning-based models for efficiently detecting, recognizing, correcting, and parsing address information from Bangla signboards. We have created manually annotated datasets and synthetic datasets to train signboard detection, address text detection, address text recognition, address text correction, and address text parser models. We have conducted a comparative study among different CTC-based and Encoder-Decoder model architectures for Bangla address text recognition. Moreover, we have designed a novel address text correction model using a sequence-to-sequence transformer-based network to improve the performance of Bangla address text recognition model by post-correction.

    "abstract": "Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) has witnessed significant advancements in recent years, largely attributed to meticulously curated datasets and proficiently trained models. Nevertheless, when tested in diverse environments, the trained models inevitably encounter significant shifts in data distribution, highlighting that relying solely on pre-trained and fixed navigation models is insufficient. To enhance models' generalization ability, test-time adaptation (TTA) demonstrates significant potential in the computer vision field by leveraging unlabeled test samples for model updates. However, simply applying existing TTA methods to the VLN task cannot well handle the adaptability-stability dilemma of VLN models, i.e., frequent updates can result in drastic changes in model parameters, while occasional updates can make the models ill-equipped to handle dynamically changing environments. Therefore, we propose a Fast-Slow Test-Time Adaptation (FSTTA) approach for VLN by performing decomposition-accumulation analysis for both gradients and parameters in a unified framework. Specifically, in the fast update phase, gradients generated during the recent multi-step navigation process are decomposed into components with varying levels of consistency. Then, these components are adaptively accumulated to pinpoint a concordant direction for fast model adaptation. In the slow update phase, historically recorded parameters are gathered, and a similar decomposition-accumulation analysis is conducted to revert the model to a stable state.

However, the complexity of prompts acts as a bottleneck in the quality of images generated. A particular under-explored facet is the ability of generative models to create high-quality images comprising multiple components given as a prior. In this paper, we propose and validate a metric called Components Inclusion Score (CIS) to evaluate the extent to which a model can correctly generate multiple components. Our results reveal that the evaluated models struggle to incorporate all the visual elements from prompts with multiple components (8.53% drop in CIS per component for all evaluated models). We also identify a significant decline in the quality of the images and context awareness within an image as the number of components increased (15.91% decrease in inception Score and 9.62% increase in Frechet Inception Distance). To remedy this issue, we fine-tuned Stable Diffusion V2 on a custom-created test dataset with multiple components, outperforming its vanilla counterpart. To conclude, these findings reveal a critical limitation in existing text-to-image generators, shedding light on the challenge of generating multiple components within a single image using a complex prompt",

This framework embeds subtle watermarks into digital artworks to protect their copyrights while still preserving the artist's visual expression. If someone takes watermarked artworks as training data to mimic an artist's style, these watermarks can serve as detectable indicators. By analyzing the distribution of these watermarks in a series of generated images, acts of fine-tuning mimicry using stolen victim data will be exposed. In various fine-tune scenarios and against watermark attack methods, our research confirms that analyzing the distribution of watermarks in artificially generated images reliably detects unauthorized mimicry",

PIFU excels in capturing nuanced body shape variations within a low-dimensional space and has been extensively trained on human 3D scans. However, the application of PIFU to live animals poses significant challenges, primarily due to the inherent difficulty in obtaining the cooperation of animals for 3D scanning. In response to this challenge, we introduce the DRIFu model, specifically tailored for animal digitization. To train DRIFu, we employ a curated set of synthetic 3D animal models, encompassing diverse shapes, sizes, and even accounting for variations such as baby birds. Our innovative alignment tools play a pivotal role in mapping these diverse synthetic animal models onto a unified template, facilitating precise predictions of animal shape and texture. Crucially, our template alignment strategy establishes a shared shape space, allowing for the seamless sampling of new animal shapes, posing them realistically, animating them, and aligning them with real-world data. This groundbreaking approach revolutionizes our capacity to comprehensively understand and represent avian forms.

However, unlike conventional object detection tasks, urban-scene images vary greatly in style. For example, images taken on sunny days differ significantly from those taken on rainy days. Therefore, models trained on sunny day images may not generalize well to rainy day images. In this paper, we aim to solve the single-domain generalizable object detection task in urban scenarios, meaning that a model trained on images from one weather condition should be able to perform well on images from any other weather conditions. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Double AUGmentation (DoubleAUG) method that includes image- and feature-level augmentation schemes. In the image-level augmentation, we consider the variation in color information across different weather conditions and propose a Color Perturbation (CP) method that randomly exchanges the RGB channels to generate various images. In the feature-level augmentation, we propose to utilize a Dual-Style Memory (DSM) to explore the diverse style information on the entire dataset, further enhancing the model's generalization capability.

Many Transformer-based pose networks have been proposed recently, achieving encouraging progress in improving performance. However, the remarkable performance of pose networks is always accompanied by heavy computation costs and large network scale. In order to deal with this problem, this paper proposes a High-Efficiency Vision Transformer for Human Pose Estimation (HEViTPose). In HEViTPose, a Cascaded Group Spatial Reduction Multi-Head Attention Module (CGSR-MHA) is proposed, which reduces the computational cost through feature grouping and spatial degradation mechanisms, while preserving feature diversity through multiple low-dimensional attention heads. Moreover, a concept of Patch Embedded Overlap Width (PEOW) is defined to help understand the relationship between the amount of overlap and local continuity. By optimising PEOW, our model gains improvements in performance, parameters and GFLOPs. Comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets (MPII and COCO) demonstrate that the small and large HEViTPose models are on par with state-of-the-art models while being more lightweight. Specifically, HEViTPose-B achieves 90.7 PCK@0.5 on the MPII test set and 72.6 AP on the COCO test-dev2017 set.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Multi-view inverse rendering is the problem of estimating the scene parameters such as shapes, materials, or illuminations from a sequence of images captured under different viewpoints. Many approaches, however, assume single light bounce and thus fail to recover challenging scenarios like inter-reflections. On the other hand, simply extending those methods to consider multi-bounced light requires more assumptions to alleviate the ambiguity. To address this problem, we propose Neural Incident Stokes Fields (NeISF), a multi-view inverse rendering framework that reduces ambiguities using polarization cues. The primary motivation for using polarization cues is that it is the accumulation of multi-bounced light, providing rich information about geometry and material. Based on this knowledge, the proposed incident Stokes field efficiently models the accumulated polarization effect with the aid of an original physically-based differentiable polarimetric renderer. Lastly, experimental results show that our method outperforms the existing works in synthetic and real scenarios",

    "abstract": "In robotics, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are increasingly recognized for their largely-unrealized potential energy efficiency and low latency particularly when implemented on neuromorphic hardware. Our paper highlights three advancements for SNNs in Visual Place Recognition (VPR). First, we propose Modular SNNs, where each SNN represents a set of non-overlapping geographically distinct places, enabling scalable networks for large environments. Secondly, we present Ensembles of Modular SNNs, where multiple networks represent the same place, significantly enhancing accuracy compared to single-network models. Our SNNs are compact and small, comprising only 1500 neurons and 474k synapses, which makes them ideally suited for ensembling due to this small size. Lastly, we investigate the role of sequence matching in SNN-based VPR, a technique where consecutive images are used to refine place recognition. We analyze the responsiveness of SNNs to ensembling and sequence matching compared to other VPR techniques. Our contributions highlight the viability of SNNs for VPR, offering scalable and robust solutions, paving the way for their application in various energy-sensitive robotic tasks",

DiffSBR incorporates a differentiable ray tracing engine to simulate radar point clouds from virtual 3D models. A gradient-based optimizer refines the model parameters to minimize the discrepancy between simulated and real point clouds.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Off-resonance artifacts in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are visual distortions that occur when the actual resonant frequencies of spins within the imaging volume differ from the expected frequencies used to encode spatial information. These discrepancies can be caused by a variety of factors, including magnetic field inhomogeneities, chemical shifts, or susceptibility differences within the tissues. Such artifacts can manifest as blurring, ghosting, or misregistration of the reconstructed image, and they often compromise its diagnostic quality. We propose to resolve these artifacts by lifting the 2D MRI reconstruction problem to 3D, introducing an additional \"spectral\" dimension to model this off-resonance. Our approach is inspired by recent progress in modeling radiance fields, and is capable of reconstructing both static and dynamic MR images as well as separating fat and water, which is of independent clinical interest. We demonstrate our approach in the context of PROPELLER (Periodically Rotated Overlapping ParallEL Lines with Enhanced Reconstruction) MRI acquisitions, which are popular for their robustness to motion artifacts. Our method operates in a few minutes on a single GPU, and to our knowledge is the first to correct for chemical shift in gradient echo PROPELLER MRI reconstruction without additional measurements or pretraining data",

    "abstract": "The advent of learning with noisy labels (LNL), multi-rater learning, and human-AI collaboration has revolutionised the development of robust classifiers, enabling them to address the challenges posed by different types of data imperfections and complex decision processes commonly encountered in real-world applications. While each of these methodologies has individually made significant strides in addressing their unique challenges, the development of techniques that can simultaneously tackle these three problems remains underexplored. This paper addresses this research gap by integrating noisy-label learning, multi-rater learning, and human-AI collaboration with new benchmarks and the innovative Learning to Complement with Multiple Humans (LECOMH) approach. LECOMH optimises the level of human collaboration during testing, aiming to optimise classification accuracy while minimising collaboration costs that vary from 0 to M, where M is the maximum number of human collaborators. We quantitatively compare LECOMH with leading human-AI collaboration methods using our proposed benchmarks. LECOMH consistently outperforms the competition, with accuracy improving as collaboration costs increase.

    "title": "3D Face Style Transfer with a Hybrid Solution of NeRF and Mesh Rasterization",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Style transfer for human face has been widely researched in recent years. Majority of the existing approaches work in 2D image domain and have 3D inconsistency issue when applied on different viewpoints of the same face. In this paper, we tackle the problem of 3D face style transfer which aims at generating stylized novel views of a 3D human face with multi-view consistency. We propose to use a neural radiance field (NeRF) to represent 3D human face and combine it with 2D style transfer to stylize the 3D face. We find that directly training a NeRF on stylized images from 2D style transfer brings in 3D inconsistency issue and causes blurriness. On the other hand, training a NeRF jointly with 2D style transfer objectives shows poor convergence due to the identity and head pose gap between style image and content image. It also poses challenge in training time and memory due to the need of volume rendering for full image to apply style transfer loss functions. We therefore propose a hybrid framework of NeRF and mesh rasterization to combine the benefits of high fidelity geometry reconstruction of NeRF and fast rendering speed of mesh. Our framework consists of three stages: 1. Training a NeRF model on input face images to learn the 3D geometry; 2. Extracting a mesh from the trained NeRF model and optimizing it with style transfer objectives via differentiable rasterization; 3. Training a new color network in NeRF conditioned on a style embedding to enable arbitrary style transfer to the 3D face. Experiment results show that our approach generates high quality face style transfer with great 3D consistency, while also enabling a flexible style control",

    "abstract": "Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) tuned on machine-generated instruction-following data have demonstrated remarkable performance in various multi-modal understanding and generation tasks. However, the hallucinations inherent in machine-generated data, which could lead to hallucinatory outputs in MLLMs, remain under-explored. This work aims to investigate various hallucinations (i.e., object, relation, attribute hallucinations) and mitigate those hallucinatory toxicities in large-scale machine-generated visual instruction datasets. Drawing on the human ability to identify factual errors, we present a novel hallucination detection and elimination framework, HalluciDoctor, based on the cross-checking paradigm. We use our framework to identify and eliminate hallucinations in the training data automatically. Interestingly, HalluciDoctor also indicates that spurious correlations arising from long-tail object co-occurrences contribute to hallucinations. Based on that, we execute counterfactual visual instruction expansion to balance data distribution, thereby enhancing MLLMs' resistance to hallucinations. Comprehensive experiments on hallucination evaluation benchmarks show that our method successfully mitigates 44.6% hallucinations relatively and maintains competitive performance compared to LLaVA.The source code will be released at \\url{https://github.com/Yuqifan1117/HalluciDoctor}",

    "abstract": "Data augmentation is a powerful technique to enhance the performance of a deep learning task but has received less attention in 3D deep learning. It is well known that when 3D shapes are sparsely represented with low point density, the performance of the downstream tasks drops significantly. This work explores test-time augmentation (TTA) for 3D point clouds. We are inspired by the recent revolution of learning implicit representation and point cloud upsampling, which can produce high-quality 3D surface reconstruction and proximity-to-surface, respectively. Our idea is to leverage the implicit field reconstruction or point cloud upsampling techniques as a systematic way to augment point cloud data. Mainly, we test both strategies by sampling points from the reconstructed results and using the sampled point cloud as test-time augmented data. We show that both strategies are effective in improving accuracy. We observed that point cloud upsampling for test-time augmentation can lead to more significant performance improvement on downstream tasks such as object classification and segmentation on the ModelNet40, ShapeNet, ScanObjectNN, and SemanticKITTI datasets, especially for sparse point clouds",

The approach effectively dampens structured CS artefacts, which can be difficult to remove assuming sparse reconstruction, or relying solely on the inductive biases of CNN to produce noise-free images.

So the rightmost and the leftmost sides of the 360 panoramic image should be continued, which is the main challenge in this field.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Dataset pruning aims to construct a coreset capable of achieving performance comparable to the original, full dataset. Most existing dataset pruning methods rely on snapshot-based criteria to identify representative samples, often resulting in poor generalization across various pruning and cross-architecture scenarios. Recent studies have addressed this issue by expanding the scope of training dynamics considered, including factors such as forgetting event and probability change, typically using an averaging approach. However, these works struggle to integrate a broader range of training dynamics without overlooking well-generalized samples, which may not be sufficiently highlighted in an averaging manner. In this study, we propose a novel dataset pruning method termed as Temporal Dual-Depth Scoring (TDDS), to tackle this problem. TDDS utilizes a dual-depth strategy to achieve a balance between incorporating extensive training dynamics and identifying representative samples for dataset pruning. In the first depth, we estimate the series of each sample's individual contributions spanning the training progress, ensuring comprehensive integration of training dynamics. In the second depth, we focus on the variability of the sample-wise contributions identified in the first depth to highlight well-generalized samples. Extensive experiments conducted on CIFAR and ImageNet datasets verify the superiority of TDDS over previous SOTA methods. Specifically on CIFAR-100, our method achieves 54.51% accuracy with only 10% training data, surpassing random selection by 7.83% and other comparison methods by at least 12.69%",

    "abstract": "The compact cameras recording high-speed scenes with high resolution are highly demanded, but the required high bandwidth often leads to bulky, heavy systems, which limits their applications on low-capacity platforms. Adopting a coded exposure setup to encode a frame sequence into a blurry snapshot and retrieve the latent sharp video afterward can serve as a lightweight solution. However, restoring motion from blur is quite challenging due to the high ill-posedness of motion blur decomposition, intrinsic ambiguity in motion direction, and diverse motions in natural videos. In this work, by leveraging classical coded exposure imaging technique and emerging implicit neural representation for videos, we tactfully embed the motion direction cues into the blurry image during the imaging process and develop a novel self-recursive neural network to sequentially retrieve the latent video sequence from the blurry image utilizing the embedded motion direction cues. To validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework, we conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and real-captured blurry images.

Conversely, point annotation, which treats objects as single points, offers a cost-effective alternative to rotated and horizontal bounding boxes but sacrifices performance due to the loss of size and orientation information. In this study, we introduce the P2RBox network, which leverages point annotations and a mask generator to create mask proposals, followed by filtration through our Inspector Module and Constrainer Module. This process selects high-quality masks, which are subsequently converted into rotated box annotations for training a fully supervised detector. Specifically, we've thoughtfully crafted an Inspector Module rooted in multi-instance learning principles to evaluate the semantic score of masks. We've also proposed a more robust mask quality assessment in conjunction with the Constrainer Module. Furthermore, we've introduced a Symmetry Axis Estimation (SAE) Module inspired by the spectral theorem for symmetric matrices to transform the top-performing mask proposal into rotated bounding boxes. P2RBox performs well with three fully supervised rotated object detectors: RetinaNet, Rotated FCOS, and Oriented R-CNN. By combining with Oriented R-CNN, P2RBox achieves 62.26% on DOTA-v1.0 test dataset. As far as we know, this is the first attempt at training an oriented object detector with point supervision",

    "abstract": "Text-to-image diffusion models allow seamless generation of personalized images from scant reference photos. Yet, these tools, in the wrong hands, can fabricate misleading or harmful content, endangering individuals. To address this problem, existing poisoning-based approaches perturb user images in an imperceptible way to render them \"unlearnable\" from malicious uses. We identify two limitations of these defending approaches: i) sub-optimal due to the hand-crafted heuristics for solving the intractable bilevel optimization and ii) lack of robustness against simple data transformations like Gaussian filtering. To solve these challenges, we propose MetaCloak, which solves the bi-level poisoning problem with a meta-learning framework with an additional transformation sampling process to craft transferable and robust perturbation. Specifically, we employ a pool of surrogate diffusion models to craft transferable and model-agnostic perturbation. Furthermore, by incorporating an additional transformation process, we design a simple denoising-error maximization loss that is sufficient for causing transformation-robust semantic distortion and degradation in a personalized generation. Extensive experiments on the VGGFace2 and CelebA-HQ datasets show that MetaCloak outperforms existing approaches. Notably, MetaCloak can successfully fool online training services like Replicate, in a black-box manner, demonstrating the effectiveness of MetaCloak in real-world scenarios.

Nevertheless, applying LLMs as a text recognizer is unacceptably resource-consuming. Moreover, our pilot experiments on LLMs show that ICL fails in STR, mainly attributed to the insufficient incorporation of contextual information from diverse samples in the training stage. To this end, we introduce E$^2$STR, a STR model trained with context-rich scene text sequences, where the sequences are generated via our proposed in-context training strategy. E$^2$STR demonstrates that a regular-sized model is sufficient to achieve effective ICL capabilities in STR.

    "title": "White-Box Transformers via Sparse Rate Reduction: Compression Is All There Is?",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we contend that a natural objective of representation learning is to compress and transform the distribution of the data, say sets of tokens, towards a low-dimensional Gaussian mixture supported on incoherent subspaces. The goodness of such a representation can be evaluated by a principled measure, called sparse rate reduction, that simultaneously maximizes the intrinsic information gain and extrinsic sparsity of the learned representation. From this perspective, popular deep network architectures, including transformers, can be viewed as realizing iterative schemes to optimize this measure. Particularly, we derive a transformer block from alternating optimization on parts of this objective: the multi-head self-attention operator compresses the representation by implementing an approximate gradient descent step on the coding rate of the features, and the subsequent multi-layer perceptron sparsifies the features. This leads to a family of white-box transformer-like deep network architectures, named CRATE, which are mathematically fully interpretable. We show, by way of a novel connection between denoising and compression, that the inverse to the aforementioned compressive encoding can be realized by the same class of CRATE architectures. Thus, the so-derived white-box architectures are universal to both encoders and decoders. Experiments show that these networks, despite their simplicity, indeed learn to compress and sparsify representations of large-scale real-world image and text datasets, and achieve performance very close to highly engineered transformer-based models: ViT, MAE, DINO, BERT, and GPT2. We believe the proposed computational framework demonstrates great potential in bridging the gap between theory and practice of deep learning, from a unified perspective of data compression.

Non-invasive coronary CT angiography (CCTA) is presently used to obtain measures of the thickness, volume, and attenuation of fat deposition. However, prior works solely focus on measuring PCAT using semi-automated approaches at the right coronary artery (RCA) over the left coronary artery (LCA). In this pilot work, we developed a fully automated approach for the measurement of PCAT mean attenuation and volume in the region around both coronary arteries. First, we used a large subset of patients from the public ImageCAS dataset (n = 735) to train a 3D full resolution nnUNet to segment LCA and RCA. Then, we automatically measured PCAT in the surrounding arterial regions. We evaluated our method on a held-out test set of patients (n = 183) from the same dataset. A mean Dice score of 83% and PCAT attenuation of -73.81 $\\pm$ 12.69 HU was calculated for the RCA, while a mean Dice score of 81% and PCAT attenuation of -77.51 $\\pm$ 7.94 HU was computed for the LCA. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to develop a fully automated method to measure PCAT attenuation and volume at both the RCA and LCA. Our work underscores how automated PCAT measurement holds promise as a biomarker for identification of inflammation and cardiac disease",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "We show that physics-based simulations can be seamlessly integrated with NeRF to generate high-quality elastodynamics of real-world objects. Unlike existing methods, we discretize nonlinear hyperelasticity in a meshless way, obviating the necessity for intermediate auxiliary shape proxies like a tetrahedral mesh or voxel grid. A quadratic generalized moving least square (Q-GMLS) is employed to capture nonlinear dynamics and large deformation on the implicit model. Such meshless integration enables versatile simulations of complex and codimensional shapes. We adaptively place the least-square kernels according to the NeRF density field to significantly reduce the complexity of the nonlinear simulation. As a result, physically realistic animations can be conveniently synthesized using our method for a wide range of hyperelastic materials at an interactive rate.

    "title": "Stable Unlearnable Example: Enhancing the Robustness of Unlearnable Examples via Stable Error-Minimizing Noise",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The open source of large amounts of image data promotes the development of deep learning techniques. Along with this comes the privacy risk of these open-source image datasets being exploited by unauthorized third parties to train deep learning models for commercial or illegal purposes. To avoid the abuse of public data, a poisoning-based technique, the unlearnable example, is proposed to significantly degrade the generalization performance of models by adding a kind of imperceptible noise to the data. To further enhance its robustness against adversarial training, existing works leverage iterative adversarial training on both the defensive noise and the surrogate model. However, it still remains unknown whether the robustness of unlearnable examples primarily comes from the effect of enhancement in the surrogate model or the defensive noise. Observing that simply removing the adversarial noise on the training process of the defensive noise can improve the performance of robust unlearnable examples, we identify that solely the surrogate model's robustness contributes to the performance. Furthermore, we found a negative correlation exists between the robustness of defensive noise and the protection performance, indicating defensive noise's instability issue. Motivated by this, to further boost the robust unlearnable example, we introduce stable error-minimizing noise (SEM), which trains the defensive noise against random perturbation instead of the time-consuming adversarial perturbation to improve the stability of defensive noise. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that SEM achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet Subset in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.

    "title": "On the Limitation of Diffusion Models for Synthesizing Training Datasets",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Synthetic samples from diffusion models are promising for leveraging in training discriminative models as replications of real training datasets. However, we found that the synthetic datasets degrade classification performance over real datasets even when using state-of-the-art diffusion models. This means that modern diffusion models do not perfectly represent the data distribution for the purpose of replicating datasets for training discriminative tasks. This paper investigates the gap between synthetic and real samples by analyzing the synthetic samples reconstructed from real samples through the diffusion and reverse process. By varying the time steps starting the reverse process in the reconstruction, we can control the trade-off between the information in the original real data and the information added by diffusion models. Through assessing the reconstructed samples and trained models, we found that the synthetic data are concentrated in modes of the training data distribution as the reverse step increases, and thus, they are difficult to cover the outer edges of the distribution. Our findings imply that modern diffusion models are insufficient to replicate training data distribution perfectly, and there is room for the improvement of generative modeling in the replication of training datasets",

    "abstract": "Multimedia generation approaches occupy a prominent place in artificial intelligence research. Text-to-image models achieved high-quality results over the last few years. However, video synthesis methods recently started to develop. This paper presents a new two-stage latent diffusion text-to-video generation architecture based on the text-to-image diffusion model. The first stage concerns keyframes synthesis to figure the storyline of a video, while the second one is devoted to interpolation frames generation to make movements of the scene and objects smooth. We compare several temporal conditioning approaches for keyframes generation. The results show the advantage of using separate temporal blocks over temporal layers in terms of metrics reflecting video generation quality aspects and human preference. The design of our interpolation model significantly reduces computational costs compared to other masked frame interpolation approaches. Furthermore, we evaluate different configurations of MoVQ-based video decoding scheme to improve consistency and achieve higher PSNR, SSIM, MSE, and LPIPS scores. Finally, we compare our pipeline with existing solutions and achieve top-2 scores overall and top-1 among open-source solutions: CLIPSIM = 0.2976 and FVD = 433.054.

    "abstract": "Semantic segmentation, a crucial task in computer vision, often relies on labor-intensive and costly annotated datasets for training. In response to this challenge, we introduce FuseNet, a dual-stream framework for self-supervised semantic segmentation that eliminates the need for manual annotation. FuseNet leverages the shared semantic dependencies between the original and augmented images to create a clustering space, effectively assigning pixels to semantically related clusters, and ultimately generating the segmentation map. Additionally, FuseNet incorporates a cross-modal fusion technique that extends the principles of CLIP by replacing textual data with augmented images. This approach enables the model to learn complex visual representations, enhancing robustness against variations similar to CLIP's text invariance. To further improve edge alignment and spatial consistency between neighboring pixels, we introduce an edge refinement loss. This loss function considers edge information to enhance spatial coherence, facilitating the grouping of nearby pixels with similar visual features. Extensive experiments on skin lesion and lung segmentation datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. \\href{https://github.com/xmindflow/FuseNet}{Codebase.}",

    "title": "Descriptor and Word Soups: Overcoming the Parameter Efficiency Accuracy Tradeoff for Out-of-Distribution Few-shot Learning",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Over the past year, a large body of multimodal research has emerged around zero-shot evaluation using GPT descriptors. These studies boost the zero-shot accuracy of pretrained VL models with an ensemble of label-specific text generated by GPT. A recent study, WaffleCLIP, demonstrated that similar zero-shot accuracy can be achieved with an ensemble of random descriptors. However, both zero-shot methods are un-trainable and consequently sub-optimal when some few-shot out-of-distribution (OOD) training data is available. Inspired by these prior works, we present two more flexible methods called descriptor and word soups, which do not require an LLM at test time and can leverage training data to increase OOD target accuracy. Descriptor soup greedily selects a small set of textual descriptors using generic few-shot training data, then calculates robust class embeddings using the selected descriptors. Word soup greedily assembles a chain of words in a similar manner. Compared to existing few-shot soft prompt tuning methods, word soup requires fewer parameters by construction and less GPU memory, since it does not require backpropagation. Both soups outperform current published few-shot methods, even when combined with SoTA zero-shot methods, on cross-dataset and domain generalization benchmarks. Compared with SoTA prompt and descriptor ensembling methods, such as ProDA and WaffleCLIP, word soup achieves higher OOD accuracy with fewer ensemble members.

Image mosaicking is a technique for aligning multiple overlapping images to obtain a larger FoV. Current mosaicking pipelines often struggle with substantial noise and considerable displacement between the input sub-fields. In this paper, we propose a versatile pipeline for stitching multi-view OCT/OCTA \\textit{en face} projection images. Our method combines the strengths of learning-based feature matching and robust pixel-based registration to align multiple images effectively. Furthermore, we advance the application of a trained foundational model, Segment Anything Model (SAM), to validate mosaicking results in an unsupervised manner. The efficacy of our pipeline is validated using an in-house dataset and a large public dataset, where our method shows superior performance in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency.

We address the topic of estimating monocular depth from defocus blur which can yield more accurate results than the semantic based depth estimation methods. The existing monocular depth from defocus techniques are sensitive to the particular camera that the images are taken from. We show how several camera-related parameters affect the defocus blur using optical physics equations and how they make the defocus blur depend on these parameters. The simple correction procedure we propose can alleviate this problem which does not require any retraining of the original model. We created a synthetic dataset which can be used to test the camera independent performance of depth from defocus blur models. We evaluate our model on both synthetic and real datasets (DDFF12 and NYU depth V2) obtained with different cameras and show that our methods are significantly more robust to the changes of cameras.

First, independent feature extraction is performed on each input surface using graph convolutions, generating low-dimensional feature representations that capture important cortical surface characteristics. Subsequently, features are registered in a deep-discrete manner to optimize the overlap of common structures across surfaces by learning displacements of a set of control points. To ensure smooth and biologically plausible deformations, we implement regularization through a deep conditional random field implemented with a recurrent neural network. Experimental results demonstrate that GeoMorph surpasses existing deep-learning methods by achieving improved alignment with smoother deformations. Furthermore, GeoMorph exhibits competitive performance compared to classical frameworks. Such versatility and robustness suggest strong potential for various neuroscience applications",

    "abstract": "Geographic privacy, a crucial aspect of personal security, often goes unnoticed in daily activities. This paper addresses the underestimation of this privacy in the context of increasing online data sharing and the advancements in information gathering technologies. With the surge in the use of Large Multimodal Models, such as GPT-4, for Open Source Intelligence (OSINT), the potential risks associated with geographic privacy breaches have intensified. This study highlights the criticality of these developments, focusing on their implications for individual privacy. The primary objective is to demonstrate the capabilities of advanced AI tools, specifically a GPT-4 based model named \"Dr. Watson,\" in identifying and potentially compromising geographic privacy through online shared content. We developed \"Dr. Watson\" to analyze and extract geographic information from publicly available data sources. The study involved five experimental cases, each offering different perspectives on the tool's application in extracting precise location data from partial images and social media content. The experiments revealed that \"Dr. Watson\" could successfully identify specific geographic details, thereby exposing the vulnerabilities in current geo-privacy measures. These findings underscore the ease with which geographic information can be unintentionally disclosed. The paper concludes with a discussion on the broader implications of these findings for individuals and the community at large. It emphasizes the urgency for enhanced awareness and protective measures against geo-privacy leakage in the era of advanced AI and widespread social media usage",

Although existing studies show promising results, they are mainly based on pixel-based approaches with traditional machine learning methods, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are uncommon. To study the use of CNNs on SOC remote sensing, here we propose the FNO-DenseNet based on the Fourier neural operator (FNO). By combining the advantages of the FNO and DenseNet, the FNO-DenseNet outperformed the FNO in our experiments with hundreds of times fewer parameters.

    "abstract": "Robustly evaluating deep learning image classifiers is challenging due to some limitations of standard datasets. Natural Adversarial Examples (NAEs), arising naturally from the environment and capable of deceiving classifiers, are instrumental in identifying vulnerabilities in trained models. Existing works collect such NAEs by filtering from a huge set of real images, a process that is passive and lacks control. In this work, we propose to actively synthesize NAEs with the state-of-the-art Stable Diffusion. Specifically, our method formulates a controlled optimization process, where we perturb the token embedding that corresponds to a specified class to synthesize NAEs. The generation is guided by the gradient of loss from the target classifier so that the created image closely mimics the ground-truth class yet fools the classifier. Named SD-NAE (Stable Diffusion for Natural Adversarial Examples), our innovative method is effective in producing valid and useful NAEs, which is demonstrated through a meticulously designed experiment. Our work thereby provides a valuable method for obtaining challenging evaluation data, which in turn can potentially advance the development of more robust deep learning models.

This study addresses the inherent challenges in this domain, notably the detection of small objects, managing densely packed elements, and accounting for diverse orientations. We present an in-depth evaluation of an object detection model that integrates the Large Selective Kernel Network (LSKNet)as its backbone with the DiffusionDet head, utilizing the iSAID dataset for empirical analysis. Our approach encompasses the introduction of novel methodologies and extensive ablation studies. These studies critically assess various aspects such as loss functions, box regression techniques, and classification strategies to refine the model's precision in object detection. The paper details the experimental application of the LSKNet backbone in synergy with the DiffusionDet heads, a combination tailored to meet the specific challenges in aerial image object detection. The findings of this research indicate a substantial enhancement in the model's performance, especially in the accuracy-time tradeoff.

Differentiable rendering of the simulated mesh enables pixel-wise comparisons between the reconstruction and a target video sequence that can be used for a gradient-based optimization procedure to extract not only shape information but also physical parameters such as stretching, shearing, or bending stiffness of the cloth. This allows to retain a precise, stable, and smooth reconstructed geometry while reducing the runtime by a factor of 400-500 compared to $\\phi$-SfT, a state-of-the-art physics-based SfT approach",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In the realm of large multi-modal models (LMMs), efficient modality alignment is crucial yet often constrained by the scarcity of high-quality image-text data. To address this bottleneck, we introduce the ShareGPT4V dataset, a pioneering large-scale resource featuring 1.2 million highly descriptive captions, which surpasses existing datasets in diversity and information content, covering world knowledge, object properties, spatial relationships, and aesthetic evaluations. Specifically, ShareGPT4V originates from a curated 100K high-quality captions collected from advanced GPT4-Vision and has been expanded to 1.2M with a superb caption model trained on this subset. ShareGPT4V first demonstrates its effectiveness for the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) phase, by substituting an equivalent quantity of detailed captions in existing SFT datasets with a subset of our high-quality captions, significantly enhancing the LMMs like LLaVA-7B, LLaVA-1.5-13B, and Qwen-VL-Chat-7B on the MME and MMBench benchmarks, with respective gains of 222.8/22.0/22.3 and 2.7/1.3/1.5. We further incorporate ShareGPT4V data into both the pre-training and SFT phases, obtaining ShareGPT4V-7B, a superior LMM based on a simple architecture that has remarkable performance across a majority of the multi-modal benchmarks. This project is available at https://ShareGPT4V.github.io to serve as a pivotal resource for advancing the LMMs community",

    "abstract": "Intrinsic decomposition is a fundamental mid-level vision problem that plays a crucial role in various inverse rendering and computational photography pipelines. Generating highly accurate intrinsic decompositions is an inherently under-constrained task that requires precisely estimating continuous-valued shading and albedo. In this work, we achieve high-resolution intrinsic decomposition by breaking the problem into two parts. First, we present a dense ordinal shading formulation using a shift- and scale-invariant loss in order to estimate ordinal shading cues without restricting the predictions to obey the intrinsic model. We then combine low- and high-resolution ordinal estimations using a second network to generate a shading estimate with both global coherency and local details. We encourage the model to learn an accurate decomposition by computing losses on the estimated shading as well as the albedo implied by the intrinsic model. We develop a straightforward method for generating dense pseudo ground truth using our model's predictions and multi-illumination data, enabling generalization to in-the-wild imagery. We present an exhaustive qualitative and quantitative analysis of our predicted intrinsic components against state-of-the-art methods. Finally, we demonstrate the real-world applicability of our estimations by performing otherwise difficult editing tasks such as recoloring and relighting",

    "abstract": "Understanding videos is an important research topic for multimodal learning. Leveraging large-scale datasets of web-crawled video-text pairs as weak supervision has become a pre-training paradigm for learning joint representations and showcased remarkable potential in video understanding tasks. However, videos can be multi-event and multi-grained, while these video-text pairs usually contain only broad-level video captions. This raises a question: with such weak supervision, can video representation in video-language models gain the ability to distinguish even factual discrepancies in textual description and understand fine-grained events? To address this, we introduce SPOT Prober, to benchmark existing video-language models's capacities of distinguishing event-level discrepancies as an indicator of models' event understanding ability. Our approach involves extracting events as tuples (<Subject, Predicate, Object, Attribute, Timestamps>) from videos and generating false event tuples by manipulating tuple components systematically. We reevaluate the existing video-language models with these positive and negative captions and find they fail to distinguish most of the manipulated events. Based on our findings, we propose to plug in these manipulated event captions as hard negative samples and find them effective in enhancing models for event understanding",

    "abstract": "We propose a method to allow precise and extremely fast mesh extraction from 3D Gaussian Splatting. Gaussian Splatting has recently become very popular as it yields realistic rendering while being significantly faster to train than NeRFs. It is however challenging to extract a mesh from the millions of tiny 3D gaussians as these gaussians tend to be unorganized after optimization and no method has been proposed so far. Our first key contribution is a regularization term that encourages the gaussians to align well with the surface of the scene. We then introduce a method that exploits this alignment to extract a mesh from the Gaussians using Poisson reconstruction, which is fast, scalable, and preserves details, in contrast to the Marching Cubes algorithm usually applied to extract meshes from Neural SDFs. Finally, we introduce an optional refinement strategy that binds gaussians to the surface of the mesh, and jointly optimizes these Gaussians and the mesh through Gaussian splatting rendering. This enables easy editing, sculpting, rigging, animating, compositing and relighting of the Gaussians using traditional softwares by manipulating the mesh instead of the gaussians themselves. Retrieving such an editable mesh for realistic rendering is done within minutes with our method, compared to hours with the state-of-the-art methods on neural SDFs, while providing a better rendering quality",

    "abstract": "Iris recognition systems, operating in the near infrared spectrum (NIR), have demonstrated vulnerability to presentation attacks, where an adversary uses artifacts such as cosmetic contact lenses, artificial eyes or printed iris images in order to circumvent the system. At the same time, a number of effective presentation attack detection (PAD) methods have been developed. These methods have demonstrated success in detecting artificial eyes (e.g., fake Van Dyke eyes) as presentation attacks. In this work, we seek to alter the optical characteristics of artificial eyes by affixing Vanadium Dioxide (VO2) films on their surface in various spatial configurations. VO2 films can be used to selectively transmit NIR light and can, therefore, be used to regulate the amount of NIR light from the object that is captured by the iris sensor. We study the impact of such images produced by the sensor on two state-of-the-art iris PA detection methods. We observe that the addition of VO2 films on the surface of artificial eyes can cause the PA detection methods to misclassify them as bonafide eyes in some cases. This represents a vulnerability that must be systematically analyzed and effectively addressed",

    "abstract": "Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) is a crucial task in low-level computer vision, aiming to reconstruct high-resolution images from low-resolution counterparts. Conventional attention mechanisms have significantly improved SISR performance but often result in complex network structures and large number of parameters, leading to slow inference speed and large model size. To address this issue, we propose the Swift Parameter-free Attention Network (SPAN), a highly efficient SISR model that balances parameter count, inference speed, and image quality. SPAN employs a novel parameter-free attention mechanism, which leverages symmetric activation functions and residual connections to enhance high-contribution information and suppress redundant information. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of this design in achieving the attention mechanism's purpose. We evaluate SPAN on multiple benchmarks, showing that it outperforms existing efficient super-resolution models in terms of both image quality and inference speed, achieving a significant quality-speed trade-off. This makes SPAN highly suitable for real-world applications, particularly in resource-constrained scenarios. Notably, our model attains the best PSNR of 27.09 dB, and the test runtime of our team is reduced by 7.08ms in the NTIRE 2023 efficient super-resolution challenge.

In this work, we assess the sensitivity of DNNs against perturbations to their weight and bias parameters. The sensitivity analysis involves three DNN architectures (VGG, ResNet, and DenseNet), three types of parameter perturbations (Gaussian noise, weight zeroing, and weight scaling), and two settings (entire network and layer-wise). We perform experiments in the context of iris presentation attack detection and evaluate on two publicly available datasets: LivDet-Iris-2017 and LivDet-Iris-2020. Based on the sensitivity analysis, we propose improved models simply by perturbing parameters of the network without undergoing training. We further combine these perturbed models at the score-level and at the parameter-level to improve the performance over the original model. The ensemble at the parameter-level shows an average improvement of 43.58% on the LivDet-Iris-2017 dataset and 9.25% on the LivDet-Iris-2020 dataset.

In this work, we present a method that automatically adds motion to a single-subject sketch (hence, \"breathing life into it\"), merely by providing a text prompt indicating the desired motion. The output is a short animation provided in vector representation, which can be easily edited. Our method does not require extensive training, but instead leverages the motion prior of a large pretrained text-to-video diffusion model using a score-distillation loss to guide the placement of strokes. To promote natural and smooth motion and to better preserve the sketch's appearance, we model the learned motion through two components. The first governs small local deformations and the second controls global affine transformations. Surprisingly, we find that even models that struggle to generate sketch videos on their own can still serve as a useful backbone for animating abstract representations",

    "abstract": "3D occupancy prediction is an important task for the robustness of vision-centric autonomous driving, which aims to predict whether each point is occupied in the surrounding 3D space. Existing methods usually require 3D occupancy labels to produce meaningful results. However, it is very laborious to annotate the occupancy status of each voxel. In this paper, we propose SelfOcc to explore a self-supervised way to learn 3D occupancy using only video sequences. We first transform the images into the 3D space (e.g., bird's eye view) to obtain 3D representation of the scene. We directly impose constraints on the 3D representations by treating them as signed distance fields. We can then render 2D images of previous and future frames as self-supervision signals to learn the 3D representations. We propose an MVS-embedded strategy to directly optimize the SDF-induced weights with multiple depth proposals. Our SelfOcc outperforms the previous best method SceneRF by 58.7% using a single frame as input on SemanticKITTI and is the first self-supervised work that produces reasonable 3D occupancy for surround cameras on Occ3D. SelfOcc produces high-quality depth and achieves state-of-the-art results on novel depth synthesis, monocular depth estimation, and surround-view depth estimation on the SemanticKITTI, KITTI-2015, and nuScenes, respectively.

    "abstract": "The latest generation of transformer-based vision models have proven to be superior to Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based models across several vision tasks, largely attributed to their remarkable prowess in relation modeling. Deformable vision transformers significantly reduce the quadratic complexity of modeling attention by using sparse attention structures, enabling them to be used in larger scale applications such as multi-view vision systems. Recent work demonstrated adversarial attacks against transformers; we show that these attacks do not transfer to deformable transformers due to their sparse attention structure. Specifically, attention in deformable transformers is modeled using pointers to the most relevant other tokens. In this work, we contribute for the first time adversarial attacks that manipulate the attention of deformable transformers, distracting them to focus on irrelevant parts of the image. We also develop new collaborative attacks where a source patch manipulates attention to point to a target patch that adversarially attacks the system. In our experiments, we find that only 1% patched area of the input field can lead to 0% AP. We also show that the attacks provide substantial versatility to support different attacker scenarios because of their ability to redirect attention under the attacker control",

Even though this is true in general, we show here that it is possible to construct planner inputs that score very highly on various perception quality metrics but still lead to planning failures. In an analogy to adversarial attacks on image classifiers, we call such inputs \\textbf{adversarial perception errors} and show they can be systematically constructed using a simple boundary-attack algorithm. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this algorithm by finding attacks for two different black-box planners in several urban and highway driving scenarios using the CARLA simulator.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Scene segmentation via unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) enables the transfer of knowledge acquired from source synthetic data to real-world target data, which largely reduces the need for manual pixel-level annotations in the target domain. To facilitate domain-invariant feature learning, existing methods typically mix data from both the source domain and target domain by simply copying and pasting the pixels. Such vanilla methods are usually sub-optimal since they do not take into account how well the mixed layouts correspond to real-world scenarios. Real-world scenarios are with an inherent layout. We observe that semantic categories, such as sidewalks, buildings, and sky, display relatively consistent depth distributions, and could be clearly distinguished in a depth map. Based on such observation, we propose a depth-aware framework to explicitly leverage depth estimation to mix the categories and facilitate the two complementary tasks, i.e., segmentation and depth learning in an end-to-end manner. In particular, the framework contains a Depth-guided Contextual Filter (DCF) forndata augmentation and a cross-task encoder for contextual learning. DCF simulates the real-world layouts, while the cross-task encoder further adaptively fuses the complementing features between two tasks. Besides, it is worth noting that several public datasets do not provide depth annotation. Therefore, we leverage the off-the-shelf depth estimation network to generate the pseudo depth. Extensive experiments show that our proposed methods, even with pseudo depth, achieve competitive performance on two widely-used bench-marks, i.e. 77.7 mIoU on GTA to Cityscapes and 69.3 mIoU on Synthia to Cityscapes",

    "abstract": "Capturing smooth motions from videos using markerless techniques typically involves complex processes such as temporal constraints, multiple stages with data-driven regression and optimization, and bundle solving over temporal windows. These processes can be inefficient and require tuning multiple objectives across stages. In contrast, BundleMoCap introduces a novel and efficient approach to this problem. It solves the motion capture task in a single stage, eliminating the need for temporal smoothness objectives while still delivering smooth motions. BundleMoCap outperforms the state-of-the-art without increasing complexity. The key concept behind BundleMoCap is manifold interpolation between latent keyframes. By relying on a local manifold smoothness assumption, we can efficiently solve a bundle of frames using a single code. Additionally, the method can be implemented as a sliding window optimization and requires only the first frame to be properly initialized, reducing the overall computational burden. BundleMoCap's strength lies in its ability to achieve high-quality motion capture results with simplicity and efficiency. More details can be found at https://moverseai.github.io/bundle/",

In contrast to LLMs, human preference learning has not been widely explored in text-to-image diffusion models; the best existing approach is to fine-tune a pretrained model using carefully curated high quality images and captions to improve visual appeal and text alignment. We propose Diffusion-DPO, a method to align diffusion models to human preferences by directly optimizing on human comparison data. Diffusion-DPO is adapted from the recently developed Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), a simpler alternative to RLHF which directly optimizes a policy that best satisfies human preferences under a classification objective. We re-formulate DPO to account for a diffusion model notion of likelihood, utilizing the evidence lower bound to derive a differentiable objective. Using the Pick-a-Pic dataset of 851K crowdsourced pairwise preferences, we fine-tune the base model of the state-of-the-art Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL)-1.0 model with Diffusion-DPO. Our fine-tuned base model significantly outperforms both base SDXL-1.0 and the larger SDXL-1.0 model consisting of an additional refinement model in human evaluation, improving visual appeal and prompt alignment. We also develop a variant that uses AI feedback and has comparable performance to training on human preferences, opening the door for scaling of diffusion model alignment methods",

    "abstract": "This study outlines a comprehensive methodology for verifying medical documents, integrating advanced techniques in template extraction, comparison, and fraud detection. It begins with template extraction using sophisticated region-of-interest (ROI) methods, incorporating contour analysis and edge identification. Pre-processing steps ensure template clarity through morphological operations and adaptive thresholding. The template comparison algorithm utilizes advanced feature matching with key points and descriptors, enhancing robustness through histogram-based analysis for accounting variations. Fraud detection involves the SSIM computation and OCR for textual information extraction. The SSIM quantifies structural similarity, aiding in potential match identification. OCR focuses on critical areas like patient details, provider information, and billing amounts. Extracted information is compared with a reference dataset, and confidence thresholding ensures reliable fraud detection. Adaptive parameters enhance system flexibility for dynamic adjustments to varying document layouts. This methodology provides a robust approach to medical document verification, addressing complexities in template extraction, comparison, fraud detection, and adaptability to diverse document structures",

Such a 3-D projective representation is view-invariant in the sense that it can be easily mapped into an image set-point without any knowledge about the camera parameters.

    "title": "Hand-Eye Calibration",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Whenever a sensor is mounted on a robot hand it is important to know the relationship between the sensor and the hand. The problem of determining this relationship is referred to as hand-eye calibration, which is important in at least two types of tasks: (i) map sensor centered measurements into the robot workspace and (ii) allow the robot to precisely move the sensor. In the past some solutions were proposed in the particular case of a camera. With almost no exception, all existing solutions attempt to solve the homogeneous matrix equation AX=XB. First we show that there are two possible formulations of the hand-eye calibration problem. One formulation is the classical one that we just mentioned. A second formulation takes the form of the following homogeneous matrix equation: MY=M'YB. The advantage of the latter is that the extrinsic and intrinsic camera parameters need not be made explicit. Indeed, this formulation directly uses the 3 by 4 perspective matrices (M and M') associated with two positions of the camera. Moreover, this formulation together with the classical one cover a wider range of camera-based sensors to be calibrated with respect to the robot hand. Second, we develop a common mathematical framework to solve for the hand-eye calibration problem using either of the two formulations. We present two methods, (i) a rotation then translation and (ii) a non-linear solver for rotation and translation. Third, we perform a stability analysis both for our two methods and for the classical linear method of Tsai and Lenz (1989). In the light of this comparison, the non-linear optimization method, that solves for rotation and translation simultaneously, seems to be the most robust one with respect to noise and to measurement errors",

    "title": "Mobile-Seed: Joint Semantic Segmentation and Boundary Detection for Mobile Robots",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Precise and rapid delineation of sharp boundaries and robust semantics is essential for numerous downstream robotic tasks, such as robot grasping and manipulation, real-time semantic mapping, and online sensor calibration performed on edge computing units. Although boundary detection and semantic segmentation are complementary tasks, most studies focus on lightweight models for semantic segmentation but overlook the critical role of boundary detection. In this work, we introduce Mobile-Seed, a lightweight, dual-task framework tailored for simultaneous semantic segmentation and boundary detection. Our framework features a two-stream encoder, an active fusion decoder (AFD) and a dual-task regularization approach. The encoder is divided into two pathways: one captures category-aware semantic information, while the other discerns boundaries from multi-scale features. The AFD module dynamically adapts the fusion of semantic and boundary information by learning channel-wise relationships, allowing for precise weight assignment of each channel. Furthermore, we introduce a regularization loss to mitigate the conflicts in dual-task learning and deep diversity supervision. Compared to existing methods, the proposed Mobile-Seed offers a lightweight framework to simultaneously improve semantic segmentation performance and accurately locate object boundaries. Experiments on the Cityscapes dataset have shown that Mobile-Seed achieves notable improvement over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baseline by 2.2 percentage points (pp) in mIoU and 4.2 pp in mF-score, while maintaining an online inference speed of 23.9 frames-per-second (FPS) with 1024x2048 resolution input on an RTX 2080 Ti GPU. Additional experiments on CamVid and PASCAL Context datasets confirm our method's generalizability.

    "abstract": "In computer vision, the indexing problem is the problem of recognizing a few objects in a large database of objects while avoiding the help of the classical image-feature-to-object-feature matching paradigm. In this paper we address the problem of recognizing 3-D polyhedral objects from 2-D images by indexing. Both the objects to be recognized and the images are represented by weighted graphs. The indexing problem is therefore the problem of determining whether a graph extracted from the image is present or absent in a database of model graphs. We introduce a novel method for performing this graph indexing process which is based both on polynomial characterization of binary and weighted graphs and on hashing. We describe in detail this polynomial characterization and then we show how it can be used in the context of polyhedral object recognition. Next we describe a practical recognition-by-indexing system that includes the organization of the database, the representation of polyhedral objects in terms of 2-D characteristic views, the representation of this views in terms of weighted graphs, and the associated image processing. Finally, some experimental results allow the evaluation of the system performance",

However, LVLMs are still plagued by the two critical issues of object hallucination and factual accuracy, which limit the practicality of LVLMs in different scenarios. Furthermore, previous evaluation methods focus more on the comprehension and reasoning of language content but lack a comprehensive evaluation of multimodal interactions, thereby resulting in potential limitations. To this end, we propose a novel KNVQA-Eval, which is devoted to knowledge-based VQA task evaluation to reflect the factuality of multimodal LVLMs. To ensure the robustness and scalability of the evaluation, we develop a new KNVQA dataset by incorporating human judgment and perception, aiming to evaluate the accuracy of standard answers relative to AI-generated answers in knowledge-based VQA. This work not only comprehensively evaluates the contextual information of LVLMs using reliable human annotations, but also further analyzes the fine-grained capabilities of current methods to reveal potential avenues for subsequent optimization of LVLMs-based estimators. Our proposed VQA-Eval and corresponding dataset KNVQA will facilitate the development of automatic evaluation tools with the advantages of low cost, privacy protection, and reproducibility.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in text-to-video generation have harnessed the power of diffusion models to create visually compelling content conditioned on text prompts. However, they usually encounter high computational costs and often struggle to produce videos with coherent physical motions. To tackle these issues, we propose GPT4Motion, a training-free framework that leverages the planning capability of large language models such as GPT, the physical simulation strength of Blender, and the excellent image generation ability of text-to-image diffusion models to enhance the quality of video synthesis. Specifically, GPT4Motion employs GPT-4 to generate a Blender script based on a user textual prompt, which commands Blender's built-in physics engine to craft fundamental scene components that encapsulate coherent physical motions across frames. Then these components are inputted into Stable Diffusion to generate a video aligned with the textual prompt. Experimental results on three basic physical motion scenarios, including rigid object drop and collision, cloth draping and swinging, and liquid flow, demonstrate that GPT4Motion can generate high-quality videos efficiently in maintaining motion coherency and entity consistency. GPT4Motion offers new insights in text-to-video research, enhancing its quality and broadening its horizon for future explorations",

    "abstract": "High Content Imaging (HCI) plays a vital role in modern drug discovery and development pipelines, facilitating various stages from hit identification to candidate drug characterization. Applying machine learning models to these datasets can prove challenging as they typically consist of multiple batches, affected by experimental variation, especially if different imaging equipment have been used. Moreover, as new data arrive, it is preferable that they are analyzed in an online fashion. To overcome this, we propose CODA, an online self-supervised domain adaptation approach. CODA divides the classifier's role into a generic feature extractor and a task-specific model. We adapt the feature extractor's weights to the new domain using cross-batch self-supervision while keeping the task-specific model unchanged. Our results demonstrate that this strategy significantly reduces the generalization gap, achieving up to a 300% improvement when applied to data from different labs utilizing different microscopes. CODA can be applied to new, unlabeled out-of-domain data sources of different sizes, from a single plate to multiple experimental batches",

    "abstract": "Current 3D semi-supervised segmentation methods face significant challenges such as limited consideration of contextual information and the inability to generate reliable pseudo-labels for effective unsupervised data use. To address these challenges, we introduce two distinct subnetworks designed to explore and exploit the discrepancies between them, ultimately correcting the erroneous prediction results. More specifically, we identify regions of inconsistent predictions and initiate a targeted verification training process. This procedure strategically fine-tunes and harmonizes the predictions of the subnetworks, leading to enhanced utilization of contextual information. Furthermore, to adaptively fine-tune the network's representational capacity and reduce prediction uncertainty, we employ a self-supervised contrastive learning paradigm. For this, we use the network's confidence to distinguish between reliable and unreliable predictions. The model is then trained to effectively minimize unreliable predictions. Our experimental results for organ segmentation, obtained from clinical MRI and CT scans, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach when compared to state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "Starting with early successes in computer vision tasks, deep learning based techniques have since overtaken state of the art approaches in a multitude of domains. However, it has been demonstrated time and again that these techniques fail to capture semantic context and logical constraints, instead often relying on spurious correlations to arrive at the answer. Since application of deep learning techniques to critical scenarios are dependent on adherence to domain specific constraints, several attempts have been made to address this issue. One limitation holding back a thorough exploration of this area, is a lack of suitable datasets which feature a rich set of rules. In order to address this, we present the ChessVision Dataset, consisting of 200,000+ images of annotated chess games in progress, requiring recreation of the game state from its corresponding image. This is accompanied by a curated set of rules which constrains the set of predictions to \"reasonable\" game states, and are designed to probe key semantic abilities like localization and enumeration. Alongside standard metrics, additional metrics to measure performance with regards to logical consistency is presented. We analyze several popular and state of the art vision models on this task, and show that, although their performance on standard metrics are laudable, they produce a plethora of incoherent results, indicating that this dataset presents a significant challenge for future works",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Recently, dense pseudo-label, which directly selects pseudo labels from the original output of the teacher model without any complicated post-processing steps, has received considerable attention in semi-supervised object detection (SSOD). However, for the multi-oriented and dense objects that are common in aerial scenes, existing dense pseudo-label selection methods are inefficient and impede the performance in semi-supervised oriented object detection. Therefore, we propose Adaptive Dense Pseudo Label Selection (ADPLS) for semi-supervised oriented object detection. In ADPLS, we design a simple but effective adaptive mechanism to guide the selection of dense pseudo labels. Specifically, we propose the mean Feature-Richness Score (mFRS) to estimate the density of potential objects and use this score to adjust the number of dense pseudo labels. On the DOTA-v1.5 benchmark, the proposed method outperforms previous methods especially when labeled data are scarce. For example, it achieves 49.78 mAP given only 5% of annotated data, which surpasses previous state-of-the-art method given 10% of annotated data by 1.15 mAP. Our codes will be available soon",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "To assist surgeons in the operating theatre, surgical phase recognition is critical for developing computer-assisted surgical systems, which requires comprehensive understanding of surgical videos. Although existing studies made great progress, there are still two significant limitations worthy of improvement. First, due to the compromise of resource consumption, frame-wise visual features are extracted by 2D networks and disregard spatial and temporal knowledge of surgical actions, which hinders subsequent inter-frame modeling for phase prediction. Second, these works simply utilize ordinary classification loss with one-hot phase labels to optimize the phase predictions, and cannot fully explore surgical videos under inadequate supervision. To overcome these two limitations, we propose a Surgical Temporal Action-aware Network with sequence Regularization, named STAR-Net, to recognize surgical phases more accurately from input videos. Specifically, we propose an efficient multi-scale surgical temporal action (MS-STA) module, which integrates visual features with spatial and temporal knowledge of surgical actions at the cost of 2D networks. Moreover, we devise the dual-classifier sequence regularization (DSR) to facilitate the training of STAR-Net by the sequence guidance of an auxiliary classifier with a smaller capacity. Our STAR-Net with MS-STA and DSR can exploit visual features of surgical actions with effective regularization, thereby leading to the superior performance of surgical phase recognition. Extensive experiments on a large-scale gastrectomy surgery dataset and the public Cholec80 benchmark prove that our STAR-Net significantly outperforms state-of-the-arts of surgical phase recognition",

    "abstract": "Humans rely on their visual and tactile senses to develop a comprehensive 3D understanding of their physical environment. Recently, there has been a growing interest in exploring and manipulating objects using data-driven approaches that utilise high-resolution vision-based tactile sensors. However, 3D shape reconstruction using tactile sensing has lagged behind visual shape reconstruction because of limitations in existing techniques, including the inability to generalise over unseen shapes, the absence of real-world testing, and limited expressive capacity imposed by discrete representations. To address these challenges, we propose TouchSDF, a Deep Learning approach for tactile 3D shape reconstruction that leverages the rich information provided by a vision-based tactile sensor and the expressivity of the implicit neural representation DeepSDF. Our technique consists of two components: (1) a Convolutional Neural Network that maps tactile images into local meshes representing the surface at the touch location, and (2) an implicit neural function that predicts a signed distance function to extract the desired 3D shape. This combination allows TouchSDF to reconstruct smooth and continuous 3D shapes from tactile inputs in simulation and real-world settings, opening up research avenues for robust 3D-aware representations and improved multimodal perception in robotics.

More precisely, we show that Weakly Supervised Deep Learning (WSDL) models can accurately detect hypoxia associated features in routine Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) whole slide images (WSI). We trained and evaluated a deep Multiple Instance Learning model on tiles from WSI H&E tissue from breast cancer primary sites (n=240) obtaining on average an AUC of 0.87 on a left-out test set. We also showed significant differences between features of hypoxic and normoxic tissue regions as distinguished by the WSDL models.

    "abstract": "Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) methods facilitate knowledge transfer from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, navigating the obstacle of domain shift. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a staple in UDA, the rise of Vision Transformers (ViTs) provides new avenues for domain generalization. This paper presents an innovative method to bolster ViT performance in source-free target adaptation, beginning with an evaluation of how key, query, and value elements affect ViT outcomes. Experiments indicate that altering the key component has negligible effects on Transformer performance. Leveraging this discovery, we introduce Domain Representation Images (DRIs), feeding embeddings through the key element. DRIs act as domain-specific markers, effortlessly merging with the training regimen. To assess our method, we perform target adaptation tests on the Cross Instance DRI source-only (SO) control. We measure the efficacy of target adaptation with and without DRIs, against existing benchmarks like SHOT-B* and adaptations via CDTrans. Findings demonstrate that excluding DRIs offers limited gains over SHOT-B*, while their inclusion in the key segment boosts average precision promoting superior domain generalization. This research underscores the vital role of DRIs in enhancing ViT efficiency in UDA scenarios, setting a precedent for further domain adaptation explorations",

To circumvent this limitation, we present HiPose, which establishes 3D-3D correspondences in a coarse-to-fine manner with a hierarchical binary surface encoding. Unlike previous dense-correspondence methods, we estimate the correspondence surface by employing point-to-surface matching and iteratively constricting the surface until it becomes a correspondence point while gradually removing outliers. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks LM-O, YCB-V, and T-Less demonstrate that our method surpasses all refinement-free methods and is even on par with expensive refinement-based approaches.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases stand as the primary global cause of mortality. Among the various imaging techniques available for visualising the heart and evaluating its function, echocardiograms emerge as the preferred choice due to their safety and low cost. Quantifying cardiac function based on echocardiograms is very laborious, time-consuming and subject to high interoperator variability. In this work, we introduce EchoAI, an echocardiogram foundation model, that is trained using self-supervised learning (SSL) on 1.5 million echocardiograms. We evaluate our approach by fine-tuning EchoAI to estimate the ejection fraction achieving a mean absolute percentage error of 9.40%. This level of accuracy aligns with the performance of expert sonographers",

    "abstract": "Skin lesion segmentation is of great significance for skin lesion analysis and subsequent treatment. It is still a challenging task due to the irregular and fuzzy lesion borders, and diversity of skin lesions. In this paper, we propose Triple-UNet to automatically segment skin lesions. It is an organic combination of three UNet architectures with suitable modules. In order to concatenate the first and second sub-networks more effectively, we design a region of interest enhancement module (ROIE). The ROIE enhances the target object region of the image by using the predicted score map of the first UNet. The features learned by the first UNet and the enhanced image help the second UNet obtain a better score map. Finally, the results are fine-tuned by the third UNet. We evaluate our algorithm on a publicly available dataset of skin lesion segmentation. Experiments show that Triple-UNet outperforms the state-of-the-art on skin lesion segmentation",

    "abstract": "This paper studies the problem of extracting planar regions in uneven terrains from unordered point cloud measurements. Such a problem is critical in various robotic applications such as robotic perceptive locomotion. While existing approaches have shown promising results in effectively extracting planar regions from the environment, they often suffer from issues such as low computational efficiency or loss of resolution. To address these issues, we propose a multi-resolution planar region extraction strategy in this paper that balances the accuracy in boundaries and computational efficiency. Our method begins with a pointwise classification preprocessing module, which categorizes all sampled points according to their local geometric properties to facilitate multi-resolution segmentation. Subsequently, we arrange the categorized points using an octree, followed by an in-depth analysis of nodes to finish multi-resolution plane segmentation. The efficiency and robustness of the proposed approach are verified via synthetic and real-world experiments, demonstrating our method's ability to generalize effectively across various uneven terrains while maintaining real-time performance, achieving frame rates exceeding 35 FPS",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Spatial and intensity normalization are nowadays a prerequisite for neuroimaging analysis. Influenced by voxel-wise and other univariate comparisons, where these corrections are key, they are commonly applied to any type of analysis and imaging modalities. Nuclear imaging modalities such as PET-FDG or FP-CIT SPECT, a common modality used in Parkinson's Disease diagnosis, are especially dependent on intensity normalization. However, these steps are computationally expensive and furthermore, they may introduce deformations in the images, altering the information contained in them. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for their part, introduce position invariance to pattern recognition, and have been proven to classify objects regardless of their orientation, size, angle, etc. Therefore, a question arises: how well can CNNs account for spatial and intensity differences when analysing nuclear brain imaging? Are spatial and intensity normalization still needed? To answer this question, we have trained four different CNN models based on well-established architectures, using or not different spatial and intensity normalization preprocessing. The results show that a sufficiently complex model such as our three-dimensional version of the ALEXNET can effectively account for spatial differences, achieving a diagnosis accuracy of 94.1% with an area under the ROC curve of 0.984. The visualization of the differences via saliency maps shows that these models are correctly finding patterns that match those found in the literature, without the need of applying any complex spatial normalization procedure. However, the intensity normalization -- and its type -- is revealed as very influential in the results and accuracy of the trained model, and therefore must be well accounted",

For new segmentation tasks, researchers often have to retrain or fine-tune the model, which is time-consuming and poses a significant obstacle to clinical researchers, who often lack the resources and professional knowledge to train neural networks. Therefore, we proposed a general method that can solve unknown medical image segmentation tasks without requiring additional training. Given an example set of images and prompts for defining new segmentation tasks, GMISeg applies a novel low-rank fine-tuning strategy based on the proposed approach to the SAM (Segment Anything Model) image encoder, and works with the prompt encoder and mask decoder to fine-tune the labeled dataset without the need for additional training. To achieve generalization of new tasks, we used medical image datasets with different imaging modes for different parts. We trained and generalized GMISeg on a different set of anatomical and imaging modes using cardiac images on other site datasets. We have demonstrated that GMISeg outperforms the latest methods on unknown tasks and have conducted a comprehensive analysis and summary of the important performance of the proposed method",

However, NeRF requires hundreds of network evaluations per pixel to approximate a volume rendering integral, making it slow to train. Caching NeRFs into explicit data structures can effectively enhance rendering speed but at the cost of higher memory usage. To address these issues, we present Hyb-NeRF, a novel neural radiance field with a multi-resolution hybrid encoding that achieves efficient neural modeling and fast rendering, which also allows for high-quality novel view synthesis. The key idea of Hyb-NeRF is to represent the scene using different encoding strategies from coarse-to-fine resolution levels. Hyb-NeRF exploits memory-efficiency learnable positional features at coarse resolutions and the fast optimization speed and local details of hash-based feature grids at fine resolutions. In addition, to further boost performance, we embed cone tracing-based features in our learnable positional encoding that eliminates encoding ambiguity and reduces aliasing artifacts. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that Hyb-NeRF achieves faster rendering speed with better rending quality and even a lower memory footprint in comparison to previous state-of-the-art methods",

    "abstract": "Accurate and automated segmentation of intervertebral discs (IVDs) in medical images is crucial for assessing spine-related disorders, such as osteoporosis, vertebral fractures, or IVD herniation. We present HCA-Net, a novel contextual attention network architecture for semantic labeling of IVDs, with a special focus on exploiting prior geometric information. Our approach excels at processing features across different scales and effectively consolidating them to capture the intricate spatial relationships within the spinal cord. To achieve this, HCA-Net models IVD labeling as a pose estimation problem, aiming to minimize the discrepancy between each predicted IVD location and its corresponding actual joint location. In addition, we introduce a skeletal loss term to reinforce the model's geometric dependence on the spine. This loss function is designed to constrain the model's predictions to a range that matches the general structure of the human vertebral skeleton. As a result, the network learns to reduce the occurrence of false predictions and adaptively improves the accuracy of IVD location estimation. Through extensive experimental evaluation on multi-center spine datasets, our approach consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on both MRI T1w and T2w modalities.

In fact, the development of audiovisual approaches has led to advances in the field of speech technologies. However, although noticeable results have recently been achieved, visual speech recognition remains an open research problem. It is a task in which, by dispensing with the auditory sense, challenges such as visual ambiguities and the complexity of modeling silence must be faced. Nonetheless, some of these challenges can be alleviated when the problem is approached from a speaker-dependent perspective. Thus, this paper studies, using the Spanish LIP-RTVE database, how the estimation of specialized end-to-end systems for a specific person could affect the quality of speech recognition. First, different adaptation strategies based on the fine-tuning technique were proposed. Then, a pre-trained CTC/Attention architecture was used as a baseline throughout our experiments. Our findings showed that a two-step fine-tuning process, where the VSR system is first adapted to the task domain, provided significant improvements when the speaker adaptation was addressed. Furthermore, results comparable to the current state of the art were reached even when only a limited amount of data was available",

We specifically focus on scenarios with a substantial domain gap, in contrast to existing works primarily deal with small domain gaps between labeled source domains and unlabeled target domains. To establish a more realistic setting, we introduce a novel UVDA scenario, denoted as Kinetics->BABEL, with a more considerable domain gap in terms of both temporal dynamics and background shifts. To tackle the temporal shift, i.e., action duration difference between the source and target domains, we propose a global-local view alignment approach. To mitigate the background shift, we propose to learn temporal order sensitive representations by temporal order learning and background invariant representations by background augmentation.

    "abstract": "Synthesizing medical images while preserving their structural information is crucial in medical research. In such scenarios, the preservation of anatomical content becomes especially important. Although recent advances have been made by incorporating instance-level information to guide translation, these methods overlook the spatial coherence of structural-level representation and the anatomical invariance of content during translation. To address these issues, we introduce hierarchical granularity discrimination, which exploits various levels of semantic information present in medical images. Our strategy utilizes three levels of discrimination granularity: pixel-level discrimination using a Brain Memory Bank, structure-level discrimination on each brain structure with a re-weighting strategy to focus on hard samples, and global-level discrimination to ensure anatomical consistency during translation. The image translation performance of our strategy has been evaluated on three independent datasets (UK Biobank, IXI, and BraTS 2018), and it has outperformed state-of-the-art algorithms. Particularly, our model excels not only in synthesizing normal structures but also in handling abnormal (pathological) structures, such as brain tumors, despite the variations in contrast observed across different imaging modalities due to their pathological characteristics. The diagnostic value of synthesized MR images containing brain tumors has been evaluated by radiologists. This indicates that our model may offer an alternative solution in scenarios where specific MR modalities of patients are unavailable.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Deducing a 3D human pose from a single 2D image or 2D keypoints is inherently challenging, given the fundamental ambiguity wherein multiple 3D poses can correspond to the same 2D representation. The acquisition of 3D data, while invaluable for resolving pose ambiguity, is expensive and requires an intricate setup, often restricting its applicability to controlled lab environments. We improve performance of monocular human pose estimation models using multiview data for fine-tuning. We propose a novel loss function, multiview consistency, to enable adding additional training data with only 2D supervision. This loss enforces that the inferred 3D pose from one view aligns with the inferred 3D pose from another view under similarity transformations. Our consistency loss substantially improves performance for fine-tuning with no available 3D data. Our experiments demonstrate that two views offset by 90 degrees are enough to obtain good performance, with only marginal improvements by adding more views. Thus, we enable the acquisition of domain-specific data by capturing activities with off-the-shelf cameras, eliminating the need for elaborate calibration procedures. This research introduces new possibilities for domain adaptation in 3D pose estimation, providing a practical and cost-effective solution to customize models for specific applications.

    "abstract": "Our work focuses on tackling large-scale fine-grained image retrieval as ranking the images depicting the concept of interests (i.e., the same sub-category labels) highest based on the fine-grained details in the query. It is desirable to alleviate the challenges of both fine-grained nature of small inter-class variations with large intra-class variations and explosive growth of fine-grained data for such a practical task. In this paper, we propose attribute-aware hashing networks with self-consistency for generating attribute-aware hash codes to not only make the retrieval process efficient, but also establish explicit correspondences between hash codes and visual attributes. Specifically, based on the captured visual representations by attention, we develop an encoder-decoder structure network of a reconstruction task to unsupervisedly distill high-level attribute-specific vectors from the appearance-specific visual representations without attribute annotations. Our models are also equipped with a feature decorrelation constraint upon these attribute vectors to strengthen their representative abilities. Then, driven by preserving original entities' similarity, the required hash codes can be generated from these attribute-specific vectors and thus become attribute-aware. Furthermore, to combat simplicity bias in deep hashing, we consider the model design from the perspective of the self-consistency principle and propose to further enhance models' self-consistency by equipping an additional image reconstruction path. Comprehensive quantitative experiments under diverse empirical settings on six fine-grained retrieval datasets and two generic retrieval datasets show the superiority of our models over competing methods",

In this work, we apply classical and deep-learning modelling techniques to the 2016, 2017 and 2019 Moonboard datasets, achieving state of the art grade prediction performance with 0.87 MAE and 1.12 RMSE. We achieve this performance on a feature-set that does not require decomposing routes into individual moves, which is a method common in literature and introduces bias. We also demonstrate the generalization capability of this model between editions and introduce a novel vision-based method of grade prediction. While the generalization performance of these techniques is below human level performance currently, we propose these methods as a basis for future work. Such a tool could be implemented in pre-existing mobile applications and would allow climbers to better track their progress and assess new routes with reduced bias",

    "title": "A Safer Vision-based Autonomous Planning System for Quadrotor UAVs with Dynamic Obstacle Trajectory Prediction and Its Application with LLMs",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "For intelligent quadcopter UAVs, a robust and reliable autonomous planning system is crucial. Most current trajectory planning methods for UAVs are suitable for static environments but struggle to handle dynamic obstacles, which can pose challenges and even dangers to flight. To address this issue, this paper proposes a vision-based planning system that combines tracking and trajectory prediction of dynamic obstacles to achieve efficient and reliable autonomous flight. We use a lightweight object detection algorithm to identify dynamic obstacles and then use Kalman Filtering to track and estimate their motion states. During the planning phase, we not only consider static obstacles but also account for the potential movements of dynamic obstacles. For trajectory generation, we use a B-spline-based trajectory search algorithm, which is further optimized with various constraints to enhance safety and alignment with the UAV's motion characteristics. We conduct experiments in both simulation and real-world environments, and the results indicate that our approach can successfully detect and avoid obstacles in dynamic environments in real-time, offering greater reliability compared to existing approaches. Furthermore, with the advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology demonstrating exceptional zero-shot generalization capabilities, more user-friendly human-machine interactions have become feasible, and this study also explores the integration of autonomous planning systems with Large Language Models (LLMs)",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Articulated objects (e.g., doors and drawers) exist everywhere in our life. Different from rigid objects, articulated objects have higher degrees of freedom and are rich in geometries, semantics, and part functions. Modeling different kinds of parts and articulations with nerual networks plays an essential role in articulated object understanding and manipulation, and will further benefit 3D vision and robotics communities. To model articulated objects, most previous works directly encode articulated objects into feature representations, without specific designs for parts, articulations and part motions. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that explicitly disentangles the part motion of articulated objects by predicting the transformation matrix of points on the part surface, using spatially continuous neural implicit representations to model the part motion smoothly in the space. More importantly, while many methods could only model a certain kind of joint motion (such as the revolution in the clockwise order), our proposed framework is generic to different kinds of joint motions in that transformation matrix can model diverse kinds of joint motions in the space. Quantitative and qualitative results of experiments over diverse categories of articulated objects demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework",

    "abstract": "Integrating deep learning and causal discovery has increased the interpretability of Temporal Action Segmentation (TAS) tasks. However, frame-level causal relationships exist many complicated noises outside the segment-level, making it infeasible to directly express macro action semantics. Thus, we propose \\textit{\\textbf{Causal Abstraction Segmentation Refiner (CASR)}}, which can refine TAS results from various models by enhancing video causality in marginalizing frame-level casual relationships. Specifically, we define the equivalent frame-level casual model and segment-level causal model, so that the causal adjacency matrix constructed from marginalized frame-level causal relationships has the ability to represent the segmnet-level causal relationships. CASR works out by reducing the difference in the causal adjacency matrix between we constructed and pre-segmentation results of backbone models. In addition, we propose a novel evaluation metric Causal Edit Distance (CED) to evaluate the causal interpretability. Extensive experimental results on mainstream datasets indicate that CASR significantly surpasses existing various methods in action segmentation performance, as well as in causal explainability and generalization.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Parallel imaging is a commonly used technique to accelerate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data acquisition. Mathematically, parallel MRI reconstruction can be formulated as an inverse problem relating the sparsely sampled k-space measurements to the desired MRI image. Despite the success of many existing reconstruction algorithms, it remains a challenge to reliably reconstruct a high-quality image from highly reduced k-space measurements. Recently, implicit neural representation has emerged as a powerful paradigm to exploit the internal information and the physics of partially acquired data to generate the desired object. In this study, we introduced IMJENSE, a scan-specific implicit neural representation-based method for improving parallel MRI reconstruction. Specifically, the underlying MRI image and coil sensitivities were modeled as continuous functions of spatial coordinates, parameterized by neural networks and polynomials, respectively. The weights in the networks and coefficients in the polynomials were simultaneously learned directly from sparsely acquired k-space measurements, without fully sampled ground truth data for training. Benefiting from the powerful continuous representation and joint estimation of the MRI image and coil sensitivities, IMJENSE outperforms conventional image or k-space domain reconstruction algorithms. With extremely limited calibration data, IMJENSE is more stable than supervised calibrationless and calibration-based deep-learning methods. Results show that IMJENSE robustly reconstructs the images acquired at 5$\\mathbf{\\times}$ and 6$\\mathbf{\\times}$ accelerations with only 4 or 8 calibration lines in 2D Cartesian acquisitions, corresponding to 22.0% and 19.5% undersampling rates. The high-quality results and scanning specificity make the proposed method hold the potential for further accelerating the data acquisition of parallel MRI",

    "title": "RFTrans: Leveraging Refractive Flow of Transparent Objects for Surface Normal Estimation and Manipulation",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Transparent objects are widely used in our daily lives, making it important to teach robots to interact with them. However, it's not easy because the reflective and refractive effects can make RGB-D cameras fail to give accurate geometry measurements. To solve this problem, this paper introduces RFTrans, an RGB-D-based method for surface normal estimation and manipulation of transparent objects. By leveraging refractive flow as an intermediate representation, RFTrans circumvents the drawbacks of directly predicting the geometry (e.g. surface normal) from RGB images and helps bridge the sim-to-real gap. RFTrans integrates the RFNet, which predicts refractive flow, object mask, and boundaries, followed by the F2Net, which estimates surface normal from the refractive flow. To make manipulation possible, a global optimization module will take in the predictions, refine the raw depth, and construct the point cloud with normal. An analytical grasp planning algorithm, ISF, is followed to generate the grasp poses. We build a synthetic dataset with physically plausible ray-tracing rendering techniques to train the networks. Results show that the RFTrans trained on the synthetic dataset can consistently outperform the baseline ClearGrasp in both synthetic and real-world benchmarks by a large margin. Finally, a real-world robot grasping task witnesses an 83% success rate, proving that refractive flow can help enable direct sim-to-real transfer.

    "title": "Rich and Poor Texture Contrast: A Simple yet Effective Approach for AI-generated Image Detection",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Recent generative models show impressive performance in generating photographic images. Humans can hardly distinguish such incredibly realistic-looking AI-generated images from real ones. AI-generated images may lead to ubiquitous disinformation dissemination. Therefore, it is of utmost urgency to develop a detector to identify AI-generated images. Most existing detectors suffer from sharp performance drops over unseen generative models. In this paper, we propose a novel AI-generated image detector capable of identifying fake images created by a wide range of generative models. Our approach leverages the inter-pixel correlation contrast between rich and poor texture regions within an image. Pixels in rich texture regions exhibit more significant fluctuations than those in poor texture regions. This discrepancy reflects that the entropy of rich texture regions is larger than that of poor ones. Consequently, synthesizing realistic rich texture regions proves to be more challenging for existing generative models. Based on this principle, we divide an image into multiple patches and reconstruct them into two images, comprising rich-texture and poor-texture patches respectively. Subsequently, we extract the inter-pixel correlation discrepancy feature between rich and poor texture regions. This feature serves as a universal fingerprint used for AI-generated image forensics across different generative models. In addition, we build a comprehensive AI-generated image detection benchmark, which includes 16 kinds of prevalent generative models, to evaluate the effectiveness of existing baselines and our approach. Our benchmark provides a leaderboard for follow-up studies. Extensive experimental results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by a significant margin.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Class-agnostic object counting aims to count all objects in an image with respect to example boxes or class names, \\emph{a.k.a} few-shot and zero-shot counting. Current state-of-the-art methods highly rely on density maps to predict object counts, which lacks model interpretability. In this paper, we propose a generalized framework for both few-shot and zero-shot object counting based on detection. Our framework combines the superior advantages of two foundation models without compromising their zero-shot capability: (\\textbf{i}) SAM to segment all possible objects as mask proposals, and (\\textbf{ii}) CLIP to classify proposals to obtain accurate object counts. However, this strategy meets the obstacles of efficiency overhead and the small crowded objects that cannot be localized and distinguished. To address these issues, our framework, termed PseCo, follows three steps: point, segment, and count. Specifically, we first propose a class-agnostic object localization to provide accurate but least point prompts for SAM, which consequently not only reduces computation costs but also avoids missing small objects. Furthermore, we propose a generalized object classification that leverages CLIP image/text embeddings as the classifier, following a hierarchical knowledge distillation to obtain discriminative classifications among hierarchical mask proposals. Extensive experimental results on FSC-147 dataset demonstrate that PseCo achieves state-of-the-art performance in both few-shot/zero-shot object counting/detection, with additional results on large-scale COCO and LVIS datasets.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel approach to synthesize texture to dress up a given 3D object, given a text prompt. Based on the pretrained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model, existing methods usually employ a project-and-inpaint approach, in which a view of the given object is first generated and warped to another view for inpainting. But it tends to generate inconsistent texture due to the asynchronous diffusion of multiple views. We believe such asynchronous diffusion and insufficient information sharing among views are the root causes of the inconsistent artifact. In this paper, we propose a synchronized multi-view diffusion approach that allows the diffusion processes from different views to reach a consensus of the generated content early in the process, and hence ensures the texture consistency. To synchronize the diffusion, we share the denoised content among different views in each denoising step, specifically blending the latent content in the texture domain from views with overlap. Our method demonstrates superior performance in generating consistent, seamless, highly detailed textures, comparing to state-of-the-art methods",

The system requires no external large language model assistance at test time, making it more convenient for practical applications. Experiments on the Visual Genome and the OpenImage V6 datasets demonstrate that harnessing hierarchical relationships enhances the model performance by a large margin.

Recent works have investigated adopting 8-bit floating-point quantization (FP8) in the context of PTQ for model inference.

Our work presents a novel PTQ design-space exploration, comparing minifloat and integer quantization schemes across a range of 3 to 8 bits for both weights and activations. We examine the applicability of various PTQ techniques to minifloats, including weight equalization, bias correction, SmoothQuant, gradient-based learned rounding, and the GPTQ method. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of low-precision minifloats when compared to their integer counterparts across a spectrum of accuracy-precision trade-offs on a set of reference deep learning vision workloads.

To address these challenges, we introduce a synthetic data augmentation framework tailored for aerial images. It encompasses sparse-to-dense region of interest (ROI) extraction to bridge the semantic gap, fine-tuning the diffusion model with low-rank adaptation (LORA) to circumvent exhaustive retraining, and finally, a Copy-Paste method to compose synthesized objects with backgrounds, providing a nuanced approach to aerial object detection through synthetic data",

For this reason, in the context of multi-modal action recognition, it is important to consider not only the overall action content but also the complementary nature of different modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel network, named Modality Mixer (M-Mixer) network, which effectively leverages and incorporates the complementary information across modalities with the temporal context of actions for action recognition. A key component of our proposed M-Mixer is the Multi-modal Contextualization Unit (MCU), a simple yet effective recurrent unit. Our MCU is responsible for temporally encoding a sequence of one modality (e.g., RGB) with action content features of other modalities (e.g., depth and infrared modalities). This process encourages M-Mixer network to exploit global action content and also to supplement complementary information of other modalities. Furthermore, to extract appropriate complementary information regarding to the given modality settings, we introduce a new module, named Complementary Feature Extraction Module (CFEM). CFEM incorporates sepearte learnable query embeddings for each modality, which guide CFEM to extract complementary information and global action content from the other modalities. As a result, our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA datasets.

    "title": "Overcoming Pathology Image Data Deficiency: Generating Images from Pathological Transformation Process",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Histopathology serves as the gold standard for medical diagnosis but faces application limitations due to the shortage of medical resources. Leveraging deep learning, computer-aided diagnosis has the potential to alleviate the pathologist scarcity and provide timely clinical analysis. However, developing a reliable model generally necessitates substantial data for training, which is challenging in pathological field. In response, we propose an adaptive depth-controlled bidirectional diffusion (ADBD) network for image data generation. The domain migration approach can work with small trainset and overcome the diffusion overfitting by source information guidance. Specifically, we developed a hybrid attention strategy to blend global and local attention priorities, which guides the bidirectional diffusion and ensures the migration success. In addition, we developed the adaptive depth-controlled strategy to simulate physiological transformations, capable of yielding unlimited cross-domain intermediate images with corresponding soft labels. ADBD is effective for overcoming pathological image data deficiency and supportable for further pathology-related research",

    "title": "Long-MIL: Scaling Long Contextual Multiple Instance Learning for Histopathology Whole Slide Image Analysis",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Histopathology image analysis is the golden standard of clinical diagnosis for Cancers. In doctors daily routine and computer-aided diagnosis, the Whole Slide Image (WSI) of histopathology tissue is used for analysis. Because of the extremely large scale of resolution, previous methods generally divide the WSI into a large number of patches, then aggregate all patches within a WSI by Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) to make the slide-level prediction when developing computer-aided diagnosis tools. However, most previous WSI-MIL models using global-attention without pairwise interaction and any positional information, or self-attention with absolute position embedding can not well handle shape varying large WSIs, e.g. testing WSIs after model deployment may be larger than training WSIs, since the model development set is always limited due to the difficulty of histopathology WSIs collection. To deal with the problem, in this paper, we propose to amend position embedding for shape varying long-contextual WSI by introducing Linear Bias into Attention, and adapt it from 1-d long sequence into 2-d long-contextual WSI which helps model extrapolate position embedding to unseen or under-fitted positions. We further utilize Flash-Attention module to tackle the computational complexity of Transformer, which also keep full self-attention performance compared to previous attention approximation work. Our method, Long-contextual MIL (Long-MIL) are evaluated on extensive experiments including 4 dataset including WSI classification and survival prediction tasks to validate the superiority on shape varying WSIs.

    "title": "ABFL: Angular Boundary Discontinuity Free Loss for Arbitrary Oriented Object Detection in Aerial Images",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Arbitrary oriented object detection (AOOD) in aerial images is a widely concerned and highly challenging task, and plays an important role in many scenarios. The core of AOOD involves the representation, encoding, and feature augmentation of oriented bounding-boxes (Bboxes). Existing methods lack intuitive modeling of angle difference measurement in oriented Bbox representations. Oriented Bboxes under different representations exhibit rotational symmetry with varying periods due to angle periodicity. The angular boundary discontinuity (ABD) problem at periodic boundary positions is caused by rotational symmetry in measuring angular differences. In addition, existing methods also use additional encoding-decoding structures for oriented Bboxes. In this paper, we design an angular boundary free loss (ABFL) based on the von Mises distribution. The ABFL aims to solve the ABD problem when detecting oriented objects. Specifically, ABFL proposes to treat angles as circular data rather than linear data when measuring angle differences, aiming to introduce angle periodicity to alleviate the ABD problem and improve the accuracy of angle difference measurement. In addition, ABFL provides a simple and effective solution for various periodic boundary discontinuities caused by rotational symmetry in AOOD tasks, as it does not require additional encoding-decoding structures for oriented Bboxes. Extensive experiments on the DOTA and HRSC2016 datasets show that the proposed ABFL loss outperforms some state-of-the-art methods focused on addressing the ABD problem",

    "abstract": "Automated human action recognition, a burgeoning field within computer vision, boasts diverse applications spanning surveillance, security, human-computer interaction, tele-health, and sports analysis. Precise action recognition in infants serves a multitude of pivotal purposes, encompassing safety monitoring, developmental milestone tracking, early intervention for developmental delays, fostering parent-infant bonds, advancing computer-aided diagnostics, and contributing to the scientific comprehension of child development. This paper delves into the intricacies of infant action recognition, a domain that has remained relatively uncharted despite the accomplishments in adult action recognition. In this study, we introduce a groundbreaking dataset called ``InfActPrimitive'', encompassing five significant infant milestone action categories, and we incorporate specialized preprocessing for infant data. We conducted an extensive comparative analysis employing cutting-edge skeleton-based action recognition models using this dataset. Our findings reveal that, although the PoseC3D model achieves the highest accuracy at approximately 71%, the remaining models struggle to accurately capture the dynamics of infant actions. This highlights a substantial knowledge gap between infant and adult action recognition domains and the urgent need for data-efficient pipeline models",

Our method combines several geometry processing tasks supervised at instance-level to promote the consistency of the learned feature representation. Specifically, our methods use shape generators and shape classifiers to perform shape reconstruction and classification tasks for each shape instance. This enforces the feature representation to faithfully encode both structural and local shape information, with an awareness of shape instances.

    "abstract": "Statistics of grain sizes and orientations in metals correlate to the material's mechanical properties. Reproducing representative volume elements for further analysis of deformation and failure in metals, like 316L stainless steel, is particularly important due to their wide use in manufacturing goods today. Two approaches, initially created for video games, were considered for the procedural generation of representative grain microstructures. The first is the Wave Function Collapse (WFC) algorithm, and the second is constraint propagation and probabilistic inference through Markov Junior, a free and open-source software. This study aimed to investigate these two algorithms' effectiveness in using reference electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) maps and recreating a statistically similar one that could be used in further research. It utilized two stainless steel EBSD maps as references to test both algorithms. First, the WFC algorithm was too constricting and, thus, incapable of producing images that resembled EBSDs. The second, MarkovJunior, was much more effective in creating a Voronoi tessellation that could be used to create an EBSD map in Python. When comparing the results between the reference and the generated EBSD, we discovered that the orientation and volume fractions were extremely similar. With the study, it was concluded that MarkovJunior is an effective machine learning tool that can reproduce representative grain microstructures",

Recent methods mainly focus on learning aligned and discriminative multi-modal features to boost generalization towards unseen categories. However, these approaches ignore the obscure action concepts in category names and may inevitably introduce complex network structures with difficult training objectives. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective framework named Knowledge-aware Distribution Adaptation (KDA) to help the model better grasp the novel action contents with an external knowledge base. Specifically, we first propose using large language models to generate rich descriptions from category names, which leads to a better understanding of unseen categories. Additionally, we propose a distribution alignment loss as well as a knowledge-aware adaptive margin loss to further improve the generalization ability towards unseen categories. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed KDA can outperform state-of-the-art methods on three popular audio-visual zero-shot learning datasets.

A key aspect of this realism originates from the physical accuracy of both a true-to-life body shape and clothing. While physical simulations can produce high-quality, realistic motions for clothed humans, they require precise estimation of body shape and high-quality garment assets with associated physical parameters for cloth simulations. However, manually creating these assets and calibrating their parameters is labor-intensive and requires specialized expertise. To address this gap, we propose DiffAvatar, a novel approach that performs body and garment co-optimization using differentiable simulation. By integrating physical simulation into the optimization loop and accounting for the complex nonlinear behavior of cloth and its intricate interaction with the body, our framework recovers body and garment geometry and extracts important material parameters in a physically plausible way.

Specifically, our goal is to generate an image in which objects in a source structure image are \"painted\" with the visual appearance of their semantically related objects in a target appearance image. To integrate semantic information into our framework, our key idea is to leverage a pre-trained and fixed Vision Transformer (ViT) model. Specifically, we derive novel disentangled representations of structure and appearance extracted from deep ViT features. We then establish an objective function that splices the desired structure and appearance representations, interweaving them together in the space of ViT features. Based on our objective function, we propose two frameworks of semantic appearance transfer -- \"Splice\", which works by training a generator on a single and arbitrary pair of structure-appearance images, and \"SpliceNet\", a feed-forward real-time appearance transfer model trained on a dataset of images from a specific domain. Our frameworks do not involve adversarial training, nor do they require any additional input information such as semantic segmentation or correspondences.

Video summarization methods mainly rely on visual factors, such as visual consecutiveness and diversity, which may not be sufficient to fully understand the content of the video. There are other non-visual factors, such as interestingness, representativeness, and storyline consistency that should also be considered for generating high-quality video summaries. Current methods do not adequately take into account these non-visual factors, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this work, a new approach to video summarization is proposed based on insights gained from how humans create ground truth video summaries. The method utilizes a conditional modeling perspective and introduces multiple meaningful random variables and joint distributions to characterize the key components of video summarization. Helper distributions are employed to improve the training of the model. A conditional attention module is designed to mitigate potential performance degradation in the presence of multi-modal input. The proposed video summarization method incorporates the above innovative design choices that aim to narrow the gap between human-generated and machine-generated video summaries.

    "abstract": "The task of predicting 3D eye gaze from eye images can be performed either by (a) end-to-end learning for image-to-gaze mapping or by (b) fitting a 3D eye model onto images. The former case requires 3D gaze labels, while the latter requires eye semantics or landmarks to facilitate the model fitting. Although obtaining eye semantics and landmarks is relatively easy, fitting an accurate 3D eye model on them remains to be very challenging due to its ill-posed nature in general. On the other hand, obtaining large-scale 3D gaze data is cumbersome due to the required hardware setups and computational demands. In this work, we propose to predict 3D eye gaze from weak supervision of eye semantic segmentation masks and direct supervision of a few 3D gaze vectors. The proposed method combines the best of both worlds by leveraging large amounts of weak annotations--which are easy to obtain, and only a few 3D gaze vectors--which alleviate the difficulty of fitting 3D eye models on the semantic segmentation of eye images. Thus, the eye gaze vectors, used in the model fitting, are directly supervised using the few-shot gaze labels. Additionally, we propose a transformer-based network architecture, that serves as a solid baseline for our improvements. Our experiments in diverse settings illustrate the significant benefits of the proposed method, achieving about 5 degrees lower angular gaze error over the baseline, when only 0.05% 3D annotations of the training images are used.

    "abstract": "We address the task of American Sign Language fingerspelling translation using videos in the wild. We exploit advances in more accurate hand pose estimation and propose a novel architecture that leverages the transformer based encoder-decoder model enabling seamless contextual word translation. The translation model is augmented by a novel loss term that accurately predicts the length of the finger-spelled word, benefiting both training and inference. We also propose a novel two-stage inference approach that re-ranks the hypotheses using the language model capabilities of the decoder. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art models on ChicagoFSWild and ChicagoFSWild+ achieving more than 10% relative improvement in performance. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of our approach and its potential to advance fingerspelling recognition in sign language translation.

    "abstract": "While current state-of-the-art generalizable implicit neural shape models rely on the inductive bias of convolutions, it is still not entirely clear how properties emerging from such biases are compatible with the task of 3D reconstruction from point cloud. We explore an alternative approach to generalizability in this context. We relax the intrinsic model bias (i.e. using MLPs to encode local features as opposed to convolutions) and constrain the hypothesis space instead with an auxiliary regularization related to the reconstruction task, i.e. denoising. The resulting model is the first only-MLP locally conditioned implicit shape reconstruction from point cloud network with fast feed forward inference. Point cloud borne features and denoising offsets are predicted from an exclusively MLP-made network in a single forward pass. A decoder predicts occupancy probabilities for queries anywhere in space by pooling nearby features from the point cloud order-invariantly, guided by denoised relative positional encoding. We outperform the state-of-the-art convolutional method while using half the number of model parameters",

    "title": "Hourglass Tokenizer for Efficient Transformer-Based 3D Human Pose Estimation",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Transformers have been successfully applied in the field of video-based 3D human pose estimation. However, the high computational costs of these video pose transformers (VPTs) make them impractical on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we present a plug-and-play pruning-and-recovering framework, called Hourglass Tokenizer (HoT), for efficient transformer-based 3D human pose estimation from videos. Our HoT begins with pruning pose tokens of redundant frames and ends with recovering full-length tokens, resulting in a few pose tokens in the intermediate transformer blocks and thus improving the model efficiency. To effectively achieve this, we propose a token pruning cluster (TPC) that dynamically selects a few representative tokens with high semantic diversity while eliminating the redundancy of video frames. In addition, we develop a token recovering attention (TRA) to restore the detailed spatio-temporal information based on the selected tokens, thereby expanding the network output to the original full-length temporal resolution for fast inference. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets (i.e., Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP) demonstrate that our method can achieve both high efficiency and estimation accuracy compared to the original VPT models. For instance, applying to MotionBERT and MixSTE on Human3.6M, our HoT can save nearly 50% FLOPs without sacrificing accuracy and nearly 40% FLOPs with only 0.2% accuracy drop, respectively.

    "abstract": "We present a method to create interpretable concept sliders that enable precise control over attributes in image generations from diffusion models. Our approach identifies a low-rank parameter direction corresponding to one concept while minimizing interference with other attributes. A slider is created using a small set of prompts or sample images; thus slider directions can be created for either textual or visual concepts. Concept Sliders are plug-and-play: they can be composed efficiently and continuously modulated, enabling precise control over image generation. In quantitative experiments comparing to previous editing techniques, our sliders exhibit stronger targeted edits with lower interference. We showcase sliders for weather, age, styles, and expressions, as well as slider compositions. We show how sliders can transfer latents from StyleGAN for intuitive editing of visual concepts for which textual description is difficult. We also find that our method can help address persistent quality issues in Stable Diffusion XL including repair of object deformations and fixing distorted hands.

This system analyzes videos of humans performing tasks and creates executable robot programs that incorporate affordance insights. The computation starts by analyzing the videos with GPT-4V to convert environmental and action details into text, followed by a GPT-4-empowered task planner. In the following analyses, vision systems reanalyze the video with the task plan. Object names are grounded using an open-vocabulary object detector, while focus on the hand-object relation helps to detect the moment of grasping and releasing. This spatiotemporal grounding allows the vision systems to further gather affordance data (e.g., grasp type, way points, and body postures). Experiments across various scenarios demonstrate this method's efficacy in achieving real robots' operations from human demonstrations in a zero-shot manner.

    "abstract": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel in local spatial pattern recognition. For many vision tasks, such as object recognition and segmentation, salient information is also present outside CNN's kernel boundaries. However, CNNs struggle in capturing such relevant information due to their confined receptive fields. Self-attention can improve a model's access to global information but increases computational overhead. We present a fast and simple fully convolutional method called DAS that helps focus attention on relevant information. It uses deformable convolutions for the location of pertinent image regions and separable convolutions for efficiency. DAS plugs into existing CNNs and propagates relevant information using a gating mechanism. Compared to the O(n^2) computational complexity of transformer-style attention, DAS is O(n). Our claim is that DAS's ability to pay increased attention to relevant features results in performance improvements when added to popular CNNs for Image Classification and Object Detection. For example, DAS yields an improvement on Stanford Dogs (4.47%), ImageNet (1.91%), and COCO AP (3.3%) with base ResNet50 backbone. This outperforms other CNN attention mechanisms while using similar or less FLOPs. Our code will be publicly available",

The improvement in generation quality and diversity is achieved through (1) a novel frequency rectification module via spherical harmonics designed to retain high-frequency content while learning the point cloud distribution; and (2) a latent DDPM to learn the regularized yet complex latent distribution. In addition, FrePolad supports variable point cloud cardinality by formulating the sampling of points as conditional distributions over a latent shape distribution. Finally, the low-dimensional latent space encoded by the VAE contributes to FrePolad's fast and scalable sampling.

The aim of this study is to compare state-of-the-art lip segmentation models using a standardized setting and a publicly available dataset. Five techniques, namely EHANet, Mask2Former, BiSeNet V2, PIDNet, and STDC1, are qualitatively selected based on their reported performance, inference time, code availability, recency, and popularity. The CelebAMask-HQ dataset, comprising manually annotated face images, is used to fairly assess the lip segmentation performance of the selected models. Inference experiments are conducted on a Raspberry Pi4 to emulate limited computational resources. The results show that Mask2Former and EHANet have the best performances in terms of mIoU score. BiSeNet V2 demonstrate competitive performance, while PIDNet excels in recall but has lower precision. Most models present inference time ranging from 1000 to around 3000 milliseconds on a Raspberry Pi4, with PIDNet having the lowest mean inference time. This study provides a comprehensive evaluation of lip segmentation models, highlighting their performance and inference times. The findings contribute to the development of lightweight techniques and establish benchmarks for future advances in lip segmentation, especially in IoT and edge computing scenarios",

    "abstract": "Dogs have a unique evolutionary relationship with humans and serve many important roles e.g. search and rescue, blind assistance, emotional support. However, few datasets exist to categorize visual features and objects available to dogs, as well as how dogs direct their visual attention within their environment. We collect and study a dataset with over 11,698 gazes to categorize the objects available to be gazed at by 11 dogs in everyday outdoor environments i.e. a walk around a college campus and urban area. We explore the availability of these object categories and the visual attention of dogs over these categories using a head mounted eye tracking apparatus. A small portion (approx. 600 images or < 20% of total dataset) of the collected data is used to fine tune a MaskRCNN for the novel image domain to segment objects present in the scene, enabling further statistical analysis on the visual gaze tendencies of dogs. The MaskRCNN, with eye tracking apparatus, serves as an end to end model for automatically classifying the visual fixations of dogs. The fine tuned MaskRCNN performs far better than chance. There are few individual differences between the 11 dogs and we observe greater visual fixations on buses, plants, pavement, and construction equipment.

Facial expressions can be very useful for emotion recognition techniques, as these are the biggest transmitters of non-verbal cues capable of being correlated with emotions.

However, simple CNNs are not always sufficient to locate points of interest on the face that can be correlated with emotions. In this work, we intend to expand the capacity of emotion recognition techniques by proposing the usage of Facial Action Units (AUs) recognition techniques to recognize emotions. This recognition will be based on the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) and computed by a machine learning system. In particular, our method expands over EmotiRAM, an approach for multi-cue emotion recognition, in which we improve over their facial encoding module",

This paper presents the first attempt to estimate 3D human body mesh from sparse LiDAR point clouds. We found that the major challenge in estimating human pose and mesh from point clouds lies in the sparsity, noise, and incompletion of LiDAR point clouds. Facing these challenges, we propose an effective sparse-to-dense reconstruction scheme to reconstruct 3D human mesh. This involves estimating a sparse representation of a human (3D human pose) and gradually reconstructing the body mesh. To better leverage the 3D structural information of point clouds, we employ a cascaded graph transformer (graphormer) to introduce point cloud features during sparse-to-dense reconstruction. Experimental results on three publicly available databases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Code: https://github.com/soullessrobot/LiDAR-HMR/",

Its success largely owes to massive labeled training data. However, directly applying SAM to medical image segmentation cannot perform well because SAM lacks medical knowledge -- it does not use medical images for training. To incorporate medical knowledge into SAM, we introduce SA-Med2D-20M, a large-scale segmentation dataset of 2D medical images built upon numerous public and private datasets. It consists of 4.6 million 2D medical images and 19.7 million corresponding masks, covering almost the whole body and showing significant diversity. This paper describes all the datasets collected in SA-Med2D-20M and details how to process these datasets. Furthermore, comprehensive statistics of SA-Med2D-20M are presented to facilitate the better use of our dataset, which can help the researchers build medical vision foundation models or apply their models to downstream medical applications. We hope that the large scale and diversity of SA-Med2D-20M can be leveraged to develop medical artificial intelligence for enhancing diagnosis, medical image analysis, knowledge sharing, and education.

    "abstract": "This position paper outlines the potential of AutoML for incremental (continual) learning to encourage more research in this direction. Incremental learning involves incorporating new data from a stream of tasks and distributions to learn enhanced deep representations and adapt better to new tasks. However, a significant limitation of incremental learners is that most current techniques freeze the backbone architecture, hyperparameters, and the order & structure of the learning tasks throughout the learning and adaptation process. We strongly believe that AutoML offers promising solutions to address these limitations, enabling incremental learning to adapt to more diverse real-world tasks. Therefore, instead of directly proposing a new method, this paper takes a step back by posing the question: \"What can AutoML do for incremental learning?\" We outline three key areas of research that can contribute to making incremental learners more dynamic, highlighting concrete opportunities to apply AutoML methods in novel ways as well as entirely new challenges for AutoML research",

    "title": "NNG-Mix: Improving Semi-supervised Anomaly Detection with Pseudo-anomaly Generation",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Anomaly detection (AD) is essential in identifying rare and often critical events in complex systems, finding applications in fields such as network intrusion detection, financial fraud detection, and fault detection in infrastructure and industrial systems. While AD is typically treated as an unsupervised learning task due to the high cost of label annotation, it is more practical to assume access to a small set of labeled anomaly samples from domain experts, as is the case for semi-supervised anomaly detection. Semi-supervised and supervised approaches can leverage such labeled data, resulting in improved performance. In this paper, rather than proposing a new semi-supervised or supervised approach for AD, we introduce a novel algorithm for generating additional pseudo-anomalies on the basis of the limited labeled anomalies and a large volume of unlabeled data. This serves as an augmentation to facilitate the detection of new anomalies. Our proposed algorithm, named Nearest Neighbor Gaussian Mixup (NNG-Mix), efficiently integrates information from both labeled and unlabeled data to generate pseudo-anomalies. We compare the performance of this novel algorithm with commonly applied augmentation techniques, such as Mixup and Cutout. We evaluate NNG-Mix by training various existing semi-supervised and supervised anomaly detection algorithms on the original training data along with the generated pseudo-anomalies. Through extensive experiments on 57 benchmark datasets in ADBench, reflecting different data types, we demonstrate that NNG-Mix outperforms other data augmentation methods. It yields significant performance improvements compared to the baselines trained exclusively on the original training data. Notably, NNG-Mix yields up to 16.4%, 8.8%, and 8.0% improvements on Classical, CV, and NLP datasets in ADBench. Our source code will be available at https://github.com/donghao51/NNG-Mix",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "We consider the problem of constraining diffusion model outputs with a user-supplied reference image. Our key objective is to extract multiple attributes (e.g., color, object, layout, style) from this single reference image, and then generate new samples with them. One line of existing work proposes to invert the reference images into a single textual conditioning vector, enabling generation of new samples with this learned token. These methods, however, do not learn multiple tokens that are necessary to condition model outputs on the multiple attributes noted above. Another line of techniques expand the inversion space to learn multiple embeddings but they do this only along the layer dimension (e.g., one per layer of the DDPM model) or the timestep dimension (one for a set of timesteps in the denoising process), leading to suboptimal attribute disentanglement. To address the aforementioned gaps, the first contribution of this paper is an extensive analysis to determine which attributes are captured in which dimension of the denoising process. As noted above, we consider both the time-step dimension (in reverse denoising) as well as the DDPM model layer dimension. We observe that often a subset of these attributes are captured in the same set of model layers and/or across same denoising timesteps. For instance, color and style are captured across same U-Net layers, whereas layout and color are captured across same timestep stages. Consequently, an inversion process that is designed only for the time-step dimension or the layer dimension is insufficient to disentangle all attributes. This leads to our second contribution where we design a new multi-attribute inversion algorithm, MATTE, with associated disentanglement-enhancing regularization losses, that operates across both dimensions and explicitly leads to four disentangled tokens (color, style, layout, and object)",

The working principle was based on the ultrasound Doppler sensing with the device built-in hardware. Applying such a lab-environment trained model on realistic application variations causes a significant drop in performance, and thus decimate its applicability. The reason of the reduced performance can be manifold. It could be induced by the user, environment, and device variations in realistic scenarios. Such scenarios are often more complex and diverse, which can be challenging to anticipate in the initial training data. To study and overcome this issue, this paper presents a database with controlled and uncontrolled subsets of fitness exercises. We propose two concepts to utilize small adaption data to successfully improve model generalization in an uncontrolled environment, increasing the recognition accuracy by two to six folds compared to the baseline for different users",

    "title": "Continual Learning: Applications and the Road Forward",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Continual learning is a sub-field of machine learning, which aims to allow machine learning models to continuously learn on new data, by accumulating knowledge without forgetting what was learned in the past. In this work, we take a step back, and ask: \"Why should one care about continual learning in the first place?\". We set the stage by surveying recent continual learning papers published at three major machine learning conferences, and show that memory-constrained settings dominate the field. Then, we discuss five open problems in machine learning, and even though they seem unrelated to continual learning at first sight, we show that continual learning will inevitably be part of their solution. These problems are model-editing, personalization, on-device learning, faster (re-)training and reinforcement learning. Finally, by comparing the desiderata from these unsolved problems and the current assumptions in continual learning, we highlight and discuss four future directions for continual learning research. We hope that this work offers an interesting perspective on the future of continual learning, while displaying its potential value and the paths we have to pursue in order to make it successful. This work is the result of the many discussions the authors had at the Dagstuhl seminar on Deep Continual Learning, in March 2023",

    "title": "LLMs as Visual Explainers: Advancing Image Classification with Evolving Visual Descriptions",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Vision-language models (VLMs) offer a promising paradigm for image classification by comparing the similarity between images and class embeddings. A critical challenge lies in crafting precise textual representations for class names. While previous studies have leveraged recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) to enhance these descriptors, their outputs often suffer from ambiguity and inaccuracy. We identify two primary causes: 1) The prevalent reliance on textual interactions with LLMs, leading to a mismatch between the generated text and the visual content in VLMs' latent space - a phenomenon we term the \"explain without seeing\" dilemma. 2) The oversight of the inter-class relationships, resulting in descriptors that fail to differentiate similar classes effectively. To address these issues, we propose a novel image classification framework combining VLMs with LLMs, named Iterative Optimization with Visual Feedback. In particular, our method develops an LLM-based agent, employing an evolutionary optimization strategy to refine class descriptors. Crucially, we incorporate visual feedback from VLM classification metrics, thereby guiding the optimization process with concrete visual data. Our method leads to improving accuracy on a wide range of image classification benchmarks, with 3.47\\% average gains over state-of-the-art methods. We also highlight the resulting descriptions serve as explainable and robust features that can consistently improve the performance across various backbone models",

    "title": "Identifying the Defective: Detecting Damaged Grains for Cereal Appearance Inspection",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Cereal grain plays a crucial role in the human diet as a major source of essential nutrients. Grain Appearance Inspection (GAI) serves as an essential process to determine grain quality and facilitate grain circulation and processing. However, GAI is routinely performed manually by inspectors with cumbersome procedures, which poses a significant bottleneck in smart agriculture. In this paper, we endeavor to develop an automated GAI system:AI4GrainInsp. By analyzing the distinctive characteristics of grain kernels, we formulate GAI as a ubiquitous problem: Anomaly Detection (AD), in which healthy and edible kernels are considered normal samples while damaged grains or unknown objects are regarded as anomalies. We further propose an AD model, called AD-GAI, which is trained using only normal samples yet can identify anomalies during inference. Moreover, we customize a prototype device for data acquisition and create a large-scale dataset including 220K high-quality images of wheat and maize kernels. Through extensive experiments, AD-GAI achieves considerable performance in comparison with advanced AD methods, and AI4GrainInsp has highly consistent performance compared to human experts and excels at inspection efficiency over 20x speedup.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Human facial data hold tremendous potential to address a variety of classification problems, including face recognition, age estimation, gender identification, emotion analysis, and race classification. However, recent privacy regulations, such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation and others, have restricted the ways in which human images may be collected and used for research. As a result, several previously published data sets containing human faces have been removed from the internet due to inadequate data collection methods that failed to meet privacy regulations. Data sets consisting of synthetic data have been proposed as an alternative, but they fall short of accurately representing the real data distribution. On the other hand, most available data sets are labeled for just a single task, which limits their applicability. To address these issues, we present the Multi-Task Faces (MTF) image data set, a meticulously curated collection of face images designed for various classification tasks, including face recognition, as well as race, gender, and age classification. The MTF data set has been ethically gathered by leveraging publicly available images of celebrities and strictly adhering to copyright regulations. In this paper, we present this data set and provide detailed descriptions of the followed data collection and processing procedures. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of five deep learning (DL) models on the MTF data set across the aforementioned classification tasks. Additionally, we compare the performance of DL models over the processed MTF data and over raw data crawled from the internet. The reported results constitute a baseline for further research employing these data.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Applying NeRF to downstream perception tasks for scene understanding and representation is becoming increasingly popular. Most existing methods treat semantic prediction as an additional rendering task, \\textit{i.e.}, the \"label rendering\" task, to build semantic NeRFs. However, by rendering semantic/instance labels per pixel without considering the contextual information of the rendered image, these methods usually suffer from unclear boundary segmentation and abnormal segmentation of pixels within an object. To solve this problem, we propose Generalized Perception NeRF (GP-NeRF), a novel pipeline that makes the widely used segmentation model and NeRF work compatibly under a unified framework, for facilitating context-aware 3D scene perception. To accomplish this goal, we introduce transformers to aggregate radiance as well as semantic embedding fields jointly for novel views and facilitate the joint volumetric rendering of both fields. In addition, we propose two self-distillation mechanisms, i.e., the Semantic Distill Loss and the Depth-Guided Semantic Distill Loss, to enhance the discrimination and quality of the semantic field and the maintenance of geometric consistency. In evaluation, we conduct experimental comparisons under two perception tasks (\\textit{i.e.} semantic and instance segmentation) using both synthetic and real-world datasets. Notably, our method outperforms SOTA approaches by 6.94\\%, 11.76\\%, and 8.47\\% on generalized semantic segmentation, finetuning semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation, respectively",

    "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have endowed LLMs with the ability to perceive and understand multi-modal signals. However, most of the existing MLLMs mainly adopt vision encoders pretrained on coarsely aligned image-text pairs, leading to insufficient extraction and reasoning of visual knowledge. To address this issue, we devise a dual-Level vIsual knOwledge eNhanced Multimodal Large Language Model (LION), which empowers the MLLM by injecting visual knowledge in two levels. 1) Progressive incorporation of fine-grained spatial-aware visual knowledge. We design a vision aggregator cooperated with region-level vision-language (VL) tasks to incorporate fine-grained spatial-aware visual knowledge into the MLLM. To alleviate the conflict between image-level and region-level VL tasks during incorporation, we devise a dedicated stage-wise instruction-tuning strategy with mixture-of-adapters. This progressive incorporation scheme contributes to the mutual promotion between these two kinds of VL tasks. 2) Soft prompting of high-level semantic visual evidence. We facilitate the MLLM with high-level semantic visual evidence by leveraging diverse image tags. To mitigate the potential influence caused by imperfect predicted tags, we propose a soft prompting method by embedding a learnable token into the tailored text instruction. Comprehensive experiments on several multi-modal benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our model (e.g., improvement of 5% accuracy on VSR and 3% CIDEr on TextCaps over InstructBLIP, 5% accuracy on RefCOCOg over Kosmos-2)",

    "abstract": "Generalizable NeRF can directly synthesize novel views across new scenes, eliminating the need for scene-specific retraining in vanilla NeRF. A critical enabling factor in these approaches is the extraction of a generalizable 3D representation by aggregating source-view features. In this paper, we propose an Entangled View-Epipolar Information Aggregation method dubbed EVE-NeRF. Different from existing methods that consider cross-view and along-epipolar information independently, EVE-NeRF conducts the view-epipolar feature aggregation in an entangled manner by injecting the scene-invariant appearance continuity and geometry consistency priors to the aggregation process. Our approach effectively mitigates the potential lack of inherent geometric and appearance constraint resulting from one-dimensional interactions, thus further boosting the 3D representation generalizablity. EVE-NeRF attains state-of-the-art performance across various evaluation scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstate that, compared to prevailing single-dimensional aggregation, the entangled network excels in the accuracy of 3D scene geometry and appearance reconstruction.Our project page is https://github.com/tatakai1/EVENeRF",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Image segmentation algorithms can be understood as a collection of pixel classifiers, for which the outcomes of nearby pixels are correlated. Classifier models can be calibrated using Inductive Conformal Prediction, but this requires holding back a sufficiently large calibration dataset for computing the distribution of non-conformity scores of the model's predictions. If one only requires only marginal calibration on the image level, this calibration set consists of all individual pixels in the images available for calibration. However, if the goal is to attain proper calibration for each individual pixel classifier, the calibration set consists of individual images. In a scenario where data are scarce (such as the medical domain), it may not always be possible to set aside sufficiently many images for this pixel-level calibration. The method we propose, dubbed ``Kandinsky calibration'', makes use of the spatial structure present in the distribution of natural images to simultaneously calibrate the classifiers of ``similar'' pixels. This can be seen as an intermediate approach between marginal (imagewise) and conditional (pixelwise) calibration, where non-conformity scores are aggregated over similar image regions, thereby making more efficient use of the images available for calibration. We run experiments on segmentation algorithms trained and calibrated on subsets of the public MS-COCO and Medical Decathlon datasets, demonstrating that Kandinsky calibration method can significantly improve the coverage. When compared to both pixelwise and imagewise calibration on little data, the Kandinsky method achieves much lower coverage errors, indicating the data efficiency of the Kandinsky calibration",

These representations are generated in the form of mathematical expressions between channels and are tailored to the specific class being segmented. Our methodology involves training an agent to identify the most informative expressions, updating the dataset using these expressions, and then using the updated dataset to perform segmentation. Due to the limited length of the expressions, the model receives useful representations without any added risk of overfitting.

Without the requirement of complex equipment, our method only takes simple RGB images captured by a drone as inputs to enable physically based and photorealistic novel-view rendering, relighting, and editing. However, a real-world facade usually has complex appearances ranging from diffuse rocks with subtle details to large-area glass windows with specular reflections, making it hard to attend to everything. As a result, previous methods can preserve the geometry details but fail to reconstruct smooth glass windows or verse vise. In order to address this challenge, we introduce three spatial- and semantic-adaptive optimization strategies, including a semantic regularization approach based on zero-shot segmentation techniques to improve material consistency, a frequency-aware geometry regularization to balance surface smoothness and details in different surfaces, and a visibility probe-based scheme to enable efficient modeling of the local lighting in large-scale outdoor environments. In addition, we capture a real-world facade aerial 3D scanning image set and corresponding point clouds for training and benchmarking.

This augmentation scheme mitigates the potential information loss that is commonly associated with various data augmentation techniques involving raw graph data, such as edge perturbation, node removal, and attribute masking. Second, we propose a CGCL model that can learn invariant graph representations. A cross-view training scheme is proposed to train the proposed CGCL model. This scheme attempts to maximize the consistency information between one augmented view and the graph structure reconstructed from the other augmented view. Furthermore, we offer a comprehensive theoretical CGCL analysis.

While practical use is limited by spatial resolution and image noise, incorporation of trained super-resolution (SR) networks has potential to enhance image quality post-scan. However, these efforts have predominantly been restricted to narrowly defined cardiovascular domains, with limited exploration of how SR performance extends across the cardiovascular system; a task aggravated by contrasting hemodynamic conditions apparent across the cardiovasculature. The aim of our study was to explore the generalizability of SR 4D Flow MRI using a combination of heterogeneous training sets and dedicated ensemble learning. With synthetic training data generated across three disparate domains (cardiac, aortic, cerebrovascular), varying convolutional base and ensemble learners were evaluated as a function of domain and architecture, quantifying performance on both in-silico and acquired in-vivo data from the same three domains. Results show that both bagging and stacking ensembling enhance SR performance across domains, accurately predicting high-resolution velocities from low-resolution input data in-silico. Likewise, optimized networks successfully recover native resolution velocities from downsampled in-vivo data, as well as show qualitative potential in generating denoised SR-images from clinical level input data. In conclusion, our work presents a viable approach for generalized SR 4D Flow MRI, with ensemble learning extending utility across various clinical areas of interest",

    "title": "CrackCLF: Automatic Pavement Crack Detection based on Closed-Loop Feedback",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Automatic pavement crack detection is an important task to ensure the functional performances of pavements during their service life. Inspired by deep learning (DL), the encoder-decoder framework is a powerful tool for crack detection. However, these models are usually open-loop (OL) systems that tend to treat thin cracks as the background. Meanwhile, these models can not automatically correct errors in the prediction, nor can it adapt to the changes of the environment to automatically extract and detect thin cracks. To tackle this problem, we embed closed-loop feedback (CLF) into the neural network so that the model could learn to correct errors on its own, based on generative adversarial networks (GAN). The resulting model is called CrackCLF and includes the front and back ends, i.e. segmentation and adversarial network. The front end with U-shape framework is employed to generate crack maps, and the back end with a multi-scale loss function is used to correct higher-order inconsistencies between labels and crack maps (generated by the front end) to address open-loop system issues. Empirical results show that the proposed CrackCLF outperforms others methods on three public datasets. Moreover, the proposed CLF can be defined as a plug and play module, which can be embedded into different neural network models to improve their performances",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "This work presents DocPedia, a novel large multimodal model (LMM) for versatile OCR-free document understanding, capable of parsing images up to 2,560$\\times$2,560 resolution. Unlike existing work either struggle with high-resolution documents or give up the large language model thus vision or language ability constrained, our DocPedia directly processes visual input in the frequency domain rather than the pixel space. The unique characteristic enables DocPedia to capture a greater amount of visual and textual information using a limited number of visual tokens. To consistently enhance both perception and comprehension abilities of our model, we develop a dual-stage training strategy and enrich instructions/annotations of all training tasks covering multiple document types. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments conducted on various publicly available benchmarks confirm the mutual benefits of jointly learning perception and comprehension tasks. The results provide further evidence of the effectiveness and superior performance of our DocPedia over other methods",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In this paper we propose a new flexible method for hand-eye calibration. The vast majority of existing hand-eye calibration techniques requires a calibration rig which is used in conjunction with camera pose estimation methods. Instead, we combine structure-from-motion with known robot motions and we show that the solution can be obtained in linear form. The latter solves for both the hand-eye parameters and for the unknown scale factor inherent with structure-from-motion methods. The algebraic analysis that is made possible with such a linear formulation allows to investigate not only the well known case of general screw motions but also such singular motions as pure translations, pure rotations, and planar motions. In essence, the robot-mounted camera looks to an unknown rigid layout, tracks points over an image sequence and estimates the camera-to-robot relationship. Such a self calibration process is relevant for unmanned vehicles, robots working in remote places, and so forth. We conduct a large number of experiments which validate the quality of the method by comparing it with existing ones",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have dramatically enhanced the field of language intelligence, as demonstrably evidenced by their formidable empirical performance across a spectrum of complex reasoning tasks. Additionally, theoretical proofs have illuminated their emergent reasoning capabilities, providing a compelling showcase of their advanced cognitive abilities in linguistic contexts. Critical to their remarkable efficacy in handling complex reasoning tasks, LLMs leverage the intriguing chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning techniques, obliging them to formulate intermediate steps en route to deriving an answer. The CoT reasoning approach has not only exhibited proficiency in amplifying reasoning performance but also in enhancing interpretability, controllability, and flexibility. In light of these merits, recent research endeavors have extended CoT reasoning methodologies to nurture the development of autonomous language agents, which adeptly adhere to language instructions and execute actions within varied environments. This survey paper orchestrates a thorough discourse, penetrating vital research dimensions, encompassing: (i) the foundational mechanics of CoT techniques, with a focus on elucidating the circumstances and justification behind its efficacy; (ii) the paradigm shift in CoT; and (iii) the burgeoning of language agents fortified by CoT approaches. Prospective research avenues envelop explorations into generalization, efficiency, customization, scaling, and safety. This paper caters to a wide audience, including beginners seeking comprehensive knowledge of CoT reasoning and language agents, as well as experienced researchers interested in foundational mechanics and engaging in cutting-edge discussions on these topics.

    "title": "Beyond Boundaries: A Comprehensive Survey of Transferable Attacks on AI Systems",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems such as autonomous vehicles, facial recognition, and speech recognition systems are increasingly integrated into our daily lives. However, despite their utility, these AI systems are vulnerable to a wide range of attacks such as adversarial, backdoor, data poisoning, membership inference, model inversion, and model stealing attacks. In particular, numerous attacks are designed to target a particular model or system, yet their effects can spread to additional targets, referred to as transferable attacks. Although considerable efforts have been directed toward developing transferable attacks, a holistic understanding of the advancements in transferable attacks remains elusive. In this paper, we comprehensively explore learning-based attacks from the perspective of transferability, particularly within the context of cyber-physical security. We delve into different domains -- the image, text, graph, audio, and video domains -- to highlight the ubiquitous and pervasive nature of transferable attacks. This paper categorizes and reviews the architecture of existing attacks from various viewpoints: data, process, model, and system. We further examine the implications of transferable attacks in practical scenarios such as autonomous driving, speech recognition, and large language models (LLMs). Additionally, we outline the potential research directions to encourage efforts in exploring the landscape of transferable attacks. This survey offers a holistic understanding of the prevailing transferable attacks and their impacts across different domains",

However, existing model architectures like ResNet, EfficientNet and ConvNeXt often underperform on smaller, specialised datasets typical of such projects. We address this gap with informed data collection and the development of a new CNN architecture, PhytNet. Utilising a novel dataset of infrared cocoa tree images, we demonstrate PhytNet's development and compare its performance with existing architectures. Data collection was informed by analysis of spectroscopy data, which provided useful insights into the spectral characteristics of cocoa trees. Such information could inform future data collection and model development. Cocoa was chosen as a focal species due to the diverse pathology of its diseases, which pose significant challenges for detection. ResNet18 showed some signs of overfitting, while EfficientNet variants showed distinct signs of overfitting. By contrast, PhytNet displayed excellent attention to relevant features, no overfitting, and an exceptionally low computation cost (1.19 GFLOPS). As such PhytNet is a promising candidate for rapid disease or plant classification, or precise localisation of disease symptoms for autonomous systems",

    "title": "Robust Tumor Segmentation with Hyperspectral Imaging and Graph Neural Networks",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Segmenting the boundary between tumor and healthy tissue during surgical cancer resection poses a significant challenge. In recent years, Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) combined with Machine Learning (ML) has emerged as a promising solution. However, due to the extensive information contained within the spectral domain, most ML approaches primarily classify individual HSI (super-)pixels, or tiles, without taking into account their spatial context. In this paper, we propose an improved methodology that leverages the spatial context of tiles for more robust and smoother segmentation. To address the irregular shapes of tiles, we utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to propagate context information across neighboring regions. The features for each tile within the graph are extracted using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is trained simultaneously with the subsequent GNN. Moreover, we incorporate local image quality metrics into the loss function to enhance the training procedure's robustness against low-quality regions in the training images. We demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method using a clinical ex vivo dataset consisting of 51 HSI images from 30 patients. Despite the limited dataset, the GNN-based model significantly outperforms context-agnostic approaches, accurately distinguishing between healthy and tumor tissues, even in images from previously unseen patients. Furthermore, we show that our carefully designed loss function, accounting for local image quality, results in additional improvements. Our findings demonstrate that context-aware GNN algorithms can robustly find tumor demarcations on HSI images, ultimately contributing to better surgery success and patient outcome",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The integration of multisource remote sensing data and deep learning models offers new possibilities for accurately mapping high spatial resolution forest height. We found that GEDI relative heights (RH) metrics exhibited strong correlation with the mean of the top 10 highest trees (dominant height) measured in situ at the corresponding footprint locations. Consequently, we proposed a novel deep learning framework termed the multi-modal attention remote sensing network (MARSNet) to estimate forest dominant height by extrapolating dominant height derived from GEDI, using Setinel-1 data, ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 data, Sentinel-2 optical data and ancillary data. MARSNet comprises separate encoders for each remote sensing data modality to extract multi-scale features, and a shared decoder to fuse the features and estimate height. Using individual encoders for each remote sensing imagery avoids interference across modalities and extracts distinct representations. To focus on the efficacious information from each dataset, we reduced the prevalent spatial and band redundancies in each remote sensing data by incorporating the extended spatial and band reconstruction convolution modules in the encoders. MARSNet achieved commendable performance in estimating dominant height, with an R2 of 0.62 and RMSE of 2.82 m, outperforming the widely used random forest approach which attained an R2 of 0.55 and RMSE of 3.05 m. Finally, we applied the trained MARSNet model to generate wall-to-wall maps at 10 m resolution for Jilin, China. Through independent validation using field measurements, MARSNet demonstrated an R2 of 0.58 and RMSE of 3.76 m, compared to 0.41 and 4.37 m for the random forest baseline. Our research demonstrates the effectiveness of a multimodal deep learning approach fusing GEDI with SAR and passive optical imagery for enhancing the accuracy of high resolution dominant height estimation",

    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been widely used for illumination estimation, which is time-consuming and requires sensor-specific data collection. Our proposed method uses a dual-mapping strategy and only requires a simple white point from a test sensor under a D65 condition. This allows us to derive a mapping matrix, enabling the reconstructions of image data and illuminants. In the second mapping phase, we transform the re-constructed image data into sparse features, which are then optimized with a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model using the re-constructed illuminants as ground truths. This approach effectively reduces sensor discrepancies and delivers performance on par with leading cross-sensor methods. It only requires a small amount of memory (~0.003 MB), and takes ~1 hour training on an RTX3070Ti GPU. More importantly, the method can be implemented very fast, with ~0.3 ms and ~1 ms on a GPU or CPU respectively, and is not sensitive to the input image resolution. Therefore, it offers a practical solution to the great challenges of data recollection that is faced by the industry",

    "title": "A Good Feature Extractor Is All You Need for Weakly Supervised Learning in Histopathology",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Deep learning is revolutionising pathology, offering novel opportunities in disease prognosis and personalised treatment. Historically, stain normalisation has been a crucial preprocessing step in computational pathology pipelines, and persists into the deep learning era. Yet, with the emergence of feature extractors trained using self-supervised learning (SSL) on diverse pathology datasets, we call this practice into question. In an empirical evaluation of publicly available feature extractors, we find that omitting stain normalisation and image augmentations does not compromise downstream performance, while incurring substantial savings in memory and compute. Further, we show that the top-performing feature extractors are remarkably robust to variations in stain and augmentations like rotation in their latent space. Contrary to previous patch-level benchmarking studies, our approach emphasises clinical relevance by focusing on slide-level prediction tasks in a weakly supervised setting with external validation cohorts. This work represents the most comprehensive robustness evaluation of public pathology SSL feature extractors to date, involving more than 6,000 training runs across nine tasks, five datasets, three downstream architectures, and various preprocessing setups. Our findings stand to streamline digital pathology workflows by minimising preprocessing needs and informing the selection of feature extractors",

A combination of two publicly available datasets, which is split into train and test sets, is used for training the CAN. This combined dataset is augmented to reduce overfitting to the 'normal' 60 - 80 bpm heart rate range by providing the full range of heart rates along with corresponding videos for each subject. This CAN, when implemented over video cropped to the subject's head, achieved a Mean Average Error (MAE) of just 0.99 bpm, proving its effectiveness on NIR video and the architecture's feasibility to regress an accurate signal output",

    "abstract": "Evaluating the risk level of adversarial images is essential for safely deploying face authentication models in the real world. Popular approaches for physical-world attacks, such as print or replay attacks, suffer from some limitations, like including physical and geometrical artifacts. Recently, adversarial attacks have gained attraction, which try to digitally deceive the learning strategy of a recognition system using slight modifications to the captured image. While most previous research assumes that the adversarial image could be digitally fed into the authentication systems, this is not always the case for systems deployed in the real world. This paper demonstrates the vulnerability of face authentication systems to adversarial images in physical world scenarios. We propose AdvGen, an automated Generative Adversarial Network, to simulate print and replay attacks and generate adversarial images that can fool state-of-the-art PADs in a physical domain attack setting. Using this attack strategy, the attack success rate goes up to 82.01%. We test AdvGen extensively on four datasets and ten state-of-the-art PADs.

    "abstract": "In the realm of medical imaging, precise segmentation of stroke lesions from brain MRI images stands as a critical challenge with significant implications for patient diagnosis and treatment. Addressing this, our study introduces an innovative approach using a Fuzzy Information Seeded Region Growing (FISRG) algorithm. Designed to effectively delineate the complex and irregular boundaries of stroke lesions, the FISRG algorithm combines fuzzy logic with Seeded Region Growing (SRG) techniques, aiming to enhance segmentation accuracy. The research involved three experiments to optimize the FISRG algorithm's performance, each focusing on different parameters to improve the accuracy of stroke lesion segmentation. The highest Dice score achieved in these experiments was 94.2\\%, indicating a high degree of similarity between the algorithm's output and the expert-validated ground truth. Notably, the best average Dice score, amounting to 88.1\\%, was recorded in the third experiment, highlighting the efficacy of the algorithm in consistently segmenting stroke lesions across various slices. Our findings reveal the FISRG algorithm's strengths in handling the heterogeneity of stroke lesions. However, challenges remain in areas of abrupt lesion topology changes and in distinguishing lesions from similar intensity brain regions. The results underscore the potential of the FISRG algorithm in contributing significantly to advancements in medical imaging analysis for stroke diagnosis and treatment",

We show that giving more weight to large objects leads to improved detection scores across all object sizes and so an overall improvement in Object Detectors performances (+2 p.p. of mAP on small objects, +2 p.p. on medium and +4 p.p. on large on COCO val 2017 with InternImage-T).

Compared to recent SLAM methods employing neural implicit representations, our method utilizes a real-time differentiable splatting rendering pipeline that offers significant speedup to map optimization and RGB-D re-rendering. Specifically, we propose an adaptive expansion strategy that adds new or deletes noisy 3D Gaussian in order to efficiently reconstruct new observed scene geometry and improve the mapping of previously observed areas. This strategy is essential to extend 3D Gaussian representation to reconstruct the whole scene rather than synthesize a static object in existing methods. Moreover, in the pose tracking process, an effective coarse-to-fine technique is designed to select reliable 3D Gaussian representations to optimize camera pose, resulting in runtime reduction and robust estimation. Our method achieves competitive performance compared with existing state-of-the-art real-time methods on the Replica, TUM-RGBD datasets. The source code will be released soon",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel framework termed Cut-and-Paste for real-word semantic video editing under the guidance of text prompt and additional reference image. While the text-driven video editing has demonstrated remarkable ability to generate highly diverse videos following given text prompts, the fine-grained semantic edits are hard to control by plain textual prompt only in terms of object details and edited region, and cumbersome long text descriptions are usually needed for the task. We therefore investigate subject-driven video editing for more precise control of both edited regions and background preservation, and fine-grained semantic generation. We achieve this goal by introducing an reference image as supplementary input to the text-driven video editing, which avoids racking your brain to come up with a cumbersome text prompt describing the detailed appearance of the object. To limit the editing area, we refer to a method of cross attention control in image editing and successfully extend it to video editing by fusing the attention map of adjacent frames, which strikes a balance between maintaining video background and spatio-temporal consistency. Compared with current methods, the whole process of our method is like ``cut\" the source object to be edited and then ``paste\" the target object provided by reference image. We demonstrate that our method performs favorably over prior arts for video editing under the guidance of text prompt and extra reference image, as measured by both quantitative and subjective evaluations",

    "abstract": "The generalization capability of existing image restoration and enhancement (IRE) methods is constrained by the limited pre-trained datasets, making it difficult to handle agnostic inputs such as different degradation levels and scenarios beyond their design scopes. Moreover, they are not equipped with interactive mechanisms to consider user preferences or feedback, and their end-to-end settings cannot provide users with more choices. Faced with the above-mentioned IRE method's limited performance and insufficient interactivity, we try to solve it from the engineering and system framework levels. Specifically, we propose Clarity ChatGPT-a transformative system that combines the conversational intelligence of ChatGPT with multiple IRE methods. Clarity ChatGPT can automatically detect image degradation types and select appropriate IRE methods to restore images, or iteratively generate satisfactory results based on user feedback. Its innovative features include a CLIP-powered detector for accurate degradation classification, no-reference image quality evaluation for performance evaluation, region-specific processing for precise enhancements, and advanced fusion techniques for optimal restoration results. Clarity ChatGPT marks a significant advancement in integrating language and vision, enhancing image-text interactions, and providing a robust, high-performance IRE solution. Our case studies demonstrate that Clarity ChatGPT effectively improves the generalization and interaction capabilities in the IRE, and also fills the gap in the low-level domain of the existing vision-language model",

    "title": "Segment Together: A Versatile Paradigm for Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Annotation scarcity has become a major obstacle for training powerful deep-learning models for medical image segmentation, restricting their deployment in clinical scenarios. To address it, semi-supervised learning by exploiting abundant unlabeled data is highly desirable to boost the model training. However, most existing works still focus on limited medical tasks and underestimate the potential of learning across diverse tasks and multiple datasets. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a \\textbf{Ver}satile \\textbf{Semi}-supervised framework (VerSemi) to point out a new perspective that integrates various tasks into a unified model with a broad label space, to exploit more unlabeled data for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Specifically, we introduce a dynamic task-prompted design to segment various targets from different datasets. Next, this unified model is used to identify the foreground regions from all labeled data, to capture cross-dataset semantics. Particularly, we create a synthetic task with a cutmix strategy to augment foreground targets within the expanded label space. To effectively utilize unlabeled data, we introduce a consistency constraint. This involves aligning aggregated predictions from various tasks with those from the synthetic task, further guiding the model in accurately segmenting foreground regions during training. We evaluated our VerSemi model on four public benchmarking datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrated that VerSemi can consistently outperform the second-best method by a large margin (e.g., an average 2.69\\% Dice gain on four datasets), setting new SOTA performance for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. The code will be released",

    "abstract": "Video prediction aims to predict future frames from a video's previous content. Existing methods mainly process video data where the time dimension mingles with the space and channel dimensions from three distinct angles: as a sequence of individual frames, as a 3D volume in spatiotemporal coordinates, or as a stacked image where frames are treated as separate channels. Most of them generally focus on one of these perspectives and may fail to fully exploit the relationships across different dimensions. To address this issue, this paper introduces a convolutional mixer for video prediction, termed ViP-Mixer, to model the spatiotemporal evolution in the latent space of an autoencoder. The ViP-Mixers are stacked sequentially and interleave feature mixing at three levels: frames, channels, and locations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves new state-of-the-art prediction performance on three benchmark video datasets covering both synthetic and real-world scenarios",

    "abstract": "Retinal disease is one of the primary causes of visual impairment, and early diagnosis is essential for preventing further deterioration. Nowadays, many works have explored Transformers for diagnosing diseases due to their strong visual representation capabilities. However, retinal diseases exhibit milder forms and often present with overlapping signs, which pose great difficulties for accurate multi-class classification. Therefore, we propose a new framework named Multi-Scale Patch Message Passing Swin Transformer for multi-class retinal disease classification. Specifically, we design a Patch Message Passing (PMP) module based on the Message Passing mechanism to establish global interaction for pathological semantic features and to exploit the subtle differences further between different diseases. Moreover, considering the various scale of pathological features we integrate multiple PMP modules for different patch sizes. For evaluation, we have constructed a new dataset, named OPTOS dataset, consisting of 1,033 high-resolution fundus images photographed by Optos camera and conducted comprehensive experiments to validate the efficacy of our proposed method. And the results on both the public dataset and our dataset demonstrate that our method achieves remarkable performance compared to state-of-the-art methods",

    "title": "ODDR: Outlier Detection & Dimension Reduction Based Defense Against Adversarial Patches",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Adversarial attacks are a major deterrent towards the reliable use of machine learning models. A powerful type of adversarial attacks is the patch-based attack, wherein the adversarial perturbations modify localized patches or specific areas within the images to deceive the trained machine learning model. In this paper, we introduce Outlier Detection and Dimension Reduction (ODDR), a holistic defense mechanism designed to effectively mitigate patch-based adversarial attacks. In our approach, we posit that input features corresponding to adversarial patches, whether naturalistic or otherwise, deviate from the inherent distribution of the remaining image sample and can be identified as outliers or anomalies. ODDR employs a three-stage pipeline: Fragmentation, Segregation, and Neutralization, providing a model-agnostic solution applicable to both image classification and object detection tasks. The Fragmentation stage parses the samples into chunks for the subsequent Segregation process. Here, outlier detection techniques identify and segregate the anomalous features associated with adversarial perturbations. The Neutralization stage utilizes dimension reduction methods on the outliers to mitigate the impact of adversarial perturbations without sacrificing pertinent information necessary for the machine learning task. Extensive testing on benchmark datasets and state-of-the-art adversarial patches demonstrates the effectiveness of ODDR. Results indicate robust accuracies matching and lying within a small range of clean accuracies (1%-3% for classification and 3%-5% for object detection), with only a marginal compromise of 1%-2% in performance on clean samples, thereby significantly outperforming other defenses",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Towards holistic understanding of 3D scenes, a general 3D segmentation method is needed that can segment diverse objects without restrictions on object quantity or categories, while also reflecting the inherent hierarchical structure. To achieve this, we propose OmniSeg3D, an omniversal segmentation method aims for segmenting anything in 3D all at once. The key insight is to lift multi-view inconsistent 2D segmentations into a consistent 3D feature field through a hierarchical contrastive learning framework, which is accomplished by two steps. Firstly, we design a novel hierarchical representation based on category-agnostic 2D segmentations to model the multi-level relationship among pixels. Secondly, image features rendered from the 3D feature field are clustered at different levels, which can be further drawn closer or pushed apart according to the hierarchical relationship between different levels. In tackling the challenges posed by inconsistent 2D segmentations, this framework yields a global consistent 3D feature field, which further enables hierarchical segmentation, multi-object selection, and global discretization. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on high-quality 3D segmentation and accurate hierarchical structure understanding.

    "abstract": "Pansharpening, a pivotal task in remote sensing, involves integrating low-resolution multispectral images with high-resolution panchromatic images to synthesize an image that is both high-resolution and retains multispectral information. These pansharpened images enhance precision in land cover classification, change detection, and environmental monitoring within remote sensing data analysis. While deep learning techniques have shown significant success in pansharpening, existing methods often face limitations in their evaluation, focusing on restricted satellite data sources, single scene types, and low-resolution images. This paper addresses this gap by introducing PanBench, a high-resolution multi-scene dataset containing all mainstream satellites and comprising 5,898 pairs of samples. Each pair includes a four-channel (RGB + near-infrared) multispectral image of 256x256 pixels and a mono-channel panchromatic image of 1,024x1,024 pixels.

    "abstract": "Recovering temporally consistent 3D human body pose, shape and motion from a monocular video is a challenging task due to (self-)occlusions, poor lighting conditions, complex articulated body poses, depth ambiguity, and limited availability of annotated data. Further, doing a simple perframe estimation is insufficient as it leads to jittery and implausible results. In this paper, we propose a novel method for temporally consistent motion estimation from a monocular video. Instead of using generic ResNet-like features, our method uses a body-aware feature representation and an independent per-frame pose and camera initialization over a temporal window followed by a novel spatio-temporal feature aggregation by using a combination of self-similarity and self-attention over the body-aware features and the perframe initialization. Together, they yield enhanced spatiotemporal context for every frame by considering remaining past and future frames. These features are used to predict the pose and shape parameters of the human body model, which are further refined using an LSTM. Experimental results on the publicly available benchmark data show that our method attains significantly lower acceleration error and outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods over all key quantitative evaluation metrics, including complex scenarios like partial occlusion, complex poses and even relatively low illumination",

    "abstract": "The rapidly emerging field of deep learning-based computational pathology has shown promising results in utilizing whole slide images (WSIs) to objectively prognosticate cancer patients. However, most prognostic methods are currently limited to either histopathology or genomics alone, which inevitably reduces their potential to accurately predict patient prognosis. Whereas integrating WSIs and genomic features presents three main challenges: (1) the enormous heterogeneity of gigapixel WSIs which can reach sizes as large as 150,000x150,000 pixels; (2) the absence of a spatially corresponding relationship between histopathology images and genomic molecular data; and (3) the existing early, late, and intermediate multimodal feature fusion strategies struggle to capture the explicit interactions between WSIs and genomics. To ameliorate these issues, we propose the Mutual-Guided Cross-Modality Transformer (MGCT), a weakly-supervised, attention-based multimodal learning framework that can combine histology features and genomic features to model the genotype-phenotype interactions within the tumor microenvironment. To validate the effectiveness of MGCT, we conduct experiments using nearly 3,600 gigapixel WSIs across five different cancer types sourced from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).

    "abstract": "Object detection in aerial images is a pivotal task for various earth observation applications, whereas current algorithms learn to detect only a pre-defined set of object categories demanding sufficient bounding-box annotated training samples and fail to detect novel object categories. In this paper, we consider open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) in aerial images that enables the characterization of new objects beyond training categories on the earth surface without annotating training images for these new categories. The performance of OVD depends on the quality of class-agnostic region proposals and pseudo-labels that can generalize well to novel object categories. To simultaneously generate high-quality proposals and pseudo-labels, we propose CastDet, a CLIP-activated student-teacher open-vocabulary object Detection framework. Our end-to-end framework within the student-teacher mechanism employs the CLIP model as an extra omniscient teacher of rich knowledge into the student-teacher self-learning process. By doing so, our approach boosts novel object proposals and classification. Furthermore, we design a dynamic label queue technique to maintain high-quality pseudo labels during batch training and mitigate label imbalance. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple existing aerial object detection datasets, which are set up for the OVD task. Experimental results demonstrate our CastDet achieving superior open-vocabulary detection performance, e.g., reaching 40.0 HM (Harmonic Mean), which outperforms previous methods Detic/ViLD by 26.9/21.1 on the VisDroneZSD dataset",

    "abstract": "Illumination degradation image restoration (IDIR) techniques aim to improve the visibility of degraded images and mitigate the adverse effects of deteriorated illumination. Among these algorithms, diffusion model (DM)-based methods have shown promising performance but are often burdened by heavy computational demands and pixel misalignment issues when predicting the image-level distribution. To tackle these problems, we propose to leverage DM within a compact latent space to generate concise guidance priors and introduce a novel solution called Reti-Diff for the IDIR task. Reti-Diff comprises two key components: the Retinex-based latent DM (RLDM) and the Retinex-guided transformer (RGformer). To ensure detailed reconstruction and illumination correction, RLDM is empowered to acquire Retinex knowledge and extract reflectance and illumination priors. These priors are subsequently utilized by RGformer to guide the decomposition of image features into their respective reflectance and illumination components. Following this, RGformer further enhances and consolidates the decomposed features, resulting in the production of refined images with consistent content and robustness to handle complex degradation scenarios. Extensive experiments show that Reti-Diff outperforms existing methods on three IDIR tasks, as well as downstream applications.

We use glaucoma diagnosis based on color fundus images as an example to show the possibility of performing segmentation and classification in real time on embedded boards and to highlight the different energy requirements of the studied implementations. Several other works develop the use of segmentation and feature extraction techniques to detect glaucoma, among many other pathologies, with deep neural networks. Memory limitations and low processing capabilities of embedded accelerated systems (EAS) limit their use for deep network-based system training. However, including specific acceleration hardware, such as NVIDIA's Maxwell GPU or Google's Edge TPU, enables them to perform inferences using complex pre-trained networks in very reasonable times. In this study, we evaluate the timing and energy performance of two EAS equipped with Machine Learning (ML) accelerators executing an example diagnostic tool developed in a previous work. For optic disc (OD) and cup (OC) segmentation, the obtained prediction times per image are under 29 and 43 ms using Edge TPUs and Maxwell GPUs, respectively. Prediction times for the classification subsystem are lower than 10 and 14 ms for Edge TPUs and Maxwell GPUs, respectively.

Ideally, these classifiers encode the salient features indicative for each disease class and can steer the diffusion model to show realistic disease signs or remove disease-related lesions in a realistic way.

We employ two MLPs to model pose-dependent deformation and linear skinning (LBS) weights. The representation of appearance relies on a decoder and the features that attached to each point. In contrast to alternative implicit approaches, the oriented points representation not only provides a more intuitive way to model human avatar animation but also significantly reduces both training and inference time. Moreover, we propose a novel method to transfer semantic information from the SMPL-X model to the points, which enables to better understand human body movements. By leveraging the semantic information of points, we can facilitate virtual try-on and human avatar composition through exchanging the points of same category across different subjects.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Visual geolocalization is a cost-effective and scalable task that involves matching one or more query images, taken at some unknown location, to a set of geo-tagged reference images. Existing methods, devoted to semantic features representation, evolving towards robustness to a wide variety between query and reference, including illumination and viewpoint changes, as well as scale and seasonal variations. However, practical visual geolocalization approaches need to be robust in appearance changing and extreme viewpoint variation conditions, while providing accurate global location estimates. Therefore, inspired by curriculum design, human learn general knowledge first and then delve into professional expertise. We first recognize semantic scene and then measure geometric structure. Our approach, termed CurriculumLoc, involves a delicate design of multi-stage refinement pipeline and a novel keypoint detection and description with global semantic awareness and local geometric verification. We rerank candidates and solve a particular cross-domain perspective-n-point (PnP) problem based on these keypoints and corresponding descriptors, position refinement occurs incrementally. The extensive experimental results on our collected dataset, TerraTrack and a benchmark dataset, ALTO, demonstrate that our approach results in the aforementioned desirable characteristics of a practical visual geolocalization solution. Additionally, we achieve new high recall@1 scores of 62.6% and 94.5% on ALTO, with two different distances metrics, respectively.

    "title": "A Multi-In-Single-Out Network for Video Frame Interpolation without Optical Flow",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In general, deep learning-based video frame interpolation (VFI) methods have predominantly focused on estimating motion vectors between two input frames and warping them to the target time. While this approach has shown impressive performance for linear motion between two input frames, it exhibits limitations when dealing with occlusions and nonlinear movements. Recently, generative models have been applied to VFI to address these issues. However, as VFI is not a task focused on generating plausible images, but rather on predicting accurate intermediate frames between two given frames, performance limitations still persist. In this paper, we propose a multi-in-single-out (MISO) based VFI method that does not rely on motion vector estimation, allowing it to effectively model occlusions and nonlinear motion. Additionally, we introduce a novel motion perceptual loss that enables MISO-VFI to better capture the spatio-temporal correlations within the video frames. Our MISO-VFI method achieves state-of-the-art results on VFI benchmarks Vimeo90K, Middlebury, and UCF101, with a significant performance gap compared to existing approaches",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Diffusion-based image restoration (IR) methods aim to use diffusion models to recover high-quality (HQ) images from degraded images and achieve promising performance. Due to the inherent property of diffusion models, most of these methods need long serial sampling chains to restore HQ images step-by-step. As a result, it leads to expensive sampling time and high computation costs. Moreover, such long sampling chains hinder understanding the relationship between the restoration results and the inputs since it is hard to compute the gradients in the whole chains. In this work, we aim to rethink the diffusion-based IR models through a different perspective, i.e., a deep equilibrium (DEQ) fixed point system. Specifically, we derive an analytical solution by modeling the entire sampling chain in diffusion-based IR models as a joint multivariate fixed point system. With the help of the analytical solution, we are able to conduct single-image sampling in a parallel way and restore HQ images without training. Furthermore, we compute fast gradients in DEQ and found that initialization optimization can boost performance and control the generation direction. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method on typical IR tasks and real-world settings. The code and models will be made publicly available",

    "title": "Predicting urban tree cover from incomplete point labels and limited background information",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Trees inside cities are important for the urban microclimate, contributing positively to the physical and mental health of the urban dwellers. Despite their importance, often only limited information about city trees is available. Therefore in this paper, we propose a method for mapping urban trees in high-resolution aerial imagery using limited datasets and deep learning. Deep learning has become best-practice for this task, however, existing approaches rely on large and accurately labelled training datasets, which can be difficult and expensive to obtain. However, often noisy and incomplete data may be available that can be combined and utilized to solve more difficult tasks than those datasets were intended for. This paper studies how to combine accurate point labels of urban trees along streets with crowd-sourced annotations from an open geographic database to delineate city trees in remote sensing images, a task which is challenging even for humans. To that end, we perform semantic segmentation of very high resolution aerial imagery using a fully convolutional neural network. The main challenge is that our segmentation maps are sparsely annotated and incomplete. Small areas around the point labels of the street trees coming from official and crowd-sourced data are marked as foreground class. Crowd-sourced annotations of streets, buildings, etc. define the background class. Since the tree data is incomplete, we introduce a masking to avoid class confusion. Our experiments in Hamburg, Germany, showed that the system is able to produce tree cover maps, not limited to trees along streets, without providing tree delineations. We evaluated the method on manually labelled trees and show that performance drastically deteriorates if the open geographic database is not used",

    "title": "FreeKD: Knowledge Distillation via Semantic Frequency Prompt",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Knowledge distillation (KD) has been applied to various tasks successfully, and mainstream methods typically boost the student model via spatial imitation losses. However, the consecutive downsamplings induced in the spatial domain of teacher model is a type of corruption, hindering the student from analyzing what specific information needs to be imitated, which results in accuracy degradation. To better understand the underlying pattern of corrupted feature maps, we shift our attention to the frequency domain. During frequency distillation, we encounter a new challenge: the low-frequency bands convey general but minimal context, while the high are more informative but also introduce noise. Not each pixel within the frequency bands contributes equally to the performance. To address the above problem: (1) We propose the Frequency Prompt plugged into the teacher model, absorbing the semantic frequency context during finetuning. (2) During the distillation period, a pixel-wise frequency mask is generated via Frequency Prompt, to localize those pixel of interests (PoIs) in various frequency bands. Additionally, we employ a position-aware relational frequency loss for dense prediction tasks, delivering a high-order spatial enhancement to the student model. We dub our Frequency Knowledge Distillation method as FreeKD, which determines the optimal localization and extent for the frequency distillation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FreeKD not only outperforms spatial-based distillation methods consistently on dense prediction tasks (e.g., FreeKD brings 3.8 AP gains for RepPoints-R50 on COCO2017 and 4.55 mIoU gains for PSPNet-R18 on Cityscapes), but also conveys more robustness to the student. Notably, we also validate the generalization of our approach on large-scale vision models (e.g., DINO and SAM)",

    "title": "Advancing Urban Renewal: An Automated Approach to Generating Historical Arcade Facades with Stable Diffusion Models",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Urban renewal and transformation processes necessitate the preservation of the historical urban fabric, particularly in districts known for their architectural and historical significance. These regions, with their diverse architectural styles, have traditionally required extensive preliminary research, often leading to subjective results. However, the advent of machine learning models has opened up new avenues for generating building facade images. Despite this, creating high-quality images for historical district renovations remains challenging, due to the complexity and diversity inherent in such districts. In response to these challenges, our study introduces a new methodology for automatically generating images of historical arcade facades, utilizing Stable Diffusion models conditioned on textual descriptions. By classifying and tagging a variety of arcade styles, we have constructed several realistic arcade facade image datasets. We trained multiple low-rank adaptation (LoRA) models to control the stylistic aspects of the generated images, supplemented by ControlNet models for improved precision and authenticity. Our approach has demonstrated high levels of precision, authenticity, and diversity in the generated images, showing promising potential for real-world urban renewal projects. This new methodology offers a more efficient and accurate alternative to conventional design processes in urban renewal, bypassing issues of unconvincing image details, lack of precision, and limited stylistic variety. Future research could focus on integrating this two-dimensional image generation with three-dimensional modeling techniques, providing a more comprehensive solution for renovating architectural facades in historical districts",

    "title": "AKConv: Convolutional Kernel with Arbitrary Sampled Shapes and Arbitrary Number of Parameters",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Neural networks based on convolutional operations have achieved remarkable results in the field of deep learning, but there are two inherent flaws in standard convolutional operations. On the one hand, the convolution operation be confined to a local window and cannot capture information from other locations, and its sampled shapes is fixed. On the other hand, the size of the convolutional kernel is fixed to k $\\times$ k, which is a fixed square shape, and the number of parameters tends to grow squarely with size. It is obvious that the shape and size of targets are various in different datasets and at different locations. Convolutional kernels with fixed sample shapes and squares do not adapt well to changing targets. In response to the above questions, the Alterable Kernel Convolution (AKConv) is explored in this work, which gives the convolution kernel an arbitrary number of parameters and arbitrary sampled shapes to provide richer options for the trade-off between network overhead and performance. In AKConv, we define initial positions for convolutional kernels of arbitrary size by means of a new coordinate generation algorithm. To adapt to changes for targets, we introduce offsets to adjust the shape of the samples at each position. Moreover, we explore the effect of the neural network by using the AKConv with the same size and different initial sampled shapes. AKConv completes the process of efficient feature extraction by irregular convolutional operations and brings more exploration options for convolutional sampling shapes. Object detection experiments on representative datasets COCO2017, VOC 7+12 and VisDrone-DET2021 fully demonstrate the advantages of AKConv. AKConv can be used as a plug-and-play convolutional operation to replace convolutional operations to improve network performance.

    "abstract": "Recently, there has been an upsurge in the research on maritime vision, where a lot of works are influenced by the application of computer vision for Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs). Various sensor modalities such as camera, radar, and lidar have been used to perform tasks such as object detection, segmentation, object tracking, and motion planning. A large subset of this research is focused on the video analysis, since most of the current vessel fleets contain the camera's onboard for various surveillance tasks. Due to the vast abundance of the video data, video scene change detection is an initial and crucial stage for scene understanding of USVs. This paper outlines our approach to detect dynamic scene changes in USVs. To the best of our understanding, this work represents the first investigation of scene change detection in the maritime vision application. Our objective is to identify significant changes in the dynamic scenes of maritime video data, particularly those scenes that exhibit a high degree of resemblance. In our system for dynamic scene change detection, we propose completely unsupervised learning method. In contrast to earlier studies, we utilize a modified cutting-edge generative picture model called VQ-VAE-2 to train on multiple marine datasets, aiming to enhance the feature extraction. Next, we introduce our innovative similarity scoring technique for directly calculating the level of similarity in a sequence of consecutive frames by utilizing grid calculation on retrieved features.

    "abstract": "The crossMoDA2023 challenge aims to segment the vestibular schwannoma (sub-divided into intra- and extra-meatal components) and cochlea regions of unlabeled hrT2 scans by leveraging labeled ceT1 scans. In this work, we proposed a 3D multi-style cross-modality segmentation framework for the crossMoDA2023 challenge, including the multi-style translation and self-training segmentation phases. Considering heterogeneous distributions and various image sizes in multi-institutional scans, we first utilize the min-max normalization, voxel size resampling, and center cropping to obtain fixed-size sub-volumes from ceT1 and hrT2 scans for training. Then, we perform the multi-style image translation phase to overcome the intensity distribution discrepancy between unpaired multi-modal scans. Specifically, we design three different translation networks with 2D or 2.5D inputs to generate multi-style and realistic target-like volumes from labeled ceT1 volumes. Finally, we perform the self-training volumetric segmentation phase in the target domain, which employs the nnU-Net framework and iterative self-training method using pseudo-labels for training accurate segmentation models in the unlabeled target domain. On the crossMoDA2023 validation dataset, our method produces promising results and achieves the mean DSC values of 72.78% and 80.64% and ASSD values of 5.85 mm and 0.25 mm for VS tumor and cochlea regions, respectively.

Current works have significantly advanced the problem in terms of model and data. However, the overall performance of most FSOD methods still does not fulfill the desired accuracy. In this paper we improve the FSOD model to address the severe issue of sample imbalance and weak feature propagation. To alleviate modeling bias from data-sufficient base classes, we examine the effect of decoupling the parameters for classes with sufficient data and classes with few samples in various ways. We design a base-novel categories decoupled DETR (DeDETR) for FSOD. We also explore various types of skip connection between the encoder and decoder for DETR. Besides, we notice that the best outputs could come from the intermediate layer of the decoder instead of the last layer; therefore, we build a unified decoder module that could dynamically fuse the decoder layers as the output feature. We evaluate our model on commonly used datasets such as PASCAL VOC and MSCOCO.

    "abstract": "Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly prominent in the field of artificial intelligence. These models not only excel in traditional vision-language tasks but also demonstrate impressive performance in contemporary multi-modal benchmarks. Although many of these benchmarks attempt to holistically evaluate MLLMs, they typically concentrate on basic reasoning tasks, often yielding only simple yes/no or multi-choice responses. These methods naturally lead to confusion and difficulties in conclusively determining the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. To mitigate this issue, we manually curate a benchmark dataset specifically designed for MLLMs, with a focus on complex reasoning tasks. Our benchmark comprises three key reasoning categories: deductive, abductive, and analogical reasoning. The queries in our dataset are intentionally constructed to engage the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs in the process of generating answers. For a fair comparison across various MLLMs, we incorporate intermediate reasoning steps into our evaluation criteria. In instances where an MLLM is unable to produce a definitive answer, its reasoning ability is evaluated by requesting intermediate reasoning steps. If these steps align with our manual annotations, appropriate scores are assigned. This evaluation scheme resembles methods commonly used in human assessments, such as exams or assignments, and represents what we consider a more effective assessment technique compared with existing benchmarks. We evaluate a selection of representative MLLMs using this rigorously developed open-ended multi-step elaborate reasoning benchmark, designed to challenge and accurately measure their reasoning capabilities.

While current image-level detection method fails to generalize to unseen domains, owing to the domain-shift phenomenon brought by CNN's strong inductive bias towards Deepfake texture, video-level one shows its potential to have both generalization across multiple domains and robustness to compression. We argue that although distinct face manipulation tools have different inherent bias, they all disrupt the consistency between frames, which is a natural characteristic shared by authentic videos. Inspired by this, we proposed a detection approach by capturing frame inconsistency that broadly exists in different forgery techniques, termed unearthing-common-inconsistency (UCI). Concretely, the UCI network based on self-supervised contrastive learning can better distinguish temporal consistency between real and fake videos from multiple domains. We introduced a temporally-preserved module method to introduce spatial noise perturbations, directing the model's attention towards temporal information. Subsequently, leveraging a multi-view cross-correlation learning module, we extensively learn the disparities in temporal representations between genuine and fake samples.

    "title": "Generalized Category Discovery in Semantic Segmentation",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "This paper explores a novel setting called Generalized Category Discovery in Semantic Segmentation (GCDSS), aiming to segment unlabeled images given prior knowledge from a labeled set of base classes. The unlabeled images contain pixels of the base class or novel class. In contrast to Novel Category Discovery in Semantic Segmentation (NCDSS), there is no prerequisite for prior knowledge mandating the existence of at least one novel class in each unlabeled image. Besides, we broaden the segmentation scope beyond foreground objects to include the entire image. Existing NCDSS methods rely on the aforementioned priors, making them challenging to truly apply in real-world situations. We propose a straightforward yet effective framework that reinterprets the GCDSS challenge as a task of mask classification. Additionally, we construct a baseline method and introduce the Neighborhood Relations-Guided Mask Clustering Algorithm (NeRG-MaskCA) for mask categorization to address the fragmentation in semantic representation. A benchmark dataset, Cityscapes-GCD, derived from the Cityscapes dataset, is established to evaluate the GCDSS framework. Our method demonstrates the feasibility of the GCDSS problem and the potential for discovering and segmenting novel object classes in unlabeled images. We employ the generated pseudo-labels from our approach as ground truth to supervise the training of other models, thereby enabling them with the ability to segment novel classes. It paves the way for further research in generalized category discovery, broadening the horizons of semantic segmentation and its applications.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for ensuring the reliability of open-world intelligent systems. Despite the notable advancements in existing OOD detection methodologies, our study identifies a significant performance drop under the scarcity of training samples. In this context, we introduce a novel few-shot OOD detection benchmark, carefully constructed to address this gap. Our empirical analysis reveals the superiority of ParameterEfficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) strategies, such as visual prompt tuning and visual adapter tuning, over conventional techniques, including fully fine-tuning and linear probing tuning in the few-shot OOD detection task. Recognizing some crucial information from the pre-trained model, which is pivotal for OOD detection, may be lost during the fine-tuning process, we propose a method termed DomainSpecific and General Knowledge Fusion (DSGF). This approach is designed to be compatible with diverse fine-tuning frameworks. Our experiments show that the integration of DSGF significantly enhances the few-shot OOD detection capabilities across various methods and fine-tuning methodologies, including fully fine-tuning, visual adapter tuning, and visual prompt tuning. The code will be released",

    "title": "Liver Tumor Prediction with Advanced Attention Mechanisms Integrated into a Depth-Based Variant Search Algorithm",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In recent days, Deep Learning (DL) techniques have become an emerging transformation in the field of machine learning, artificial intelligence, computer vision, and so on. Subsequently, researchers and industries have been highly endorsed in the medical field, predicting and controlling diverse diseases at specific intervals. Liver tumor prediction is a vital chore in analyzing and treating liver diseases. This paper proposes a novel approach for predicting liver tumors using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and a depth-based variant search algorithm with advanced attention mechanisms (CNN-DS-AM). The proposed work aims to improve accuracy and robustness in diagnosing and treating liver diseases. The anticipated model is assessed on a Computed Tomography (CT) scan dataset containing both benign and malignant liver tumors. The proposed approach achieved high accuracy in predicting liver tumors, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, advanced attention mechanisms were incorporated into the CNN model to enable the identification and highlighting of regions of the CT scans most relevant to predicting liver tumors. The results suggest that incorporating attention mechanisms and a depth-based variant search algorithm into the CNN model is a promising approach for improving the accuracy and robustness of liver tumor prediction. It can assist radiologists in their diagnosis and treatment planning. The proposed system achieved a high accuracy of 95.5% in predicting liver tumors, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods",

    "title": "Seeing through the Mask: Multi-task Generative Mask Decoupling Face Recognition",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic make people wear masks more frequently than ever. Current general face recognition system suffers from serious performance degradation,when encountering occluded scenes. The potential reason is that face features are corrupted by occlusions on key facial regions. To tackle this problem, previous works either extract identity-related embeddings on feature level by additional mask prediction, or restore the occluded facial part by generative models. However, the former lacks visual results for model interpretation, while the latter suffers from artifacts which may affect downstream recognition. Therefore, this paper proposes a Multi-task gEnerative mask dEcoupling face Recognition (MEER) network to jointly handle these two tasks, which can learn occlusionirrelevant and identity-related representation while achieving unmasked face synthesis. We first present a novel mask decoupling module to disentangle mask and identity information, which makes the network obtain purer identity features from visible facial components. Then, an unmasked face is restored by a joint-training strategy, which will be further used to refine the recognition network with an id-preserving loss. Experiments on masked face recognition under realistic and synthetic occlusions benchmarks demonstrate that the MEER can outperform the state-ofthe-art methods",

    "title": "BadCLIP: Dual-Embedding Guided Backdoor Attack on Multimodal Contrastive Learning",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Studying backdoor attacks is valuable for model copyright protection and enhancing defenses. While existing backdoor attacks have successfully infected multimodal contrastive learning models such as CLIP, they can be easily countered by specialized backdoor defenses for MCL models. This paper reveals the threats in this practical scenario that backdoor attacks can remain effective even after defenses and introduces the \\emph{\\toolns} attack, which is resistant to backdoor detection and model fine-tuning defenses. To achieve this, we draw motivations from the perspective of the Bayesian rule and propose a dual-embedding guided framework for backdoor attacks. Specifically, we ensure that visual trigger patterns approximate the textual target semantics in the embedding space, making it challenging to detect the subtle parameter variations induced by backdoor learning on such natural trigger patterns. Additionally, we optimize the visual trigger patterns to align the poisoned samples with target vision features in order to hinder the backdoor unlearning through clean fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our attack significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines (+45.3% ASR) in the presence of SoTA backdoor defenses, rendering these mitigation and detection strategies virtually ineffective. Furthermore, our approach effectively attacks some more rigorous scenarios like downstream tasks. We believe that this paper raises awareness regarding the potential threats associated with the practical application of multimodal contrastive learning and encourages the development of more robust defense mechanisms",

    "abstract": "In semiconductor manufacturing, lithography has often been the manufacturing step defining the smallest possible pattern dimensions. In recent years, progress has been made towards high-NA (Numerical Aperture) EUVL (Extreme-Ultraviolet-Lithography) paradigm, which promises to advance pattern shrinking (2 nm node and beyond). However, a significant increase in stochastic defects and the complexity of defect detection becomes more pronounced with high-NA. Present defect inspection techniques (both non-machine learning and machine learning based), fail to achieve satisfactory performance at high-NA dimensions. In this work, we investigate the use of the Slicing Aided Hyper Inference (SAHI) framework for improving upon current techniques. Using SAHI, inference is performed on size-increased slices of the SEM images. This leads to the object detector's receptive field being more effective in capturing small defect instances. First, the performance on previously investigated semiconductor datasets is benchmarked across various configurations, and the SAHI approach is demonstrated to substantially enhance the detection of small defects, by approx. 2x. Afterwards, we also demonstrated application of SAHI leads to flawless detection rates on a new test dataset, with scenarios not encountered during training, whereas previous trained models failed. Finally, we formulate an extension of SAHI that does not significantly reduce true-positive predictions while eliminating false-positive predictions",

We apply our framework to a simple Variational Auto-Encoder model on the RADIATE dataset \\cite{sheeny2021radiate} and qualitatively demonstrate that we can generate new renders of night-time photos using day-time appearance codes without additional optimization iterations.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Continual Learning (CL) allows applications such as user personalization and household robots to learn on the fly and adapt to context. This is an important feature when context, actions, and users change. However, enabling CL on resource-constrained embedded systems is challenging due to the limited labeled data, memory, and computing capacity. In this paper, we propose LifeLearner, a hardware-aware meta continual learning system that drastically optimizes system resources (lower memory, latency, energy consumption) while ensuring high accuracy. Specifically, we (1) exploit meta-learning and rehearsal strategies to explicitly cope with data scarcity issues and ensure high accuracy, (2) effectively combine lossless and lossy compression to significantly reduce the resource requirements of CL and rehearsal samples, and (3) developed hardware-aware system on embedded and IoT platforms considering the hardware characteristics. As a result, LifeLearner achieves near-optimal CL performance, falling short by only 2.8% on accuracy compared to an Oracle baseline. With respect to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) Meta CL method, LifeLearner drastically reduces the memory footprint (by 178.7x), end-to-end latency by 80.8-94.2%, and energy consumption by 80.9-94.2%. In addition, we successfully deployed LifeLearner on two edge devices and a microcontroller unit, thereby enabling efficient CL on resource-constrained platforms where it would be impractical to run SOTA methods and the far-reaching deployment of adaptable CL in a ubiquitous manner.

    "abstract": "This paper endeavors to advance the precision of snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) reconstruction for multispectral image (MSI). To achieve this, we integrate the advantageous attributes of established SCI techniques and an image generative model, propose a novel structured zero-shot diffusion model, dubbed DiffSCI. DiffSCI leverages the structural insights from the deep prior and optimization-based methodologies, complemented by the generative capabilities offered by the contemporary denoising diffusion model. Specifically, firstly, we employ a pre-trained diffusion model, which has been trained on a substantial corpus of RGB images, as the generative denoiser within the Plug-and-Play framework for the first time. This integration allows for the successful completion of SCI reconstruction, especially in the case that current methods struggle to address effectively. Secondly, we systematically account for spectral band correlations and introduce a robust methodology to mitigate wavelength mismatch, thus enabling seamless adaptation of the RGB diffusion model to MSIs. Thirdly, an accelerated algorithm is implemented to expedite the resolution of the data subproblem. This augmentation not only accelerates the convergence rate but also elevates the quality of the reconstruction process. We present extensive testing to show that DiffSCI exhibits discernible performance enhancements over prevailing self-supervised and zero-shot approaches, surpassing even supervised transformer counterparts across both simulated and real datasets.

Recent application of deep learning methods for image reconstruction provides a successful data-driven approach to addressing the challenges when reconstructing images with undersampled measurements or various types of noise. In this work, we propose a hybrid supervised-unsupervised learning framework for X-ray computed tomography (CT) image reconstruction. The proposed learning formulation leverages both sparsity or unsupervised learning-based priors and neural network reconstructors to simulate a fixed-point iteration process. Each proposed trained block consists of a deterministic MBIR solver and a neural network. The information flows in parallel through these two reconstructors and is then optimally combined. Multiple such blocks are cascaded to form a reconstruction pipeline. We demonstrate the efficacy of this learned hybrid model for low-dose CT image reconstruction with limited training data, where we use the NIH AAPM Mayo Clinic Low Dose CT Grand Challenge dataset for training and testing. In our experiments, we study combinations of supervised deep network reconstructors and MBIR solver with learned sparse representation-based priors or analytical priors.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Diffusion models have demonstrated significant potential in producing high-quality images for medical image translation to aid disease diagnosis, localization, and treatment. Nevertheless, current diffusion models have limited success in achieving faithful image translations that can accurately preserve the anatomical structures of medical images, especially for unpaired datasets. The preservation of structural and anatomical details is essential to reliable medical diagnosis and treatment planning, as structural mismatches can lead to disease misidentification and treatment errors. In this study, we introduced a frequency-decoupled diffusion model (FDDM), a novel framework that decouples the frequency components of medical images in the Fourier domain during the translation process, to allow structure-preserved high-quality image conversion. FDDM applies an unsupervised frequency conversion module to translate the source medical images into frequency-specific outputs and then uses the frequency-specific information to guide a following diffusion model for final source-to-target image translation. We conducted extensive evaluations of FDDM using a public brain MR-to-CT translation dataset, showing its superior performance against other GAN-, VAE-, and diffusion-based models. Metrics including the Frechet inception distance (FID), the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and the structural similarity index measure (SSIM) were assessed. FDDM achieves an FID of 29.88, less than half of the second best. These results demonstrated FDDM's prowess in generating highly-realistic target-domain images while maintaining the faithfulness of translated anatomical structures",

Recent advances in evidential deep learning shed light on the direct quantification of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties with a single forward pass of the model. Most traditional approaches adopt an entropy-based method to derive evidential uncertainty in classification, quantifying uncertainty at the sample level. However, the variance-based method that has been widely applied in regression problems is seldom used in the classification setting. In this work, we adapt the variance-based approach from regression to classification, quantifying classification uncertainty at the class level. The variance decomposition technique in regression is extended to class covariance decomposition in classification based on the law of total covariance, and the class correlation is also derived from the covariance. Experiments on cross-domain datasets are conducted to illustrate that the variance-based approach not only results in similar accuracy as the entropy-based one in active domain adaptation but also brings information about class-wise uncertainties as well as between-class correlations.

This paper proposes a scale-aware competitive network (SAC-Net), which includes the Inner-Scale Competition Module (ISCM) and the Across-Scale Competition Module (ASCM) to capture texture characteristics related to orientation and scale. ISCM efficiently integrates learnable Gabor filters and a self-attention mechanism to extract rich orientation data and discern textures with long-range discriminative properties. Subsequently, ASCM leverages a competitive strategy across various scales to effectively encapsulate the competitive texture scale elements. By synergizing ISCM and ASCM, our method adeptly characterizes palmprint features.

The former regulates motion by per-frame object distances and spatial layouts, while the later describes motion by cross-frame correspondences that help in preserving fine details and improving temporal consistency. More specifically, given a key frame that exists or generated from text prompts, we first design a diffusion model with spatio-temporal modules to generate the video depth and the corresponding optical flows. Then, the video is generated in the latent space by another spatio-temporal diffusion model under the guidance of depth, optical flow-based warped latent video and the calculated occlusion mask. Lastly, we use optical flows again to align and refine different frames for better video decoding from the latent space to the pixel space.

To address these challenges, we propose Geographical SAM (GeoSAM), a novel SAM-based framework that implements a fine-tuning strategy using the dense visual prompt from zero-shot learning, and the sparse visual prompt from a pre-trained CNN segmentation model. The proposed GeoSAM outperforms existing approaches for geographical image segmentation, specifically by 20%, 14.29%, and 17.65% for road infrastructure, pedestrian infrastructure, and on average, respectively, representing a momentous leap in leveraging foundation models to segment mobility infrastructure including both road and pedestrian infrastructure in geographical images",

    "abstract": "This paper develops an in-depth treatment concerning the problem of approximating the Gaussian smoothing and Gaussian derivative computations in scale-space theory for application on discrete data. With close connections to previous axiomatic treatments of continuous and discrete scale-space theory, we consider three main ways discretizing these scale-space operations in terms of explicit discrete convolutions, based on either (i) sampling the Gaussian kernels and the Gaussian derivative kernels, (ii) locally integrating the Gaussian kernels and the Gaussian derivative kernels over each pixel support region and (iii) basing the scale-space analysis on the discrete analogue of the Gaussian kernel, and then computing derivative approximations by applying small-support central difference operators to the spatially smoothed image data. We study the properties of these three main discretization methods both theoretically and experimentally, and characterize their performance by quantitative measures, including the results they give rise to with respect to the task of scale selection, investigated for four different use cases, and with emphasis on the behaviour at fine scales. The results show that the sampled Gaussian kernels and derivatives as well as the integrated Gaussian kernels and derivatives perform very poorly at very fine scales. At very fine scales, the discrete analogue of the Gaussian kernel with its corresponding discrete derivative approximations performs substantially better. The sampled Gaussian kernel and the sampled Gaussian derivatives do, on the other hand, lead to numerically very good approximations of the corresponding continuous results, when the scale parameter is sufficiently large, in the experiments presented in the paper, when the scale parameter is greater than a value of about 1, in units of the grid spacing",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Semantic segmentation of RGB-D images involves understanding the appearance and spatial relationships of objects within a scene, which requires careful consideration of various factors. However, in indoor environments, the simple input of RGB and depth images often results in a relatively limited acquisition of semantic and spatial information, leading to suboptimal segmentation outcomes. To address this, we propose the Multi-modal Interaction and Pooling Attention Network (MIPANet), a novel approach designed to harness the interactive synergy between RGB and depth modalities, optimizing the utilization of complementary information. Specifically, we incorporate a Multi-modal Interaction Fusion Module (MIM) into the deepest layers of the network. This module is engineered to facilitate the fusion of RGB and depth information, allowing for mutual enhancement and correction. Additionally, we introduce a Pooling Attention Module (PAM) at various stages of the encoder. This module serves to amplify the features extracted by the network and integrates the module's output into the decoder in a targeted manner, significantly improving semantic segmentation performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that MIPANet outperforms existing methods on two indoor scene datasets, NYUDv2 and SUN-RGBD, underscoring its effectiveness in enhancing RGB-D semantic segmentation",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "With the increasing prevalence of smartphones and websites, Image Aesthetic Assessment (IAA) has become increasingly crucial. While the significance of attributes in IAA is widely recognized, many attribute-based methods lack consideration for the selection and utilization of aesthetic attributes. Our initial step involves the acquisition of aesthetic attributes from both intra- and inter-perspectives. Within the intra-perspective, we extract the direct visual attributes of images, constituting the absolute attribute. In the inter-perspective, our focus lies in modeling the relative score relationships between images within the same sequence, forming the relative attribute. Then, to better utilize image attributes in aesthetic assessment, we propose the Unified Multi-attribute Aesthetic Assessment Framework (UMAAF) to model both absolute and relative attributes of images. For absolute attributes, we leverage multiple absolute-attribute perception modules and an absolute-attribute interacting network. The absolute-attribute perception modules are first pre-trained on several absolute-attribute learning tasks and then used to extract corresponding absolute attribute features. The absolute-attribute interacting network adaptively learns the weight of diverse absolute-attribute features, effectively integrating them with generic aesthetic features from various absolute-attribute perspectives and generating the aesthetic prediction. To model the relative attribute of images, we consider the relative ranking and relative distance relationships between images in a Relative-Relation Loss function, which boosts the robustness of the UMAAF. Furthermore, UMAAF achieves state-of-the-art performance on TAD66K and AVA datasets, and multiple experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of each module and the model's alignment with human preference",

    "title": "Exchanging Dual Encoder-Decoder: A New Strategy for Change Detection with Semantic Guidance and Spatial Localization",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Change detection is a critical task in earth observation applications. Recently, deep learning-based methods have shown promising performance and are quickly adopted in change detection. However, the widely used multiple encoder and single decoder (MESD) as well as dual encoder-decoder (DED) architectures still struggle to effectively handle change detection well. The former has problems of bitemporal feature interference in the feature-level fusion, while the latter is inapplicable to intraclass change detection and multiview building change detection. To solve these problems, we propose a new strategy with an exchanging dual encoder-decoder structure for binary change detection with semantic guidance and spatial localization. The proposed strategy solves the problems of bitemporal feature inference in MESD by fusing bitemporal features in the decision level and the inapplicability in DED by determining changed areas using bitemporal semantic features. We build a binary change detection model based on this strategy, and then validate and compare it with 18 state-of-the-art change detection methods on six datasets in three scenarios, including intraclass change detection datasets (CDD, SYSU), single-view building change detection datasets (WHU, LEVIR-CD, LEVIR-CD+) and a multiview building change detection dataset (NJDS). The experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance with high efficiency and outperforms all benchmark methods with F1-scores of 97.77%, 83.07%, 94.86%, 92.33%, 91.39%, 74.35% on CDD, SYSU, WHU, LEVIR-CD, LEVIR- CD+, and NJDS datasets, respectively.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Video prediction yields future frames by employing the historical frames and has exhibited its great potential in many applications, e.g., meteorological prediction, and autonomous driving. Previous works often decode the ultimate high-level semantic features to future frames without texture details, which deteriorates the prediction quality. Motivated by this, we develop a Pair-wise Layer Attention (PLA) module to enhance the layer-wise semantic dependency of the feature maps derived from the U-shape structure in Translator, by coupling low-level visual cues and high-level features. Hence, the texture details of predicted frames are enriched. Moreover, most existing methods capture the spatiotemporal dynamics by Translator, but fail to sufficiently utilize the spatial features of Encoder. This inspires us to design a Spatial Masking (SM) module to mask partial encoding features during pretraining, which adds the visibility of remaining feature pixels by Decoder. To this end, we present a Pair-wise Layer Attention with Spatial Masking (PLA-SM) framework for video prediction to capture the spatiotemporal dynamics, which reflect the motion trend. Extensive experiments and rigorous ablation studies on five benchmarks demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach. The code is available at GitHub",

    "abstract": "The recent advancements in text-to-3D generation mark a significant milestone in generative models, unlocking new possibilities for creating imaginative 3D assets across various real-world scenarios. While recent advancements in text-to-3D generation have shown promise, they often fall short in rendering detailed and high-quality 3D models. This problem is especially prevalent as many methods base themselves on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). This paper identifies a notable deficiency in SDS, that it brings inconsistent and low-quality updating direction for the 3D model, causing the over-smoothing effect. To address this, we propose a novel approach called Interval Score Matching (ISM). ISM employs deterministic diffusing trajectories and utilizes interval-based score matching to counteract over-smoothing. Furthermore, we incorporate 3D Gaussian Splatting into our text-to-3D generation pipeline.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Deepfake detection faces a critical generalization hurdle, with performance deteriorating when there is a mismatch between the distributions of training and testing data. A broadly received explanation is the tendency of these detectors to be overfitted to forgery-specific artifacts, rather than learning features that are widely applicable across various forgeries. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective detector called LSDA (\\underline{L}atent \\underline{S}pace \\underline{D}ata \\underline{A}ugmentation), which is based on a heuristic idea: representations with a wider variety of forgeries should be able to learn a more generalizable decision boundary, thereby mitigating the overfitting of method-specific features (see Figure. 1). Following this idea, we propose to enlarge the forgery space by constructing and simulating variations within and across forgery features in the latent space. This approach encompasses the acquisition of enriched, domain-specific features and the facilitation of smoother transitions between different forgery types, effectively bridging domain gaps. Our approach culminates in refining a binary classifier that leverages the distilled knowledge from the enhanced features, striving for a generalizable deepfake detector. Comprehensive experiments show that our proposed method is surprisingly effective and transcends state-of-the-art detectors across several widely used benchmarks",

    "abstract": "Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) has seen burgeoning development and increasing attention recently. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, camo-perceptive vision-language framework (CPVLF), to explore whether LVLM can generalize to the challenging camouflaged object detection (COD) scenario in a training-free manner. During the process of generalization, we find that due to hallucination issues within LVLM, it can erroneously perceive objects in camouflaged scenes, producing counterfactual concepts. Moreover, as LVLM is not specifically trained for the precise localization of camouflaged objects, it exhibits a degree of uncertainty in accurately pinpointing these objects. Therefore, we propose chain of visual perception, which enhances LVLM's perception of camouflaged scenes from both linguistic and visual perspectives, reducing the hallucination issue and improving its capability in accurately locating camouflaged objects. We validate the effectiveness of CPVLF on three widely used COD datasets, and the experiments show the potential of LVLM in the COD task",

    "abstract": "Writing assistance is an application closely related to human life and is also a fundamental Natural Language Processing (NLP) research field. Its aim is to improve the correctness and quality of input texts, with character checking being crucial in detecting and correcting wrong characters. From the perspective of the real world where handwriting occupies the vast majority, characters that humans get wrong include faked characters (i.e., untrue characters created due to writing errors) and misspelled characters (i.e., true characters used incorrectly due to spelling errors). However, existing datasets and related studies only focus on misspelled characters mainly caused by phonological or visual confusion, thereby ignoring faked characters which are more common and difficult. To break through this dilemma, we present Visual-C$^3$, a human-annotated Visual Chinese Character Checking dataset with faked and misspelled Chinese characters. To the best of our knowledge, Visual-C$^3$ is the first real-world visual and the largest human-crafted dataset for the Chinese character checking scenario. Additionally, we also propose and evaluate novel baseline methods on Visual-C$^3$. Extensive empirical results and analyses show that Visual-C$^3$ is high-quality yet challenging. The Visual-C$^3$ dataset and the baseline methods will be publicly available to facilitate further research in the community",

However, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, particularly in the image modality, presenting considerable security risks. This paper introduces Adversarial Prompt Tuning (AdvPT), a novel technique to enhance the adversarial robustness of image encoders in VLMs. AdvPT innovatively leverages learnable text prompts and aligns them with adversarial image embeddings, to address the vulnerabilities inherent in VLMs without the need for extensive parameter training or modification of the model architecture. We demonstrate that AdvPT improves resistance against white-box and black-box adversarial attacks and exhibits a synergistic effect when combined with existing image-processing-based defense techniques, further boosting defensive capabilities. Comprehensive experimental analyses provide insights into adversarial prompt tuning, a novel paradigm devoted to improving resistance to adversarial images through textual input modifications, paving the way for future robust multimodal learning research. These findings open up new possibilities for enhancing the security of VLMs. Our code will be available upon publication of the paper",

    "abstract": "Story visualization aims to generate a series of images that match the story described in texts, and it requires the generated images to satisfy high quality, alignment with the text description, and consistency in character identities. Given the complexity of story visualization, existing methods drastically simplify the problem by considering only a few specific characters and scenarios, or requiring the users to provide per-image control conditions such as sketches. However, these simplifications render these methods incompetent for real applications. To this end, we propose an automated story visualization system that can effectively generate diverse, high-quality, and consistent sets of story images, with minimal human interactions. Specifically, we utilize the comprehension and planning capabilities of large language models for layout planning, and then leverage large-scale text-to-image models to generate sophisticated story images based on the layout. We empirically find that sparse control conditions, such as bounding boxes, are suitable for layout planning, while dense control conditions, e.g., sketches and keypoints, are suitable for generating high-quality image content. To obtain the best of both worlds, we devise a dense condition generation module to transform simple bounding box layouts into sketch or keypoint control conditions for final image generation, which not only improves the image quality but also allows easy and intuitive user interactions. In addition, we propose a simple yet effective method to generate multi-view consistent character images, eliminating the reliance on human labor to collect or draw character images",

Existing methods construct experiments based on the public datasets of related tasks, which are not tailored for open vocabulary and rarely involves imperceptible objects camouflaged in complex scenes due to data collection bias and annotation costs. To fill in the gaps, we introduce a new task, open-vocabulary camouflaged object segmentation (OVCOS) and construct a large-scale complex scene dataset (\\textbf{OVCamo}) which containing 11,483 hand-selected images with fine annotations and corresponding object classes.

However, the amalgamation of Nerf and 2D diffusion models frequently yields oversaturated images, posing severe limitations on downstream industrial applications due to the constraints of pixelwise rendering method. Gaussian splatting has recently superseded the traditional pointwise sampling technique prevalent in NeRF-based methodologies, revolutionizing various aspects of 3D reconstruction. This paper introduces a novel text to 3D content generation framework based on Gaussian splatting, enabling fine control over image saturation through individual Gaussian sphere transparencies, thereby producing more realistic images. The challenge of achieving multi-view consistency in 3D generation significantly impedes modeling complexity and accuracy. Taking inspiration from SJC, we explore employing multi-view noise distributions to perturb images generated by 3D Gaussian splatting, aiming to rectify inconsistencies in multi-view geometry. We ingeniously devise an efficient method to generate noise that produces Gaussian noise from diverse viewpoints, all originating from a shared noise source. Furthermore, vanilla 3D Gaussian-based generation tends to trap models in local minima, causing artifacts like floaters, burrs, or proliferative elements. To mitigate these issues, we propose the variational Gaussian splatting technique to enhance the quality and stability of 3D appearance. To our knowledge, our approach represents the first comprehensive utilization of Gaussian splatting across the entire spectrum of 3D content generation processes",

    "abstract": "This study presents a weakly supervised method for identifying faults in infrared images of substation equipment. It utilizes the Faster RCNN model for equipment identification, enhancing detection accuracy through modifications to the model's network structure and parameters. The method is exemplified through the analysis of infrared images captured by inspection robots at substations.

    "title": "HiH: A Multi-modal Hierarchy in Hierarchy Network for Unconstrained Gait Recognition",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Gait recognition has achieved promising advances in controlled settings, yet it significantly struggles in unconstrained environments due to challenges such as view changes, occlusions, and varying walking speeds. Additionally, efforts to fuse multiple modalities often face limited improvements because of cross-modality incompatibility, particularly in outdoor scenarios. To address these issues, we present a multi-modal Hierarchy in Hierarchy network (HiH) that integrates silhouette and pose sequences for robust gait recognition. HiH features a main branch that utilizes Hierarchical Gait Decomposer (HGD) modules for depth-wise and intra-module hierarchical examination of general gait patterns from silhouette data. This approach captures motion hierarchies from overall body dynamics to detailed limb movements, facilitating the representation of gait attributes across multiple spatial resolutions. Complementing this, an auxiliary branch, based on 2D joint sequences, enriches the spatial and temporal aspects of gait analysis. It employs a Deformable Spatial Enhancement (DSE) module for pose-guided spatial attention and a Deformable Temporal Alignment (DTA) module for aligning motion dynamics through learned temporal offsets. Extensive evaluations across diverse indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate HiH's state-of-the-art performance, affirming a well-balanced trade-off between accuracy and efficiency",

    "title": "3D Guidewire Shape Reconstruction from Monoplane Fluoroscopic Images",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Endovascular navigation, essential for diagnosing and treating endovascular diseases, predominantly hinges on fluoroscopic images due to the constraints in sensory feedback. Current shape reconstruction techniques for endovascular intervention often rely on either a priori information or specialized equipment, potentially subjecting patients to heightened radiation exposure. While deep learning holds potential, it typically demands extensive data. In this paper, we propose a new method to reconstruct the 3D guidewire by utilizing CathSim, a state-of-the-art endovascular simulator, and a 3D Fluoroscopy Guidewire Reconstruction Network (3D-FGRN). Our 3D-FGRN delivers results on par with conventional triangulation from simulated monoplane fluoroscopic images. Our experiments accentuate the efficiency of the proposed network, demonstrating it as a promising alternative to traditional methods",

    "title": "LogicNet: A Logical Consistency Embedded Face Attribute Learning Network",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Ensuring logical consistency in predictions is a crucial yet overlooked aspect in multi-attribute classification. We explore the potential reasons for this oversight and introduce two pressing challenges to the field: 1) How can we ensure that a model, when trained with data checked for logical consistency, yields predictions that are logically consistent? 2) How can we achieve the same with data that hasn't undergone logical consistency checks? Minimizing manual effort is also essential for enhancing automation. To address these challenges, we introduce two datasets, FH41K and CelebA-logic, and propose LogicNet, an adversarial training framework that learns the logical relationships between attributes. Accuracy of LogicNet surpasses that of the next-best approach by 23.05%, 9.96%, and 1.71% on FH37K, FH41K, and CelebA-logic, respectively. In real-world case analysis, our approach can achieve a reduction of more than 50% in the average number of failed cases compared to other methods",

    "title": "On the Noise Scheduling for Generating Plausible Designs with Diffusion Models",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Deep Generative Models (DGMs) are widely used to create innovative designs across multiple industries, ranging from fashion to the automotive sector. In addition to generating images of high visual quality, the task of structural design generation imposes more stringent constrains on the semantic expression, e.g., no floating material or missing part, which we refer to as plausibility in this work. We delve into the impact of noise schedules of diffusion models on the plausibility of the outcome: there exists a range of noise levels at which the model's performance decides the result plausibility. Also, we propose two techniques to determine such a range for a given image set and devise a novel parametric noise schedule for better plausibility. We apply this noise schedule to the training and sampling of the well-known diffusion model EDM and compare it to its default noise schedule. Compared to EDM, our schedule significantly improves the rate of plausible designs from 83.4% to 93.5% and Fr\\'echet Inception Distance (FID) from 7.84 to 4.87. Further applications of advanced image editing tools demonstrate the model's solid understanding of structure",

    "abstract": "We introduce a shape-sensitive loss function for catheter and guidewire segmentation and utilize it in a vision transformer network to establish a new state-of-the-art result on a large-scale X-ray images dataset. We transform network-derived predictions and their corresponding ground truths into signed distance maps, thereby enabling any networks to concentrate on the essential boundaries rather than merely the overall contours. These SDMs are subjected to the vision transformer, efficiently producing high-dimensional feature vectors encapsulating critical image attributes. By computing the cosine similarity between these feature vectors, we gain a nuanced understanding of image similarity that goes beyond the limitations of traditional overlap-based measures. The advantages of our approach are manifold, ranging from scale and translation invariance to superior detection of subtle differences, thus ensuring precise localization and delineation of the medical instruments within the images. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analyses substantiate the significant enhancement in performance over existing baselines, demonstrating the promise held by our new shape-sensitive loss function for improving catheter and guidewire segmentation",

    "title": "Self-Supervised Versus Supervised Training for Segmentation of Organoid Images",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The process of annotating relevant data in the field of digital microscopy can be both time-consuming and especially expensive due to the required technical skills and human-expert knowledge. Consequently, large amounts of microscopic image data sets remain unlabeled, preventing their effective exploitation using deep-learning algorithms. In recent years it has been shown that a lot of relevant information can be drawn from unlabeled data. Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a promising solution based on learning intrinsic features under a pretext task that is similar to the main task without requiring labels. The trained result is transferred to the main task - image segmentation in our case. A ResNet50 U-Net was first trained to restore images of liver progenitor organoids from augmented images using the Structural Similarity Index Metric (SSIM), alone, and using SSIM combined with L1 loss. Both the encoder and decoder were trained in tandem. The weights were transferred to another U-Net model designed for segmentation with frozen encoder weights, using Binary Cross Entropy, Dice, and Intersection over Union (IoU) losses. For comparison, we used the same U-Net architecture to train two supervised models, one utilizing the ResNet50 encoder as well as a simple CNN. Results showed that self-supervised learning models using a 25\\% pixel drop or image blurring augmentation performed better than the other augmentation techniques using the IoU loss. When trained on only 114 images for the main task, the self-supervised learning approach outperforms the supervised method achieving an F1-score of 0.85, with higher stability, in contrast to an F1=0.78 scored by the supervised method. Furthermore, when trained with larger data sets (1,000 images), self-supervised learning is still able to perform better, achieving an F1-score of 0.92, contrasting to a score of 0.85 for the supervised method",

    "title": "Attention-Based Real-Time Defenses for Physical Adversarial Attacks in Vision Applications",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Deep neural networks exhibit excellent performance in computer vision tasks, but their vulnerability to real-world adversarial attacks, achieved through physical objects that can corrupt their predictions, raises serious security concerns for their application in safety-critical domains. Existing defense methods focus on single-frame analysis and are characterized by high computational costs that limit their applicability in multi-frame scenarios, where real-time decisions are crucial. To address this problem, this paper proposes an efficient attention-based defense mechanism that exploits adversarial channel-attention to quickly identify and track malicious objects in shallow network layers and mask their adversarial effects in a multi-frame setting. This work advances the state of the art by enhancing existing over-activation techniques for real-world adversarial attacks to make them usable in real-time applications. It also introduces an efficient multi-frame defense framework, validating its efficacy through extensive experiments aimed at evaluating both defense performance and computational cost",

    "abstract": "The task of few-shot image classification and segmentation (FS-CS) requires the classification and segmentation of target objects in a query image, given only a few examples of the target classes. We introduce a method that utilises large language models (LLM) as an agent to address the FS-CS problem in a training-free manner. By making the LLM the task planner and off-the-shelf vision models the tools, the proposed method is capable of classifying and segmenting target objects using only image-level labels. Specifically, chain-of-thought prompting and in-context learning guide the LLM to observe support images like human; vision models such as Segment Anything Model (SAM) and GPT-4Vision assist LLM understand spatial and semantic information at the same time. Ultimately, the LLM uses its summarizing and reasoning capabilities to classify and segment the query image. The proposed method's modular framework makes it easily extendable.
