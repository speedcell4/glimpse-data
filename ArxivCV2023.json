    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Content-aware graphic layout generation aims to automatically arrange visual elements along with a given content, such as an e-commerce product image. In this paper, we argue that the current layout generation approaches suffer from the limited training data for the high-dimensional layout structure. We show that a simple retrieval augmentation can significantly improve the generation quality. Our model, which is named Retrieval-Augmented Layout Transformer (RALF), retrieves nearest neighbor layout examples based on an input image and feeds these results into an autoregressive generator. Our model can apply retrieval augmentation to various controllable generation tasks and yield high-quality layouts within a unified architecture. Our extensive experiments show that RALF successfully generates content-aware layouts in both constrained and unconstrained settings and significantly outperforms the baselines",

    "title": "Visual In-Context Prompting",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In-context prompting in large language models (LLMs) has become a prevalent approach to improve zero-shot capabilities, but this idea is less explored in the vision domain. Existing visual prompting methods focus on referring segmentation to segment the most relevant object, falling short of addressing many generic vision tasks like open-set segmentation and detection. In this paper, we introduce a universal visual in-context prompting framework for both tasks. In particular, we build on top of an encoder-decoder architecture, and develop a versatile prompt encoder to support a variety of prompts like strokes, boxes, and points. We further enhance it to take an arbitrary number of reference image segments as the context. Our extensive explorations show that the proposed visual in-context prompting elicits extraordinary referring and generic segmentation capabilities to refer and detect, yielding competitive performance to close-set in-domain datasets and showing promising results on many open-set segmentation datasets. By joint training on COCO and SA-1B, our model achieves $57.7$ PQ on COCO and $23.2$ PQ on ADE20K. Code will be available at https://github.com/UX-Decoder/DINOv",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Methods for finetuning generative models for concept-driven personalization generally achieve strong results for subject-driven or style-driven generation. Recently, low-rank adaptations (LoRA) have been proposed as a parameter-efficient way of achieving concept-driven personalization. While recent work explores the combination of separate LoRAs to achieve joint generation of learned styles and subjects, existing techniques do not reliably address the problem; they often compromise either subject fidelity or style fidelity. We propose ZipLoRA, a method to cheaply and effectively merge independently trained style and subject LoRAs in order to achieve generation of any user-provided subject in any user-provided style. Experiments on a wide range of subject and style combinations show that ZipLoRA can generate compelling results with meaningful improvements over baselines in subject and style fidelity while preserving the ability to recontextualize.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in 3D-aware GAN models have enabled the generation of realistic and controllable human body images. However, existing methods focus on the control of major body joints, neglecting the manipulation of expressive attributes, such as facial expressions, jaw poses, hand poses, and so on. In this work, we present XAGen, the first 3D generative model for human avatars capable of expressive control over body, face, and hands. To enhance the fidelity of small-scale regions like face and hands, we devise a multi-scale and multi-part 3D representation that models fine details. Based on this representation, we propose a multi-part rendering technique that disentangles the synthesis of body, face, and hands to ease model training and enhance geometric quality. Furthermore, we design multi-part discriminators that evaluate the quality of the generated avatars with respect to their appearance and fine-grained control capabilities. Experiments show that XAGen surpasses state-of-the-art methods in terms of realism, diversity, and expressive control abilities.

    "title": "WildFusion: Learning 3D-Aware Latent Diffusion Models in View Space",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Modern learning-based approaches to 3D-aware image synthesis achieve high photorealism and 3D-consistent viewpoint changes for the generated images. Existing approaches represent instances in a shared canonical space. However, for in-the-wild datasets a shared canonical system can be difficult to define or might not even exist. In this work, we instead model instances in view space, alleviating the need for posed images and learned camera distributions. We find that in this setting, existing GAN-based methods are prone to generating flat geometry and struggle with distribution coverage. We hence propose WildFusion, a new approach to 3D-aware image synthesis based on latent diffusion models (LDMs). We first train an autoencoder that infers a compressed latent representation, which additionally captures the images' underlying 3D structure and enables not only reconstruction but also novel view synthesis. To learn a faithful 3D representation, we leverage cues from monocular depth prediction. Then, we train a diffusion model in the 3D-aware latent space, thereby enabling synthesis of high-quality 3D-consistent image samples, outperforming recent state-of-the-art GAN-based methods. Importantly, our 3D-aware LDM is trained without any direct supervision from multiview images or 3D geometry and does not require posed images or learned pose or camera distributions. It directly learns a 3D representation without relying on canonical camera coordinates. This opens up promising research avenues for scalable 3D-aware image synthesis and 3D content creation from in-the-wild image data.

    "title": "Soulstyler: Using Large Language Model to Guide Image Style Transfer for Target Object",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Image style transfer occupies an important place in both computer graphics and computer vision. However, most current methods require reference to stylized images and cannot individually stylize specific objects. To overcome this limitation, we propose the \"Soulstyler\" framework, which allows users to guide the stylization of specific objects in an image through simple textual descriptions. We introduce a large language model to parse the text and identify stylization goals and specific styles. Combined with a CLIP-based semantic visual embedding encoder, the model understands and matches text and image content. We also introduce a novel localized text-image block matching loss that ensures that style transfer is performed only on specified target objects, while non-target regions remain in their original style. Experimental results demonstrate that our model is able to accurately perform style transfer on target objects according to textual descriptions without affecting the style of background regions.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Typically, autonomous driving adopts a modular design, which divides the full stack into perception, prediction, planning and control parts. Though interpretable, such modular design tends to introduce a substantial amount of redundancy. Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLM) and diffusion techniques have demonstrated their superior performance on comprehension and generation ability. In this paper, we first introduce the concept of interleaved vision-action pair, which unifies the format of visual features and control signals. Based on the vision-action pairs, we construct a general world model based on MLLM and diffusion model for autonomous driving, termed ADriver-I. It takes the vision-action pairs as inputs and autoregressively predicts the control signal of the current frame. The generated control signals together with the historical vision-action pairs are further conditioned to predict the future frames. With the predicted next frame, ADriver-I performs further control signal prediction. Such a process can be repeated infinite times, ADriver-I achieves autonomous driving in the world created by itself. Extensive experiments are conducted on nuScenes and our large-scale private datasets. ADriver-I shows impressive performance compared to several constructed baselines. We hope our ADriver-I can provide some new insights for future autonomous driving and embodied intelligence",

In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of employing four state-of-the-art pretrained models for medical image retrieval at modality, body region, and organ levels and compared the results of two similarity indexing approaches. Since the employed networks take 2D images, we analyzed the impacts of weighting and sampling strategies to incorporate 3D information during retrieval of 3D volumes. We showed that medical image retrieval is feasible using pretrained networks without any additional training or fine-tuning steps.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce DiffusionMat, a novel image matting framework that employs a diffusion model for the transition from coarse to refined alpha mattes. Diverging from conventional methods that utilize trimaps merely as loose guidance for alpha matte prediction, our approach treats image matting as a sequential refinement learning process. This process begins with the addition of noise to trimaps and iteratively denoises them using a pre-trained diffusion model, which incrementally guides the prediction towards a clean alpha matte. The key innovation of our framework is a correction module that adjusts the output at each denoising step, ensuring that the final result is consistent with the input image's structures. We also introduce the Alpha Reliability Propagation, a novel technique designed to maximize the utility of available guidance by selectively enhancing the trimap regions with confident alpha information, thus simplifying the correction task. To train the correction module, we devise specialized loss functions that target the accuracy of the alpha matte's edges and the consistency of its opaque and transparent regions. We evaluate our model across several image matting benchmarks, and the results indicate that DiffusionMat consistently outperforms existing methods.

    "abstract": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive diagnostic and radiotherapy (RT) planning tool, offering detailed insights into the anatomy of the human body. The extensive scan time is stressful for patients, who must remain motionless in a prolonged imaging procedure that prioritizes reduction of imaging artifacts. This is challenging for pediatric patients who may require measures for managing voluntary motions such as anesthesia. Several computational approaches reduce scan time (fast MRI), by recording fewer measurements and digitally recovering full information via post-acquisition reconstruction. However, most fast MRI approaches were developed for diagnostic imaging, without addressing reconstruction challenges specific to RT planning. In this work, we developed a deep learning-based method (DeepMRIRec) for MRI reconstruction from undersampled data acquired with RT-specific receiver coil arrangements. We evaluated our method against fully sampled data of T1-weighted MR images acquired from 73 children with brain tumors/surgical beds using loop and posterior coils (12 channels), with and without applying virtual compression of coil elements. DeepMRIRec reduced scanning time by a factor of four producing a structural similarity score surpassing the evaluated state-of-the-art method (0.960 vs 0.896), thereby demonstrating its potential for accelerating MRI scanning for RT planning",

The binary silhouettes and skeletal coordinates are two dominant representations in recent literature, achieving remarkable advances in many scenarios. However, inherent challenges remain, in which silhouettes are not always guaranteed in unconstrained scenes, and structural cues have not been fully utilized from skeletons. In this paper, we introduce a novel skeletal gait representation named Skeleton Map, together with SkeletonGait, a skeleton-based method to exploit structural information from human skeleton maps. Specifically, the skeleton map represents the coordinates of human joints as a heatmap with Gaussian approximation, exhibiting a silhouette-like image devoid of exact body structure. Beyond achieving state-of-the-art performances over five popular gait datasets, more importantly, SkeletonGait uncovers novel insights about how important structural features are in describing gait and when do they play a role. Furthermore, we propose a multi-branch architecture, named SkeletonGait++, to make use of complementary features from both skeletons and silhouettes. Experiments indicate that SkeletonGait++ outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin in various scenarios.

To address this issue, this paper proposes a practical full compensation solution. Firstly, we design an attention-based grid refinement network to improve geometric correction quality. Secondly, we integrate a novel sampling scheme into an end-to-end compensation network to alleviate computation and introduce attention blocks to preserve key features. Finally, we construct a benchmark dataset for high-resolution projector full compensation. In experiments, our method demonstrates clear advantages in both efficiency and quality",

The core of our model is a novel augmented 3D Gaussian representation, which attaches each Gaussian with a learnable code. The learnable code serves as a pose-dependent appearance embedding for refining the erroneous appearance caused by geometric transformation of Gaussians, based on which an appearance refinement model is learned to produce residual Gaussian properties to match the appearance in target pose. To force the Gaussians to learn the foreground human only without background interference, we further design a novel alpha loss to explicitly constrain the Gaussians within the human body. We also propose to jointly optimize the human joint parameters to improve the appearance accuracy. The animatable 3D Gaussian model can be learned with shallow MLPs, so new human motions can be synthesized in real time (66 fps on avarage).

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a method to optimize Gaussian splatting with a limited number of images while avoiding overfitting. Representing a 3D scene by combining numerous Gaussian splats has yielded outstanding visual quality. However, it tends to overfit the training views when only a small number of images are available. To address this issue, we introduce a dense depth map as a geometry guide to mitigate overfitting. We obtained the depth map using a pre-trained monocular depth estimation model and aligning the scale and offset using sparse COLMAP feature points. The adjusted depth aids in the color-based optimization of 3D Gaussian splatting, mitigating floating artifacts, and ensuring adherence to geometric constraints. We verify the proposed method on the NeRF-LLFF dataset with varying numbers of few images. Our approach demonstrates robust geometry compared to the original method that relies solely on images",

Despite the remarkable progress achieved in medical image segmentation, there is still an absence of foundation segmentation model that can segment a wide range of anatomical categories with easy user interaction. In this paper, we propose a universal and interactive volumetric medical image segmentation model, named SegVol. By training on 90k unlabeled Computed Tomography (CT) volumes and 6k labeled CTs, this foundation model supports the segmentation of over 200 anatomical categories using semantic and spatial prompts. Extensive experiments verify that SegVol outperforms the state of the art by a large margin on multiple segmentation benchmarks.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "With the widespread usage of VR devices and contents, demands for 3D scene generation techniques become more popular. Existing 3D scene generation models, however, limit the target scene to specific domain, primarily due to their training strategies using 3D scan dataset that is far from the real-world. To address such limitation, we propose LucidDreamer, a domain-free scene generation pipeline by fully leveraging the power of existing large-scale diffusion-based generative model. Our LucidDreamer has two alternate steps: Dreaming and Alignment. First, to generate multi-view consistent images from inputs, we set the point cloud as a geometrical guideline for each image generation. Specifically, we project a portion of point cloud to the desired view and provide the projection as a guidance for inpainting using the generative model. The inpainted images are lifted to 3D space with estimated depth maps, composing a new points. Second, to aggregate the new points into the 3D scene, we propose an aligning algorithm which harmoniously integrates the portions of newly generated 3D scenes. The finally obtained 3D scene serves as initial points for optimizing Gaussian splats. LucidDreamer produces Gaussian splats that are highly-detailed compared to the previous 3D scene generation methods, with no constraint on domain of the target scene",

Recently, Frey et al. provided an exciting deep learning method for learning eye movements from fMRI data. However, it needed to co-register fMRI into standard space to obtain eyeballs masks, and thus required additional templates and was time consuming. To resolve this issue, in this paper, we propose a framework named MRGazer for predicting eye gaze points from fMRI in individual space. The MRGazer consisted of eyeballs extraction module and a residual network-based eye gaze prediction. Compared to the previous method, the proposed framework skips the fMRI co-registration step, simplifies the processing protocol and achieves end-to-end eye gaze regression. The proposed method achieved superior performance in a variety of eye movement tasks than the co-registration-based method, and delivered objective results within a shorter time (~ 0.02 Seconds for each volume) than prior method (~0.3 Seconds for each volume)",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Classifying patterns of known classes and rejecting ambiguous and novel (also called as out-of-distribution (OOD)) inputs are involved in open world pattern recognition. Deep neural network models usually excel in closed-set classification while performing poorly in rejecting OOD. To tackle this problem, numerous methods have been designed to perform open set recognition (OSR) or OOD rejection/detection tasks. Previous methods mostly take post-training score transformation or hybrid models to ensure low scores on OOD inputs while separating known classes. In this paper, we attempt to build a unified framework for building open set classifiers for both classification and OOD rejection. We formulate the open set recognition of $ K $-known-class as a $ (K + 1) $-class classification problem with model trained on known-class samples only. By decomposing the $ K $-class problem into $ K $ one-versus-all (OVA) binary classification tasks and binding some parameters, we show that combining the scores of OVA classifiers can give $ (K + 1) $-class posterior probabilities, which enables classification and OOD rejection in a unified framework. To maintain the closed-set classification accuracy of the OVA trained classifier, we propose a hybrid training strategy combining OVA loss and multi-class cross-entropy loss. We implement the OVA framework and hybrid training strategy on the recently proposed convolutional prototype network. Experiments on popular OSR and OOD detection datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework, using a single multi-class classifier, yields competitive performance in closed-set classification, OOD detection, and misclassification detection",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Caricature is an exaggerated form of artistic portraiture that accentuates unique yet subtle characteristics of human faces. Recently, advancements in deep end-to-end techniques have yielded encouraging outcomes in capturing both style and elevated exaggerations in creating face caricatures. Most of these approaches tend to produce cartoon-like results that could be more practical for real-world applications. In this study, we proposed a high-quality, unpaired face caricature method that is appropriate for use in the real world and uses computer vision techniques and GAN models. We attain the exaggeration of facial features and the stylization of appearance through a two-step process: Face caricature generation and face caricature projection. The face caricature generation step creates new caricature face datasets from real images and trains a generative model using the real and newly created caricature datasets. The Face caricature projection employs an encoder trained with real and caricature faces with the pretrained generator to project real and caricature faces. We perform an incremental facial exaggeration from the real image to the caricature faces using the encoder and generator's latent space. Our projection preserves the facial identity, attributes, and expressions from the input image. Also, it accounts for facial occlusions, such as reading glasses or sunglasses, to enhance the robustness of our model. Furthermore, we conducted a comprehensive comparison of our approach with various state-of-the-art face caricature methods, highlighting our process's distinctiveness and exceptional realism",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence has made significant progress in the Close World problem, being able to accurately recognize old knowledge through training and classification. However, AI faces significant challenges in the Open World problem, as it involves a new and unknown exploration journey. AI is not inherently proactive in exploration, and its challenge lies in not knowing how to approach and adapt to the unknown world. How do humans acquire knowledge of the unknown world. Humans identify new knowledge through intrinsic cognition. In the process of recognizing new colors, the cognitive cues are different from known color features and involve hue, saturation, brightness, and other characteristics. When AI encounters objects with different features in the new world, it faces another challenge: where are the distinguishing features between influential features of new and old objects? AI often mistakes a new world's brown bear for a known dog because it has not learned the differences in feature distributions between knowledge systems. This is because things in the new and old worlds have different units and dimensions for their features. This paper proposes an open-world model and elemental feature system that focuses on fundamentally recognizing the distribution differences in objective features between the new and old worlds. The quantum tunneling effect of learning ability in the new and old worlds is realized through the tractive force of meta-characteristic. The outstanding performance of the model system in learning new knowledge (using pedestrian re-identification datasets as an example) demonstrates that AI has acquired the ability to recognize the new world with an accuracy of $96.71\\%$ at most and has gained the capability to explore new knowledge, similar to humans",

In this work, we depart from this observation and reexamine the role of supervision in continual representation learning.

    "abstract": "Automated blood vessel segmentation is vital for biomedical imaging, as vessel changes indicate many pathologies. Still, precise segmentation is difficult due to the complexity of vascular structures, anatomical variations across patients, the scarcity of annotated public datasets, and the quality of images. We present a thorough literature review, highlighting the state of machine learning techniques across diverse organs. Our goal is to provide a foundation on the topic and identify a robust baseline model for application to vascular segmentation in a new imaging modality, Hierarchical Phase Contrast Tomography (HiP CT). Introduced in 2020 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, HiP CT enables 3D imaging of complete organs at an unprecedented resolution of ca. 20mm per voxel, with the capability for localized zooms in selected regions down to 1mm per voxel without sectioning. We have created a training dataset with double annotator validated vascular data from three kidneys imaged with HiP CT in the context of the Human Organ Atlas Project. Finally, utilising the nnU Net model, we conduct experiments to assess the models performance on both familiar and unseen samples, employing vessel specific metrics. Our results show that while segmentations yielded reasonably high scores such as clDice values ranging from 0.82 to 0.88, certain errors persisted. Large vessels that collapsed due to the lack of hydrostatic pressure (HiP CT is an ex vivo technique) were segmented poorly. Moreover, decreased connectivity in finer vessels and higher segmentation errors at vessel boundaries were observed. Such errors obstruct the understanding of the structures by interrupting vascular tree connectivity. Through our review and outputs, we aim to set a benchmark for subsequent model evaluations using various modalities, especially with the HiP CT imaging database",

Previous works inherited the ideology of vision-to-language generation tasks,aiming to generate paragraphs with high consistency as reports. However, one unique characteristic of RRG, the independence between diseases, was neglected, leading to the injection of the spurious confounder, i.e., the disease co-occurrence. Unfortunately, this confounder confuses the process of report generation worse because of the biased RRG data distribution. In this paper, to rethink this issue thoroughly, we reason about its causes and effects from a novel perspective of statistics and causality, where the Joint Vision Coupling and the Conditional Sentence Coherence Coupling are two aspects prone to implicitly decrease the accuracy of reports. Then, a counterfactual augmentation strategy that contains the Counterfactual Sample Synthesis and the Counterfactual Report Reconstruction sub-methods is proposed to break these two aspects of spurious effects.

Additionally, we observe that as data heterogeneity increases, the gap between higher feature norms for observed classes, obtained from local models, and feature norms of unobserved classes widens, in contrast to the behavior of classifier weight norms. This widening gap extends to encompass the feature norm disparities between local and the global models.

These deep learning based methods heavily rely on synthetic training data, and the performance will degrade when facing new tasks. In this paper, we propose a Transformer-style copy-move forgery detection network named as CMFDFormer, and provide a novel PCSD (Pooled Cube and Strip Distillation) continual learning framework to help CMFDFormer handle new tasks. CMFDFormer consists of a MiT (Mix Transformer) backbone network and a PHD (Pluggable Hybrid Decoder) mask prediction network. The MiT backbone network is a Transformer-style network which is adopted on the basis of comprehensive analyses with CNN-style and MLP-style backbones. The PHD network is constructed based on self-correlation computation, hierarchical feature integration, a multi-scale cycle fully-connected block and a mask reconstruction block. The PHD network is applicable to feature extractors of different styles for hierarchical multi-scale information extraction, achieving comparable performance. Last but not least, we propose a PCSD continual learning framework to improve the forgery detectability and avoid catastrophic forgetting when handling new tasks. Our continual learning framework restricts intermediate features from the PHD network, and takes advantage of both cube pooling and strip pooling.

    "abstract": "Digital pathology enables automatic analysis of histopathological sections using artificial intelligence (AI). Automatic evaluation could improve diagnostic efficiency and help find associations between morphological features and clinical outcome. For development of such prediction models, identifying invasive epithelial cells, and separating these from benign epithelial cells and in situ lesions would be the first step. In this study, we aimed to develop an AI model for segmentation of epithelial cells in sections from breast cancer. We generated epithelial ground truth masks by restaining hematoxylin and eosin (HE) sections with cytokeratin (CK) AE1/AE3, and by pathologists' annotations. HE/CK image pairs were used to train a convolutional neural network, and data augmentation was used to make the model more robust. Tissue microarrays (TMAs) from 839 patients, and whole slide images from two patients were used for training and evaluation of the models. The sections were derived from four cohorts of breast cancer patients. TMAs from 21 patients from a fifth cohort was used as a second test set. In quantitative evaluation, a mean Dice score of 0.70, 0.79, and 0.75 for invasive epithelial cells, benign epithelial cells, and in situ lesions, respectively, were achieved. In qualitative scoring (0-5) by pathologists, results were best for all epithelium and invasive epithelium, with scores of 4.7 and 4.4. Scores for benign epithelium and in situ lesions were 3.7 and 2.0. The proposed model segmented epithelial cells in HE stained breast cancer slides well, but further work is needed for accurate division between the classes. Immunohistochemistry, together with pathologists' annotations, enabled the creation of accurate ground truths.

In this work, we present ViStruct, a training framework to learn VLMs for effective visual structural knowledge extraction. Two novel designs are incorporated. First, we propose to leverage the inherent structure of programming language to depict visual structural information. This approach enables explicit and consistent representation of visual structural information of multiple granularities, such as concepts, relations, and events, in a well-organized structured format. Second, we introduce curriculum-based learning for VLMs to progressively comprehend visual structures, from fundamental visual concepts to intricate event structures. Our intuition is that lower-level knowledge may contribute to complex visual structure understanding. Furthermore, we compile and release a collection of datasets tailored for visual structural knowledge extraction. We adopt a weakly-supervised approach to directly generate visual event structures from captions for ViStruct training, capitalizing on abundant image-caption pairs from the web. In experiments, we evaluate ViStruct on visual structure prediction tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving the understanding of visual structures.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Video semantic segmentation is a pivotal aspect of video representation learning. However, significant domain shifts present a challenge in effectively learning invariant spatio-temporal features across the labeled source domain and unlabeled target domain for video semantic segmentation. To solve the challenge, we propose a novel DA-STC method for domain adaptive video semantic segmentation, which incorporates a bidirectional multi-level spatio-temporal fusion module and a category-aware spatio-temporal feature alignment module to facilitate consistent learning for domain-invariant features. Firstly, we perform bidirectional spatio-temporal fusion at the image sequence level and shallow feature level, leading to the construction of two fused intermediate video domains. This prompts the video semantic segmentation model to consistently learn spatio-temporal features of shared patch sequences which are influenced by domain-specific contexts, thereby mitigating the feature gap between the source and target domain. Secondly, we propose a category-aware feature alignment module to promote the consistency of spatio-temporal features, facilitating adaptation to the target domain. Specifically, we adaptively aggregate the domain-specific deep features of each category along spatio-temporal dimensions, which are further constrained to achieve cross-domain intra-class feature alignment and inter-class feature separation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which achieves state-of-the-art mIOUs on multiple challenging benchmarks. Furthermore, we extend the proposed DA-STC to the image domain, where it also exhibits superior performance for domain adaptive semantic segmentation.

    "title": "Towards Hetero-Client Federated Multi-Task Learning",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) enables joint training across distributed clients using their local data privately. Federated Multi-Task Learning (FMTL) builds on FL to handle multiple tasks, assuming model congruity that identical model architecture is deployed in each client. To relax this assumption and thus extend real-world applicability, we introduce a novel problem setting, Hetero-Client Federated Multi-Task Learning (HC-FMTL), to accommodate diverse task setups. The main challenge of HC-FMTL is the model incongruity issue that invalidates conventional aggregation methods. It also escalates the difficulties in accurate model aggregation to deal with data and task heterogeneity inherent in FMTL. To address these challenges, we propose the FedHCA$^2$ framework, which allows for federated training of personalized models by modeling relationships among heterogeneous clients. Drawing on our theoretical insights into the difference between multi-task and federated optimization, we propose the Hyper Conflict-Averse Aggregation scheme to mitigate conflicts during encoder updates. Additionally, inspired by task interaction in MTL, the Hyper Cross Attention Aggregation scheme uses layer-wise cross attention to enhance decoder interactions while alleviating model incongruity. Moreover, we employ learnable Hyper Aggregation Weights for each client to customize personalized parameter updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of FedHCA$^2$ in various HC-FMTL scenarios compared to representative methods. Our code will be made publicly available",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Optical Intraoral Scanners (IOS) are widely used in digital dentistry to provide detailed 3D information of dental crowns and the gingiva. Accurate 3D tooth segmentation in IOSs is critical for various dental applications, while previous methods are error-prone at complicated boundaries and exhibit unsatisfactory results across patients. In this paper, we propose TSegFormer which captures both local and global dependencies among different teeth and the gingiva in the IOS point clouds with a multi-task 3D transformer architecture. Moreover, we design a geometry-guided loss based on a novel point curvature to refine boundaries in an end-to-end manner, avoiding time-consuming post-processing to reach clinically applicable segmentation. In addition, we create a dataset with 16,000 IOSs, the largest ever IOS dataset to the best of our knowledge. The experimental results demonstrate that our TSegFormer consistently surpasses existing state-of-the-art baselines. The superiority of TSegFormer is corroborated by extensive analysis, visualizations and real-world clinical applicability tests. Our code is available at https://github.com/huiminxiong/TSegFormer",

    "title": "Using Human Feedback to Fine-tune Diffusion Models without Any Reward Model",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Using reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) has shown significant promise in fine-tuning diffusion models. Previous methods start by training a reward model that aligns with human preferences, then leverage RL techniques to fine-tune the underlying models. However, crafting an efficient reward model demands extensive datasets, optimal architecture, and manual hyperparameter tuning, making the process both time and cost-intensive. The direct preference optimization (DPO) method, effective in fine-tuning large language models, eliminates the necessity for a reward model. However, the extensive GPU memory requirement of the diffusion model's denoising process hinders the direct application of the DPO method. To address this issue, we introduce the Direct Preference for Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization (D3PO) method to directly fine-tune diffusion models. The theoretical analysis demonstrates that although D3PO omits training a reward model, it effectively functions as the optimal reward model trained using human feedback data to guide the learning process. This approach requires no training of a reward model, proving to be more direct, cost-effective, and minimizing computational overhead. In experiments, our method uses the relative scale of objectives as a proxy for human preference, delivering comparable results to methods using ground-truth rewards. Moreover, D3PO demonstrates the ability to reduce image distortion rates and generate safer images, overcoming challenges lacking robust reward models",

    "abstract": "Retrieving textual information from natural scene images is an active research area in the field of computer vision with numerous practical applications. Detecting text regions and extracting text from signboards is a challenging problem due to special characteristics like reflecting lights, uneven illumination, or shadows found in real-life natural scene images. With the advent of deep learning-based methods, different sophisticated techniques have been proposed for text detection and text recognition from the natural scene. Though a significant amount of effort has been devoted to extracting natural scene text for resourceful languages like English, little has been done for low-resource languages like Bangla. In this research work, we have proposed an end-to-end system with deep learning-based models for efficiently detecting, recognizing, correcting, and parsing address information from Bangla signboards. We have created manually annotated datasets and synthetic datasets to train signboard detection, address text detection, address text recognition, address text correction, and address text parser models. We have conducted a comparative study among different CTC-based and Encoder-Decoder model architectures for Bangla address text recognition. Moreover, we have designed a novel address text correction model using a sequence-to-sequence transformer-based network to improve the performance of Bangla address text recognition model by post-correction. Finally, we have developed a Bangla address text parser using the state-of-the-art transformer-based pre-trained language model",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) has witnessed significant advancements in recent years, largely attributed to meticulously curated datasets and proficiently trained models. Nevertheless, when tested in diverse environments, the trained models inevitably encounter significant shifts in data distribution, highlighting that relying solely on pre-trained and fixed navigation models is insufficient. To enhance models' generalization ability, test-time adaptation (TTA) demonstrates significant potential in the computer vision field by leveraging unlabeled test samples for model updates. However, simply applying existing TTA methods to the VLN task cannot well handle the adaptability-stability dilemma of VLN models, i.e., frequent updates can result in drastic changes in model parameters, while occasional updates can make the models ill-equipped to handle dynamically changing environments. Therefore, we propose a Fast-Slow Test-Time Adaptation (FSTTA) approach for VLN by performing decomposition-accumulation analysis for both gradients and parameters in a unified framework. Specifically, in the fast update phase, gradients generated during the recent multi-step navigation process are decomposed into components with varying levels of consistency. Then, these components are adaptively accumulated to pinpoint a concordant direction for fast model adaptation. In the slow update phase, historically recorded parameters are gathered, and a similar decomposition-accumulation analysis is conducted to revert the model to a stable state.

    "abstract": "The Differentiable Rendering and Implicit Function-based model (DRIFu) draws its roots from the Pixel-aligned Implicit Function (PIFU), a pioneering 3D digitization technique initially designed for clothed human bodies. PIFU excels in capturing nuanced body shape variations within a low-dimensional space and has been extensively trained on human 3D scans. However, the application of PIFU to live animals poses significant challenges, primarily due to the inherent difficulty in obtaining the cooperation of animals for 3D scanning. In response to this challenge, we introduce the DRIFu model, specifically tailored for animal digitization. To train DRIFu, we employ a curated set of synthetic 3D animal models, encompassing diverse shapes, sizes, and even accounting for variations such as baby birds. Our innovative alignment tools play a pivotal role in mapping these diverse synthetic animal models onto a unified template, facilitating precise predictions of animal shape and texture. Crucially, our template alignment strategy establishes a shared shape space, allowing for the seamless sampling of new animal shapes, posing them realistically, animating them, and aligning them with real-world data. This groundbreaking approach revolutionizes our capacity to comprehensively understand and represent avian forms.

    "abstract": "Object detection in urban scenarios is crucial for autonomous driving in intelligent traffic systems. However, unlike conventional object detection tasks, urban-scene images vary greatly in style. For example, images taken on sunny days differ significantly from those taken on rainy days. Therefore, models trained on sunny day images may not generalize well to rainy day images. In this paper, we aim to solve the single-domain generalizable object detection task in urban scenarios, meaning that a model trained on images from one weather condition should be able to perform well on images from any other weather conditions. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Double AUGmentation (DoubleAUG) method that includes image- and feature-level augmentation schemes. In the image-level augmentation, we consider the variation in color information across different weather conditions and propose a Color Perturbation (CP) method that randomly exchanges the RGB channels to generate various images. In the feature-level augmentation, we propose to utilize a Dual-Style Memory (DSM) to explore the diverse style information on the entire dataset, further enhancing the model's generalization capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each module in our proposed method.

Empirical evidence suggests that text-grounding improves the model's interpretation of textual content, thereby elevating its proficiency in comprehending text-rich images. Specifically, we compile a dataset containing 99K PowerPoint presentations sourced from the internet. We formulate instruction tuning tasks including text detection, recognition, and spotting to facilitate the cohesive alignment between the visual encoder and large language model. Moreover, we curate a collection of text-rich images and prompt the text-only GPT-4 to generate 12K high-quality conversations, featuring textual locations within text-rich scenarios. By integrating text location data into the instructions, TGDoc is adept at discerning text locations during the visual question process.

To address this problem, we propose Neural Incident Stokes Fields (NeISF), a multi-view inverse rendering framework that reduces ambiguities using polarization cues. The primary motivation for using polarization cues is that it is the accumulation of multi-bounced light, providing rich information about geometry and material. Based on this knowledge, the proposed incident Stokes field efficiently models the accumulated polarization effect with the aid of an original physically-based differentiable polarimetric renderer.

    "abstract": "Off-resonance artifacts in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are visual distortions that occur when the actual resonant frequencies of spins within the imaging volume differ from the expected frequencies used to encode spatial information. These discrepancies can be caused by a variety of factors, including magnetic field inhomogeneities, chemical shifts, or susceptibility differences within the tissues. Such artifacts can manifest as blurring, ghosting, or misregistration of the reconstructed image, and they often compromise its diagnostic quality. We propose to resolve these artifacts by lifting the 2D MRI reconstruction problem to 3D, introducing an additional \"spectral\" dimension to model this off-resonance. Our approach is inspired by recent progress in modeling radiance fields, and is capable of reconstructing both static and dynamic MR images as well as separating fat and water, which is of independent clinical interest. We demonstrate our approach in the context of PROPELLER (Periodically Rotated Overlapping ParallEL Lines with Enhanced Reconstruction) MRI acquisitions, which are popular for their robustness to motion artifacts.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Style transfer for human face has been widely researched in recent years. Majority of the existing approaches work in 2D image domain and have 3D inconsistency issue when applied on different viewpoints of the same face. In this paper, we tackle the problem of 3D face style transfer which aims at generating stylized novel views of a 3D human face with multi-view consistency. We propose to use a neural radiance field (NeRF) to represent 3D human face and combine it with 2D style transfer to stylize the 3D face. We find that directly training a NeRF on stylized images from 2D style transfer brings in 3D inconsistency issue and causes blurriness. On the other hand, training a NeRF jointly with 2D style transfer objectives shows poor convergence due to the identity and head pose gap between style image and content image. It also poses challenge in training time and memory due to the need of volume rendering for full image to apply style transfer loss functions. We therefore propose a hybrid framework of NeRF and mesh rasterization to combine the benefits of high fidelity geometry reconstruction of NeRF and fast rendering speed of mesh. Our framework consists of three stages: 1. Training a NeRF model on input face images to learn the 3D geometry; 2. Extracting a mesh from the trained NeRF model and optimizing it with style transfer objectives via differentiable rasterization; 3. Training a new color network in NeRF conditioned on a style embedding to enable arbitrary style transfer to the 3D face. Experiment results show that our approach generates high quality face style transfer with great 3D consistency, while also enabling a flexible style control",

We are inspired by the recent revolution of learning implicit representation and point cloud upsampling, which can produce high-quality 3D surface reconstruction and proximity-to-surface, respectively. Our idea is to leverage the implicit field reconstruction or point cloud upsampling techniques as a systematic way to augment point cloud data. Mainly, we test both strategies by sampling points from the reconstructed results and using the sampled point cloud as test-time augmented data. We show that both strategies are effective in improving accuracy. We observed that point cloud upsampling for test-time augmentation can lead to more significant performance improvement on downstream tasks such as object classification and segmentation on the ModelNet40, ShapeNet, ScanObjectNN, and SemanticKITTI datasets, especially for sparse point clouds",

    "abstract": "The compact cameras recording high-speed scenes with high resolution are highly demanded, but the required high bandwidth often leads to bulky, heavy systems, which limits their applications on low-capacity platforms. Adopting a coded exposure setup to encode a frame sequence into a blurry snapshot and retrieve the latent sharp video afterward can serve as a lightweight solution. However, restoring motion from blur is quite challenging due to the high ill-posedness of motion blur decomposition, intrinsic ambiguity in motion direction, and diverse motions in natural videos. In this work, by leveraging classical coded exposure imaging technique and emerging implicit neural representation for videos, we tactfully embed the motion direction cues into the blurry image during the imaging process and develop a novel self-recursive neural network to sequentially retrieve the latent video sequence from the blurry image utilizing the embedded motion direction cues. To validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework, we conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and real-captured blurry images. The results demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly outperforms existing methods in quality and flexibility. The code for our work is available at https://github.com/zhihongz/BDINR",

    "title": "P2RBox: A Single Point is All You Need for Oriented Object Detection",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Oriented object detection, a specialized subfield in computer vision, finds applications across diverse scenarios, excelling particularly when dealing with objects of arbitrary orientations. Conversely, point annotation, which treats objects as single points, offers a cost-effective alternative to rotated and horizontal bounding boxes but sacrifices performance due to the loss of size and orientation information. In this study, we introduce the P2RBox network, which leverages point annotations and a mask generator to create mask proposals, followed by filtration through our Inspector Module and Constrainer Module. This process selects high-quality masks, which are subsequently converted into rotated box annotations for training a fully supervised detector. Specifically, we've thoughtfully crafted an Inspector Module rooted in multi-instance learning principles to evaluate the semantic score of masks. We've also proposed a more robust mask quality assessment in conjunction with the Constrainer Module. Furthermore, we've introduced a Symmetry Axis Estimation (SAE) Module inspired by the spectral theorem for symmetric matrices to transform the top-performing mask proposal into rotated bounding boxes. P2RBox performs well with three fully supervised rotated object detectors: RetinaNet, Rotated FCOS, and Oriented R-CNN. By combining with Oriented R-CNN, P2RBox achieves 62.26% on DOTA-v1.0 test dataset. As far as we know, this is the first attempt at training an oriented object detector with point supervision",

    "title": "Toward Robust Imperceptible Perturbation against Unauthorized Text-to-image Diffusion-based Synthesis",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Text-to-image diffusion models allow seamless generation of personalized images from scant reference photos. Yet, these tools, in the wrong hands, can fabricate misleading or harmful content, endangering individuals. To address this problem, existing poisoning-based approaches perturb user images in an imperceptible way to render them \"unlearnable\" from malicious uses. We identify two limitations of these defending approaches: i) sub-optimal due to the hand-crafted heuristics for solving the intractable bilevel optimization and ii) lack of robustness against simple data transformations like Gaussian filtering. To solve these challenges, we propose MetaCloak, which solves the bi-level poisoning problem with a meta-learning framework with an additional transformation sampling process to craft transferable and robust perturbation. Specifically, we employ a pool of surrogate diffusion models to craft transferable and model-agnostic perturbation. Furthermore, by incorporating an additional transformation process, we design a simple denoising-error maximization loss that is sufficient for causing transformation-robust semantic distortion and degradation in a personalized generation. Extensive experiments on the VGGFace2 and CelebA-HQ datasets show that MetaCloak outperforms existing approaches. Notably, MetaCloak can successfully fool online training services like Replicate, in a black-box manner, demonstrating the effectiveness of MetaCloak in real-world scenarios.

    "abstract": "We present an unsupervised 3D shape co-segmentation method which learns a set of deformable part templates from a shape collection. To accommodate structural variations in the collection, our network composes each shape by a selected subset of template parts which are affine-transformed. To maximize the expressive power of the part templates, we introduce a per-part deformation network to enable the modeling of diverse parts with substantial geometry variations, while imposing constraints on the deformation capacity to ensure fidelity to the originally represented parts. We also propose a training scheme to effectively overcome local minima. Architecturally, our network is a branched autoencoder, with a CNN encoder taking a voxel shape as input and producing per-part transformation matrices, latent codes, and part existence scores, and the decoder outputting point occupancies to define the reconstruction loss. Our network, coined DAE-Net for Deforming Auto-Encoder, can achieve unsupervised 3D shape co-segmentation that yields fine-grained, compact, and meaningful parts that are consistent across diverse shapes. We conduct extensive experiments on the ShapeNet Part dataset, DFAUST, and an animal subset of Objaverse to show superior performance over prior methods",

    "abstract": "Scene text recognition (STR) in the wild frequently encounters challenges when coping with domain variations, font diversity, shape deformations, etc. A straightforward solution is performing model fine-tuning tailored to a specific scenario, but it is computationally intensive and requires multiple model copies for various scenarios. Recent studies indicate that large language models (LLMs) can learn from a few demonstration examples in a training-free manner, termed \"In-Context Learning\" (ICL). Nevertheless, applying LLMs as a text recognizer is unacceptably resource-consuming. Moreover, our pilot experiments on LLMs show that ICL fails in STR, mainly attributed to the insufficient incorporation of contextual information from diverse samples in the training stage. To this end, we introduce E$^2$STR, a STR model trained with context-rich scene text sequences, where the sequences are generated via our proposed in-context training strategy. E$^2$STR demonstrates that a regular-sized model is sufficient to achieve effective ICL capabilities in STR.

    "title": "White-Box Transformers via Sparse Rate Reduction: Compression Is All There Is?",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we contend that a natural objective of representation learning is to compress and transform the distribution of the data, say sets of tokens, towards a low-dimensional Gaussian mixture supported on incoherent subspaces. The goodness of such a representation can be evaluated by a principled measure, called sparse rate reduction, that simultaneously maximizes the intrinsic information gain and extrinsic sparsity of the learned representation. From this perspective, popular deep network architectures, including transformers, can be viewed as realizing iterative schemes to optimize this measure. Particularly, we derive a transformer block from alternating optimization on parts of this objective: the multi-head self-attention operator compresses the representation by implementing an approximate gradient descent step on the coding rate of the features, and the subsequent multi-layer perceptron sparsifies the features. This leads to a family of white-box transformer-like deep network architectures, named CRATE, which are mathematically fully interpretable. We show, by way of a novel connection between denoising and compression, that the inverse to the aforementioned compressive encoding can be realized by the same class of CRATE architectures. Thus, the so-derived white-box architectures are universal to both encoders and decoders. Experiments show that these networks, despite their simplicity, indeed learn to compress and sparsify representations of large-scale real-world image and text datasets, and achieve performance very close to highly engineered transformer-based models: ViT, MAE, DINO, BERT, and GPT2. We believe the proposed computational framework demonstrates great potential in bridging the gap between theory and practice of deep learning, from a unified perspective of data compression.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Pericoronary adipose tissue (PCAT) is the deposition of fat in the vicinity of the coronary arteries. It is an indicator of coronary inflammation and associated with coronary artery disease. Non-invasive coronary CT angiography (CCTA) is presently used to obtain measures of the thickness, volume, and attenuation of fat deposition. However, prior works solely focus on measuring PCAT using semi-automated approaches at the right coronary artery (RCA) over the left coronary artery (LCA). In this pilot work, we developed a fully automated approach for the measurement of PCAT mean attenuation and volume in the region around both coronary arteries. First, we used a large subset of patients from the public ImageCAS dataset (n = 735) to train a 3D full resolution nnUNet to segment LCA and RCA. Then, we automatically measured PCAT in the surrounding arterial regions. We evaluated our method on a held-out test set of patients (n = 183) from the same dataset. A mean Dice score of 83% and PCAT attenuation of -73.81 $\\pm$ 12.69 HU was calculated for the RCA, while a mean Dice score of 81% and PCAT attenuation of -77.51 $\\pm$ 7.94 HU was computed for the LCA. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to develop a fully automated method to measure PCAT attenuation and volume at both the RCA and LCA. Our work underscores how automated PCAT measurement holds promise as a biomarker for identification of inflammation and cardiac disease",

Unlike existing methods, we discretize nonlinear hyperelasticity in a meshless way, obviating the necessity for intermediate auxiliary shape proxies like a tetrahedral mesh or voxel grid. A quadratic generalized moving least square (Q-GMLS) is employed to capture nonlinear dynamics and large deformation on the implicit model. Such meshless integration enables versatile simulations of complex and codimensional shapes. We adaptively place the least-square kernels according to the NeRF density field to significantly reduce the complexity of the nonlinear simulation. As a result, physically realistic animations can be conveniently synthesized using our method for a wide range of hyperelastic materials at an interactive rate.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The open source of large amounts of image data promotes the development of deep learning techniques. Along with this comes the privacy risk of these open-source image datasets being exploited by unauthorized third parties to train deep learning models for commercial or illegal purposes. To avoid the abuse of public data, a poisoning-based technique, the unlearnable example, is proposed to significantly degrade the generalization performance of models by adding a kind of imperceptible noise to the data. To further enhance its robustness against adversarial training, existing works leverage iterative adversarial training on both the defensive noise and the surrogate model. However, it still remains unknown whether the robustness of unlearnable examples primarily comes from the effect of enhancement in the surrogate model or the defensive noise. Observing that simply removing the adversarial noise on the training process of the defensive noise can improve the performance of robust unlearnable examples, we identify that solely the surrogate model's robustness contributes to the performance. Furthermore, we found a negative correlation exists between the robustness of defensive noise and the protection performance, indicating defensive noise's instability issue. Motivated by this, to further boost the robust unlearnable example, we introduce stable error-minimizing noise (SEM), which trains the defensive noise against random perturbation instead of the time-consuming adversarial perturbation to improve the stability of defensive noise. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that SEM achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet Subset in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.

    "title": "On the Limitation of Diffusion Models for Synthesizing Training Datasets",

    "abstract": "Synthetic samples from diffusion models are promising for leveraging in training discriminative models as replications of real training datasets. However, we found that the synthetic datasets degrade classification performance over real datasets even when using state-of-the-art diffusion models. This means that modern diffusion models do not perfectly represent the data distribution for the purpose of replicating datasets for training discriminative tasks. This paper investigates the gap between synthetic and real samples by analyzing the synthetic samples reconstructed from real samples through the diffusion and reverse process. By varying the time steps starting the reverse process in the reconstruction, we can control the trade-off between the information in the original real data and the information added by diffusion models. Through assessing the reconstructed samples and trained models, we found that the synthetic data are concentrated in modes of the training data distribution as the reverse step increases, and thus, they are difficult to cover the outer edges of the distribution. Our findings imply that modern diffusion models are insufficient to replicate training data distribution perfectly, and there is room for the improvement of generative modeling in the replication of training datasets",

However, video synthesis methods recently started to develop. This paper presents a new two-stage latent diffusion text-to-video generation architecture based on the text-to-image diffusion model.

We compare several temporal conditioning approaches for keyframes generation. The results show the advantage of using separate temporal blocks over temporal layers in terms of metrics reflecting video generation quality aspects and human preference. The design of our interpolation model significantly reduces computational costs compared to other masked frame interpolation approaches. Furthermore, we evaluate different configurations of MoVQ-based video decoding scheme to improve consistency and achieve higher PSNR, SSIM, MSE, and LPIPS scores. Finally, we compare our pipeline with existing solutions and achieve top-2 scores overall and top-1 among open-source solutions: CLIPSIM = 0.2976 and FVD = 433.054.

FuseNet leverages the shared semantic dependencies between the original and augmented images to create a clustering space, effectively assigning pixels to semantically related clusters, and ultimately generating the segmentation map. Additionally, FuseNet incorporates a cross-modal fusion technique that extends the principles of CLIP by replacing textual data with augmented images. This approach enables the model to learn complex visual representations, enhancing robustness against variations similar to CLIP's text invariance. To further improve edge alignment and spatial consistency between neighboring pixels, we introduce an edge refinement loss. This loss function considers edge information to enhance spatial coherence, facilitating the grouping of nearby pixels with similar visual features.

This study highlights the criticality of these developments, focusing on their implications for individual privacy. The primary objective is to demonstrate the capabilities of advanced AI tools, specifically a GPT-4 based model named \"Dr. Watson,\" in identifying and potentially compromising geographic privacy through online shared content. We developed \"Dr. Watson\" to analyze and extract geographic information from publicly available data sources. The study involved five experimental cases, each offering different perspectives on the tool's application in extracting precise location data from partial images and social media content. The experiments revealed that \"Dr. Watson\" could successfully identify specific geographic details, thereby exposing the vulnerabilities in current geo-privacy measures. These findings underscore the ease with which geographic information can be unintentionally disclosed. The paper concludes with a discussion on the broader implications of these findings for individuals and the community at large.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Crop mapping is one of the most common tasks in artificial intelligence for agriculture due to higher food demands from a growing population and increased awareness of climate change. In case of vineyards, the texture is very important for crop segmentation: with higher resolution satellite imagery the texture is easily detected by majority of state-of-the-art algorithms. However, this task becomes increasingly more difficult as the resolution of satellite imagery decreases and the information about the texture becomes unavailable. In this paper we aim to explore the main machine learning methods that can be used with freely available satellite imagery and discuss how and when they can be applied for vineyard segmentation problem. We assess the effectiveness of various widely-used machine learning techniques and offer guidance on selecting the most suitable model for specific scenarios",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Human-robot interaction (HRI) has become a crucial enabler in houses and industries for facilitating operational flexibility. When it comes to mobile collaborative robots, this flexibility can be further increased due to the autonomous mobility and navigation capacity of the robotic agents, expanding their workspace and consequently, the personalizable assistance they can provide to the human operators. This however requires that the robot is capable of detecting and identifying the human counterpart in all stages of the collaborative task, and in particular while following a human in crowded workplaces. To respond to this need, we developed a unified perception and navigation framework, which enables the robot to identify and follow a target person using a combination of visual Re-Identification (Re-ID), hand gestures detection, and collision-free navigation. The Re-ID module can autonomously learn the features of a target person and use the acquired knowledge to visually re-identify the target. The navigation stack is used to follow the target avoiding obstacles and other individuals in the environment. Experiments are conducted with few subjects in a laboratory setting where some unknown dynamic obstacles are introduced",

    "title": "SD-NAE: Generating Natural Adversarial Examples with Stable Diffusion",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Robustly evaluating deep learning image classifiers is challenging due to some limitations of standard datasets. Natural Adversarial Examples (NAEs), arising naturally from the environment and capable of deceiving classifiers, are instrumental in identifying vulnerabilities in trained models. Existing works collect such NAEs by filtering from a huge set of real images, a process that is passive and lacks control. In this work, we propose to actively synthesize NAEs with the state-of-the-art Stable Diffusion. Specifically, our method formulates a controlled optimization process, where we perturb the token embedding that corresponds to a specified class to synthesize NAEs. The generation is guided by the gradient of loss from the target classifier so that the created image closely mimics the ground-truth class yet fools the classifier. Named SD-NAE (Stable Diffusion for Natural Adversarial Examples), our innovative method is effective in producing valid and useful NAEs, which is demonstrated through a meticulously designed experiment. Our work thereby provides a valuable method for obtaining challenging evaluation data, which in turn can potentially advance the development of more robust deep learning models.

    "abstract": "In the realm of aerial image analysis, object detection plays a pivotal role, with significant implications for areas such as remote sensing, urban planning, and disaster management. This study addresses the inherent challenges in this domain, notably the detection of small objects, managing densely packed elements, and accounting for diverse orientations. We present an in-depth evaluation of an object detection model that integrates the Large Selective Kernel Network (LSKNet)as its backbone with the DiffusionDet head, utilizing the iSAID dataset for empirical analysis. Our approach encompasses the introduction of novel methodologies and extensive ablation studies. These studies critically assess various aspects such as loss functions, box regression techniques, and classification strategies to refine the model's precision in object detection. The paper details the experimental application of the LSKNet backbone in synergy with the DiffusionDet heads, a combination tailored to meet the specific challenges in aerial image object detection. The findings of this research indicate a substantial enhancement in the model's performance, especially in the accuracy-time tradeoff. The proposed model achieves a mean average precision (MAP) of approximately 45.7%, which is a significant improvement, outperforming the RCNN model by 4.7% on the same dataset. This advancement underscores the effectiveness of the proposed modifications and sets a new benchmark in aerial image analysis, paving the way for more accurate and efficient object detection methodologies.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "3D reconstruction of dynamic scenes is a long-standing problem in computer graphics and increasingly difficult the less information is available. Shape-from-Template (SfT) methods aim to reconstruct a template-based geometry from RGB images or video sequences, often leveraging just a single monocular camera without depth information, such as regular smartphone recordings. Unfortunately, existing reconstruction methods are either unphysical and noisy or slow in optimization. To solve this problem, we propose a novel SfT reconstruction algorithm for cloth using a pre-trained neural surrogate model that is fast to evaluate, stable, and produces smooth reconstructions due to a regularizing physics simulation. Differentiable rendering of the simulated mesh enables pixel-wise comparisons between the reconstruction and a target video sequence that can be used for a gradient-based optimization procedure to extract not only shape information but also physical parameters such as stretching, shearing, or bending stiffness of the cloth. This allows to retain a precise, stable, and smooth reconstructed geometry while reducing the runtime by a factor of 400-500 compared to $\\phi$-SfT, a state-of-the-art physics-based SfT approach",

To address this bottleneck, we introduce the ShareGPT4V dataset, a pioneering large-scale resource featuring 1.2 million highly descriptive captions, which surpasses existing datasets in diversity and information content, covering world knowledge, object properties, spatial relationships, and aesthetic evaluations. Specifically, ShareGPT4V originates from a curated 100K high-quality captions collected from advanced GPT4-Vision and has been expanded to 1.2M with a superb caption model trained on this subset. ShareGPT4V first demonstrates its effectiveness for the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) phase, by substituting an equivalent quantity of detailed captions in existing SFT datasets with a subset of our high-quality captions, significantly enhancing the LMMs like LLaVA-7B, LLaVA-1.5-13B, and Qwen-VL-Chat-7B on the MME and MMBench benchmarks, with respective gains of 222.8/22.0/22.3 and 2.7/1.3/1.5. We further incorporate ShareGPT4V data into both the pre-training and SFT phases, obtaining ShareGPT4V-7B, a superior LMM based on a simple architecture that has remarkable performance across a majority of the multi-modal benchmarks.

Generating highly accurate intrinsic decompositions is an inherently under-constrained task that requires precisely estimating continuous-valued shading and albedo. In this work, we achieve high-resolution intrinsic decomposition by breaking the problem into two parts. First, we present a dense ordinal shading formulation using a shift- and scale-invariant loss in order to estimate ordinal shading cues without restricting the predictions to obey the intrinsic model. We then combine low- and high-resolution ordinal estimations using a second network to generate a shading estimate with both global coherency and local details. We encourage the model to learn an accurate decomposition by computing losses on the estimated shading as well as the albedo implied by the intrinsic model. We develop a straightforward method for generating dense pseudo ground truth using our model's predictions and multi-illumination data, enabling generalization to in-the-wild imagery. We present an exhaustive qualitative and quantitative analysis of our predicted intrinsic components against state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "Understanding videos is an important research topic for multimodal learning. Leveraging large-scale datasets of web-crawled video-text pairs as weak supervision has become a pre-training paradigm for learning joint representations and showcased remarkable potential in video understanding tasks. However, videos can be multi-event and multi-grained, while these video-text pairs usually contain only broad-level video captions. This raises a question: with such weak supervision, can video representation in video-language models gain the ability to distinguish even factual discrepancies in textual description and understand fine-grained events? To address this, we introduce SPOT Prober, to benchmark existing video-language models's capacities of distinguishing event-level discrepancies as an indicator of models' event understanding ability. Our approach involves extracting events as tuples (<Subject, Predicate, Object, Attribute, Timestamps>) from videos and generating false event tuples by manipulating tuple components systematically. We reevaluate the existing video-language models with these positive and negative captions and find they fail to distinguish most of the manipulated events. Based on our findings, we propose to plug in these manipulated event captions as hard negative samples and find them effective in enhancing models for event understanding",

    "abstract": "We propose a method to allow precise and extremely fast mesh extraction from 3D Gaussian Splatting. Gaussian Splatting has recently become very popular as it yields realistic rendering while being significantly faster to train than NeRFs. It is however challenging to extract a mesh from the millions of tiny 3D gaussians as these gaussians tend to be unorganized after optimization and no method has been proposed so far. Our first key contribution is a regularization term that encourages the gaussians to align well with the surface of the scene. We then introduce a method that exploits this alignment to extract a mesh from the Gaussians using Poisson reconstruction, which is fast, scalable, and preserves details, in contrast to the Marching Cubes algorithm usually applied to extract meshes from Neural SDFs. Finally, we introduce an optional refinement strategy that binds gaussians to the surface of the mesh, and jointly optimizes these Gaussians and the mesh through Gaussian splatting rendering. This enables easy editing, sculpting, rigging, animating, compositing and relighting of the Gaussians using traditional softwares by manipulating the mesh instead of the gaussians themselves. Retrieving such an editable mesh for realistic rendering is done within minutes with our method, compared to hours with the state-of-the-art methods on neural SDFs, while providing a better rendering quality",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Iris recognition systems, operating in the near infrared spectrum (NIR), have demonstrated vulnerability to presentation attacks, where an adversary uses artifacts such as cosmetic contact lenses, artificial eyes or printed iris images in order to circumvent the system. At the same time, a number of effective presentation attack detection (PAD) methods have been developed. These methods have demonstrated success in detecting artificial eyes (e.g., fake Van Dyke eyes) as presentation attacks. In this work, we seek to alter the optical characteristics of artificial eyes by affixing Vanadium Dioxide (VO2) films on their surface in various spatial configurations. VO2 films can be used to selectively transmit NIR light and can, therefore, be used to regulate the amount of NIR light from the object that is captured by the iris sensor. We study the impact of such images produced by the sensor on two state-of-the-art iris PA detection methods. We observe that the addition of VO2 films on the surface of artificial eyes can cause the PA detection methods to misclassify them as bonafide eyes in some cases.

    "abstract": "Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) is a crucial task in low-level computer vision, aiming to reconstruct high-resolution images from low-resolution counterparts. Conventional attention mechanisms have significantly improved SISR performance but often result in complex network structures and large number of parameters, leading to slow inference speed and large model size. To address this issue, we propose the Swift Parameter-free Attention Network (SPAN), a highly efficient SISR model that balances parameter count, inference speed, and image quality. SPAN employs a novel parameter-free attention mechanism, which leverages symmetric activation functions and residual connections to enhance high-contribution information and suppress redundant information. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of this design in achieving the attention mechanism's purpose. We evaluate SPAN on multiple benchmarks, showing that it outperforms existing efficient super-resolution models in terms of both image quality and inference speed, achieving a significant quality-speed trade-off. This makes SPAN highly suitable for real-world applications, particularly in resource-constrained scenarios. Notably, our model attains the best PSNR of 27.09 dB, and the test runtime of our team is reduced by 7.08ms in the NTIRE 2023 efficient super-resolution challenge.

In this work, we assess the sensitivity of DNNs against perturbations to their weight and bias parameters.

    "abstract": "3D occupancy prediction is an important task for the robustness of vision-centric autonomous driving, which aims to predict whether each point is occupied in the surrounding 3D space. Existing methods usually require 3D occupancy labels to produce meaningful results. However, it is very laborious to annotate the occupancy status of each voxel. In this paper, we propose SelfOcc to explore a self-supervised way to learn 3D occupancy using only video sequences. We first transform the images into the 3D space (e.g., bird's eye view) to obtain 3D representation of the scene. We directly impose constraints on the 3D representations by treating them as signed distance fields. We can then render 2D images of previous and future frames as self-supervision signals to learn the 3D representations. We propose an MVS-embedded strategy to directly optimize the SDF-induced weights with multiple depth proposals. Our SelfOcc outperforms the previous best method SceneRF by 58.7% using a single frame as input on SemanticKITTI and is the first self-supervised work that produces reasonable 3D occupancy for surround cameras on Occ3D.

    "abstract": "The latest generation of transformer-based vision models have proven to be superior to Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based models across several vision tasks, largely attributed to their remarkable prowess in relation modeling. Deformable vision transformers significantly reduce the quadratic complexity of modeling attention by using sparse attention structures, enabling them to be used in larger scale applications such as multi-view vision systems. Recent work demonstrated adversarial attacks against transformers; we show that these attacks do not transfer to deformable transformers due to their sparse attention structure. Specifically, attention in deformable transformers is modeled using pointers to the most relevant other tokens. In this work, we contribute for the first time adversarial attacks that manipulate the attention of deformable transformers, distracting them to focus on irrelevant parts of the image. We also develop new collaborative attacks where a source patch manipulates attention to point to a target patch that adversarially attacks the system. In our experiments, we find that only 1% patched area of the input field can lead to 0% AP. We also show that the attacks provide substantial versatility to support different attacker scenarios because of their ability to redirect attention under the attacker control",

    "abstract": "Autonomous driving (AD) systems are often built and tested in a modular fashion, where the performance of different modules is measured using task-specific metrics. These metrics should be chosen so as to capture the downstream impact of each module and the performance of the system as a whole. For example, high perception quality should enable prediction and planning to be performed safely. Even though this is true in general, we show here that it is possible to construct planner inputs that score very highly on various perception quality metrics but still lead to planning failures. In an analogy to adversarial attacks on image classifiers, we call such inputs \\textbf{adversarial perception errors} and show they can be systematically constructed using a simple boundary-attack algorithm. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this algorithm by finding attacks for two different black-box planners in several urban and highway driving scenarios using the CARLA simulator. Finally, we analyse the properties of these attacks and show that they are isolated in the input space of the planner, and discuss their implications for AD system deployment and testing",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Lack of interpretability of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) is a well-known problem particularly in the medical domain as clinicians want trustworthy automated decisions. One way to improve trust is to demonstrate the localisation of feature representations with respect to expert labeled regions of interest. In this work, we investigate the localisation of features learned via two varied learning paradigms and demonstrate the superiority of one learning approach with respect to localisation. Our analysis on medical and natural datasets show that the traditional end-to-end (E2E) learning strategy has a limited ability to localise discriminative features across multiple network layers. We show that a layer-wise learning strategy, namely cascade learning (CL), results in more localised features. Considering localisation accuracy, we not only show that CL outperforms E2E but that it is a promising method of predicting regions. On the YOLO object detection framework, our best result shows that CL outperforms the E2E scheme by $2\\%$ in mAP",

    "title": "Transferring to Real-World Layouts: A Depth-aware Framework for Scene Adaptation",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Scene segmentation via unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) enables the transfer of knowledge acquired from source synthetic data to real-world target data, which largely reduces the need for manual pixel-level annotations in the target domain. To facilitate domain-invariant feature learning, existing methods typically mix data from both the source domain and target domain by simply copying and pasting the pixels. Such vanilla methods are usually sub-optimal since they do not take into account how well the mixed layouts correspond to real-world scenarios. Real-world scenarios are with an inherent layout. We observe that semantic categories, such as sidewalks, buildings, and sky, display relatively consistent depth distributions, and could be clearly distinguished in a depth map. Based on such observation, we propose a depth-aware framework to explicitly leverage depth estimation to mix the categories and facilitate the two complementary tasks, i.e., segmentation and depth learning in an end-to-end manner. In particular, the framework contains a Depth-guided Contextual Filter (DCF) forndata augmentation and a cross-task encoder for contextual learning. DCF simulates the real-world layouts, while the cross-task encoder further adaptively fuses the complementing features between two tasks. Besides, it is worth noting that several public datasets do not provide depth annotation. Therefore, we leverage the off-the-shelf depth estimation network to generate the pseudo depth. Extensive experiments show that our proposed methods, even with pseudo depth, achieve competitive performance on two widely-used bench-marks, i.e. 77.7 mIoU on GTA to Cityscapes and 69.3 mIoU on Synthia to Cityscapes",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Capturing smooth motions from videos using markerless techniques typically involves complex processes such as temporal constraints, multiple stages with data-driven regression and optimization, and bundle solving over temporal windows. These processes can be inefficient and require tuning multiple objectives across stages. In contrast, BundleMoCap introduces a novel and efficient approach to this problem. It solves the motion capture task in a single stage, eliminating the need for temporal smoothness objectives while still delivering smooth motions. BundleMoCap outperforms the state-of-the-art without increasing complexity. The key concept behind BundleMoCap is manifold interpolation between latent keyframes. By relying on a local manifold smoothness assumption, we can efficiently solve a bundle of frames using a single code. Additionally, the method can be implemented as a sliding window optimization and requires only the first frame to be properly initialized, reducing the overall computational burden. BundleMoCap's strength lies in its ability to achieve high-quality motion capture results with simplicity and efficiency. More details can be found at https://moverseai.github.io/bundle/",

In contrast to LLMs, human preference learning has not been widely explored in text-to-image diffusion models; the best existing approach is to fine-tune a pretrained model using carefully curated high quality images and captions to improve visual appeal and text alignment. We propose Diffusion-DPO, a method to align diffusion models to human preferences by directly optimizing on human comparison data. Diffusion-DPO is adapted from the recently developed Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), a simpler alternative to RLHF which directly optimizes a policy that best satisfies human preferences under a classification objective. We re-formulate DPO to account for a diffusion model notion of likelihood, utilizing the evidence lower bound to derive a differentiable objective. Using the Pick-a-Pic dataset of 851K crowdsourced pairwise preferences, we fine-tune the base model of the state-of-the-art Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL)-1.0 model with Diffusion-DPO. Our fine-tuned base model significantly outperforms both base SDXL-1.0 and the larger SDXL-1.0 model consisting of an additional refinement model in human evaluation, improving visual appeal and prompt alignment. We also develop a variant that uses AI feedback and has comparable performance to training on human preferences, opening the door for scaling of diffusion model alignment methods",

    "title": "Hand-Eye Calibration",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Whenever a sensor is mounted on a robot hand it is important to know the relationship between the sensor and the hand. The problem of determining this relationship is referred to as hand-eye calibration, which is important in at least two types of tasks: (i) map sensor centered measurements into the robot workspace and (ii) allow the robot to precisely move the sensor. In the past some solutions were proposed in the particular case of a camera. With almost no exception, all existing solutions attempt to solve the homogeneous matrix equation AX=XB. First we show that there are two possible formulations of the hand-eye calibration problem. One formulation is the classical one that we just mentioned. A second formulation takes the form of the following homogeneous matrix equation: MY=M'YB. The advantage of the latter is that the extrinsic and intrinsic camera parameters need not be made explicit. Indeed, this formulation directly uses the 3 by 4 perspective matrices (M and M') associated with two positions of the camera. Moreover, this formulation together with the classical one cover a wider range of camera-based sensors to be calibrated with respect to the robot hand. Second, we develop a common mathematical framework to solve for the hand-eye calibration problem using either of the two formulations. We present two methods, (i) a rotation then translation and (ii) a non-linear solver for rotation and translation. Third, we perform a stability analysis both for our two methods and for the classical linear method of Tsai and Lenz (1989). In the light of this comparison, the non-linear optimization method, that solves for rotation and translation simultaneously, seems to be the most robust one with respect to noise and to measurement errors",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Precise and rapid delineation of sharp boundaries and robust semantics is essential for numerous downstream robotic tasks, such as robot grasping and manipulation, real-time semantic mapping, and online sensor calibration performed on edge computing units. Although boundary detection and semantic segmentation are complementary tasks, most studies focus on lightweight models for semantic segmentation but overlook the critical role of boundary detection. In this work, we introduce Mobile-Seed, a lightweight, dual-task framework tailored for simultaneous semantic segmentation and boundary detection. Our framework features a two-stream encoder, an active fusion decoder (AFD) and a dual-task regularization approach. The encoder is divided into two pathways: one captures category-aware semantic information, while the other discerns boundaries from multi-scale features. The AFD module dynamically adapts the fusion of semantic and boundary information by learning channel-wise relationships, allowing for precise weight assignment of each channel. Furthermore, we introduce a regularization loss to mitigate the conflicts in dual-task learning and deep diversity supervision. Compared to existing methods, the proposed Mobile-Seed offers a lightweight framework to simultaneously improve semantic segmentation performance and accurately locate object boundaries. Experiments on the Cityscapes dataset have shown that Mobile-Seed achieves notable improvement over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baseline by 2.2 percentage points (pp) in mIoU and 4.2 pp in mF-score, while maintaining an online inference speed of 23.9 frames-per-second (FPS) with 1024x2048 resolution input on an RTX 2080 Ti GPU. Additional experiments on CamVid and PASCAL Context datasets confirm our method's generalizability.

    "abstract": "In computer vision, the indexing problem is the problem of recognizing a few objects in a large database of objects while avoiding the help of the classical image-feature-to-object-feature matching paradigm. In this paper we address the problem of recognizing 3-D polyhedral objects from 2-D images by indexing. Both the objects to be recognized and the images are represented by weighted graphs. The indexing problem is therefore the problem of determining whether a graph extracted from the image is present or absent in a database of model graphs. We introduce a novel method for performing this graph indexing process which is based both on polynomial characterization of binary and weighted graphs and on hashing. We describe in detail this polynomial characterization and then we show how it can be used in the context of polyhedral object recognition. Next we describe a practical recognition-by-indexing system that includes the organization of the database, the representation of polyhedral objects in terms of 2-D characteristic views, the representation of this views in terms of weighted graphs, and the associated image processing. Finally, some experimental results allow the evaluation of the system performance",

However, LVLMs are still plagued by the two critical issues of object hallucination and factual accuracy, which limit the practicality of LVLMs in different scenarios. Furthermore, previous evaluation methods focus more on the comprehension and reasoning of language content but lack a comprehensive evaluation of multimodal interactions, thereby resulting in potential limitations. To this end, we propose a novel KNVQA-Eval, which is devoted to knowledge-based VQA task evaluation to reflect the factuality of multimodal LVLMs. To ensure the robustness and scalability of the evaluation, we develop a new KNVQA dataset by incorporating human judgment and perception, aiming to evaluate the accuracy of standard answers relative to AI-generated answers in knowledge-based VQA. This work not only comprehensively evaluates the contextual information of LVLMs using reliable human annotations, but also further analyzes the fine-grained capabilities of current methods to reveal potential avenues for subsequent optimization of LVLMs-based estimators. Our proposed VQA-Eval and corresponding dataset KNVQA will facilitate the development of automatic evaluation tools with the advantages of low cost, privacy protection, and reproducibility.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in text-to-video generation have harnessed the power of diffusion models to create visually compelling content conditioned on text prompts. However, they usually encounter high computational costs and often struggle to produce videos with coherent physical motions. To tackle these issues, we propose GPT4Motion, a training-free framework that leverages the planning capability of large language models such as GPT, the physical simulation strength of Blender, and the excellent image generation ability of text-to-image diffusion models to enhance the quality of video synthesis. Specifically, GPT4Motion employs GPT-4 to generate a Blender script based on a user textual prompt, which commands Blender's built-in physics engine to craft fundamental scene components that encapsulate coherent physical motions across frames. Then these components are inputted into Stable Diffusion to generate a video aligned with the textual prompt. Experimental results on three basic physical motion scenarios, including rigid object drop and collision, cloth draping and swinging, and liquid flow, demonstrate that GPT4Motion can generate high-quality videos efficiently in maintaining motion coherency and entity consistency. GPT4Motion offers new insights in text-to-video research, enhancing its quality and broadening its horizon for future explorations",

Applying machine learning models to these datasets can prove challenging as they typically consist of multiple batches, affected by experimental variation, especially if different imaging equipment have been used. Moreover, as new data arrive, it is preferable that they are analyzed in an online fashion. To overcome this, we propose CODA, an online self-supervised domain adaptation approach. CODA divides the classifier's role into a generic feature extractor and a task-specific model. We adapt the feature extractor's weights to the new domain using cross-batch self-supervision while keeping the task-specific model unchanged. Our results demonstrate that this strategy significantly reduces the generalization gap, achieving up to a 300% improvement when applied to data from different labs utilizing different microscopes.

To address these challenges, we introduce two distinct subnetworks designed to explore and exploit the discrepancies between them, ultimately correcting the erroneous prediction results. More specifically, we identify regions of inconsistent predictions and initiate a targeted verification training process. This procedure strategically fine-tunes and harmonizes the predictions of the subnetworks, leading to enhanced utilization of contextual information. Furthermore, to adaptively fine-tune the network's representational capacity and reduce prediction uncertainty, we employ a self-supervised contrastive learning paradigm. For this, we use the network's confidence to distinguish between reliable and unreliable predictions. The model is then trained to effectively minimize unreliable predictions.

However, it has been demonstrated time and again that these techniques fail to capture semantic context and logical constraints, instead often relying on spurious correlations to arrive at the answer. Since application of deep learning techniques to critical scenarios are dependent on adherence to domain specific constraints, several attempts have been made to address this issue. One limitation holding back a thorough exploration of this area, is a lack of suitable datasets which feature a rich set of rules. In order to address this, we present the ChessVision Dataset, consisting of 200,000+ images of annotated chess games in progress, requiring recreation of the game state from its corresponding image. This is accompanied by a curated set of rules which constrains the set of predictions to \"reasonable\" game states, and are designed to probe key semantic abilities like localization and enumeration. Alongside standard metrics, additional metrics to measure performance with regards to logical consistency is presented. We analyze several popular and state of the art vision models on this task, and show that, although their performance on standard metrics are laudable, they produce a plethora of incoherent results, indicating that this dataset presents a significant challenge for future works",

However, for the multi-oriented and dense objects that are common in aerial scenes, existing dense pseudo-label selection methods are inefficient and impede the performance in semi-supervised oriented object detection. Therefore, we propose Adaptive Dense Pseudo Label Selection (ADPLS) for semi-supervised oriented object detection. In ADPLS, we design a simple but effective adaptive mechanism to guide the selection of dense pseudo labels. Specifically, we propose the mean Feature-Richness Score (mFRS) to estimate the density of potential objects and use this score to adjust the number of dense pseudo labels. On the DOTA-v1.5 benchmark, the proposed method outperforms previous methods especially when labeled data are scarce. For example, it achieves 49.78 mAP given only 5% of annotated data, which surpasses previous state-of-the-art method given 10% of annotated data by 1.15 mAP. Our codes will be available soon",

    "abstract": "To assist surgeons in the operating theatre, surgical phase recognition is critical for developing computer-assisted surgical systems, which requires comprehensive understanding of surgical videos. Although existing studies made great progress, there are still two significant limitations worthy of improvement. First, due to the compromise of resource consumption, frame-wise visual features are extracted by 2D networks and disregard spatial and temporal knowledge of surgical actions, which hinders subsequent inter-frame modeling for phase prediction. Second, these works simply utilize ordinary classification loss with one-hot phase labels to optimize the phase predictions, and cannot fully explore surgical videos under inadequate supervision. To overcome these two limitations, we propose a Surgical Temporal Action-aware Network with sequence Regularization, named STAR-Net, to recognize surgical phases more accurately from input videos. Specifically, we propose an efficient multi-scale surgical temporal action (MS-STA) module, which integrates visual features with spatial and temporal knowledge of surgical actions at the cost of 2D networks. Moreover, we devise the dual-classifier sequence regularization (DSR) to facilitate the training of STAR-Net by the sequence guidance of an auxiliary classifier with a smaller capacity. Our STAR-Net with MS-STA and DSR can exploit visual features of surgical actions with effective regularization, thereby leading to the superior performance of surgical phase recognition. Extensive experiments on a large-scale gastrectomy surgery dataset and the public Cholec80 benchmark prove that our STAR-Net significantly outperforms state-of-the-arts of surgical phase recognition",

    "abstract": "Humans rely on their visual and tactile senses to develop a comprehensive 3D understanding of their physical environment. Recently, there has been a growing interest in exploring and manipulating objects using data-driven approaches that utilise high-resolution vision-based tactile sensors. However, 3D shape reconstruction using tactile sensing has lagged behind visual shape reconstruction because of limitations in existing techniques, including the inability to generalise over unseen shapes, the absence of real-world testing, and limited expressive capacity imposed by discrete representations. To address these challenges, we propose TouchSDF, a Deep Learning approach for tactile 3D shape reconstruction that leverages the rich information provided by a vision-based tactile sensor and the expressivity of the implicit neural representation DeepSDF. Our technique consists of two components: (1) a Convolutional Neural Network that maps tactile images into local meshes representing the surface at the touch location, and (2) an implicit neural function that predicts a signed distance function to extract the desired 3D shape. This combination allows TouchSDF to reconstruct smooth and continuous 3D shapes from tactile inputs in simulation and real-world settings, opening up research avenues for robust 3D-aware representations and improved multimodal perception in robotics.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Hypoxia occurs when tumour cells outgrow their blood supply, leading to regions of low oxygen levels within the tumour. Calculating hypoxia levels can be an important step in understanding the biology of tumours, their clinical progression and response to treatment. This study demonstrates a novel application of deep learning to evaluate hypoxia in the context of breast cancer histomorphology. More precisely, we show that Weakly Supervised Deep Learning (WSDL) models can accurately detect hypoxia associated features in routine Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) whole slide images (WSI). We trained and evaluated a deep Multiple Instance Learning model on tiles from WSI H&E tissue from breast cancer primary sites (n=240) obtaining on average an AUC of 0.87 on a left-out test set. We also showed significant differences between features of hypoxic and normoxic tissue regions as distinguished by the WSDL models. Such DL hypoxia H&E WSI detection models could potentially be extended to other tumour types and easily integrated into the pathology workflow without requiring additional costly assays",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) methods facilitate knowledge transfer from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, navigating the obstacle of domain shift. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a staple in UDA, the rise of Vision Transformers (ViTs) provides new avenues for domain generalization. This paper presents an innovative method to bolster ViT performance in source-free target adaptation, beginning with an evaluation of how key, query, and value elements affect ViT outcomes. Experiments indicate that altering the key component has negligible effects on Transformer performance. Leveraging this discovery, we introduce Domain Representation Images (DRIs), feeding embeddings through the key element. DRIs act as domain-specific markers, effortlessly merging with the training regimen. To assess our method, we perform target adaptation tests on the Cross Instance DRI source-only (SO) control. We measure the efficacy of target adaptation with and without DRIs, against existing benchmarks like SHOT-B* and adaptations via CDTrans. Findings demonstrate that excluding DRIs offers limited gains over SHOT-B*, while their inclusion in the key segment boosts average precision promoting superior domain generalization. This research underscores the vital role of DRIs in enhancing ViT efficiency in UDA scenarios, setting a precedent for further domain adaptation explorations",

    "abstract": "In this work, we present a novel dense-correspondence method for 6DoF object pose estimation from a single RGB-D image. While many existing data-driven methods achieve impressive performance, they tend to be time-consuming due to their reliance on rendering-based refinement approaches. To circumvent this limitation, we present HiPose, which establishes 3D-3D correspondences in a coarse-to-fine manner with a hierarchical binary surface encoding. Unlike previous dense-correspondence methods, we estimate the correspondence surface by employing point-to-surface matching and iteratively constricting the surface until it becomes a correspondence point while gradually removing outliers. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks LM-O, YCB-V, and T-Less demonstrate that our method surpasses all refinement-free methods and is even on par with expensive refinement-based approaches. Crucially, our approach is computationally efficient and enables real-time critical applications with high accuracy requirements. Code and models will be released",

The ROIE enhances the target object region of the image by using the predicted score map of the first UNet. The features learned by the first UNet and the enhanced image help the second UNet obtain a better score map. Finally, the results are fine-tuned by the third UNet. We evaluate our algorithm on a publicly available dataset of skin lesion segmentation. Experiments show that Triple-UNet outperforms the state-of-the-art on skin lesion segmentation",

Such a problem is critical in various robotic applications such as robotic perceptive locomotion. While existing approaches have shown promising results in effectively extracting planar regions from the environment, they often suffer from issues such as low computational efficiency or loss of resolution. To address these issues, we propose a multi-resolution planar region extraction strategy in this paper that balances the accuracy in boundaries and computational efficiency. Our method begins with a pointwise classification preprocessing module, which categorizes all sampled points according to their local geometric properties to facilitate multi-resolution segmentation. Subsequently, we arrange the categorized points using an octree, followed by an in-depth analysis of nodes to finish multi-resolution plane segmentation. The efficiency and robustness of the proposed approach are verified via synthetic and real-world experiments, demonstrating our method's ability to generalize effectively across various uneven terrains while maintaining real-time performance, achieving frame rates exceeding 35 FPS",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Spatial and intensity normalization are nowadays a prerequisite for neuroimaging analysis. Influenced by voxel-wise and other univariate comparisons, where these corrections are key, they are commonly applied to any type of analysis and imaging modalities. Nuclear imaging modalities such as PET-FDG or FP-CIT SPECT, a common modality used in Parkinson's Disease diagnosis, are especially dependent on intensity normalization. However, these steps are computationally expensive and furthermore, they may introduce deformations in the images, altering the information contained in them. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for their part, introduce position invariance to pattern recognition, and have been proven to classify objects regardless of their orientation, size, angle, etc. Therefore, a question arises: how well can CNNs account for spatial and intensity differences when analysing nuclear brain imaging? Are spatial and intensity normalization still needed? To answer this question, we have trained four different CNN models based on well-established architectures, using or not different spatial and intensity normalization preprocessing. The results show that a sufficiently complex model such as our three-dimensional version of the ALEXNET can effectively account for spatial differences, achieving a diagnosis accuracy of 94.1% with an area under the ROC curve of 0.984. The visualization of the differences via saliency maps shows that these models are correctly finding patterns that match those found in the literature, without the need of applying any complex spatial normalization procedure. However, the intensity normalization -- and its type -- is revealed as very influential in the results and accuracy of the trained model, and therefore must be well accounted",

For new segmentation tasks, researchers often have to retrain or fine-tune the model, which is time-consuming and poses a significant obstacle to clinical researchers, who often lack the resources and professional knowledge to train neural networks. Therefore, we proposed a general method that can solve unknown medical image segmentation tasks without requiring additional training. Given an example set of images and prompts for defining new segmentation tasks, GMISeg applies a novel low-rank fine-tuning strategy based on the proposed approach to the SAM (Segment Anything Model) image encoder, and works with the prompt encoder and mask decoder to fine-tune the labeled dataset without the need for additional training. To achieve generalization of new tasks, we used medical image datasets with different imaging modes for different parts. We trained and generalized GMISeg on a different set of anatomical and imaging modes using cardiac images on other site datasets.

However, NeRF requires hundreds of network evaluations per pixel to approximate a volume rendering integral, making it slow to train. Caching NeRFs into explicit data structures can effectively enhance rendering speed but at the cost of higher memory usage. To address these issues, we present Hyb-NeRF, a novel neural radiance field with a multi-resolution hybrid encoding that achieves efficient neural modeling and fast rendering, which also allows for high-quality novel view synthesis. The key idea of Hyb-NeRF is to represent the scene using different encoding strategies from coarse-to-fine resolution levels. Hyb-NeRF exploits memory-efficiency learnable positional features at coarse resolutions and the fast optimization speed and local details of hash-based feature grids at fine resolutions. In addition, to further boost performance, we embed cone tracing-based features in our learnable positional encoding that eliminates encoding ambiguity and reduces aliasing artifacts. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that Hyb-NeRF achieves faster rendering speed with better rending quality and even a lower memory footprint in comparison to previous state-of-the-art methods",

We present HCA-Net, a novel contextual attention network architecture for semantic labeling of IVDs, with a special focus on exploiting prior geometric information. Our approach excels at processing features across different scales and effectively consolidating them to capture the intricate spatial relationships within the spinal cord. To achieve this, HCA-Net models IVD labeling as a pose estimation problem, aiming to minimize the discrepancy between each predicted IVD location and its corresponding actual joint location. In addition, we introduce a skeletal loss term to reinforce the model's geometric dependence on the spine. This loss function is designed to constrain the model's predictions to a range that matches the general structure of the human vertebral skeleton. As a result, the network learns to reduce the occurrence of false predictions and adaptively improves the accuracy of IVD location estimation. Through extensive experimental evaluation on multi-center spine datasets, our approach consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on both MRI T1w and T2w modalities.

In fact, the development of audiovisual approaches has led to advances in the field of speech technologies. However, although noticeable results have recently been achieved, visual speech recognition remains an open research problem. It is a task in which, by dispensing with the auditory sense, challenges such as visual ambiguities and the complexity of modeling silence must be faced. Nonetheless, some of these challenges can be alleviated when the problem is approached from a speaker-dependent perspective. Thus, this paper studies, using the Spanish LIP-RTVE database, how the estimation of specialized end-to-end systems for a specific person could affect the quality of speech recognition. First, different adaptation strategies based on the fine-tuning technique were proposed. Then, a pre-trained CTC/Attention architecture was used as a baseline throughout our experiments. Our findings showed that a two-step fine-tuning process, where the VSR system is first adapted to the task domain, provided significant improvements when the speaker adaptation was addressed.

To establish a more realistic setting, we introduce a novel UVDA scenario, denoted as Kinetics->BABEL, with a more considerable domain gap in terms of both temporal dynamics and background shifts. To tackle the temporal shift, i.e., action duration difference between the source and target domains, we propose a global-local view alignment approach. To mitigate the background shift, we propose to learn temporal order sensitive representations by temporal order learning and background invariant representations by background augmentation.

    "abstract": "Synthesizing medical images while preserving their structural information is crucial in medical research. In such scenarios, the preservation of anatomical content becomes especially important. Although recent advances have been made by incorporating instance-level information to guide translation, these methods overlook the spatial coherence of structural-level representation and the anatomical invariance of content during translation. To address these issues, we introduce hierarchical granularity discrimination, which exploits various levels of semantic information present in medical images. Our strategy utilizes three levels of discrimination granularity: pixel-level discrimination using a Brain Memory Bank, structure-level discrimination on each brain structure with a re-weighting strategy to focus on hard samples, and global-level discrimination to ensure anatomical consistency during translation. The image translation performance of our strategy has been evaluated on three independent datasets (UK Biobank, IXI, and BraTS 2018), and it has outperformed state-of-the-art algorithms. Particularly, our model excels not only in synthesizing normal structures but also in handling abnormal (pathological) structures, such as brain tumors, despite the variations in contrast observed across different imaging modalities due to their pathological characteristics. The diagnostic value of synthesized MR images containing brain tumors has been evaluated by radiologists. This indicates that our model may offer an alternative solution in scenarios where specific MR modalities of patients are unavailable.

The combination of artificial intelligence and augmented reality technology has also become a future development trend. This project is an AR visualization system for ship detection and recognition based on AI, which mainly includes three parts: artificial intelligence module, Unity development module and Hololens2AR module. This project is based on R3Det algorithm to complete the detection and recognition of ships in remote sensing images. The recognition rate of model detection trained on RTX 2080Ti can reach 96%.

    "title": "Two Views Are Better than One: Monocular 3D Pose Estimation with Multiview Consistency",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Deducing a 3D human pose from a single 2D image or 2D keypoints is inherently challenging, given the fundamental ambiguity wherein multiple 3D poses can correspond to the same 2D representation. The acquisition of 3D data, while invaluable for resolving pose ambiguity, is expensive and requires an intricate setup, often restricting its applicability to controlled lab environments. We improve performance of monocular human pose estimation models using multiview data for fine-tuning. We propose a novel loss function, multiview consistency, to enable adding additional training data with only 2D supervision. This loss enforces that the inferred 3D pose from one view aligns with the inferred 3D pose from another view under similarity transformations. Our consistency loss substantially improves performance for fine-tuning with no available 3D data. Our experiments demonstrate that two views offset by 90 degrees are enough to obtain good performance, with only marginal improvements by adding more views. Thus, we enable the acquisition of domain-specific data by capturing activities with off-the-shelf cameras, eliminating the need for elaborate calibration procedures. This research introduces new possibilities for domain adaptation in 3D pose estimation, providing a practical and cost-effective solution to customize models for specific applications. The used dataset, featuring additional views, will be made publicly available",

    "title": "Attribute-Aware Deep Hashing with Self-Consistency for Large-Scale Fine-Grained Image Retrieval",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Our work focuses on tackling large-scale fine-grained image retrieval as ranking the images depicting the concept of interests (i.e., the same sub-category labels) highest based on the fine-grained details in the query. It is desirable to alleviate the challenges of both fine-grained nature of small inter-class variations with large intra-class variations and explosive growth of fine-grained data for such a practical task. In this paper, we propose attribute-aware hashing networks with self-consistency for generating attribute-aware hash codes to not only make the retrieval process efficient, but also establish explicit correspondences between hash codes and visual attributes. Specifically, based on the captured visual representations by attention, we develop an encoder-decoder structure network of a reconstruction task to unsupervisedly distill high-level attribute-specific vectors from the appearance-specific visual representations without attribute annotations. Our models are also equipped with a feature decorrelation constraint upon these attribute vectors to strengthen their representative abilities. Then, driven by preserving original entities' similarity, the required hash codes can be generated from these attribute-specific vectors and thus become attribute-aware. Furthermore, to combat simplicity bias in deep hashing, we consider the model design from the perspective of the self-consistency principle and propose to further enhance models' self-consistency by equipping an additional image reconstruction path. Comprehensive quantitative experiments under diverse empirical settings on six fine-grained retrieval datasets and two generic retrieval datasets show the superiority of our models over competing methods",

Typically routes are assigned a grade to inform climbers of its difficulty and allow them to more easily track their progression. However, the variation in individual climbers technical and physical attributes and many nuances of an individual route make grading a difficult and often biased task. In this work, we apply classical and deep-learning modelling techniques to the 2016, 2017 and 2019 Moonboard datasets, achieving state of the art grade prediction performance with 0.87 MAE and 1.12 RMSE. We achieve this performance on a feature-set that does not require decomposing routes into individual moves, which is a method common in literature and introduces bias. We also demonstrate the generalization capability of this model between editions and introduce a novel vision-based method of grade prediction. While the generalization performance of these techniques is below human level performance currently, we propose these methods as a basis for future work. Such a tool could be implemented in pre-existing mobile applications and would allow climbers to better track their progress and assess new routes with reduced bias",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "For intelligent quadcopter UAVs, a robust and reliable autonomous planning system is crucial. Most current trajectory planning methods for UAVs are suitable for static environments but struggle to handle dynamic obstacles, which can pose challenges and even dangers to flight. To address this issue, this paper proposes a vision-based planning system that combines tracking and trajectory prediction of dynamic obstacles to achieve efficient and reliable autonomous flight. We use a lightweight object detection algorithm to identify dynamic obstacles and then use Kalman Filtering to track and estimate their motion states. During the planning phase, we not only consider static obstacles but also account for the potential movements of dynamic obstacles. For trajectory generation, we use a B-spline-based trajectory search algorithm, which is further optimized with various constraints to enhance safety and alignment with the UAV's motion characteristics. We conduct experiments in both simulation and real-world environments, and the results indicate that our approach can successfully detect and avoid obstacles in dynamic environments in real-time, offering greater reliability compared to existing approaches. Furthermore, with the advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology demonstrating exceptional zero-shot generalization capabilities, more user-friendly human-machine interactions have become feasible, and this study also explores the integration of autonomous planning systems with Large Language Models (LLMs)",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Articulated objects (e.g., doors and drawers) exist everywhere in our life. Different from rigid objects, articulated objects have higher degrees of freedom and are rich in geometries, semantics, and part functions. Modeling different kinds of parts and articulations with nerual networks plays an essential role in articulated object understanding and manipulation, and will further benefit 3D vision and robotics communities. To model articulated objects, most previous works directly encode articulated objects into feature representations, without specific designs for parts, articulations and part motions. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that explicitly disentangles the part motion of articulated objects by predicting the transformation matrix of points on the part surface, using spatially continuous neural implicit representations to model the part motion smoothly in the space. More importantly, while many methods could only model a certain kind of joint motion (such as the revolution in the clockwise order), our proposed framework is generic to different kinds of joint motions in that transformation matrix can model diverse kinds of joint motions in the space. Quantitative and qualitative results of experiments over diverse categories of articulated objects demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework",

    "abstract": "Integrating deep learning and causal discovery has increased the interpretability of Temporal Action Segmentation (TAS) tasks. However, frame-level causal relationships exist many complicated noises outside the segment-level, making it infeasible to directly express macro action semantics. Thus, we propose \\textit{\\textbf{Causal Abstraction Segmentation Refiner (CASR)}}, which can refine TAS results from various models by enhancing video causality in marginalizing frame-level casual relationships. Specifically, we define the equivalent frame-level casual model and segment-level causal model, so that the causal adjacency matrix constructed from marginalized frame-level causal relationships has the ability to represent the segmnet-level causal relationships. CASR works out by reducing the difference in the causal adjacency matrix between we constructed and pre-segmentation results of backbone models. In addition, we propose a novel evaluation metric Causal Edit Distance (CED) to evaluate the causal interpretability. Extensive experimental results on mainstream datasets indicate that CASR significantly surpasses existing various methods in action segmentation performance, as well as in causal explainability and generalization.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Parallel imaging is a commonly used technique to accelerate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data acquisition. Mathematically, parallel MRI reconstruction can be formulated as an inverse problem relating the sparsely sampled k-space measurements to the desired MRI image. Despite the success of many existing reconstruction algorithms, it remains a challenge to reliably reconstruct a high-quality image from highly reduced k-space measurements. Recently, implicit neural representation has emerged as a powerful paradigm to exploit the internal information and the physics of partially acquired data to generate the desired object. In this study, we introduced IMJENSE, a scan-specific implicit neural representation-based method for improving parallel MRI reconstruction. Specifically, the underlying MRI image and coil sensitivities were modeled as continuous functions of spatial coordinates, parameterized by neural networks and polynomials, respectively. The weights in the networks and coefficients in the polynomials were simultaneously learned directly from sparsely acquired k-space measurements, without fully sampled ground truth data for training. Benefiting from the powerful continuous representation and joint estimation of the MRI image and coil sensitivities, IMJENSE outperforms conventional image or k-space domain reconstruction algorithms. With extremely limited calibration data, IMJENSE is more stable than supervised calibrationless and calibration-based deep-learning methods. Results show that IMJENSE robustly reconstructs the images acquired at 5$\\mathbf{\\times}$ and 6$\\mathbf{\\times}$ accelerations with only 4 or 8 calibration lines in 2D Cartesian acquisitions, corresponding to 22.0% and 19.5% undersampling rates. The high-quality results and scanning specificity make the proposed method hold the potential for further accelerating the data acquisition of parallel MRI",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Transparent objects are widely used in our daily lives, making it important to teach robots to interact with them. However, it's not easy because the reflective and refractive effects can make RGB-D cameras fail to give accurate geometry measurements. To solve this problem, this paper introduces RFTrans, an RGB-D-based method for surface normal estimation and manipulation of transparent objects. By leveraging refractive flow as an intermediate representation, RFTrans circumvents the drawbacks of directly predicting the geometry (e.g. surface normal) from RGB images and helps bridge the sim-to-real gap. RFTrans integrates the RFNet, which predicts refractive flow, object mask, and boundaries, followed by the F2Net, which estimates surface normal from the refractive flow. To make manipulation possible, a global optimization module will take in the predictions, refine the raw depth, and construct the point cloud with normal. An analytical grasp planning algorithm, ISF, is followed to generate the grasp poses. We build a synthetic dataset with physically plausible ray-tracing rendering techniques to train the networks. Results show that the RFTrans trained on the synthetic dataset can consistently outperform the baseline ClearGrasp in both synthetic and real-world benchmarks by a large margin. Finally, a real-world robot grasping task witnesses an 83% success rate, proving that refractive flow can help enable direct sim-to-real transfer.

    "title": "Rich and Poor Texture Contrast: A Simple yet Effective Approach for AI-generated Image Detection",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Recent generative models show impressive performance in generating photographic images. Humans can hardly distinguish such incredibly realistic-looking AI-generated images from real ones. AI-generated images may lead to ubiquitous disinformation dissemination. Therefore, it is of utmost urgency to develop a detector to identify AI-generated images. Most existing detectors suffer from sharp performance drops over unseen generative models. In this paper, we propose a novel AI-generated image detector capable of identifying fake images created by a wide range of generative models. Our approach leverages the inter-pixel correlation contrast between rich and poor texture regions within an image. Pixels in rich texture regions exhibit more significant fluctuations than those in poor texture regions. This discrepancy reflects that the entropy of rich texture regions is larger than that of poor ones. Consequently, synthesizing realistic rich texture regions proves to be more challenging for existing generative models. Based on this principle, we divide an image into multiple patches and reconstruct them into two images, comprising rich-texture and poor-texture patches respectively. Subsequently, we extract the inter-pixel correlation discrepancy feature between rich and poor texture regions. This feature serves as a universal fingerprint used for AI-generated image forensics across different generative models. In addition, we build a comprehensive AI-generated image detection benchmark, which includes 16 kinds of prevalent generative models, to evaluate the effectiveness of existing baselines and our approach. Our benchmark provides a leaderboard for follow-up studies. Extensive experimental results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by a significant margin.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Class-agnostic object counting aims to count all objects in an image with respect to example boxes or class names, \\emph{a.k.a} few-shot and zero-shot counting. Current state-of-the-art methods highly rely on density maps to predict object counts, which lacks model interpretability. In this paper, we propose a generalized framework for both few-shot and zero-shot object counting based on detection. Our framework combines the superior advantages of two foundation models without compromising their zero-shot capability: (\\textbf{i}) SAM to segment all possible objects as mask proposals, and (\\textbf{ii}) CLIP to classify proposals to obtain accurate object counts. However, this strategy meets the obstacles of efficiency overhead and the small crowded objects that cannot be localized and distinguished. To address these issues, our framework, termed PseCo, follows three steps: point, segment, and count. Specifically, we first propose a class-agnostic object localization to provide accurate but least point prompts for SAM, which consequently not only reduces computation costs but also avoids missing small objects. Furthermore, we propose a generalized object classification that leverages CLIP image/text embeddings as the classifier, following a hierarchical knowledge distillation to obtain discriminative classifications among hierarchical mask proposals. Extensive experimental results on FSC-147 dataset demonstrate that PseCo achieves state-of-the-art performance in both few-shot/zero-shot object counting/detection, with additional results on large-scale COCO and LVIS datasets.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel approach to synthesize texture to dress up a given 3D object, given a text prompt. Based on the pretrained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model, existing methods usually employ a project-and-inpaint approach, in which a view of the given object is first generated and warped to another view for inpainting. But it tends to generate inconsistent texture due to the asynchronous diffusion of multiple views. We believe such asynchronous diffusion and insufficient information sharing among views are the root causes of the inconsistent artifact. In this paper, we propose a synchronized multi-view diffusion approach that allows the diffusion processes from different views to reach a consensus of the generated content early in the process, and hence ensures the texture consistency. To synchronize the diffusion, we share the denoised content among different views in each denoising step, specifically blending the latent content in the texture domain from views with overlap. Our method demonstrates superior performance in generating consistent, seamless, highly detailed textures, comparing to state-of-the-art methods",

Recent works have investigated adopting 8-bit floating-point quantization (FP8) in the context of PTQ for model inference. However, the exploration of floating-point formats smaller than 8 bits and their comparison with integer quantization remains relatively limited. In this work, we present minifloats, which are reduced-precision floating-point formats capable of further reducing the memory footprint, latency, and energy cost of a model while approaching full-precision model accuracy. Our work presents a novel PTQ design-space exploration, comparing minifloat and integer quantization schemes across a range of 3 to 8 bits for both weights and activations. We examine the applicability of various PTQ techniques to minifloats, including weight equalization, bias correction, SmoothQuant, gradient-based learned rounding, and the GPTQ method. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of low-precision minifloats when compared to their integer counterparts across a spectrum of accuracy-precision trade-offs on a set of reference deep learning vision workloads.

To address these challenges, we introduce a synthetic data augmentation framework tailored for aerial images. It encompasses sparse-to-dense region of interest (ROI) extraction to bridge the semantic gap, fine-tuning the diffusion model with low-rank adaptation (LORA) to circumvent exhaustive retraining, and finally, a Copy-Paste method to compose synthesized objects with backgrounds, providing a nuanced approach to aerial object detection through synthetic data",

For this reason, in the context of multi-modal action recognition, it is important to consider not only the overall action content but also the complementary nature of different modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel network, named Modality Mixer (M-Mixer) network, which effectively leverages and incorporates the complementary information across modalities with the temporal context of actions for action recognition. A key component of our proposed M-Mixer is the Multi-modal Contextualization Unit (MCU), a simple yet effective recurrent unit. Our MCU is responsible for temporally encoding a sequence of one modality (e.g., RGB) with action content features of other modalities (e.g., depth and infrared modalities). This process encourages M-Mixer network to exploit global action content and also to supplement complementary information of other modalities. Furthermore, to extract appropriate complementary information regarding to the given modality settings, we introduce a new module, named Complementary Feature Extraction Module (CFEM). CFEM incorporates sepearte learnable query embeddings for each modality, which guide CFEM to extract complementary information and global action content from the other modalities. As a result, our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA datasets. Moreover, through comprehensive ablation studies, we further validate the effectiveness of our proposed method",

    "abstract": "Recent text-to-image diffusion models have reached an unprecedented level in generating high-quality images. However, their exclusive reliance on textual prompts often falls short in accurately conveying fine-grained spatial compositions. In this paper, we propose LoCo, a training-free approach for layout-to-image synthesis that excels in producing high-quality images aligned with both textual prompts and spatial layouts. Our method introduces a Localized Attention Constraint to refine cross-attention for individual objects, ensuring their precise placement in designated regions. We further propose a Padding Token Constraint to leverage the semantic information embedded in previously neglected padding tokens, thereby preventing the undesired fusion of synthesized objects. LoCo seamlessly integrates into existing text-to-image and layout-to-image models, significantly amplifying their performance and effectively addressing semantic failures observed in prior methods. Through extensive experiments, we showcase the superiority of our approach, surpassing existing state-of-the-art training-free layout-to-image methods both qualitatively and quantitatively across multiple benchmarks",

Leveraging deep learning, computer-aided diagnosis has the potential to alleviate the pathologist scarcity and provide timely clinical analysis. However, developing a reliable model generally necessitates substantial data for training, which is challenging in pathological field. In response, we propose an adaptive depth-controlled bidirectional diffusion (ADBD) network for image data generation. The domain migration approach can work with small trainset and overcome the diffusion overfitting by source information guidance. Specifically, we developed a hybrid attention strategy to blend global and local attention priorities, which guides the bidirectional diffusion and ensures the migration success. In addition, we developed the adaptive depth-controlled strategy to simulate physiological transformations, capable of yielding unlimited cross-domain intermediate images with corresponding soft labels. ADBD is effective for overcoming pathological image data deficiency and supportable for further pathology-related research",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Histopathology image analysis is the golden standard of clinical diagnosis for Cancers. In doctors daily routine and computer-aided diagnosis, the Whole Slide Image (WSI) of histopathology tissue is used for analysis. Because of the extremely large scale of resolution, previous methods generally divide the WSI into a large number of patches, then aggregate all patches within a WSI by Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) to make the slide-level prediction when developing computer-aided diagnosis tools. However, most previous WSI-MIL models using global-attention without pairwise interaction and any positional information, or self-attention with absolute position embedding can not well handle shape varying large WSIs, e.g. testing WSIs after model deployment may be larger than training WSIs, since the model development set is always limited due to the difficulty of histopathology WSIs collection. To deal with the problem, in this paper, we propose to amend position embedding for shape varying long-contextual WSI by introducing Linear Bias into Attention, and adapt it from 1-d long sequence into 2-d long-contextual WSI which helps model extrapolate position embedding to unseen or under-fitted positions. We further utilize Flash-Attention module to tackle the computational complexity of Transformer, which also keep full self-attention performance compared to previous attention approximation work. Our method, Long-contextual MIL (Long-MIL) are evaluated on extensive experiments including 4 dataset including WSI classification and survival prediction tasks to validate the superiority on shape varying WSIs.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Arbitrary oriented object detection (AOOD) in aerial images is a widely concerned and highly challenging task, and plays an important role in many scenarios. The core of AOOD involves the representation, encoding, and feature augmentation of oriented bounding-boxes (Bboxes). Existing methods lack intuitive modeling of angle difference measurement in oriented Bbox representations. Oriented Bboxes under different representations exhibit rotational symmetry with varying periods due to angle periodicity. The angular boundary discontinuity (ABD) problem at periodic boundary positions is caused by rotational symmetry in measuring angular differences. In addition, existing methods also use additional encoding-decoding structures for oriented Bboxes. In this paper, we design an angular boundary free loss (ABFL) based on the von Mises distribution. The ABFL aims to solve the ABD problem when detecting oriented objects. Specifically, ABFL proposes to treat angles as circular data rather than linear data when measuring angle differences, aiming to introduce angle periodicity to alleviate the ABD problem and improve the accuracy of angle difference measurement. In addition, ABFL provides a simple and effective solution for various periodic boundary discontinuities caused by rotational symmetry in AOOD tasks, as it does not require additional encoding-decoding structures for oriented Bboxes. Extensive experiments on the DOTA and HRSC2016 datasets show that the proposed ABFL loss outperforms some state-of-the-art methods focused on addressing the ABD problem",

Precise action recognition in infants serves a multitude of pivotal purposes, encompassing safety monitoring, developmental milestone tracking, early intervention for developmental delays, fostering parent-infant bonds, advancing computer-aided diagnostics, and contributing to the scientific comprehension of child development. This paper delves into the intricacies of infant action recognition, a domain that has remained relatively uncharted despite the accomplishments in adult action recognition. In this study, we introduce a groundbreaking dataset called ``InfActPrimitive'', encompassing five significant infant milestone action categories, and we incorporate specialized preprocessing for infant data. We conducted an extensive comparative analysis employing cutting-edge skeleton-based action recognition models using this dataset. Our findings reveal that, although the PoseC3D model achieves the highest accuracy at approximately 71%, the remaining models struggle to accurately capture the dynamics of infant actions. This highlights a substantial knowledge gap between infant and adult action recognition domains and the urgent need for data-efficient pipeline models",

Our method combines several geometry processing tasks supervised at instance-level to promote the consistency of the learned feature representation. Specifically, our methods use shape generators and shape classifiers to perform shape reconstruction and classification tasks for each shape instance. This enforces the feature representation to faithfully encode both structural and local shape information, with an awareness of shape instances.

    "abstract": "Statistics of grain sizes and orientations in metals correlate to the material's mechanical properties. Reproducing representative volume elements for further analysis of deformation and failure in metals, like 316L stainless steel, is particularly important due to their wide use in manufacturing goods today. Two approaches, initially created for video games, were considered for the procedural generation of representative grain microstructures. The first is the Wave Function Collapse (WFC) algorithm, and the second is constraint propagation and probabilistic inference through Markov Junior, a free and open-source software. This study aimed to investigate these two algorithms' effectiveness in using reference electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) maps and recreating a statistically similar one that could be used in further research. It utilized two stainless steel EBSD maps as references to test both algorithms. First, the WFC algorithm was too constricting and, thus, incapable of producing images that resembled EBSDs. The second, MarkovJunior, was much more effective in creating a Voronoi tessellation that could be used to create an EBSD map in Python. When comparing the results between the reference and the generated EBSD, we discovered that the orientation and volume fractions were extremely similar. With the study, it was concluded that MarkovJunior is an effective machine learning tool that can reproduce representative grain microstructures",

Recent methods mainly focus on learning aligned and discriminative multi-modal features to boost generalization towards unseen categories.

In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective framework named Knowledge-aware Distribution Adaptation (KDA) to help the model better grasp the novel action contents with an external knowledge base. Specifically, we first propose using large language models to generate rich descriptions from category names, which leads to a better understanding of unseen categories. Additionally, we propose a distribution alignment loss as well as a knowledge-aware adaptive margin loss to further improve the generalization ability towards unseen categories. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed KDA can outperform state-of-the-art methods on three popular audio-visual zero-shot learning datasets.

However, manually creating these assets and calibrating their parameters is labor-intensive and requires specialized expertise. To address this gap, we propose DiffAvatar, a novel approach that performs body and garment co-optimization using differentiable simulation. By integrating physical simulation into the optimization loop and accounting for the complex nonlinear behavior of cloth and its intricate interaction with the body, our framework recovers body and garment geometry and extracts important material parameters in a physically plausible way.

Specifically, our goal is to generate an image in which objects in a source structure image are \"painted\" with the visual appearance of their semantically related objects in a target appearance image. To integrate semantic information into our framework, our key idea is to leverage a pre-trained and fixed Vision Transformer (ViT) model. Specifically, we derive novel disentangled representations of structure and appearance extracted from deep ViT features. We then establish an objective function that splices the desired structure and appearance representations, interweaving them together in the space of ViT features. Based on our objective function, we propose two frameworks of semantic appearance transfer -- \"Splice\", which works by training a generator on a single and arbitrary pair of structure-appearance images, and \"SpliceNet\", a feed-forward real-time appearance transfer model trained on a dataset of images from a specific domain. Our frameworks do not involve adversarial training, nor do they require any additional input information such as semantic segmentation or correspondences.

    "abstract": "The aim of video summarization is to shorten videos automatically while retaining the key information necessary to convey the overall story. Video summarization methods mainly rely on visual factors, such as visual consecutiveness and diversity, which may not be sufficient to fully understand the content of the video. There are other non-visual factors, such as interestingness, representativeness, and storyline consistency that should also be considered for generating high-quality video summaries. Current methods do not adequately take into account these non-visual factors, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this work, a new approach to video summarization is proposed based on insights gained from how humans create ground truth video summaries. The method utilizes a conditional modeling perspective and introduces multiple meaningful random variables and joint distributions to characterize the key components of video summarization. Helper distributions are employed to improve the training of the model. A conditional attention module is designed to mitigate potential performance degradation in the presence of multi-modal input.

    "title": "Model-aware 3D Eye Gaze from Weak and Few-shot Supervisions",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The task of predicting 3D eye gaze from eye images can be performed either by (a) end-to-end learning for image-to-gaze mapping or by (b) fitting a 3D eye model onto images. The former case requires 3D gaze labels, while the latter requires eye semantics or landmarks to facilitate the model fitting. Although obtaining eye semantics and landmarks is relatively easy, fitting an accurate 3D eye model on them remains to be very challenging due to its ill-posed nature in general. On the other hand, obtaining large-scale 3D gaze data is cumbersome due to the required hardware setups and computational demands. In this work, we propose to predict 3D eye gaze from weak supervision of eye semantic segmentation masks and direct supervision of a few 3D gaze vectors. The proposed method combines the best of both worlds by leveraging large amounts of weak annotations--which are easy to obtain, and only a few 3D gaze vectors--which alleviate the difficulty of fitting 3D eye models on the semantic segmentation of eye images. Thus, the eye gaze vectors, used in the model fitting, are directly supervised using the few-shot gaze labels. Additionally, we propose a transformer-based network architecture, that serves as a solid baseline for our improvements. Our experiments in diverse settings illustrate the significant benefits of the proposed method, achieving about 5 degrees lower angular gaze error over the baseline, when only 0.05% 3D annotations of the training images are used.

In this work, we focus on the estimation of epistemic uncertainty for 3D medical image-to-image translation. We propose a novel model uncertainty quantification method, Multi-Axis Fusion (MAF), which relies on the integration of complementary information derived from multiple views on volumetric image data. The proposed approach is applied to the task of synthesizing contrast enhanced T1-weighted images based on native T1, T2 and T2-FLAIR scans. The quantitative findings indicate a strong correlation ($\\rho_{\\text healthy} = 0.89$) between the mean absolute image synthetization error and the mean uncertainty score for our MAF method. Hence, we consider MAF as a promising approach to solve the highly relevant task of detecting synthetization failures at inference time",

We explore an alternative approach to generalizability in this context. We relax the intrinsic model bias (i.e. using MLPs to encode local features as opposed to convolutions) and constrain the hypothesis space instead with an auxiliary regularization related to the reconstruction task, i.e. denoising. The resulting model is the first only-MLP locally conditioned implicit shape reconstruction from point cloud network with fast feed forward inference. Point cloud borne features and denoising offsets are predicted from an exclusively MLP-made network in a single forward pass. A decoder predicts occupancy probabilities for queries anywhere in space by pooling nearby features from the point cloud order-invariantly, guided by denoised relative positional encoding.

    "title": "Hourglass Tokenizer for Efficient Transformer-Based 3D Human Pose Estimation",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Transformers have been successfully applied in the field of video-based 3D human pose estimation. However, the high computational costs of these video pose transformers (VPTs) make them impractical on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we present a plug-and-play pruning-and-recovering framework, called Hourglass Tokenizer (HoT), for efficient transformer-based 3D human pose estimation from videos. Our HoT begins with pruning pose tokens of redundant frames and ends with recovering full-length tokens, resulting in a few pose tokens in the intermediate transformer blocks and thus improving the model efficiency. To effectively achieve this, we propose a token pruning cluster (TPC) that dynamically selects a few representative tokens with high semantic diversity while eliminating the redundancy of video frames. In addition, we develop a token recovering attention (TRA) to restore the detailed spatio-temporal information based on the selected tokens, thereby expanding the network output to the original full-length temporal resolution for fast inference. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets (i.e., Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP) demonstrate that our method can achieve both high efficiency and estimation accuracy compared to the original VPT models. For instance, applying to MotionBERT and MixSTE on Human3.6M, our HoT can save nearly 50% FLOPs without sacrificing accuracy and nearly 40% FLOPs with only 0.2% accuracy drop, respectively.

Our approach identifies a low-rank parameter direction corresponding to one concept while minimizing interference with other attributes. A slider is created using a small set of prompts or sample images; thus slider directions can be created for either textual or visual concepts. Concept Sliders are plug-and-play: they can be composed efficiently and continuously modulated, enabling precise control over image generation. In quantitative experiments comparing to previous editing techniques, our sliders exhibit stronger targeted edits with lower interference. We showcase sliders for weather, age, styles, and expressions, as well as slider compositions. We show how sliders can transfer latents from StyleGAN for intuitive editing of visual concepts for which textual description is difficult. We also find that our method can help address persistent quality issues in Stable Diffusion XL including repair of object deformations and fixing distorted hands.

This system analyzes videos of humans performing tasks and creates executable robot programs that incorporate affordance insights. The computation starts by analyzing the videos with GPT-4V to convert environmental and action details into text, followed by a GPT-4-empowered task planner. In the following analyses, vision systems reanalyze the video with the task plan. Object names are grounded using an open-vocabulary object detector, while focus on the hand-object relation helps to detect the moment of grasping and releasing. This spatiotemporal grounding allows the vision systems to further gather affordance data (e.g., grasp type, way points, and body postures). Experiments across various scenarios demonstrate this method's efficacy in achieving real robots' operations from human demonstrations in a zero-shot manner.

    "abstract": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel in local spatial pattern recognition. For many vision tasks, such as object recognition and segmentation, salient information is also present outside CNN's kernel boundaries. However, CNNs struggle in capturing such relevant information due to their confined receptive fields. Self-attention can improve a model's access to global information but increases computational overhead. We present a fast and simple fully convolutional method called DAS that helps focus attention on relevant information. It uses deformable convolutions for the location of pertinent image regions and separable convolutions for efficiency. DAS plugs into existing CNNs and propagates relevant information using a gating mechanism. Compared to the O(n^2) computational complexity of transformer-style attention, DAS is O(n). Our claim is that DAS's ability to pay increased attention to relevant features results in performance improvements when added to popular CNNs for Image Classification and Object Detection. For example, DAS yields an improvement on Stanford Dogs (4.47%), ImageNet (1.91%), and COCO AP (3.3%) with base ResNet50 backbone. This outperforms other CNN attention mechanisms while using similar or less FLOPs. Our code will be publicly available",

In addition, FrePolad supports variable point cloud cardinality by formulating the sampling of points as conditional distributions over a latent shape distribution. Finally, the low-dimensional latent space encoded by the VAE contributes to FrePolad's fast and scalable sampling.

The aim of this study is to compare state-of-the-art lip segmentation models using a standardized setting and a publicly available dataset. Five techniques, namely EHANet, Mask2Former, BiSeNet V2, PIDNet, and STDC1, are qualitatively selected based on their reported performance, inference time, code availability, recency, and popularity. The CelebAMask-HQ dataset, comprising manually annotated face images, is used to fairly assess the lip segmentation performance of the selected models. Inference experiments are conducted on a Raspberry Pi4 to emulate limited computational resources. The results show that Mask2Former and EHANet have the best performances in terms of mIoU score. BiSeNet V2 demonstrate competitive performance, while PIDNet excels in recall but has lower precision. Most models present inference time ranging from 1000 to around 3000 milliseconds on a Raspberry Pi4, with PIDNet having the lowest mean inference time. This study provides a comprehensive evaluation of lip segmentation models, highlighting their performance and inference times.

However, few datasets exist to categorize visual features and objects available to dogs, as well as how dogs direct their visual attention within their environment. We collect and study a dataset with over 11,698 gazes to categorize the objects available to be gazed at by 11 dogs in everyday outdoor environments i.e. a walk around a college campus and urban area. We explore the availability of these object categories and the visual attention of dogs over these categories using a head mounted eye tracking apparatus. A small portion (approx. 600 images or < 20% of total dataset) of the collected data is used to fine tune a MaskRCNN for the novel image domain to segment objects present in the scene, enabling further statistical analysis on the visual gaze tendencies of dogs. The MaskRCNN, with eye tracking apparatus, serves as an end to end model for automatically classifying the visual fixations of dogs. The fine tuned MaskRCNN performs far better than chance. There are few individual differences between the 11 dogs and we observe greater visual fixations on buses, plants, pavement, and construction equipment.

This paper presents the first attempt to estimate 3D human body mesh from sparse LiDAR point clouds. We found that the major challenge in estimating human pose and mesh from point clouds lies in the sparsity, noise, and incompletion of LiDAR point clouds. Facing these challenges, we propose an effective sparse-to-dense reconstruction scheme to reconstruct 3D human mesh. This involves estimating a sparse representation of a human (3D human pose) and gradually reconstructing the body mesh. To better leverage the 3D structural information of point clouds, we employ a cascaded graph transformer (graphormer) to introduce point cloud features during sparse-to-dense reconstruction. Experimental results on three publicly available databases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Code: https://github.com/soullessrobot/LiDAR-HMR/",

Its success largely owes to massive labeled training data. However, directly applying SAM to medical image segmentation cannot perform well because SAM lacks medical knowledge -- it does not use medical images for training. To incorporate medical knowledge into SAM, we introduce SA-Med2D-20M, a large-scale segmentation dataset of 2D medical images built upon numerous public and private datasets. It consists of 4.6 million 2D medical images and 19.7 million corresponding masks, covering almost the whole body and showing significant diversity. This paper describes all the datasets collected in SA-Med2D-20M and details how to process these datasets. Furthermore, comprehensive statistics of SA-Med2D-20M are presented to facilitate the better use of our dataset, which can help the researchers build medical vision foundation models or apply their models to downstream medical applications. We hope that the large scale and diversity of SA-Med2D-20M can be leveraged to develop medical artificial intelligence for enhancing diagnosis, medical image analysis, knowledge sharing, and education.

    "abstract": "This position paper outlines the potential of AutoML for incremental (continual) learning to encourage more research in this direction. Incremental learning involves incorporating new data from a stream of tasks and distributions to learn enhanced deep representations and adapt better to new tasks. However, a significant limitation of incremental learners is that most current techniques freeze the backbone architecture, hyperparameters, and the order & structure of the learning tasks throughout the learning and adaptation process. We strongly believe that AutoML offers promising solutions to address these limitations, enabling incremental learning to adapt to more diverse real-world tasks. Therefore, instead of directly proposing a new method, this paper takes a step back by posing the question: \"What can AutoML do for incremental learning?\" We outline three key areas of research that can contribute to making incremental learners more dynamic, highlighting concrete opportunities to apply AutoML methods in novel ways as well as entirely new challenges for AutoML research",

    "title": "NNG-Mix: Improving Semi-supervised Anomaly Detection with Pseudo-anomaly Generation",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Anomaly detection (AD) is essential in identifying rare and often critical events in complex systems, finding applications in fields such as network intrusion detection, financial fraud detection, and fault detection in infrastructure and industrial systems. While AD is typically treated as an unsupervised learning task due to the high cost of label annotation, it is more practical to assume access to a small set of labeled anomaly samples from domain experts, as is the case for semi-supervised anomaly detection. Semi-supervised and supervised approaches can leverage such labeled data, resulting in improved performance. In this paper, rather than proposing a new semi-supervised or supervised approach for AD, we introduce a novel algorithm for generating additional pseudo-anomalies on the basis of the limited labeled anomalies and a large volume of unlabeled data. This serves as an augmentation to facilitate the detection of new anomalies. Our proposed algorithm, named Nearest Neighbor Gaussian Mixup (NNG-Mix), efficiently integrates information from both labeled and unlabeled data to generate pseudo-anomalies. We compare the performance of this novel algorithm with commonly applied augmentation techniques, such as Mixup and Cutout. We evaluate NNG-Mix by training various existing semi-supervised and supervised anomaly detection algorithms on the original training data along with the generated pseudo-anomalies. Through extensive experiments on 57 benchmark datasets in ADBench, reflecting different data types, we demonstrate that NNG-Mix outperforms other data augmentation methods. It yields significant performance improvements compared to the baselines trained exclusively on the original training data. Notably, NNG-Mix yields up to 16.4%, 8.8%, and 8.0% improvements on Classical, CV, and NLP datasets in ADBench. Our source code will be available at https://github.com/donghao51/NNG-Mix",

    "title": "An Image is Worth Multiple Words: Multi-attribute Inversion for Constrained Text-to-Image Synthesis",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "We consider the problem of constraining diffusion model outputs with a user-supplied reference image. Our key objective is to extract multiple attributes (e.g., color, object, layout, style) from this single reference image, and then generate new samples with them. One line of existing work proposes to invert the reference images into a single textual conditioning vector, enabling generation of new samples with this learned token. These methods, however, do not learn multiple tokens that are necessary to condition model outputs on the multiple attributes noted above. Another line of techniques expand the inversion space to learn multiple embeddings but they do this only along the layer dimension (e.g., one per layer of the DDPM model) or the timestep dimension (one for a set of timesteps in the denoising process), leading to suboptimal attribute disentanglement. To address the aforementioned gaps, the first contribution of this paper is an extensive analysis to determine which attributes are captured in which dimension of the denoising process. As noted above, we consider both the time-step dimension (in reverse denoising) as well as the DDPM model layer dimension. We observe that often a subset of these attributes are captured in the same set of model layers and/or across same denoising timesteps. For instance, color and style are captured across same U-Net layers, whereas layout and color are captured across same timestep stages. Consequently, an inversion process that is designed only for the time-step dimension or the layer dimension is insufficient to disentangle all attributes. This leads to our second contribution where we design a new multi-attribute inversion algorithm, MATTE, with associated disentanglement-enhancing regularization losses, that operates across both dimensions and explicitly leads to four disentangled tokens (color, style, layout, and object)",

    "title": "Generalization of Fitness Exercise Recognition from Doppler Measurements by Domain-adaption and Few-Shot Learning",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In previous works, a mobile application was developed using an unmodified commercial off-the-shelf smartphone to recognize whole-body exercises. The working principle was based on the ultrasound Doppler sensing with the device built-in hardware. Applying such a lab-environment trained model on realistic application variations causes a significant drop in performance, and thus decimate its applicability. The reason of the reduced performance can be manifold. It could be induced by the user, environment, and device variations in realistic scenarios. Such scenarios are often more complex and diverse, which can be challenging to anticipate in the initial training data. To study and overcome this issue, this paper presents a database with controlled and uncontrolled subsets of fitness exercises. We propose two concepts to utilize small adaption data to successfully improve model generalization in an uncontrolled environment, increasing the recognition accuracy by two to six folds compared to the baseline for different users",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Continual learning is a sub-field of machine learning, which aims to allow machine learning models to continuously learn on new data, by accumulating knowledge without forgetting what was learned in the past. In this work, we take a step back, and ask: \"Why should one care about continual learning in the first place?\". We set the stage by surveying recent continual learning papers published at three major machine learning conferences, and show that memory-constrained settings dominate the field. Then, we discuss five open problems in machine learning, and even though they seem unrelated to continual learning at first sight, we show that continual learning will inevitably be part of their solution. These problems are model-editing, personalization, on-device learning, faster (re-)training and reinforcement learning. Finally, by comparing the desiderata from these unsolved problems and the current assumptions in continual learning, we highlight and discuss four future directions for continual learning research. We hope that this work offers an interesting perspective on the future of continual learning, while displaying its potential value and the paths we have to pursue in order to make it successful. This work is the result of the many discussions the authors had at the Dagstuhl seminar on Deep Continual Learning, in March 2023",

    "title": "LLMs as Visual Explainers: Advancing Image Classification with Evolving Visual Descriptions",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Vision-language models (VLMs) offer a promising paradigm for image classification by comparing the similarity between images and class embeddings. A critical challenge lies in crafting precise textual representations for class names. While previous studies have leveraged recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) to enhance these descriptors, their outputs often suffer from ambiguity and inaccuracy. We identify two primary causes: 1) The prevalent reliance on textual interactions with LLMs, leading to a mismatch between the generated text and the visual content in VLMs' latent space - a phenomenon we term the \"explain without seeing\" dilemma. 2) The oversight of the inter-class relationships, resulting in descriptors that fail to differentiate similar classes effectively. To address these issues, we propose a novel image classification framework combining VLMs with LLMs, named Iterative Optimization with Visual Feedback. In particular, our method develops an LLM-based agent, employing an evolutionary optimization strategy to refine class descriptors. Crucially, we incorporate visual feedback from VLM classification metrics, thereby guiding the optimization process with concrete visual data. Our method leads to improving accuracy on a wide range of image classification benchmarks, with 3.47\\% average gains over state-of-the-art methods. We also highlight the resulting descriptions serve as explainable and robust features that can consistently improve the performance across various backbone models",

    "title": "Identifying the Defective: Detecting Damaged Grains for Cereal Appearance Inspection",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Cereal grain plays a crucial role in the human diet as a major source of essential nutrients. Grain Appearance Inspection (GAI) serves as an essential process to determine grain quality and facilitate grain circulation and processing. However, GAI is routinely performed manually by inspectors with cumbersome procedures, which poses a significant bottleneck in smart agriculture. In this paper, we endeavor to develop an automated GAI system:AI4GrainInsp. By analyzing the distinctive characteristics of grain kernels, we formulate GAI as a ubiquitous problem: Anomaly Detection (AD), in which healthy and edible kernels are considered normal samples while damaged grains or unknown objects are regarded as anomalies. We further propose an AD model, called AD-GAI, which is trained using only normal samples yet can identify anomalies during inference. Moreover, we customize a prototype device for data acquisition and create a large-scale dataset including 220K high-quality images of wheat and maize kernels. Through extensive experiments, AD-GAI achieves considerable performance in comparison with advanced AD methods, and AI4GrainInsp has highly consistent performance compared to human experts and excels at inspection efficiency over 20x speedup.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Human facial data hold tremendous potential to address a variety of classification problems, including face recognition, age estimation, gender identification, emotion analysis, and race classification. However, recent privacy regulations, such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation and others, have restricted the ways in which human images may be collected and used for research. As a result, several previously published data sets containing human faces have been removed from the internet due to inadequate data collection methods that failed to meet privacy regulations. Data sets consisting of synthetic data have been proposed as an alternative, but they fall short of accurately representing the real data distribution. On the other hand, most available data sets are labeled for just a single task, which limits their applicability. To address these issues, we present the Multi-Task Faces (MTF) image data set, a meticulously curated collection of face images designed for various classification tasks, including face recognition, as well as race, gender, and age classification. The MTF data set has been ethically gathered by leveraging publicly available images of celebrities and strictly adhering to copyright regulations. In this paper, we present this data set and provide detailed descriptions of the followed data collection and processing procedures. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of five deep learning (DL) models on the MTF data set across the aforementioned classification tasks. Additionally, we compare the performance of DL models over the processed MTF data and over raw data crawled from the internet. The reported results constitute a baseline for further research employing these data.

    "abstract": "Applying NeRF to downstream perception tasks for scene understanding and representation is becoming increasingly popular. Most existing methods treat semantic prediction as an additional rendering task, \\textit{i.e.}, the \"label rendering\" task, to build semantic NeRFs. However, by rendering semantic/instance labels per pixel without considering the contextual information of the rendered image, these methods usually suffer from unclear boundary segmentation and abnormal segmentation of pixels within an object. To solve this problem, we propose Generalized Perception NeRF (GP-NeRF), a novel pipeline that makes the widely used segmentation model and NeRF work compatibly under a unified framework, for facilitating context-aware 3D scene perception. To accomplish this goal, we introduce transformers to aggregate radiance as well as semantic embedding fields jointly for novel views and facilitate the joint volumetric rendering of both fields. In addition, we propose two self-distillation mechanisms, i.e., the Semantic Distill Loss and the Depth-Guided Semantic Distill Loss, to enhance the discrimination and quality of the semantic field and the maintenance of geometric consistency. In evaluation, we conduct experimental comparisons under two perception tasks (\\textit{i.e.} semantic and instance segmentation) using both synthetic and real-world datasets. Notably, our method outperforms SOTA approaches by 6.94\\%, 11.76\\%, and 8.47\\% on generalized semantic segmentation, finetuning semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation, respectively",

However, most of the existing MLLMs mainly adopt vision encoders pretrained on coarsely aligned image-text pairs, leading to insufficient extraction and reasoning of visual knowledge. To address this issue, we devise a dual-Level vIsual knOwledge eNhanced Multimodal Large Language Model (LION), which empowers the MLLM by injecting visual knowledge in two levels. 1) Progressive incorporation of fine-grained spatial-aware visual knowledge. We design a vision aggregator cooperated with region-level vision-language (VL) tasks to incorporate fine-grained spatial-aware visual knowledge into the MLLM. To alleviate the conflict between image-level and region-level VL tasks during incorporation, we devise a dedicated stage-wise instruction-tuning strategy with mixture-of-adapters. This progressive incorporation scheme contributes to the mutual promotion between these two kinds of VL tasks. 2) Soft prompting of high-level semantic visual evidence. We facilitate the MLLM with high-level semantic visual evidence by leveraging diverse image tags. To mitigate the potential influence caused by imperfect predicted tags, we propose a soft prompting method by embedding a learnable token into the tailored text instruction.

    "abstract": "Generalizable NeRF can directly synthesize novel views across new scenes, eliminating the need for scene-specific retraining in vanilla NeRF. A critical enabling factor in these approaches is the extraction of a generalizable 3D representation by aggregating source-view features. In this paper, we propose an Entangled View-Epipolar Information Aggregation method dubbed EVE-NeRF. Different from existing methods that consider cross-view and along-epipolar information independently, EVE-NeRF conducts the view-epipolar feature aggregation in an entangled manner by injecting the scene-invariant appearance continuity and geometry consistency priors to the aggregation process. Our approach effectively mitigates the potential lack of inherent geometric and appearance constraint resulting from one-dimensional interactions, thus further boosting the 3D representation generalizablity. EVE-NeRF attains state-of-the-art performance across various evaluation scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstate that, compared to prevailing single-dimensional aggregation, the entangled network excels in the accuracy of 3D scene geometry and appearance reconstruction.Our project page is https://github.com/tatakai1/EVENeRF",

    "title": "Kandinsky Conformal Prediction: Efficient Calibration of Image Segmentation Algorithms",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Image segmentation algorithms can be understood as a collection of pixel classifiers, for which the outcomes of nearby pixels are correlated. Classifier models can be calibrated using Inductive Conformal Prediction, but this requires holding back a sufficiently large calibration dataset for computing the distribution of non-conformity scores of the model's predictions. If one only requires only marginal calibration on the image level, this calibration set consists of all individual pixels in the images available for calibration. However, if the goal is to attain proper calibration for each individual pixel classifier, the calibration set consists of individual images. In a scenario where data are scarce (such as the medical domain), it may not always be possible to set aside sufficiently many images for this pixel-level calibration. The method we propose, dubbed ``Kandinsky calibration'', makes use of the spatial structure present in the distribution of natural images to simultaneously calibrate the classifiers of ``similar'' pixels. This can be seen as an intermediate approach between marginal (imagewise) and conditional (pixelwise) calibration, where non-conformity scores are aggregated over similar image regions, thereby making more efficient use of the images available for calibration. We run experiments on segmentation algorithms trained and calibrated on subsets of the public MS-COCO and Medical Decathlon datasets, demonstrating that Kandinsky calibration method can significantly improve the coverage. When compared to both pixelwise and imagewise calibration on little data, the Kandinsky method achieves much lower coverage errors, indicating the data efficiency of the Kandinsky calibration",

In this paper, we propose a novel approach for improving few-shot segmentation performance on multispectral images using reinforcement learning to generate representations. These representations are generated in the form of mathematical expressions between channels and are tailored to the specific class being segmented. Our methodology involves training an agent to identify the most informative expressions, updating the dataset using these expressions, and then using the updated dataset to perform segmentation. Due to the limited length of the expressions, the model receives useful representations without any added risk of overfitting.

Without the requirement of complex equipment, our method only takes simple RGB images captured by a drone as inputs to enable physically based and photorealistic novel-view rendering, relighting, and editing. However, a real-world facade usually has complex appearances ranging from diffuse rocks with subtle details to large-area glass windows with specular reflections, making it hard to attend to everything. As a result, previous methods can preserve the geometry details but fail to reconstruct smooth glass windows or verse vise. In order to address this challenge, we introduce three spatial- and semantic-adaptive optimization strategies, including a semantic regularization approach based on zero-shot segmentation techniques to improve material consistency, a frequency-aware geometry regularization to balance surface smoothness and details in different surfaces, and a visibility probe-based scheme to enable efficient modeling of the local lighting in large-scale outdoor environments. In addition, we capture a real-world facade aerial 3D scanning image set and corresponding point clouds for training and benchmarking.

    "title": "Cross-View Graph Consistency Learning for Invariant Graph Representations",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Graph representation learning is fundamental for analyzing graph-structured data. Exploring invariant graph representations remains a challenge for most existing graph representation learning methods. In this paper, we propose a cross-view graph consistency learning (CGCL) method that learns invariant graph representations for link prediction. First, two complementary augmented views are derived from an incomplete graph structure through a bidirectional graph structure augmentation scheme. This augmentation scheme mitigates the potential information loss that is commonly associated with various data augmentation techniques involving raw graph data, such as edge perturbation, node removal, and attribute masking. Second, we propose a CGCL model that can learn invariant graph representations. A cross-view training scheme is proposed to train the proposed CGCL model. This scheme attempts to maximize the consistency information between one augmented view and the graph structure reconstructed from the other augmented view. Furthermore, we offer a comprehensive theoretical CGCL analysis. This paper empirically and experimentally demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed CGCL method, achieving competitive results on graph datasets in comparisons with several state-of-the-art algorithms",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "4D Flow Magnetic Resonance Imaging (4D Flow MRI) is a non-invasive measurement technique capable of quantifying blood flow across the cardiovascular system. While practical use is limited by spatial resolution and image noise, incorporation of trained super-resolution (SR) networks has potential to enhance image quality post-scan. However, these efforts have predominantly been restricted to narrowly defined cardiovascular domains, with limited exploration of how SR performance extends across the cardiovascular system; a task aggravated by contrasting hemodynamic conditions apparent across the cardiovasculature. The aim of our study was to explore the generalizability of SR 4D Flow MRI using a combination of heterogeneous training sets and dedicated ensemble learning. With synthetic training data generated across three disparate domains (cardiac, aortic, cerebrovascular), varying convolutional base and ensemble learners were evaluated as a function of domain and architecture, quantifying performance on both in-silico and acquired in-vivo data from the same three domains. Results show that both bagging and stacking ensembling enhance SR performance across domains, accurately predicting high-resolution velocities from low-resolution input data in-silico. Likewise, optimized networks successfully recover native resolution velocities from downsampled in-vivo data, as well as show qualitative potential in generating denoised SR-images from clinical level input data. In conclusion, our work presents a viable approach for generalized SR 4D Flow MRI, with ensemble learning extending utility across various clinical areas of interest",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Automatic pavement crack detection is an important task to ensure the functional performances of pavements during their service life. Inspired by deep learning (DL), the encoder-decoder framework is a powerful tool for crack detection. However, these models are usually open-loop (OL) systems that tend to treat thin cracks as the background. Meanwhile, these models can not automatically correct errors in the prediction, nor can it adapt to the changes of the environment to automatically extract and detect thin cracks. To tackle this problem, we embed closed-loop feedback (CLF) into the neural network so that the model could learn to correct errors on its own, based on generative adversarial networks (GAN). The resulting model is called CrackCLF and includes the front and back ends, i.e. segmentation and adversarial network. The front end with U-shape framework is employed to generate crack maps, and the back end with a multi-scale loss function is used to correct higher-order inconsistencies between labels and crack maps (generated by the front end) to address open-loop system issues. Empirical results show that the proposed CrackCLF outperforms others methods on three public datasets. Moreover, the proposed CLF can be defined as a plug and play module, which can be embedded into different neural network models to improve their performances",

Unlike existing work either struggle with high-resolution documents or give up the large language model thus vision or language ability constrained, our DocPedia directly processes visual input in the frequency domain rather than the pixel space. The unique characteristic enables DocPedia to capture a greater amount of visual and textual information using a limited number of visual tokens. To consistently enhance both perception and comprehension abilities of our model, we develop a dual-stage training strategy and enrich instructions/annotations of all training tasks covering multiple document types. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments conducted on various publicly available benchmarks confirm the mutual benefits of jointly learning perception and comprehension tasks.

    "abstract": "In this paper we propose a new flexible method for hand-eye calibration. The vast majority of existing hand-eye calibration techniques requires a calibration rig which is used in conjunction with camera pose estimation methods. Instead, we combine structure-from-motion with known robot motions and we show that the solution can be obtained in linear form. The latter solves for both the hand-eye parameters and for the unknown scale factor inherent with structure-from-motion methods. The algebraic analysis that is made possible with such a linear formulation allows to investigate not only the well known case of general screw motions but also such singular motions as pure translations, pure rotations, and planar motions. In essence, the robot-mounted camera looks to an unknown rigid layout, tracks points over an image sequence and estimates the camera-to-robot relationship. Such a self calibration process is relevant for unmanned vehicles, robots working in remote places, and so forth. We conduct a large number of experiments which validate the quality of the method by comparing it with existing ones",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have dramatically enhanced the field of language intelligence, as demonstrably evidenced by their formidable empirical performance across a spectrum of complex reasoning tasks. Additionally, theoretical proofs have illuminated their emergent reasoning capabilities, providing a compelling showcase of their advanced cognitive abilities in linguistic contexts. Critical to their remarkable efficacy in handling complex reasoning tasks, LLMs leverage the intriguing chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning techniques, obliging them to formulate intermediate steps en route to deriving an answer. The CoT reasoning approach has not only exhibited proficiency in amplifying reasoning performance but also in enhancing interpretability, controllability, and flexibility. In light of these merits, recent research endeavors have extended CoT reasoning methodologies to nurture the development of autonomous language agents, which adeptly adhere to language instructions and execute actions within varied environments. This survey paper orchestrates a thorough discourse, penetrating vital research dimensions, encompassing: (i) the foundational mechanics of CoT techniques, with a focus on elucidating the circumstances and justification behind its efficacy; (ii) the paradigm shift in CoT; and (iii) the burgeoning of language agents fortified by CoT approaches. Prospective research avenues envelop explorations into generalization, efficiency, customization, scaling, and safety. This paper caters to a wide audience, including beginners seeking comprehensive knowledge of CoT reasoning and language agents, as well as experienced researchers interested in foundational mechanics and engaging in cutting-edge discussions on these topics.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems such as autonomous vehicles, facial recognition, and speech recognition systems are increasingly integrated into our daily lives. However, despite their utility, these AI systems are vulnerable to a wide range of attacks such as adversarial, backdoor, data poisoning, membership inference, model inversion, and model stealing attacks. In particular, numerous attacks are designed to target a particular model or system, yet their effects can spread to additional targets, referred to as transferable attacks. Although considerable efforts have been directed toward developing transferable attacks, a holistic understanding of the advancements in transferable attacks remains elusive. In this paper, we comprehensively explore learning-based attacks from the perspective of transferability, particularly within the context of cyber-physical security. We delve into different domains -- the image, text, graph, audio, and video domains -- to highlight the ubiquitous and pervasive nature of transferable attacks. This paper categorizes and reviews the architecture of existing attacks from various viewpoints: data, process, model, and system. We further examine the implications of transferable attacks in practical scenarios such as autonomous driving, speech recognition, and large language models (LLMs). Additionally, we outline the potential research directions to encourage efforts in exploring the landscape of transferable attacks. This survey offers a holistic understanding of the prevailing transferable attacks and their impacts across different domains",

However, existing model architectures like ResNet, EfficientNet and ConvNeXt often underperform on smaller, specialised datasets typical of such projects. We address this gap with informed data collection and the development of a new CNN architecture, PhytNet. Utilising a novel dataset of infrared cocoa tree images, we demonstrate PhytNet's development and compare its performance with existing architectures. Data collection was informed by analysis of spectroscopy data, which provided useful insights into the spectral characteristics of cocoa trees. Such information could inform future data collection and model development. Cocoa was chosen as a focal species due to the diverse pathology of its diseases, which pose significant challenges for detection. ResNet18 showed some signs of overfitting, while EfficientNet variants showed distinct signs of overfitting. By contrast, PhytNet displayed excellent attention to relevant features, no overfitting, and an exceptionally low computation cost (1.19 GFLOPS). As such PhytNet is a promising candidate for rapid disease or plant classification, or precise localisation of disease symptoms for autonomous systems",

    "title": "Robust Tumor Segmentation with Hyperspectral Imaging and Graph Neural Networks",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Segmenting the boundary between tumor and healthy tissue during surgical cancer resection poses a significant challenge. In recent years, Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) combined with Machine Learning (ML) has emerged as a promising solution. However, due to the extensive information contained within the spectral domain, most ML approaches primarily classify individual HSI (super-)pixels, or tiles, without taking into account their spatial context. In this paper, we propose an improved methodology that leverages the spatial context of tiles for more robust and smoother segmentation. To address the irregular shapes of tiles, we utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to propagate context information across neighboring regions. The features for each tile within the graph are extracted using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is trained simultaneously with the subsequent GNN. Moreover, we incorporate local image quality metrics into the loss function to enhance the training procedure's robustness against low-quality regions in the training images. We demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method using a clinical ex vivo dataset consisting of 51 HSI images from 30 patients. Despite the limited dataset, the GNN-based model significantly outperforms context-agnostic approaches, accurately distinguishing between healthy and tumor tissues, even in images from previously unseen patients. Furthermore, we show that our carefully designed loss function, accounting for local image quality, results in additional improvements. Our findings demonstrate that context-aware GNN algorithms can robustly find tumor demarcations on HSI images, ultimately contributing to better surgery success and patient outcome",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The integration of multisource remote sensing data and deep learning models offers new possibilities for accurately mapping high spatial resolution forest height. We found that GEDI relative heights (RH) metrics exhibited strong correlation with the mean of the top 10 highest trees (dominant height) measured in situ at the corresponding footprint locations. Consequently, we proposed a novel deep learning framework termed the multi-modal attention remote sensing network (MARSNet) to estimate forest dominant height by extrapolating dominant height derived from GEDI, using Setinel-1 data, ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 data, Sentinel-2 optical data and ancillary data. MARSNet comprises separate encoders for each remote sensing data modality to extract multi-scale features, and a shared decoder to fuse the features and estimate height. Using individual encoders for each remote sensing imagery avoids interference across modalities and extracts distinct representations. To focus on the efficacious information from each dataset, we reduced the prevalent spatial and band redundancies in each remote sensing data by incorporating the extended spatial and band reconstruction convolution modules in the encoders. MARSNet achieved commendable performance in estimating dominant height, with an R2 of 0.62 and RMSE of 2.82 m, outperforming the widely used random forest approach which attained an R2 of 0.55 and RMSE of 3.05 m. Finally, we applied the trained MARSNet model to generate wall-to-wall maps at 10 m resolution for Jilin, China. Through independent validation using field measurements, MARSNet demonstrated an R2 of 0.58 and RMSE of 3.76 m, compared to 0.41 and 4.37 m for the random forest baseline. Our research demonstrates the effectiveness of a multimodal deep learning approach fusing GEDI with SAR and passive optical imagery for enhancing the accuracy of high resolution dominant height estimation",

Our proposed method uses a dual-mapping strategy and only requires a simple white point from a test sensor under a D65 condition. This allows us to derive a mapping matrix, enabling the reconstructions of image data and illuminants. In the second mapping phase, we transform the re-constructed image data into sparse features, which are then optimized with a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model using the re-constructed illuminants as ground truths. This approach effectively reduces sensor discrepancies and delivers performance on par with leading cross-sensor methods. It only requires a small amount of memory (~0.003 MB), and takes ~1 hour training on an RTX3070Ti GPU. More importantly, the method can be implemented very fast, with ~0.3 ms and ~1 ms on a GPU or CPU respectively, and is not sensitive to the input image resolution. Therefore, it offers a practical solution to the great challenges of data recollection that is faced by the industry",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Deep learning is revolutionising pathology, offering novel opportunities in disease prognosis and personalised treatment. Historically, stain normalisation has been a crucial preprocessing step in computational pathology pipelines, and persists into the deep learning era. Yet, with the emergence of feature extractors trained using self-supervised learning (SSL) on diverse pathology datasets, we call this practice into question. In an empirical evaluation of publicly available feature extractors, we find that omitting stain normalisation and image augmentations does not compromise downstream performance, while incurring substantial savings in memory and compute. Further, we show that the top-performing feature extractors are remarkably robust to variations in stain and augmentations like rotation in their latent space. Contrary to previous patch-level benchmarking studies, our approach emphasises clinical relevance by focusing on slide-level prediction tasks in a weakly supervised setting with external validation cohorts. This work represents the most comprehensive robustness evaluation of public pathology SSL feature extractors to date, involving more than 6,000 training runs across nine tasks, five datasets, three downstream architectures, and various preprocessing setups. Our findings stand to streamline digital pathology workflows by minimising preprocessing needs and informing the selection of feature extractors",

    "abstract": "Evaluating the risk level of adversarial images is essential for safely deploying face authentication models in the real world. Popular approaches for physical-world attacks, such as print or replay attacks, suffer from some limitations, like including physical and geometrical artifacts. Recently, adversarial attacks have gained attraction, which try to digitally deceive the learning strategy of a recognition system using slight modifications to the captured image. While most previous research assumes that the adversarial image could be digitally fed into the authentication systems, this is not always the case for systems deployed in the real world. This paper demonstrates the vulnerability of face authentication systems to adversarial images in physical world scenarios. We propose AdvGen, an automated Generative Adversarial Network, to simulate print and replay attacks and generate adversarial images that can fool state-of-the-art PADs in a physical domain attack setting. Using this attack strategy, the attack success rate goes up to 82.01%. We test AdvGen extensively on four datasets and ten state-of-the-art PADs.

    "abstract": "In the realm of medical imaging, precise segmentation of stroke lesions from brain MRI images stands as a critical challenge with significant implications for patient diagnosis and treatment. Addressing this, our study introduces an innovative approach using a Fuzzy Information Seeded Region Growing (FISRG) algorithm. Designed to effectively delineate the complex and irregular boundaries of stroke lesions, the FISRG algorithm combines fuzzy logic with Seeded Region Growing (SRG) techniques, aiming to enhance segmentation accuracy. The research involved three experiments to optimize the FISRG algorithm's performance, each focusing on different parameters to improve the accuracy of stroke lesion segmentation. The highest Dice score achieved in these experiments was 94.2\\%, indicating a high degree of similarity between the algorithm's output and the expert-validated ground truth. Notably, the best average Dice score, amounting to 88.1\\%, was recorded in the third experiment, highlighting the efficacy of the algorithm in consistently segmenting stroke lesions across various slices. Our findings reveal the FISRG algorithm's strengths in handling the heterogeneity of stroke lesions. However, challenges remain in areas of abrupt lesion topology changes and in distinguishing lesions from similar intensity brain regions. The results underscore the potential of the FISRG algorithm in contributing significantly to advancements in medical imaging analysis for stroke diagnosis and treatment",

    "title": "On the Importance of Large Objects in CNN Based Object Detection Algorithms",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Object detection models, a prominent class of machine learning algorithms, aim to identify and precisely locate objects in images or videos. However, this task might yield uneven performances sometimes caused by the objects sizes and the quality of the images and labels used for training. In this paper, we highlight the importance of large objects in learning features that are critical for all sizes. Given these findings, we propose to introduce a weighting term into the training loss. This term is a function of the object area size. We show that giving more weight to large objects leads to improved detection scores across all object sizes and so an overall improvement in Object Detectors performances (+2 p.p. of mAP on small objects, +2 p.p. on medium and +4 p.p. on large on COCO val 2017 with InternImage-T). Additional experiments and ablation studies with different models and on a different dataset further confirm the robustness of our findings",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce $\\textbf{GS-SLAM}$ that first utilizes 3D Gaussian representation in the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) system. It facilitates a better balance between efficiency and accuracy. Compared to recent SLAM methods employing neural implicit representations, our method utilizes a real-time differentiable splatting rendering pipeline that offers significant speedup to map optimization and RGB-D re-rendering. Specifically, we propose an adaptive expansion strategy that adds new or deletes noisy 3D Gaussian in order to efficiently reconstruct new observed scene geometry and improve the mapping of previously observed areas. This strategy is essential to extend 3D Gaussian representation to reconstruct the whole scene rather than synthesize a static object in existing methods. Moreover, in the pose tracking process, an effective coarse-to-fine technique is designed to select reliable 3D Gaussian representations to optimize camera pose, resulting in runtime reduction and robust estimation. Our method achieves competitive performance compared with existing state-of-the-art real-time methods on the Replica, TUM-RGBD datasets. The source code will be released soon",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel framework termed Cut-and-Paste for real-word semantic video editing under the guidance of text prompt and additional reference image. While the text-driven video editing has demonstrated remarkable ability to generate highly diverse videos following given text prompts, the fine-grained semantic edits are hard to control by plain textual prompt only in terms of object details and edited region, and cumbersome long text descriptions are usually needed for the task. We therefore investigate subject-driven video editing for more precise control of both edited regions and background preservation, and fine-grained semantic generation. We achieve this goal by introducing an reference image as supplementary input to the text-driven video editing, which avoids racking your brain to come up with a cumbersome text prompt describing the detailed appearance of the object. To limit the editing area, we refer to a method of cross attention control in image editing and successfully extend it to video editing by fusing the attention map of adjacent frames, which strikes a balance between maintaining video background and spatio-temporal consistency. Compared with current methods, the whole process of our method is like ``cut\" the source object to be edited and then ``paste\" the target object provided by reference image. We demonstrate that our method performs favorably over prior arts for video editing under the guidance of text prompt and extra reference image, as measured by both quantitative and subjective evaluations",

    "abstract": "The generalization capability of existing image restoration and enhancement (IRE) methods is constrained by the limited pre-trained datasets, making it difficult to handle agnostic inputs such as different degradation levels and scenarios beyond their design scopes. Moreover, they are not equipped with interactive mechanisms to consider user preferences or feedback, and their end-to-end settings cannot provide users with more choices. Faced with the above-mentioned IRE method's limited performance and insufficient interactivity, we try to solve it from the engineering and system framework levels. Specifically, we propose Clarity ChatGPT-a transformative system that combines the conversational intelligence of ChatGPT with multiple IRE methods. Clarity ChatGPT can automatically detect image degradation types and select appropriate IRE methods to restore images, or iteratively generate satisfactory results based on user feedback. Its innovative features include a CLIP-powered detector for accurate degradation classification, no-reference image quality evaluation for performance evaluation, region-specific processing for precise enhancements, and advanced fusion techniques for optimal restoration results. Clarity ChatGPT marks a significant advancement in integrating language and vision, enhancing image-text interactions, and providing a robust, high-performance IRE solution. Our case studies demonstrate that Clarity ChatGPT effectively improves the generalization and interaction capabilities in the IRE, and also fills the gap in the low-level domain of the existing vision-language model",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Annotation scarcity has become a major obstacle for training powerful deep-learning models for medical image segmentation, restricting their deployment in clinical scenarios. To address it, semi-supervised learning by exploiting abundant unlabeled data is highly desirable to boost the model training. However, most existing works still focus on limited medical tasks and underestimate the potential of learning across diverse tasks and multiple datasets. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a \\textbf{Ver}satile \\textbf{Semi}-supervised framework (VerSemi) to point out a new perspective that integrates various tasks into a unified model with a broad label space, to exploit more unlabeled data for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Specifically, we introduce a dynamic task-prompted design to segment various targets from different datasets. Next, this unified model is used to identify the foreground regions from all labeled data, to capture cross-dataset semantics. Particularly, we create a synthetic task with a cutmix strategy to augment foreground targets within the expanded label space. To effectively utilize unlabeled data, we introduce a consistency constraint. This involves aligning aggregated predictions from various tasks with those from the synthetic task, further guiding the model in accurately segmenting foreground regions during training. We evaluated our VerSemi model on four public benchmarking datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrated that VerSemi can consistently outperform the second-best method by a large margin (e.g., an average 2.69\\% Dice gain on four datasets), setting new SOTA performance for semi-supervised medical image segmentation.

Existing methods mainly process video data where the time dimension mingles with the space and channel dimensions from three distinct angles: as a sequence of individual frames, as a 3D volume in spatiotemporal coordinates, or as a stacked image where frames are treated as separate channels. Most of them generally focus on one of these perspectives and may fail to fully exploit the relationships across different dimensions. To address this issue, this paper introduces a convolutional mixer for video prediction, termed ViP-Mixer, to model the spatiotemporal evolution in the latent space of an autoencoder. The ViP-Mixers are stacked sequentially and interleave feature mixing at three levels: frames, channels, and locations.

Therefore, we propose a new framework named Multi-Scale Patch Message Passing Swin Transformer for multi-class retinal disease classification. Specifically, we design a Patch Message Passing (PMP) module based on the Message Passing mechanism to establish global interaction for pathological semantic features and to exploit the subtle differences further between different diseases. Moreover, considering the various scale of pathological features we integrate multiple PMP modules for different patch sizes. For evaluation, we have constructed a new dataset, named OPTOS dataset, consisting of 1,033 high-resolution fundus images photographed by Optos camera and conducted comprehensive experiments to validate the efficacy of our proposed method.

    "title": "ODDR: Outlier Detection & Dimension Reduction Based Defense Against Adversarial Patches",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Adversarial attacks are a major deterrent towards the reliable use of machine learning models. A powerful type of adversarial attacks is the patch-based attack, wherein the adversarial perturbations modify localized patches or specific areas within the images to deceive the trained machine learning model. In this paper, we introduce Outlier Detection and Dimension Reduction (ODDR), a holistic defense mechanism designed to effectively mitigate patch-based adversarial attacks. In our approach, we posit that input features corresponding to adversarial patches, whether naturalistic or otherwise, deviate from the inherent distribution of the remaining image sample and can be identified as outliers or anomalies. ODDR employs a three-stage pipeline: Fragmentation, Segregation, and Neutralization, providing a model-agnostic solution applicable to both image classification and object detection tasks. The Fragmentation stage parses the samples into chunks for the subsequent Segregation process. Here, outlier detection techniques identify and segregate the anomalous features associated with adversarial perturbations. The Neutralization stage utilizes dimension reduction methods on the outliers to mitigate the impact of adversarial perturbations without sacrificing pertinent information necessary for the machine learning task. Extensive testing on benchmark datasets and state-of-the-art adversarial patches demonstrates the effectiveness of ODDR. Results indicate robust accuracies matching and lying within a small range of clean accuracies (1%-3% for classification and 3%-5% for object detection), with only a marginal compromise of 1%-2% in performance on clean samples, thereby significantly outperforming other defenses",

    "abstract": "Towards holistic understanding of 3D scenes, a general 3D segmentation method is needed that can segment diverse objects without restrictions on object quantity or categories, while also reflecting the inherent hierarchical structure. To achieve this, we propose OmniSeg3D, an omniversal segmentation method aims for segmenting anything in 3D all at once. The key insight is to lift multi-view inconsistent 2D segmentations into a consistent 3D feature field through a hierarchical contrastive learning framework, which is accomplished by two steps. Firstly, we design a novel hierarchical representation based on category-agnostic 2D segmentations to model the multi-level relationship among pixels. Secondly, image features rendered from the 3D feature field are clustered at different levels, which can be further drawn closer or pushed apart according to the hierarchical relationship between different levels. In tackling the challenges posed by inconsistent 2D segmentations, this framework yields a global consistent 3D feature field, which further enables hierarchical segmentation, multi-object selection, and global discretization. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on high-quality 3D segmentation and accurate hierarchical structure understanding.

These pansharpened images enhance precision in land cover classification, change detection, and environmental monitoring within remote sensing data analysis. While deep learning techniques have shown significant success in pansharpening, existing methods often face limitations in their evaluation, focusing on restricted satellite data sources, single scene types, and low-resolution images. This paper addresses this gap by introducing PanBench, a high-resolution multi-scene dataset containing all mainstream satellites and comprising 5,898 pairs of samples. Each pair includes a four-channel (RGB + near-infrared) multispectral image of 256x256 pixels and a mono-channel panchromatic image of 1,024x1,024 pixels.

    "abstract": "Recovering temporally consistent 3D human body pose, shape and motion from a monocular video is a challenging task due to (self-)occlusions, poor lighting conditions, complex articulated body poses, depth ambiguity, and limited availability of annotated data. Further, doing a simple perframe estimation is insufficient as it leads to jittery and implausible results. In this paper, we propose a novel method for temporally consistent motion estimation from a monocular video. Instead of using generic ResNet-like features, our method uses a body-aware feature representation and an independent per-frame pose and camera initialization over a temporal window followed by a novel spatio-temporal feature aggregation by using a combination of self-similarity and self-attention over the body-aware features and the perframe initialization. Together, they yield enhanced spatiotemporal context for every frame by considering remaining past and future frames. These features are used to predict the pose and shape parameters of the human body model, which are further refined using an LSTM. Experimental results on the publicly available benchmark data show that our method attains significantly lower acceleration error and outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods over all key quantitative evaluation metrics, including complex scenarios like partial occlusion, complex poses and even relatively low illumination",

    "abstract": "The rapidly emerging field of deep learning-based computational pathology has shown promising results in utilizing whole slide images (WSIs) to objectively prognosticate cancer patients. However, most prognostic methods are currently limited to either histopathology or genomics alone, which inevitably reduces their potential to accurately predict patient prognosis. Whereas integrating WSIs and genomic features presents three main challenges: (1) the enormous heterogeneity of gigapixel WSIs which can reach sizes as large as 150,000x150,000 pixels; (2) the absence of a spatially corresponding relationship between histopathology images and genomic molecular data; and (3) the existing early, late, and intermediate multimodal feature fusion strategies struggle to capture the explicit interactions between WSIs and genomics. To ameliorate these issues, we propose the Mutual-Guided Cross-Modality Transformer (MGCT), a weakly-supervised, attention-based multimodal learning framework that can combine histology features and genomic features to model the genotype-phenotype interactions within the tumor microenvironment. To validate the effectiveness of MGCT, we conduct experiments using nearly 3,600 gigapixel WSIs across five different cancer types sourced from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).

In this paper, we consider open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) in aerial images that enables the characterization of new objects beyond training categories on the earth surface without annotating training images for these new categories. The performance of OVD depends on the quality of class-agnostic region proposals and pseudo-labels that can generalize well to novel object categories. To simultaneously generate high-quality proposals and pseudo-labels, we propose CastDet, a CLIP-activated student-teacher open-vocabulary object Detection framework. Our end-to-end framework within the student-teacher mechanism employs the CLIP model as an extra omniscient teacher of rich knowledge into the student-teacher self-learning process. By doing so, our approach boosts novel object proposals and classification. Furthermore, we design a dynamic label queue technique to maintain high-quality pseudo labels during batch training and mitigate label imbalance. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple existing aerial object detection datasets, which are set up for the OVD task. Experimental results demonstrate our CastDet achieving superior open-vocabulary detection performance, e.g., reaching 40.0 HM (Harmonic Mean), which outperforms previous methods Detic/ViLD by 26.9/21.1 on the VisDroneZSD dataset",

    "abstract": "Illumination degradation image restoration (IDIR) techniques aim to improve the visibility of degraded images and mitigate the adverse effects of deteriorated illumination. Among these algorithms, diffusion model (DM)-based methods have shown promising performance but are often burdened by heavy computational demands and pixel misalignment issues when predicting the image-level distribution. To tackle these problems, we propose to leverage DM within a compact latent space to generate concise guidance priors and introduce a novel solution called Reti-Diff for the IDIR task. Reti-Diff comprises two key components: the Retinex-based latent DM (RLDM) and the Retinex-guided transformer (RGformer). To ensure detailed reconstruction and illumination correction, RLDM is empowered to acquire Retinex knowledge and extract reflectance and illumination priors. These priors are subsequently utilized by RGformer to guide the decomposition of image features into their respective reflectance and illumination components. Following this, RGformer further enhances and consolidates the decomposed features, resulting in the production of refined images with consistent content and robustness to handle complex degradation scenarios. Extensive experiments show that Reti-Diff outperforms existing methods on three IDIR tasks, as well as downstream applications.

    "title": "Energy efficiency in Edge TPU vs. embedded GPU for computer-aided medical imaging segmentation and classification",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In this work, we evaluate the energy usage of fully embedded medical diagnosis aids based on both segmentation and classification of medical images implemented on Edge TPU and embedded GPU processors. We use glaucoma diagnosis based on color fundus images as an example to show the possibility of performing segmentation and classification in real time on embedded boards and to highlight the different energy requirements of the studied implementations. Several other works develop the use of segmentation and feature extraction techniques to detect glaucoma, among many other pathologies, with deep neural networks. Memory limitations and low processing capabilities of embedded accelerated systems (EAS) limit their use for deep network-based system training. However, including specific acceleration hardware, such as NVIDIA's Maxwell GPU or Google's Edge TPU, enables them to perform inferences using complex pre-trained networks in very reasonable times. In this study, we evaluate the timing and energy performance of two EAS equipped with Machine Learning (ML) accelerators executing an example diagnostic tool developed in a previous work. For optic disc (OD) and cup (OC) segmentation, the obtained prediction times per image are under 29 and 43 ms using Edge TPUs and Maxwell GPUs, respectively. Prediction times for the classification subsystem are lower than 10 and 14 ms for Edge TPUs and Maxwell GPUs, respectively. Regarding energy usage, in approximate terms, for OD segmentation Edge TPUs and Maxwell GPUs use 38 and 190 mJ per image, respectively. For fundus classification, Edge TPUs and Maxwell GPUs use 45 and 70 mJ, respectively",

    "abstract": "Counterfactual reasoning is often used in a clinical setting to explain decisions or weigh alternatives. Therefore, for imaging based modalities such as ophthalmology, it would be beneficial to be able to create counterfactual images, illustrating the answer to the question: \"If the subject had had diabetic retinopathy, how would the fundus image have looked?\" Here, we demonstrate that using a diffusion model in combination with an adversarially robust classifier trained on retinal disease classification tasks enables generation of highly realistic counterfactuals of retinal fundus images and optical coherence tomorgraphy (OCT) B-scans. Ideally, these classifiers encode the salient features indicative for each disease class and can steer the diffusion model to show realistic disease signs or remove disease-related lesions in a realistic way. Importantly, in a user study, domain experts found the counterfactuals generated using our method significantly more realistic than counterfactuals generated from a previous method, and even indistiguishable from realistic images",

In contrast to alternative implicit approaches, the oriented points representation not only provides a more intuitive way to model human avatar animation but also significantly reduces both training and inference time. Moreover, we propose a novel method to transfer semantic information from the SMPL-X model to the points, which enables to better understand human body movements.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Visual geolocalization is a cost-effective and scalable task that involves matching one or more query images, taken at some unknown location, to a set of geo-tagged reference images. Existing methods, devoted to semantic features representation, evolving towards robustness to a wide variety between query and reference, including illumination and viewpoint changes, as well as scale and seasonal variations. However, practical visual geolocalization approaches need to be robust in appearance changing and extreme viewpoint variation conditions, while providing accurate global location estimates. Therefore, inspired by curriculum design, human learn general knowledge first and then delve into professional expertise. We first recognize semantic scene and then measure geometric structure. Our approach, termed CurriculumLoc, involves a delicate design of multi-stage refinement pipeline and a novel keypoint detection and description with global semantic awareness and local geometric verification. We rerank candidates and solve a particular cross-domain perspective-n-point (PnP) problem based on these keypoints and corresponding descriptors, position refinement occurs incrementally. The extensive experimental results on our collected dataset, TerraTrack and a benchmark dataset, ALTO, demonstrate that our approach results in the aforementioned desirable characteristics of a practical visual geolocalization solution. Additionally, we achieve new high recall@1 scores of 62.6% and 94.5% on ALTO, with two different distances metrics, respectively.

    "title": "A Multi-In-Single-Out Network for Video Frame Interpolation without Optical Flow",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In general, deep learning-based video frame interpolation (VFI) methods have predominantly focused on estimating motion vectors between two input frames and warping them to the target time. While this approach has shown impressive performance for linear motion between two input frames, it exhibits limitations when dealing with occlusions and nonlinear movements. Recently, generative models have been applied to VFI to address these issues. However, as VFI is not a task focused on generating plausible images, but rather on predicting accurate intermediate frames between two given frames, performance limitations still persist. In this paper, we propose a multi-in-single-out (MISO) based VFI method that does not rely on motion vector estimation, allowing it to effectively model occlusions and nonlinear motion. Additionally, we introduce a novel motion perceptual loss that enables MISO-VFI to better capture the spatio-temporal correlations within the video frames. Our MISO-VFI method achieves state-of-the-art results on VFI benchmarks Vimeo90K, Middlebury, and UCF101, with a significant performance gap compared to existing approaches",

    "title": "Deep Equilibrium Diffusion Restoration with Parallel Sampling",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Diffusion-based image restoration (IR) methods aim to use diffusion models to recover high-quality (HQ) images from degraded images and achieve promising performance. Due to the inherent property of diffusion models, most of these methods need long serial sampling chains to restore HQ images step-by-step. As a result, it leads to expensive sampling time and high computation costs. Moreover, such long sampling chains hinder understanding the relationship between the restoration results and the inputs since it is hard to compute the gradients in the whole chains. In this work, we aim to rethink the diffusion-based IR models through a different perspective, i.e., a deep equilibrium (DEQ) fixed point system. Specifically, we derive an analytical solution by modeling the entire sampling chain in diffusion-based IR models as a joint multivariate fixed point system. With the help of the analytical solution, we are able to conduct single-image sampling in a parallel way and restore HQ images without training. Furthermore, we compute fast gradients in DEQ and found that initialization optimization can boost performance and control the generation direction. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method on typical IR tasks and real-world settings. The code and models will be made publicly available",

    "title": "Predicting urban tree cover from incomplete point labels and limited background information",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Trees inside cities are important for the urban microclimate, contributing positively to the physical and mental health of the urban dwellers. Despite their importance, often only limited information about city trees is available. Therefore in this paper, we propose a method for mapping urban trees in high-resolution aerial imagery using limited datasets and deep learning. Deep learning has become best-practice for this task, however, existing approaches rely on large and accurately labelled training datasets, which can be difficult and expensive to obtain. However, often noisy and incomplete data may be available that can be combined and utilized to solve more difficult tasks than those datasets were intended for. This paper studies how to combine accurate point labels of urban trees along streets with crowd-sourced annotations from an open geographic database to delineate city trees in remote sensing images, a task which is challenging even for humans. To that end, we perform semantic segmentation of very high resolution aerial imagery using a fully convolutional neural network. The main challenge is that our segmentation maps are sparsely annotated and incomplete. Small areas around the point labels of the street trees coming from official and crowd-sourced data are marked as foreground class. Crowd-sourced annotations of streets, buildings, etc. define the background class. Since the tree data is incomplete, we introduce a masking to avoid class confusion. Our experiments in Hamburg, Germany, showed that the system is able to produce tree cover maps, not limited to trees along streets, without providing tree delineations. We evaluated the method on manually labelled trees and show that performance drastically deteriorates if the open geographic database is not used",

    "title": "FreeKD: Knowledge Distillation via Semantic Frequency Prompt",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Knowledge distillation (KD) has been applied to various tasks successfully, and mainstream methods typically boost the student model via spatial imitation losses. However, the consecutive downsamplings induced in the spatial domain of teacher model is a type of corruption, hindering the student from analyzing what specific information needs to be imitated, which results in accuracy degradation. To better understand the underlying pattern of corrupted feature maps, we shift our attention to the frequency domain. During frequency distillation, we encounter a new challenge: the low-frequency bands convey general but minimal context, while the high are more informative but also introduce noise. Not each pixel within the frequency bands contributes equally to the performance. To address the above problem: (1) We propose the Frequency Prompt plugged into the teacher model, absorbing the semantic frequency context during finetuning. (2) During the distillation period, a pixel-wise frequency mask is generated via Frequency Prompt, to localize those pixel of interests (PoIs) in various frequency bands. Additionally, we employ a position-aware relational frequency loss for dense prediction tasks, delivering a high-order spatial enhancement to the student model. We dub our Frequency Knowledge Distillation method as FreeKD, which determines the optimal localization and extent for the frequency distillation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FreeKD not only outperforms spatial-based distillation methods consistently on dense prediction tasks (e.g., FreeKD brings 3.8 AP gains for RepPoints-R50 on COCO2017 and 4.55 mIoU gains for PSPNet-R18 on Cityscapes), but also conveys more robustness to the student. Notably, we also validate the generalization of our approach on large-scale vision models (e.g., DINO and SAM)",

    "title": "Advancing Urban Renewal: An Automated Approach to Generating Historical Arcade Facades with Stable Diffusion Models",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Urban renewal and transformation processes necessitate the preservation of the historical urban fabric, particularly in districts known for their architectural and historical significance. These regions, with their diverse architectural styles, have traditionally required extensive preliminary research, often leading to subjective results. However, the advent of machine learning models has opened up new avenues for generating building facade images. Despite this, creating high-quality images for historical district renovations remains challenging, due to the complexity and diversity inherent in such districts. In response to these challenges, our study introduces a new methodology for automatically generating images of historical arcade facades, utilizing Stable Diffusion models conditioned on textual descriptions. By classifying and tagging a variety of arcade styles, we have constructed several realistic arcade facade image datasets. We trained multiple low-rank adaptation (LoRA) models to control the stylistic aspects of the generated images, supplemented by ControlNet models for improved precision and authenticity. Our approach has demonstrated high levels of precision, authenticity, and diversity in the generated images, showing promising potential for real-world urban renewal projects. This new methodology offers a more efficient and accurate alternative to conventional design processes in urban renewal, bypassing issues of unconvincing image details, lack of precision, and limited stylistic variety. Future research could focus on integrating this two-dimensional image generation with three-dimensional modeling techniques, providing a more comprehensive solution for renovating architectural facades in historical districts",

    "title": "AKConv: Convolutional Kernel with Arbitrary Sampled Shapes and Arbitrary Number of Parameters",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Neural networks based on convolutional operations have achieved remarkable results in the field of deep learning, but there are two inherent flaws in standard convolutional operations. On the one hand, the convolution operation be confined to a local window and cannot capture information from other locations, and its sampled shapes is fixed. On the other hand, the size of the convolutional kernel is fixed to k $\\times$ k, which is a fixed square shape, and the number of parameters tends to grow squarely with size. It is obvious that the shape and size of targets are various in different datasets and at different locations. Convolutional kernels with fixed sample shapes and squares do not adapt well to changing targets. In response to the above questions, the Alterable Kernel Convolution (AKConv) is explored in this work, which gives the convolution kernel an arbitrary number of parameters and arbitrary sampled shapes to provide richer options for the trade-off between network overhead and performance. In AKConv, we define initial positions for convolutional kernels of arbitrary size by means of a new coordinate generation algorithm. To adapt to changes for targets, we introduce offsets to adjust the shape of the samples at each position. Moreover, we explore the effect of the neural network by using the AKConv with the same size and different initial sampled shapes. AKConv completes the process of efficient feature extraction by irregular convolutional operations and brings more exploration options for convolutional sampling shapes. Object detection experiments on representative datasets COCO2017, VOC 7+12 and VisDrone-DET2021 fully demonstrate the advantages of AKConv. AKConv can be used as a plug-and-play convolutional operation to replace convolutional operations to improve network performance.

    "abstract": "Recently, there has been an upsurge in the research on maritime vision, where a lot of works are influenced by the application of computer vision for Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs). Various sensor modalities such as camera, radar, and lidar have been used to perform tasks such as object detection, segmentation, object tracking, and motion planning. A large subset of this research is focused on the video analysis, since most of the current vessel fleets contain the camera's onboard for various surveillance tasks. Due to the vast abundance of the video data, video scene change detection is an initial and crucial stage for scene understanding of USVs. This paper outlines our approach to detect dynamic scene changes in USVs. To the best of our understanding, this work represents the first investigation of scene change detection in the maritime vision application. Our objective is to identify significant changes in the dynamic scenes of maritime video data, particularly those scenes that exhibit a high degree of resemblance. In our system for dynamic scene change detection, we propose completely unsupervised learning method. In contrast to earlier studies, we utilize a modified cutting-edge generative picture model called VQ-VAE-2 to train on multiple marine datasets, aiming to enhance the feature extraction. Next, we introduce our innovative similarity scoring technique for directly calculating the level of similarity in a sequence of consecutive frames by utilizing grid calculation on retrieved features.

    "abstract": "The crossMoDA2023 challenge aims to segment the vestibular schwannoma (sub-divided into intra- and extra-meatal components) and cochlea regions of unlabeled hrT2 scans by leveraging labeled ceT1 scans. In this work, we proposed a 3D multi-style cross-modality segmentation framework for the crossMoDA2023 challenge, including the multi-style translation and self-training segmentation phases. Considering heterogeneous distributions and various image sizes in multi-institutional scans, we first utilize the min-max normalization, voxel size resampling, and center cropping to obtain fixed-size sub-volumes from ceT1 and hrT2 scans for training. Then, we perform the multi-style image translation phase to overcome the intensity distribution discrepancy between unpaired multi-modal scans. Specifically, we design three different translation networks with 2D or 2.5D inputs to generate multi-style and realistic target-like volumes from labeled ceT1 volumes. Finally, we perform the self-training volumetric segmentation phase in the target domain, which employs the nnU-Net framework and iterative self-training method using pseudo-labels for training accurate segmentation models in the unlabeled target domain. On the crossMoDA2023 validation dataset, our method produces promising results and achieves the mean DSC values of 72.78% and 80.64% and ASSD values of 5.85 mm and 0.25 mm for VS tumor and cochlea regions, respectively.

Current works have significantly advanced the problem in terms of model and data. However, the overall performance of most FSOD methods still does not fulfill the desired accuracy. In this paper we improve the FSOD model to address the severe issue of sample imbalance and weak feature propagation. To alleviate modeling bias from data-sufficient base classes, we examine the effect of decoupling the parameters for classes with sufficient data and classes with few samples in various ways. We design a base-novel categories decoupled DETR (DeDETR) for FSOD. We also explore various types of skip connection between the encoder and decoder for DETR. Besides, we notice that the best outputs could come from the intermediate layer of the decoder instead of the last layer; therefore, we build a unified decoder module that could dynamically fuse the decoder layers as the output feature. We evaluate our model on commonly used datasets such as PASCAL VOC and MSCOCO.

    "abstract": "Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly prominent in the field of artificial intelligence. These models not only excel in traditional vision-language tasks but also demonstrate impressive performance in contemporary multi-modal benchmarks. Although many of these benchmarks attempt to holistically evaluate MLLMs, they typically concentrate on basic reasoning tasks, often yielding only simple yes/no or multi-choice responses. These methods naturally lead to confusion and difficulties in conclusively determining the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. To mitigate this issue, we manually curate a benchmark dataset specifically designed for MLLMs, with a focus on complex reasoning tasks. Our benchmark comprises three key reasoning categories: deductive, abductive, and analogical reasoning. The queries in our dataset are intentionally constructed to engage the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs in the process of generating answers. For a fair comparison across various MLLMs, we incorporate intermediate reasoning steps into our evaluation criteria. In instances where an MLLM is unable to produce a definitive answer, its reasoning ability is evaluated by requesting intermediate reasoning steps. If these steps align with our manual annotations, appropriate scores are assigned. This evaluation scheme resembles methods commonly used in human assessments, such as exams or assignments, and represents what we consider a more effective assessment technique compared with existing benchmarks. We evaluate a selection of representative MLLMs using this rigorously developed open-ended multi-step elaborate reasoning benchmark, designed to challenge and accurately measure their reasoning capabilities.

    "title": "Unearthing Common Inconsistency for Generalisable Deepfake Detection",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Deepfake has emerged for several years, yet efficient detection techniques could generalize over different manipulation methods require further research. While current image-level detection method fails to generalize to unseen domains, owing to the domain-shift phenomenon brought by CNN's strong inductive bias towards Deepfake texture, video-level one shows its potential to have both generalization across multiple domains and robustness to compression. We argue that although distinct face manipulation tools have different inherent bias, they all disrupt the consistency between frames, which is a natural characteristic shared by authentic videos. Inspired by this, we proposed a detection approach by capturing frame inconsistency that broadly exists in different forgery techniques, termed unearthing-common-inconsistency (UCI). Concretely, the UCI network based on self-supervised contrastive learning can better distinguish temporal consistency between real and fake videos from multiple domains. We introduced a temporally-preserved module method to introduce spatial noise perturbations, directing the model's attention towards temporal information. Subsequently, leveraging a multi-view cross-correlation learning module, we extensively learn the disparities in temporal representations between genuine and fake samples.

    "title": "Efficient Model Agnostic Approach for Implicit Neural Representation Based Arbitrary-Scale Image Super-Resolution",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Single image super-resolution (SISR) has experienced significant advancements, primarily driven by deep convolutional networks. Traditional networks, however, are limited to upscaling images to a fixed scale, leading to the utilization of implicit neural functions for generating arbitrarily scaled images. Nevertheless, these methodologies have imposed substantial computational demands as they involve querying every target pixel to a single resource-intensive decoder. In this paper, we introduce a novel and efficient framework, the Mixture of Experts Implicit Super-Resolution (MoEISR), which enables super-resolution at arbitrary scales with significantly increased computational efficiency without sacrificing reconstruction quality. MoEISR dynamically allocates the most suitable decoding expert to each pixel using a lightweight mapper module, allowing experts with varying capacities to reconstruct pixels across regions with diverse complexities. Our experiments demonstrate that MoEISR successfully reduces up to 73% in floating point operations (FLOPs) while delivering comparable or superior peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR)",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a self-supervised learning framework designed for pre-training neural networks tailored to dense prediction tasks using event camera data. Our approach utilizes solely event data for training. Transferring achievements from dense RGB pre-training directly to event camera data yields subpar performance. This is attributed to the spatial sparsity inherent in an event image (converted from event data), where many pixels do not contain information. To mitigate this sparsity issue, we encode an event image into event patch features, automatically mine contextual similarity relationships among patches, group the patch features into distinctive contexts, and enforce context-to-context similarities to learn discriminative event features. For training our framework, we curate a synthetic event camera dataset featuring diverse scene and motion patterns. Transfer learning performance on downstream dense prediction tasks illustrates the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art approaches.

    "title": "Generalized Category Discovery in Semantic Segmentation",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "This paper explores a novel setting called Generalized Category Discovery in Semantic Segmentation (GCDSS), aiming to segment unlabeled images given prior knowledge from a labeled set of base classes. The unlabeled images contain pixels of the base class or novel class. In contrast to Novel Category Discovery in Semantic Segmentation (NCDSS), there is no prerequisite for prior knowledge mandating the existence of at least one novel class in each unlabeled image. Besides, we broaden the segmentation scope beyond foreground objects to include the entire image. Existing NCDSS methods rely on the aforementioned priors, making them challenging to truly apply in real-world situations. We propose a straightforward yet effective framework that reinterprets the GCDSS challenge as a task of mask classification. Additionally, we construct a baseline method and introduce the Neighborhood Relations-Guided Mask Clustering Algorithm (NeRG-MaskCA) for mask categorization to address the fragmentation in semantic representation. A benchmark dataset, Cityscapes-GCD, derived from the Cityscapes dataset, is established to evaluate the GCDSS framework. Our method demonstrates the feasibility of the GCDSS problem and the potential for discovering and segmenting novel object classes in unlabeled images. We employ the generated pseudo-labels from our approach as ground truth to supervise the training of other models, thereby enabling them with the ability to segment novel classes. It paves the way for further research in generalized category discovery, broadening the horizons of semantic segmentation and its applications.

    "abstract": "In recent days, Deep Learning (DL) techniques have become an emerging transformation in the field of machine learning, artificial intelligence, computer vision, and so on. Subsequently, researchers and industries have been highly endorsed in the medical field, predicting and controlling diverse diseases at specific intervals. Liver tumor prediction is a vital chore in analyzing and treating liver diseases. This paper proposes a novel approach for predicting liver tumors using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and a depth-based variant search algorithm with advanced attention mechanisms (CNN-DS-AM). The proposed work aims to improve accuracy and robustness in diagnosing and treating liver diseases. The anticipated model is assessed on a Computed Tomography (CT) scan dataset containing both benign and malignant liver tumors. The proposed approach achieved high accuracy in predicting liver tumors, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, advanced attention mechanisms were incorporated into the CNN model to enable the identification and highlighting of regions of the CT scans most relevant to predicting liver tumors. The results suggest that incorporating attention mechanisms and a depth-based variant search algorithm into the CNN model is a promising approach for improving the accuracy and robustness of liver tumor prediction.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic make people wear masks more frequently than ever. Current general face recognition system suffers from serious performance degradation,when encountering occluded scenes. The potential reason is that face features are corrupted by occlusions on key facial regions. To tackle this problem, previous works either extract identity-related embeddings on feature level by additional mask prediction, or restore the occluded facial part by generative models. However, the former lacks visual results for model interpretation, while the latter suffers from artifacts which may affect downstream recognition. Therefore, this paper proposes a Multi-task gEnerative mask dEcoupling face Recognition (MEER) network to jointly handle these two tasks, which can learn occlusionirrelevant and identity-related representation while achieving unmasked face synthesis. We first present a novel mask decoupling module to disentangle mask and identity information, which makes the network obtain purer identity features from visible facial components. Then, an unmasked face is restored by a joint-training strategy, which will be further used to refine the recognition network with an id-preserving loss. Experiments on masked face recognition under realistic and synthetic occlusions benchmarks demonstrate that the MEER can outperform the state-ofthe-art methods",

    "abstract": "Studying backdoor attacks is valuable for model copyright protection and enhancing defenses. While existing backdoor attacks have successfully infected multimodal contrastive learning models such as CLIP, they can be easily countered by specialized backdoor defenses for MCL models. This paper reveals the threats in this practical scenario that backdoor attacks can remain effective even after defenses and introduces the \\emph{\\toolns} attack, which is resistant to backdoor detection and model fine-tuning defenses. To achieve this, we draw motivations from the perspective of the Bayesian rule and propose a dual-embedding guided framework for backdoor attacks. Specifically, we ensure that visual trigger patterns approximate the textual target semantics in the embedding space, making it challenging to detect the subtle parameter variations induced by backdoor learning on such natural trigger patterns. Additionally, we optimize the visual trigger patterns to align the poisoned samples with target vision features in order to hinder the backdoor unlearning through clean fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our attack significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines (+45.3% ASR) in the presence of SoTA backdoor defenses, rendering these mitigation and detection strategies virtually ineffective. Furthermore, our approach effectively attacks some more rigorous scenarios like downstream tasks. We believe that this paper raises awareness regarding the potential threats associated with the practical application of multimodal contrastive learning and encourages the development of more robust defense mechanisms",

    "abstract": "In semiconductor manufacturing, lithography has often been the manufacturing step defining the smallest possible pattern dimensions. In recent years, progress has been made towards high-NA (Numerical Aperture) EUVL (Extreme-Ultraviolet-Lithography) paradigm, which promises to advance pattern shrinking (2 nm node and beyond). However, a significant increase in stochastic defects and the complexity of defect detection becomes more pronounced with high-NA. Present defect inspection techniques (both non-machine learning and machine learning based), fail to achieve satisfactory performance at high-NA dimensions. In this work, we investigate the use of the Slicing Aided Hyper Inference (SAHI) framework for improving upon current techniques. Using SAHI, inference is performed on size-increased slices of the SEM images. This leads to the object detector's receptive field being more effective in capturing small defect instances. First, the performance on previously investigated semiconductor datasets is benchmarked across various configurations, and the SAHI approach is demonstrated to substantially enhance the detection of small defects, by approx. 2x. Afterwards, we also demonstrated application of SAHI leads to flawless detection rates on a new test dataset, with scenarios not encountered during training, whereas previous trained models failed. Finally, we formulate an extension of SAHI that does not significantly reduce true-positive predictions while eliminating false-positive predictions",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Continual Learning (CL) allows applications such as user personalization and household robots to learn on the fly and adapt to context. This is an important feature when context, actions, and users change. However, enabling CL on resource-constrained embedded systems is challenging due to the limited labeled data, memory, and computing capacity. In this paper, we propose LifeLearner, a hardware-aware meta continual learning system that drastically optimizes system resources (lower memory, latency, energy consumption) while ensuring high accuracy. Specifically, we (1) exploit meta-learning and rehearsal strategies to explicitly cope with data scarcity issues and ensure high accuracy, (2) effectively combine lossless and lossy compression to significantly reduce the resource requirements of CL and rehearsal samples, and (3) developed hardware-aware system on embedded and IoT platforms considering the hardware characteristics. As a result, LifeLearner achieves near-optimal CL performance, falling short by only 2.8% on accuracy compared to an Oracle baseline. With respect to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) Meta CL method, LifeLearner drastically reduces the memory footprint (by 178.7x), end-to-end latency by 80.8-94.2%, and energy consumption by 80.9-94.2%. In addition, we successfully deployed LifeLearner on two edge devices and a microcontroller unit, thereby enabling efficient CL on resource-constrained platforms where it would be impractical to run SOTA methods and the far-reaching deployment of adaptable CL in a ubiquitous manner.

DiffSCI leverages the structural insights from the deep prior and optimization-based methodologies, complemented by the generative capabilities offered by the contemporary denoising diffusion model. Specifically, firstly, we employ a pre-trained diffusion model, which has been trained on a substantial corpus of RGB images, as the generative denoiser within the Plug-and-Play framework for the first time. This integration allows for the successful completion of SCI reconstruction, especially in the case that current methods struggle to address effectively. Secondly, we systematically account for spectral band correlations and introduce a robust methodology to mitigate wavelength mismatch, thus enabling seamless adaptation of the RGB diffusion model to MSIs. Thirdly, an accelerated algorithm is implemented to expedite the resolution of the data subproblem. This augmentation not only accelerates the convergence rate but also elevates the quality of the reconstruction process.

Nevertheless, current diffusion models have limited success in achieving faithful image translations that can accurately preserve the anatomical structures of medical images, especially for unpaired datasets. The preservation of structural and anatomical details is essential to reliable medical diagnosis and treatment planning, as structural mismatches can lead to disease misidentification and treatment errors. In this study, we introduced a frequency-decoupled diffusion model (FDDM), a novel framework that decouples the frequency components of medical images in the Fourier domain during the translation process, to allow structure-preserved high-quality image conversion. FDDM applies an unsupervised frequency conversion module to translate the source medical images into frequency-specific outputs and then uses the frequency-specific information to guide a following diffusion model for final source-to-target image translation. We conducted extensive evaluations of FDDM using a public brain MR-to-CT translation dataset, showing its superior performance against other GAN-, VAE-, and diffusion-based models. Metrics including the Frechet inception distance (FID), the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and the structural similarity index measure (SSIM) were assessed. FDDM achieves an FID of 29.88, less than half of the second best. These results demonstrated FDDM's prowess in generating highly-realistic target-domain images while maintaining the faithfulness of translated anatomical structures",

However, the variance-based method that has been widely applied in regression problems is seldom used in the classification setting. In this work, we adapt the variance-based approach from regression to classification, quantifying classification uncertainty at the class level. The variance decomposition technique in regression is extended to class covariance decomposition in classification based on the law of total covariance, and the class correlation is also derived from the covariance. Experiments on cross-domain datasets are conducted to illustrate that the variance-based approach not only results in similar accuracy as the entropy-based one in active domain adaptation but also brings information about class-wise uncertainties as well as between-class correlations. The code is available at https://github.com/KerryDRX/EvidentialADA. This alternative means of evidential uncertainty quantification will give researchers more options when class uncertainties and correlations are important in their applications",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Palmprint biometrics garner heightened attention in palm-scanning payment and social security due to their distinctive attributes. However, prevailing methodologies singularly prioritize texture orientation, neglecting the significant texture scale dimension. We design an innovative network for concurrently extracting intra-scale and inter-scale features to redress this limitation. This paper proposes a scale-aware competitive network (SAC-Net), which includes the Inner-Scale Competition Module (ISCM) and the Across-Scale Competition Module (ASCM) to capture texture characteristics related to orientation and scale. ISCM efficiently integrates learnable Gabor filters and a self-attention mechanism to extract rich orientation data and discern textures with long-range discriminative properties. Subsequently, ASCM leverages a competitive strategy across various scales to effectively encapsulate the competitive texture scale elements. By synergizing ISCM and ASCM, our method adeptly characterizes palmprint features. Rigorous experimentation across three benchmark datasets unequivocally demonstrates our proposed approach's exceptional recognition performance and resilience relative to state-of-the-art alternatives",

    "abstract": "While recent years have witnessed great progress on using diffusion models for video generation, most of them are simple extensions of image generation frameworks, which fail to explicitly consider one of the key differences between videos and images, i.e., motion. In this paper, we propose a novel motion-aware video generation (MoVideo) framework that takes motion into consideration from two aspects: video depth and optical flow. The former regulates motion by per-frame object distances and spatial layouts, while the later describes motion by cross-frame correspondences that help in preserving fine details and improving temporal consistency. More specifically, given a key frame that exists or generated from text prompts, we first design a diffusion model with spatio-temporal modules to generate the video depth and the corresponding optical flows. Then, the video is generated in the latent space by another spatio-temporal diffusion model under the guidance of depth, optical flow-based warped latent video and the calculated occlusion mask. Lastly, we use optical flows again to align and refine different frames for better video decoding from the latent space to the pixel space. In experiments, MoVideo achieves state-of-the-art results in both text-to-video and image-to-video generation, showing promising prompt consistency, frame consistency and visual quality",

    "abstract": "The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has shown impressive performance when applied to natural image segmentation. However, it struggles with geographical images like aerial and satellite imagery, especially when segmenting mobility infrastructure including roads, sidewalks, and crosswalks. This inferior performance stems from the narrow features of these objects, their textures blending into the surroundings, and interference from objects like trees, buildings, vehicles, and pedestrians - all of which can disorient the model to produce inaccurate segmentation maps. To address these challenges, we propose Geographical SAM (GeoSAM), a novel SAM-based framework that implements a fine-tuning strategy using the dense visual prompt from zero-shot learning, and the sparse visual prompt from a pre-trained CNN segmentation model. The proposed GeoSAM outperforms existing approaches for geographical image segmentation, specifically by 20%, 14.29%, and 17.65% for road infrastructure, pedestrian infrastructure, and on average, respectively, representing a momentous leap in leveraging foundation models to segment mobility infrastructure including both road and pedestrian infrastructure in geographical images",

    "abstract": "This paper develops an in-depth treatment concerning the problem of approximating the Gaussian smoothing and Gaussian derivative computations in scale-space theory for application on discrete data. With close connections to previous axiomatic treatments of continuous and discrete scale-space theory, we consider three main ways discretizing these scale-space operations in terms of explicit discrete convolutions, based on either (i) sampling the Gaussian kernels and the Gaussian derivative kernels, (ii) locally integrating the Gaussian kernels and the Gaussian derivative kernels over each pixel support region and (iii) basing the scale-space analysis on the discrete analogue of the Gaussian kernel, and then computing derivative approximations by applying small-support central difference operators to the spatially smoothed image data. We study the properties of these three main discretization methods both theoretically and experimentally, and characterize their performance by quantitative measures, including the results they give rise to with respect to the task of scale selection, investigated for four different use cases, and with emphasis on the behaviour at fine scales. The results show that the sampled Gaussian kernels and derivatives as well as the integrated Gaussian kernels and derivatives perform very poorly at very fine scales. At very fine scales, the discrete analogue of the Gaussian kernel with its corresponding discrete derivative approximations performs substantially better. The sampled Gaussian kernel and the sampled Gaussian derivatives do, on the other hand, lead to numerically very good approximations of the corresponding continuous results, when the scale parameter is sufficiently large, in the experiments presented in the paper, when the scale parameter is greater than a value of about 1, in units of the grid spacing",

    "abstract": "Semantic segmentation of RGB-D images involves understanding the appearance and spatial relationships of objects within a scene, which requires careful consideration of various factors. However, in indoor environments, the simple input of RGB and depth images often results in a relatively limited acquisition of semantic and spatial information, leading to suboptimal segmentation outcomes. To address this, we propose the Multi-modal Interaction and Pooling Attention Network (MIPANet), a novel approach designed to harness the interactive synergy between RGB and depth modalities, optimizing the utilization of complementary information. Specifically, we incorporate a Multi-modal Interaction Fusion Module (MIM) into the deepest layers of the network. This module is engineered to facilitate the fusion of RGB and depth information, allowing for mutual enhancement and correction. Additionally, we introduce a Pooling Attention Module (PAM) at various stages of the encoder. This module serves to amplify the features extracted by the network and integrates the module's output into the decoder in a targeted manner, significantly improving semantic segmentation performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that MIPANet outperforms existing methods on two indoor scene datasets, NYUDv2 and SUN-RGBD, underscoring its effectiveness in enhancing RGB-D semantic segmentation",

    "title": "UMAAF: Unveiling Aesthetics via Multifarious Attributes of Images",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "With the increasing prevalence of smartphones and websites, Image Aesthetic Assessment (IAA) has become increasingly crucial. While the significance of attributes in IAA is widely recognized, many attribute-based methods lack consideration for the selection and utilization of aesthetic attributes. Our initial step involves the acquisition of aesthetic attributes from both intra- and inter-perspectives. Within the intra-perspective, we extract the direct visual attributes of images, constituting the absolute attribute. In the inter-perspective, our focus lies in modeling the relative score relationships between images within the same sequence, forming the relative attribute. Then, to better utilize image attributes in aesthetic assessment, we propose the Unified Multi-attribute Aesthetic Assessment Framework (UMAAF) to model both absolute and relative attributes of images. For absolute attributes, we leverage multiple absolute-attribute perception modules and an absolute-attribute interacting network. The absolute-attribute perception modules are first pre-trained on several absolute-attribute learning tasks and then used to extract corresponding absolute attribute features. The absolute-attribute interacting network adaptively learns the weight of diverse absolute-attribute features, effectively integrating them with generic aesthetic features from various absolute-attribute perspectives and generating the aesthetic prediction. To model the relative attribute of images, we consider the relative ranking and relative distance relationships between images in a Relative-Relation Loss function, which boosts the robustness of the UMAAF. Furthermore, UMAAF achieves state-of-the-art performance on TAD66K and AVA datasets, and multiple experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of each module and the model's alignment with human preference",

    "title": "Exchanging Dual Encoder-Decoder: A New Strategy for Change Detection with Semantic Guidance and Spatial Localization",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Change detection is a critical task in earth observation applications. Recently, deep learning-based methods have shown promising performance and are quickly adopted in change detection. However, the widely used multiple encoder and single decoder (MESD) as well as dual encoder-decoder (DED) architectures still struggle to effectively handle change detection well. The former has problems of bitemporal feature interference in the feature-level fusion, while the latter is inapplicable to intraclass change detection and multiview building change detection. To solve these problems, we propose a new strategy with an exchanging dual encoder-decoder structure for binary change detection with semantic guidance and spatial localization. The proposed strategy solves the problems of bitemporal feature inference in MESD by fusing bitemporal features in the decision level and the inapplicability in DED by determining changed areas using bitemporal semantic features. We build a binary change detection model based on this strategy, and then validate and compare it with 18 state-of-the-art change detection methods on six datasets in three scenarios, including intraclass change detection datasets (CDD, SYSU), single-view building change detection datasets (WHU, LEVIR-CD, LEVIR-CD+) and a multiview building change detection dataset (NJDS). The experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance with high efficiency and outperforms all benchmark methods with F1-scores of 97.77%, 83.07%, 94.86%, 92.33%, 91.39%, 74.35% on CDD, SYSU, WHU, LEVIR-CD, LEVIR- CD+, and NJDS datasets, respectively.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Video prediction yields future frames by employing the historical frames and has exhibited its great potential in many applications, e.g., meteorological prediction, and autonomous driving. Previous works often decode the ultimate high-level semantic features to future frames without texture details, which deteriorates the prediction quality. Motivated by this, we develop a Pair-wise Layer Attention (PLA) module to enhance the layer-wise semantic dependency of the feature maps derived from the U-shape structure in Translator, by coupling low-level visual cues and high-level features. Hence, the texture details of predicted frames are enriched. Moreover, most existing methods capture the spatiotemporal dynamics by Translator, but fail to sufficiently utilize the spatial features of Encoder. This inspires us to design a Spatial Masking (SM) module to mask partial encoding features during pretraining, which adds the visibility of remaining feature pixels by Decoder. To this end, we present a Pair-wise Layer Attention with Spatial Masking (PLA-SM) framework for video prediction to capture the spatiotemporal dynamics, which reflect the motion trend. Extensive experiments and rigorous ablation studies on five benchmarks demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach. The code is available at GitHub",

    "abstract": "The recent advancements in text-to-3D generation mark a significant milestone in generative models, unlocking new possibilities for creating imaginative 3D assets across various real-world scenarios. While recent advancements in text-to-3D generation have shown promise, they often fall short in rendering detailed and high-quality 3D models. This problem is especially prevalent as many methods base themselves on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). This paper identifies a notable deficiency in SDS, that it brings inconsistent and low-quality updating direction for the 3D model, causing the over-smoothing effect. To address this, we propose a novel approach called Interval Score Matching (ISM). ISM employs deterministic diffusing trajectories and utilizes interval-based score matching to counteract over-smoothing. Furthermore, we incorporate 3D Gaussian Splatting into our text-to-3D generation pipeline.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Deepfake detection faces a critical generalization hurdle, with performance deteriorating when there is a mismatch between the distributions of training and testing data. A broadly received explanation is the tendency of these detectors to be overfitted to forgery-specific artifacts, rather than learning features that are widely applicable across various forgeries. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective detector called LSDA (\\underline{L}atent \\underline{S}pace \\underline{D}ata \\underline{A}ugmentation), which is based on a heuristic idea: representations with a wider variety of forgeries should be able to learn a more generalizable decision boundary, thereby mitigating the overfitting of method-specific features (see Figure. 1). Following this idea, we propose to enlarge the forgery space by constructing and simulating variations within and across forgery features in the latent space. This approach encompasses the acquisition of enriched, domain-specific features and the facilitation of smoother transitions between different forgery types, effectively bridging domain gaps. Our approach culminates in refining a binary classifier that leverages the distilled knowledge from the enhanced features, striving for a generalizable deepfake detector. Comprehensive experiments show that our proposed method is surprisingly effective and transcends state-of-the-art detectors across several widely used benchmarks",

In this paper, we propose a novel framework, camo-perceptive vision-language framework (CPVLF), to explore whether LVLM can generalize to the challenging camouflaged object detection (COD) scenario in a training-free manner. During the process of generalization, we find that due to hallucination issues within LVLM, it can erroneously perceive objects in camouflaged scenes, producing counterfactual concepts. Moreover, as LVLM is not specifically trained for the precise localization of camouflaged objects, it exhibits a degree of uncertainty in accurately pinpointing these objects. Therefore, we propose chain of visual perception, which enhances LVLM's perception of camouflaged scenes from both linguistic and visual perspectives, reducing the hallucination issue and improving its capability in accurately locating camouflaged objects. We validate the effectiveness of CPVLF on three widely used COD datasets, and the experiments show the potential of LVLM in the COD task",

    "abstract": "Writing assistance is an application closely related to human life and is also a fundamental Natural Language Processing (NLP) research field. Its aim is to improve the correctness and quality of input texts, with character checking being crucial in detecting and correcting wrong characters. From the perspective of the real world where handwriting occupies the vast majority, characters that humans get wrong include faked characters (i.e., untrue characters created due to writing errors) and misspelled characters (i.e., true characters used incorrectly due to spelling errors). However, existing datasets and related studies only focus on misspelled characters mainly caused by phonological or visual confusion, thereby ignoring faked characters which are more common and difficult. To break through this dilemma, we present Visual-C$^3$, a human-annotated Visual Chinese Character Checking dataset with faked and misspelled Chinese characters. To the best of our knowledge, Visual-C$^3$ is the first real-world visual and the largest human-crafted dataset for the Chinese character checking scenario. Additionally, we also propose and evaluate novel baseline methods on Visual-C$^3$. Extensive empirical results and analyses show that Visual-C$^3$ is high-quality yet challenging.

We demonstrate that AdvPT improves resistance against white-box and black-box adversarial attacks and exhibits a synergistic effect when combined with existing image-processing-based defense techniques, further boosting defensive capabilities. Comprehensive experimental analyses provide insights into adversarial prompt tuning, a novel paradigm devoted to improving resistance to adversarial images through textual input modifications, paving the way for future robust multimodal learning research.

We introduce a human-in-the-loop deep learning framework leveraging OpenEarthMap, a recently introduced benchmark dataset for global submeter-level land cover mapping, with a U-Net model that achieves national-scale mapping with a small amount of additional labeled data. By adding a small amount of labeled data of areas or regions where a U-Net model trained on OpenEarthMap clearly failed and retraining the model, an overall accuracy of 80\\% was achieved, which is a nearly 16 percentage point improvement after retraining. Using aerial imagery provided by the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan, we create land cover classification maps of eight classes for the entire country of Japan. Our framework, with its low annotation cost and high-accuracy mapping results, demonstrates the potential to contribute to the automatic updating of national-scale land cover mapping using submeter-level optical remote sensing data.

    "abstract": "Story visualization aims to generate a series of images that match the story described in texts, and it requires the generated images to satisfy high quality, alignment with the text description, and consistency in character identities. Given the complexity of story visualization, existing methods drastically simplify the problem by considering only a few specific characters and scenarios, or requiring the users to provide per-image control conditions such as sketches. However, these simplifications render these methods incompetent for real applications. To this end, we propose an automated story visualization system that can effectively generate diverse, high-quality, and consistent sets of story images, with minimal human interactions. Specifically, we utilize the comprehension and planning capabilities of large language models for layout planning, and then leverage large-scale text-to-image models to generate sophisticated story images based on the layout. We empirically find that sparse control conditions, such as bounding boxes, are suitable for layout planning, while dense control conditions, e.g., sketches and keypoints, are suitable for generating high-quality image content. To obtain the best of both worlds, we devise a dense condition generation module to transform simple bounding box layouts into sketch or keypoint control conditions for final image generation, which not only improves the image quality but also allows easy and intuitive user interactions. In addition, we propose a simple yet effective method to generate multi-view consistent character images, eliminating the reliance on human labor to collect or draw character images",

    "title": "Open-Vocabulary Camouflaged Object Segmentation",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Recently, the emergence of the large-scale vision-language model (VLM), such as CLIP, has opened the way towards open-world object perception. Many works has explored the utilization of pre-trained VLM for the challenging open-vocabulary dense prediction task that requires perceive diverse objects with novel classes at inference time. Existing methods construct experiments based on the public datasets of related tasks, which are not tailored for open vocabulary and rarely involves imperceptible objects camouflaged in complex scenes due to data collection bias and annotation costs. To fill in the gaps, we introduce a new task, open-vocabulary camouflaged object segmentation (OVCOS) and construct a large-scale complex scene dataset (\\textbf{OVCamo}) which containing 11,483 hand-selected images with fine annotations and corresponding object classes. Further, we build a strong single-stage open-vocabulary \\underline{c}amouflaged \\underline{o}bject \\underline{s}egmentation transform\\underline{er} baseline \\textbf{OVCoser} attached to the parameter-fixed CLIP with iterative semantic guidance and structure enhancement. By integrating the guidance of class semantic knowledge and the supplement of visual structure cues from the edge and depth information, the proposed method can efficiently capture camouflaged objects. Moreover, this effective framework also surpasses previous state-of-the-arts of open-vocabulary semantic image segmentation by a large margin on our OVCamo dataset. With the proposed dataset and baseline, we hope that this new task with more practical value can further expand the research on open-vocabulary dense prediction tasks",

With an altered DenseNet architecture, the CNN performs admirably in terms of particularity, sensitivity, as well as accuracy. Its superiority over conventional methods is validated by comparative analyses, which highlight efficiency gains. Nonetheless, interpretability issues highlight the necessity of sophisticated methods in addition to continuous model improvement. Integration issues like interoperability and radiologists' training lead to suggestions for teamwork.

    "title": "GaussianDiffusion: 3D Gaussian Splatting for Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models with Structured Noise",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Text-to-3D, known for its efficient generation methods and expansive creative potential, has garnered significant attention in the AIGC domain. However, the amalgamation of Nerf and 2D diffusion models frequently yields oversaturated images, posing severe limitations on downstream industrial applications due to the constraints of pixelwise rendering method. Gaussian splatting has recently superseded the traditional pointwise sampling technique prevalent in NeRF-based methodologies, revolutionizing various aspects of 3D reconstruction. This paper introduces a novel text to 3D content generation framework based on Gaussian splatting, enabling fine control over image saturation through individual Gaussian sphere transparencies, thereby producing more realistic images. The challenge of achieving multi-view consistency in 3D generation significantly impedes modeling complexity and accuracy. Taking inspiration from SJC, we explore employing multi-view noise distributions to perturb images generated by 3D Gaussian splatting, aiming to rectify inconsistencies in multi-view geometry. We ingeniously devise an efficient method to generate noise that produces Gaussian noise from diverse viewpoints, all originating from a shared noise source. Furthermore, vanilla 3D Gaussian-based generation tends to trap models in local minima, causing artifacts like floaters, burrs, or proliferative elements. To mitigate these issues, we propose the variational Gaussian splatting technique to enhance the quality and stability of 3D appearance. To our knowledge, our approach represents the first comprehensive utilization of Gaussian splatting across the entire spectrum of 3D content generation processes",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Gait recognition has achieved promising advances in controlled settings, yet it significantly struggles in unconstrained environments due to challenges such as view changes, occlusions, and varying walking speeds. Additionally, efforts to fuse multiple modalities often face limited improvements because of cross-modality incompatibility, particularly in outdoor scenarios. To address these issues, we present a multi-modal Hierarchy in Hierarchy network (HiH) that integrates silhouette and pose sequences for robust gait recognition. HiH features a main branch that utilizes Hierarchical Gait Decomposer (HGD) modules for depth-wise and intra-module hierarchical examination of general gait patterns from silhouette data. This approach captures motion hierarchies from overall body dynamics to detailed limb movements, facilitating the representation of gait attributes across multiple spatial resolutions. Complementing this, an auxiliary branch, based on 2D joint sequences, enriches the spatial and temporal aspects of gait analysis. It employs a Deformable Spatial Enhancement (DSE) module for pose-guided spatial attention and a Deformable Temporal Alignment (DTA) module for aligning motion dynamics through learned temporal offsets. Extensive evaluations across diverse indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate HiH's state-of-the-art performance, affirming a well-balanced trade-off between accuracy and efficiency",

Current shape reconstruction techniques for endovascular intervention often rely on either a priori information or specialized equipment, potentially subjecting patients to heightened radiation exposure.

In this paper, we propose a new method to reconstruct the 3D guidewire by utilizing CathSim, a state-of-the-art endovascular simulator, and a 3D Fluoroscopy Guidewire Reconstruction Network (3D-FGRN). Our 3D-FGRN delivers results on par with conventional triangulation from simulated monoplane fluoroscopic images.

    "abstract": "Ensuring logical consistency in predictions is a crucial yet overlooked aspect in multi-attribute classification. We explore the potential reasons for this oversight and introduce two pressing challenges to the field: 1) How can we ensure that a model, when trained with data checked for logical consistency, yields predictions that are logically consistent? 2) How can we achieve the same with data that hasn't undergone logical consistency checks? Minimizing manual effort is also essential for enhancing automation. To address these challenges, we introduce two datasets, FH41K and CelebA-logic, and propose LogicNet, an adversarial training framework that learns the logical relationships between attributes. Accuracy of LogicNet surpasses that of the next-best approach by 23.05%, 9.96%, and 1.71% on FH37K, FH41K, and CelebA-logic, respectively.

    "title": "On the Noise Scheduling for Generating Plausible Designs with Diffusion Models",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Deep Generative Models (DGMs) are widely used to create innovative designs across multiple industries, ranging from fashion to the automotive sector. In addition to generating images of high visual quality, the task of structural design generation imposes more stringent constrains on the semantic expression, e.g., no floating material or missing part, which we refer to as plausibility in this work. We delve into the impact of noise schedules of diffusion models on the plausibility of the outcome: there exists a range of noise levels at which the model's performance decides the result plausibility. Also, we propose two techniques to determine such a range for a given image set and devise a novel parametric noise schedule for better plausibility. We apply this noise schedule to the training and sampling of the well-known diffusion model EDM and compare it to its default noise schedule. Compared to EDM, our schedule significantly improves the rate of plausible designs from 83.4% to 93.5% and Fr\\'echet Inception Distance (FID) from 7.84 to 4.87.

We transform network-derived predictions and their corresponding ground truths into signed distance maps, thereby enabling any networks to concentrate on the essential boundaries rather than merely the overall contours. These SDMs are subjected to the vision transformer, efficiently producing high-dimensional feature vectors encapsulating critical image attributes. By computing the cosine similarity between these feature vectors, we gain a nuanced understanding of image similarity that goes beyond the limitations of traditional overlap-based measures. The advantages of our approach are manifold, ranging from scale and translation invariance to superior detection of subtle differences, thus ensuring precise localization and delineation of the medical instruments within the images. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analyses substantiate the significant enhancement in performance over existing baselines, demonstrating the promise held by our new shape-sensitive loss function for improving catheter and guidewire segmentation",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The process of annotating relevant data in the field of digital microscopy can be both time-consuming and especially expensive due to the required technical skills and human-expert knowledge. Consequently, large amounts of microscopic image data sets remain unlabeled, preventing their effective exploitation using deep-learning algorithms. In recent years it has been shown that a lot of relevant information can be drawn from unlabeled data. Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a promising solution based on learning intrinsic features under a pretext task that is similar to the main task without requiring labels. The trained result is transferred to the main task - image segmentation in our case. A ResNet50 U-Net was first trained to restore images of liver progenitor organoids from augmented images using the Structural Similarity Index Metric (SSIM), alone, and using SSIM combined with L1 loss. Both the encoder and decoder were trained in tandem. The weights were transferred to another U-Net model designed for segmentation with frozen encoder weights, using Binary Cross Entropy, Dice, and Intersection over Union (IoU) losses. For comparison, we used the same U-Net architecture to train two supervised models, one utilizing the ResNet50 encoder as well as a simple CNN. Results showed that self-supervised learning models using a 25\\% pixel drop or image blurring augmentation performed better than the other augmentation techniques using the IoU loss. When trained on only 114 images for the main task, the self-supervised learning approach outperforms the supervised method achieving an F1-score of 0.85, with higher stability, in contrast to an F1=0.78 scored by the supervised method. Furthermore, when trained with larger data sets (1,000 images), self-supervised learning is still able to perform better, achieving an F1-score of 0.92, contrasting to a score of 0.85 for the supervised method",

To address this problem, this paper proposes an efficient attention-based defense mechanism that exploits adversarial channel-attention to quickly identify and track malicious objects in shallow network layers and mask their adversarial effects in a multi-frame setting. This work advances the state of the art by enhancing existing over-activation techniques for real-world adversarial attacks to make them usable in real-time applications.
