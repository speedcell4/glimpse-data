    "title": "On the Complexity of Best-Arm Identification in Multi-Armed Bandit Models",
    "abstract": "The stochastic multi-armed bandit model is a simple abstraction that has proven useful in many different contexts in statistics and machine learning. Whereas the achievable limit in terms of regret minimization is now well known, our aim is to contribute to a better understanding of the performance in terms of identifying the $m$ best arms. We introduce generic notions of complexity for the two dominant frameworks considered in the literature: fixed-budget and fixed-confidence settings. In the fixed-confidence setting, we provide the first known distribution-dependent lower bound on the complexity that involves information-theoretic quantities and holds when $m\\geq 1$ under general assumptions. In the specific case of two armed- bandits, we derive refined lower bounds in both the fixed- confidence and fixed-budget settings, along with matching algorithms for Gaussian and Bernoulli bandit models. These results show in particular that the complexity of the fixed- budget setting may be smaller than the complexity of the fixed- confidence setting, contradicting the familiar behavior observed when testing fully specified alternatives. In addition, we also provide improved sequential stopping rules that have guaranteed error probabilities and shorter average running times. The proofs rely on two technical results that are of independent interest : a deviation lemma for self-normalized sums (Lemma 7) and a novel change of measure inequality for bandit models (Lemma 1)",

    "title": "Consistent Algorithms for Clustering Time Series",
    "abstract": "The problem of clustering is considered for the case where every point is a time series. The time series are either given in one batch (offline setting), or they are allowed to grow with time and new time series can be added along the way (online setting). We propose a natural notion of consistency for this problem, and show that there are simple, computationally efficient algorithms that are asymptotically consistent under extremely weak assumptions on the distributions that generate the data. The notion of consistency is as follows. A clustering algorithm is called consistent if it places two time series into the same cluster if and only if the distribution that generates them is the same. In the considered framework the time series are allowed to be highly dependent, and the dependence can have arbitrary form. If the number of clusters is known, the only assumption we make is that the (marginal) distribution of each time series is stationary ergodic. No parametric, memory or mixing assumptions are made. When the number of clusters is unknown, stronger assumptions are provably necessary, but it is still possible to devise nonparametric algorithms that are consistent under very general conditions. The theoretical findings of this work are illustrated with experiments on both synthetic and real data",

    "abstract": "In machine learning, ensemble methods combine the predictions of multiple base learners to construct more accurate aggregate predictions. Established supervised learning algorithms inject randomness into the construction of the individual base learners in an effort to promote diversity within the resulting ensembles. An undesirable side effect of this approach is that it generally also reduces the accuracy of the base learners. In this paper, we introduce a method that is simple to implement yet general and effective in improving ensemble diversity with only modest impact on the accuracy of the individual base learners. By randomly rotating the feature space prior to inducing the base learners, we achieve favorable aggregate predictions on standard data sets compared to state of the art ensemble methods, most notably for tree-based ensembles, which are particularly sensitive to rotation",

    "title": "Should We Really Use Post-Hoc Tests Based on Mean-Ranks?",
    "abstract": "The statistical comparison of multiple algorithms over multiple data sets is fundamental in machine learning. This is typically carried out by the Friedman test. When the Friedman test rejects the null hypothesis, multiple comparisons are carried out to establish which are the significant differences among algorithms. The multiple comparisons are usually performed using the mean-ranks test. The aim of this technical note is to discuss the inconsistencies of the mean-ranks post-hoc test with the goal of discouraging its use in machine learning as well as in medicine, psychology, etc.. We show that the outcome of the mean-ranks test depends on the pool of algorithms originally included in the experiment. In other words, the outcome of the comparison between algorithms $A$ and $B$ depends also on the performance of the other algorithms included in the original experiment. This can lead to paradoxical situations. For instance the difference between $A$ and $B$ could be declared significant if the pool comprises algorithms $C,D,E$ and not significant if the pool comprises algorithms $F,G,H$. To overcome these issues, we suggest instead to perform the multiple comparison using a test whose outcome only depends on the two algorithms being compared, such as the sign-test or the Wilcoxon signed-rank test",

    "title": "Minimax Rates in Permutation Estimation for Feature Matching",
    "abstract": "The problem of matching two sets of features appears in various tasks of computer vision and can be often formalized as a problem of permutation estimation. We address this problem from a statistical point of view and provide a theoretical analysis of the accuracy of several natural estimators. To this end, the minimax rate of separation is investigated and its expression is obtained as a function of the sample size, noise level and dimension of the features. We consider the cases of homoscedastic and heteroscedastic noise and establish, in each case, tight upper bounds on the separation distance of several estimators. These upper bounds are shown to be unimprovable both in the homoscedastic and heteroscedastic settings. Interestingly, these bounds demonstrate that a phase transition occurs when the dimension $d$ of the features is of the order of the logarithm of the number of features $n$. For $d=O(\\log n)$, the rate is dimension free and equals $\\sigma (\\log n)^{1/2}$, where $\\sigma$ is the noise level. In contrast, when $d$ is larger than $c\\log n$ for some constant $c>0$, the minimax rate increases with $d$ and is of the order of $\\sigma(d\\log n)^{1/4}$. We also discuss the computational aspects of the estimators and provide empirical evidence of their consistency on synthetic data. Finally, we show that our results extend to more general matching criteria",

    "abstract": "Applying standard Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms to large data sets is computationally expensive. Both the calculation of the acceptance probability and the creation of informed proposals usually require an iteration through the whole data set. The recently proposed stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) method circumvents this problem by generating proposals which are only based on a subset of the data, by skipping the accept-reject step and by using decreasing step-sizes sequence $(\\delta_m)_{m \\geq 0}$. We provide in this article a rigorous mathematical framework for analysing this algorithm. We prove that, under verifiable assumptions, the algorithm is consistent, satisfies a central limit theorem (CLT) and its asymptotic bias-variance decomposition can be characterized by an explicit functional of the step-sizes sequence $(\\delta_m)_{m \\geq 0}$. We leverage this analysis to give practical recommendations for the notoriously difficult tuning of this algorithm: it is asymptotically optimal to use a step-size sequence of the type $\\delta_m \\asymp m^{-1/3}$, leading to an algorithm whose mean squared error (MSE) decreases at rate $\\mathcal{O}(m^{-1/3})$",

    "abstract": "We explored the effect of introducing prior knowledge into the intermediate level of deep supervised neural networks on two tasks. On a task we designed, all black-box state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms which we tested, failed to generalize well. We motivate our work from the hypothesis that, there is a training barrier involved in the nature of such tasks, and that humans learn useful intermediate concepts from other individuals by using a form of supervision or guidance using a curriculum. Our results provide a positive evidence in favor of this hypothesis. In our experiments, we trained a two- tiered MLP architecture on a dataset for which each input image contains three sprites, and the binary target class is $1$ if all of three shapes belong to the same category and otherwise the class is $0$. In terms of generalization, black-box machine learning algorithms could not perform better than chance on this task. Standard deep supervised neural networks also failed to generalize. However, using a particular structure and guiding the learner by providing intermediate targets in the form of intermediate concepts (the presence of each object) allowed us to solve the task efficiently. We obtained much better than chance, but imperfect results by exploring different architectures and optimization variants. This observation might be an indication of optimization difficulty when the neural network trained without hints on this task. We hypothesize that the learning difficulty is due to the composition of two highly non-linear tasks. Our findings are also consistent with the hypotheses on cultural learning inspired by the observations of training of neural networks sometimes getting stuck, even though good solutions exist, both in terms of training and generalization error",

    "title": "Complexity of Representation and Inference in Compositional Models with Part Sharing",
    "abstract": "This paper performs a complexity analysis of a class of serial and parallel compositional models of multiple objects and shows that they enable efficient representation and rapid inference. Compositional models are generative and represent objects in a hierarchically distributed manner in terms of parts and subparts, which are constructed recursively by part-subpart compositions. Parts are represented more coarsely at higher level of the hierarchy, so that the upper levels give coarse summary descriptions (e.g., there is a horse in the image) while the lower levels represents the details (e.g., the positions of the legs of the horse). This hierarchically distributed representation obeys the executive summary principle, meaning that a high level executive only requires a coarse summary description and can, if necessary, get more details by consulting lower level executives. The parts and subparts are organized in terms of hierarchical dictionaries which enables part sharing between different objects allowing efficient representation of many objects. The first main contribution of this paper is to show that compositional models can be mapped onto a parallel visual architecture similar to that used by bio- inspired visual models such as deep convolutional networks but more explicit in terms of representation, hence enabling part detection as well as object detection, and suitable for complexity analysis. Inference algorithms can be run on this architecture to exploit the gains caused by part sharing and executive summary. Effectively, this compositional architecture enables us to perform exact inference simultaneously over a large class of generative models of objects. The second contribution is an analysis of the complexity of compositional models in terms of computation time (for serial computers) and numbers of nodes (e.g., \"neurons\") for parallel computers. In particular, we compute the complexity gains by part sharing and executive summary and their dependence on how the dictionary scales with the level of the hierarchy. We explore three regimes of scaling behavior where the dictionary size (i) increases exponentially with the level of the hierarchy, (ii) is determined by an unsupervised compositional learning algorithm applied to real data, (iii) decreases exponentially with scale. This analysis shows that in some regimes the use of shared parts enables algorithms which can perform inference in time linear in the number of levels for an exponential number of objects. In other regimes part sharing has little advantage for serial computers but can enable linear processing on parallel computers",

This is in contrast to the case of the expected reward-to-go, also known as the value function, for which effective simulation-based algorithms are known, and have been used successfully in various domains. In this paper we extend temporal difference (TD) learning algorithms to estimating the variance of the reward-to- go for a fixed policy.

We extend the notion of classification calibration, which has been studied for binary and multiclass 0-1 classification problems (and for certain other specific learning problems), to the general multiclass setting, and derive necessary and sufficient conditions for a surrogate loss to be calibrated with respect to a loss matrix in this setting. We then introduce the notion of convex calibration dimension of a multiclass loss matrix, which measures the smallest \"size\" of a prediction space in which it is possible to design a convex surrogate that is calibrated with respect to the loss matrix. We derive both upper and lower bounds on this quantity, and use these results to analyze various loss matrices. In particular, we apply our framework to study various subset ranking losses, and use the convex calibration dimension as a tool to show both the existence and non-existence of various types of convex calibrated surrogates for these losses. Our results strengthen recent results of Duchi et al. (2010) and CalauzÃÂ¨nes et al. (2012) on the non-existence of certain types of convex calibrated surrogates in subset ranking.

Working in a setting where both the data providers and data analysts want to maximize the utility of statistical analyses performed on the released data, we study the fundamental trade-off between local differential privacy and utility. This trade-off is formulated as a constrained optimization problem: maximize utility subject to local differential privacy constraints. We introduce a combinatorial family of extremal privatization mechanisms, which we call staircase mechanisms, and show that it contains the optimal privatization mechanisms for a broad class of information theoretic utilities such as mutual information and $f$-divergences. We further prove that for any utility function and any privacy level, solving the privacy-utility maximization problem is equivalent to solving a finite-dimensional linear program, the outcome of which is the optimal staircase mechanism. However, solving this linear program can be computationally expensive since it has a number of variables that is exponential in the size of the alphabet the data lives in. To account for this, we show that two simple privatization mechanisms, the binary and randomized response mechanisms, are universally optimal in the low and high privacy regimes, and well approximate the intermediate regime",

The approach, termed Gradient Weighting (GW), consists of a first pass regression estimate $f_n$ which serves to evaluate the directional derivatives of $f$, and a second-pass regression estimate on the re-weighted data. The GW approach can be instantiated for both regression and classification, and is grounded in strong theoretical principles having to do with the way regression bias and variance are affected by a generic feature-weighting scheme. These theoretical principles provide further technical foundation for some existing feature-weighting heuristics that have proved successful in practice. We propose a simple estimator of these derivative norms and prove its consistency. The proposed estimator computes efficiently and easily extends to run online. We then derive a classification version of the GW approach which evaluates on real-worlds datasets with as much success as its regression counterpart",

The adaptive regret of an algorithm on a time interval $[t_1,t_2]$ is the loss of the algorithm minus the loss of the best expert over that interval. Adaptive regret measures how well the algorithm approximates the best expert locally, and so is different from, although closely related to, both the classical regret, measured over an initial time interval $[1,t]$, and the tracking regret, where the algorithm is compared to a good sequence of experts over $[1,t]$. We investigate two existing intuitive methods for deriving algorithms with low adaptive regret, one based on specialist experts and the other based on restarts. Quite surprisingly, we show that both methods lead to the same algorithm, namely Fixed Share, which is known for its tracking regret. We provide a thorough analysis of the adaptive regret of Fixed Share. We obtain the exact worst-case adaptive regret for Fixed Share, from which the classical tracking bounds follow.

We review, analyze, and unify the NFL theorem with the perspectives of \"blind\" search and meta-learning to arrive at necessary conditions for improving black-box optimization. We survey meta-learning literature to determine when and how meta- learning can benefit machine learning. Then, we generalize meta- learning in the context of the NFL theorems, to arrive at a novel technique called anti-training with sacrificial data (ATSD). Our technique applies at the meta level to arrive at domain specific algorithms. We also show how to generate sacrificial data. An extensive case study is presented along with simulated annealing results to demonstrate the efficacy of the ATSD method",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a general vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) framework for the problem of learning an unknown functional dependency between a structured input space and a structured output space. Our formulation encompasses both Vector-valued Manifold Regularization and Co-regularized Multi- view Learning, providing in particular a unifying framework linking these two important learning approaches. In the case of the least square loss function, we provide a closed form solution, which is obtained by solving a system of linear equations. In the case of Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification, our formulation generalizes in particular both the binary Laplacian SVM to the multi-class, multi-view settings and the multi-class Simplex Cone SVM to the semi-supervised, multi-view settings. The solution is obtained by solving a single quadratic optimization problem, as in standard SVM, via the Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) approach. Empirical results obtained on the task of object recognition, using several challenging data sets, demonstrate the competitiveness of our algorithms compared with other state-of-the-art methods",

Ensemble methods based on bootstrapping, such as bagging and random forests, have improved the predictive accuracy of individual trees, but fail to provide a framework in which distributional results can be easily determined. Instead of aggregating full bootstrap samples, we consider predicting by averaging over trees built on subsamples of the training set and demonstrate that the resulting estimator takes the form of a U-statistic. As such, predictions for individual feature vectors are asymptotically normal, allowing for confidence intervals to accompany predictions. In practice, a subset of subsamples is used for computational speed; here our estimators take the form of incomplete U-statistics and equivalent results are derived. We further demonstrate that this setup provides a framework for testing the significance of features. Moreover, the internal estimation method we develop allows us to estimate the variance parameters and perform these inference procedures at no additional computational cost.

Assuming that the causes and the effects have the same distribution, we show that the distribution of the residuals of a linear fit in the anti-causal direction is closer to a Gaussian than the distribution of the residuals in the causal direction. This Gaussianization effect is characterized by reduction of the magnitude of the high-order cumulants and by an increment of the differential entropy of the residuals. The problem of non-linear causal inference is addressed by performing an embedding in an expanded feature space, in which the relation between causes and effects can be assumed to be linear. The effectiveness of a method to discriminate between causes and effects based on this type of asymmetry is illustrated in a variety of experiments using different measures of Gaussianity. The proposed method is shown to be competitive with state-of-the-art techniques for causal inference",

    "abstract": "A popular approach for testing if two univariate random variables are statistically independent consists of partitioning the sample space into bins, and evaluating a test statistic on the binned data. The partition size matters, and the optimal partition size is data dependent. While for detecting simple relationships coarse partitions may be best, for detecting complex relationships a great gain in power can be achieved by considering finer partitions. We suggest novel consistent distribution-free tests that are based on summation or maximization aggregation of scores over all partitions of a fixed size. We show that our test statistics based on summation can serve as good estimators of the mutual information. Moreover, we suggest regularized tests that aggregate over all partition sizes, and prove those are consistent too. We provide polynomial-time algorithms, which are critical for computing the suggested test statistics efficiently. We show that the power of the regularized tests is excellent compared to existing tests, and almost as powerful as the tests based on the optimal (yet unknown in practice) partition size, in simulations as well as on a real data example",

The standard Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms used for learning DAGs are random-walk Metropolis-Hastings samplers. These samplers are guaranteed to converge asymptotically but often mix slowly when exploring the large graph spaces that arise in structure learning. In each step, the sampler we propose draws entire sets of parents for multiple nodes from the appropriate conditional distribution. This provides an efficient way to make large moves in graph space, permitting faster mixing whilst retaining asymptotic guarantees of convergence. The conditional distribution is related to variable selection with candidate parents playing the role of covariates or inputs. We empirically examine the performance of the sampler using several simulated and real data examples. The proposed method gives robust results in diverse settings, outperforming several existing Bayesian and frequentist methods. In addition, our empirical results shed some light on the relative merits of Bayesian and constraint- based methods for structure learning",

    "abstract": "Learning probabilistic models over strings is an important issue for many applications. Spectral methods propose elegant solutions to the problem of inferring weighted automata from finite samples of variable-length strings drawn from an unknown target distribution $p$. These methods rely on a singular value decomposition of a matrix $\\v{H}_S$, called the empirical Hankel matrix, that records the frequencies of (some of) the observed strings $S$. The accuracy of the learned distribution depends both on the quantity of information embedded in $\\v{H}_S$ and on the distance between $\\v{H}_S$ and its mean $\\v{H}_p$. Existing concentration bounds seem to indicate that the concentration over $\\v{H}_p$ gets looser with its dimensions, suggesting that it might be necessary to bound the dimensions of $\\v{H}_S$ for learning. We prove new dimension-free concentration bounds for classical Hankel matrices and several variants, based on prefixes or factors of strings, that are useful for learning. Experiments demonstrate that these bounds are tight and that they significantly improve existing (dimension-dependent) bounds. One consequence of these results is that the spectral learning approach remains consistent even if all the observations are recorded within the empirical matrix",

    "title": "Distinguishing Cause from Effect Using Observational Data: Methods and Benchmarks",
    "abstract": "The discovery of causal relationships from purely observational data is a fundamental problem in science. The most elementary form of such a causal discovery problem is to decide whether $X$ causes $Y$ or, alternatively, $Y$ causes $X$, given joint observations of two variables $X,Y$. An example is to decide whether altitude causes temperature, or vice versa, given only joint measurements of both variables. Even under the simplifying assumptions of no confounding, no feedback loops, and no selection bias, such bivariate causal discovery problems are challenging. Nevertheless, several approaches for addressing those problems have been proposed in recent years. We review two families of such methods: methods based on Additive Noise Models (ANMs) and Information Geometric Causal Inference (IGCI). We present the benchmark CauseEffectPairs that consists of data for 100 different cause-effect pairs selected from 37 data sets from various domains (e.g., meteorology, biology, medicine, engineering, economy, etc.) and motivate our decisions regarding the ground truth causal directions of all pairs. We evaluate the performance of several bivariate causal discovery methods on these real-world benchmark data and in addition on artificially simulated data. Our empirical results on real-world data indicate that certain methods are indeed able to distinguish cause from effect using only purely observational data, although more benchmark data would be needed to obtain statistically significant conclusions. One of the best performing methods overall is the method based on Additive Noise Models that has originally been proposed by Hoyer et al. (2009), which obtains an accuracy of 63 $\\pm$ 10 % and an AUC of 0.74 $\\pm$ 0.05 on the real-world benchmark.

In particular, we consider a joint estimation problem of the tasks relationship structure and the individual task parameters, which is solved using alternating minimization. The task relationship revealed by structure learning is founded on recent advances in Gaussian graphical models endowed with sparse estimators of the precision (inverse covariance) matrix. An extension to include flexible Gaussian copula models that relaxes the Gaussian marginal assumption is also proposed. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model on a variety of synthetic and benchmark data sets for regression and classification.

    "abstract": "Max-convolution is an important problem closely resembling standard convolution; as such, max-convolution occurs frequently across many fields. Here we extend the method with fastest known worst-case runtime, which can be applied to nonnegative vectors by numerically approximating the Chebyshev norm $\\| \\cdot \\|_\\infty$, and use this approach to derive two numerically stable methods based on the idea of computing $p$-norms via fast convolution: The first method proposed, with runtime in $O( k \\log(k) \\log(\\log(k)) )$ (which is less than $18 k \\log(k)$ for any vectors that can be practically realized), uses the $p$-norm as a direct approximation of the Chebyshev norm. The second approach proposed, with runtime in $O( k \\log(k) )$ (although in practice both perform similarly), uses a novel null space projection method, which extracts information from a sequence of $p$-norms to estimate the maximum value in the vector (this is equivalent to querying a small number of moments from a distribution of bounded support in order to estimate the maximum). The $p$-norm approaches are compared to one another and are shown to compute an approximation of the Viterbi path in a hidden Markov model where the transition matrix is a Toeplitz matrix; the runtime of approximating the Viterbi path is thus reduced from $O( n k^2 )$ steps to $O( n k \\log(k))$ steps in practice, and is demonstrated by inferring the U.S. unemployment rate from the S&P 500 stock index",

As a result, the HOPE framework can be used as a novel tool to probe why and how NNs work, more importantly, to learn NNs in either supervised or unsupervised ways. In this work, we have investigated the HOPE framework to learn NNs for several standard tasks, including image recognition on MNIST and speech recognition on TIMIT.

The policies are represented by deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with 92,000 parameters, and are trained using a guided policy search method, which transforms policy search into supervised learning, with supervision provided by a simple trajectory-centric reinforcement learning method.

    "abstract": "For spline regressions, it is well known that the choice of knots is crucial for the performance of the estimator. As a general learning framework covering the smoothing splines, learning in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) has a similar issue. However, the selection of training data points for kernel functions in the RKHS representation has not been carefully studied in the literature. In this paper we study quantile regression as an example of learning in a RKHS. In this case, the regular squared norm penalty does not perform training data selection. We propose a data sparsity constraint that imposes thresholding on the kernel function coefficients to achieve a sparse kernel function representation. We demonstrate that the proposed data sparsity method can have competitive prediction performance for certain situations, and have comparable performance in other cases compared to that of the traditional squared norm penalty. Therefore, the data sparsity method can serve as a competitive alternative to the squared norm penalty method. Some theoretical properties of our proposed method using the data sparsity constraint are obtained.

However, the current approach for training GP-LVMs is based on maximum likelihood, where the latent projection variables are maximised over rather than integrated out. In this paper we present a Bayesian method for training GP-LVMs by introducing a non-standard variational inference framework that allows to approximately integrate out the latent variables and subsequently train a GP-LVM by maximising an analytic lower bound on the exact marginal likelihood. We apply this method for learning a GP-LVM from i.i.d. observations and for learning non-linear dynamical systems where the observations are temporally correlated. We show that a benefit of the variational Bayesian procedure is its robustness to overfitting and its ability to automatically select the dimensionality of the non-linear latent space. The resulting framework is generic, flexible and easy to extend for other purposes, such as Gaussian process regression with uncertain or partially missing inputs.

    "title": "SPSD Matrix Approximation vis Column Selection: Theories, Algorithms, and Extensions",
    "abstract": "Symmetric positive semidefinite (SPSD) matrix approximation is an important problem with applications in kernel methods. However, existing SPSD matrix approximation methods such as the NystrÃÂ¶m method only have weak error bounds. In this paper we conduct in-depth studies of an SPSD matrix approximation model and establish strong relative-error bounds. We call it the prototype model for it has more efficient and effective extensions, and some of its extensions have high scalability. Though the prototype model itself is not suitable for large- scale data, it is still useful to study its properties, on which the analysis of its extensions relies. This paper offers novel theoretical analysis, efficient algorithms, and a highly accurate extension. First, we establish a lower error bound for the prototype model and improve the error bound of an existing column selection algorithm to match the lower bound. In this way, we obtain the first optimal column selection algorithm for the prototype model. We also prove that the prototype model is exact under certain conditions. Second, we develop a simple column selection algorithm with a provable error bound. Third, we propose a so-called spectral shifting model to make the approximation more accurate when the eigenvalues of the matrix decay slowly, and the improvement is theoretically quantified. The spectral shifting method can also be applied to improve other SPSD matrix approximation models",

    "title": "Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandit and Its Extension to Probabilistically Triggered Arms",
    "abstract": "We define a general framework for a large class of combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) problems, where subsets of base arms with unknown distributions form super arms. In each round, a super arm is played and the base arms contained in the super arm are played and their outcomes are observed. We further consider the extension in which more base arms could be probabilistically triggered based on the outcomes of already triggered arms. The reward of the super arm depends on the outcomes of all played arms, and it only needs to satisfy two mild assumptions, which allow a large class of nonlinear reward instances. We assume the availability of an offline $(\\alpha,\\beta)$-approximation oracle that takes the means of the outcome distributions of arms and outputs a super arm that with probability $\\beta$ generates an $\\alpha$ fraction of the optimal expected reward. The objective of an online learning algorithm for CMAB is to minimize $(\\alpha,\\beta)$-approximation regret, which is the difference in total expected reward between the $\\alpha\\beta$ fraction of expected reward when always playing the optimal super arm, and the expected reward of playing super arms according to the algorithm. We provide CUCB algorithm that achieves $O(\\log n)$ distribution-dependent regret, where $n$ is the number of rounds played, and we further provide distribution-independent bounds for a large class of reward functions. Our regret analysis is tight in that it matches the bound of UCB1 algorithm (up to a constant factor) for the classical MAB problem, and it significantly improves the regret bound in an earlier paper on combinatorial bandits with linear rewards. We apply our CMAB framework to two new applications, probabilistic maximum coverage (PMC) for online advertising and social influence maximization for viral marketing, both having nonlinear reward structures. In particular, application to social influence maximization requires our extension on probabilistically triggered arms",

    "title": "Differentially Private Data Releasing for Smooth Queries",
    "abstract": "In the past few years, differential privacy has become a standard concept in the area of privacy. One of the most important problems in this field is to answer queries while preserving differential privacy. In spite of extensive studies, most existing work on differentially private query answering assumes the data are discrete (i.e., in $\\{0,1\\}^d$) and focuses on queries induced by \\emph{Boolean} functions. In real applications however, continuous data are at least as common as binary data. Thus, in this work we explore a less studied topic, namely, differential privately query answering for continuous data with continuous function. As a first step towards the continuous case, we study a natural class of linear queries on continuous data which we refer to as smooth queries. A linear query is said to be $K$-smooth if it is specified by a function defined on $[-1,1]^d$ whose partial derivatives up to order $K$ are all bounded. We develop two $\\epsilon$-differentially private mechanisms which are able to answer all smooth queries. The first mechanism outputs a summary of the database and can then give answers to the queries. The second mechanism is an improvement of the first one and it outputs a synthetic database. The two mechanisms both achieve an accuracy of $O (n^{-\\frac{K}{2d+K}}/\\epsilon )$. Here we assume that the dimension $d$ is a constant. It turns out that even in this parameter setting (which is almost trivial in the discrete case), using existing discrete mechanisms to answer the smooth queries is difficult and requires more noise. Our mechanisms are based on $L_{\\infty}$-approximation of (transformed) smooth functions by low-degree even trigonometric polynomials with uniformly bounded coefficients. We also develop practically efficient variants of the mechanisms with promising experimental results",

The quality of a least-squares approximation can be assessed in different ways: either in terms of the value of the quadratic objective function (cost approximation), or in terms of some distance measure between the approximate minimizer and the true minimizer (solution approximation). Focusing on the latter criterion, our first main result provides a general lower bound on any randomized method that sketches both the data matrix and vector in a least-squares problem; as a surprising consequence, the most widely used least-squares sketch is sub-optimal for solution approximation. We then present a new method known as the iterative Hessian sketch, and show that it can be used to obtain approximations to the original least-squares problem using a projection dimension proportional to the statistical complexity of the least-squares minimizer, and a logarithmic number of iterations. We illustrate our general theory with simulations for both unconstrained and constrained versions of least-squares, including $\\ell_1$-regularization and nuclear norm constraints.

We prove that, under certain assumptions, such causal structure is identifiable from the joint observational distribution of the primary and secondary variables. We give causal semantics for the model class, put forward a score-based approach for estimation and establish consistency results. Empirical results demonstrate gains compared with formulations that treat all variables on an equal footing, or that ignore secondary variables.

The widely used faithfulness condition of Spirtes et al. is relaxed to allow for varying degrees of Ã¢ÂÂpath cancellationsÃ¢ÂÂ that imply conditional independencies but do not rule out the existence of confounding causal paths.

The methods draw samples from an appropriate distribution of partial orders on the nodes, continued by sampling directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) conditionally on the sampled partial orders. We show that the computations needed for the sampling algorithms are feasible as long as the encountered partial orders have relatively few down-sets. While the algorithms assume suitable modularity properties of the priors, arbitrary priors can be handled by dividing the importance weight of each sampled DAG by the number of topological sorts it has---we give a practical dynamic programming algorithm to compute these numbers. Our empirical results demonstrate that the presented partial-order- based samplers are superior to previous Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, which sample DAGs either directly or via linear orders on the nodes. The results also suggest that the convergence rate of the estimators based on AIS are competitive to those of MC3. Thus AIS is the preferred method, as it enables easier large- scale parallelization and, in addition, supplies good probabilistic lower bound guarantees for the marginal likelihood of the model",

The bounds depend on the topology of the comparison graph induced by the subset of pairs being compared, via the spectrum of the Laplacian of the comparison graph. Thus, in settings where the subset of pairs may be chosen, our results provide principled guidelines for making this choice.

Strong convexity of local functions and Lipschitz continuity of local gradients is shown to guarantee linear convergence of the sequence generated by DSA in expectation. Local iterates are further shown to approach the optimal argument for almost all realizations. The expected linear convergence of DSA is in contrast to the sublinear rate characteristic of existing methods for decentralized stochastic optimization.

    "title": "Bayesian Policy Gradient and Actor-Critic Algorithms",
    "abstract": "Policy gradient methods are reinforcement learning algorithms that adapt a parameterized policy by following a performance gradient estimate. Many conventional policy gradient methods use Monte-Carlo techniques to estimate this gradient. The policy is improved by adjusting the parameters in the direction of the gradient estimate. Since Monte-Carlo methods tend to have high variance, a large number of samples is required to attain accurate estimates, resulting in slow convergence. In this paper, we first propose a Bayesian framework for policy gradient, based on modeling the policy gradient as a Gaussian process. This reduces the number of samples needed to obtain accurate gradient estimates. Moreover, estimates of the natural gradient as well as a measure of the uncertainty in the gradient estimates, namely, the gradient covariance, are provided at little extra cost. Since the proposed Bayesian framework considers system trajectories as its basic observable unit, it does not require the dynamics within trajectories to be of any particular form, and thus, can be easily extended to partially observable problems. On the downside, it cannot take advantage of the Markov property when the system is Markovian. To address this issue, we proceed to supplement our Bayesian policy gradient framework with a new actor-critic learning model in which a Bayesian class of non- parametric critics, based on Gaussian process temporal difference learning, is used. Such critics model the action- value function as a Gaussian process, allowing Bayes' rule to be used in computing the posterior distribution over action-value functions, conditioned on the observed data. Appropriate choices of the policy parameterization and of the prior covariance (kernel) between action-values allow us to obtain closed-form expressions for the posterior distribution of the gradient of the expected return with respect to the policy parameters. We perform detailed experimental comparisons of the proposed Bayesian policy gradient and actor-critic algorithms with classic Monte-Carlo based policy gradient methods, as well as with each other, on a number of reinforcement learning problems",

    "title": "Practical Kernel-Based Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract": "Kernel-based reinforcement learning (KBRL) stands out among approximate reinforcement learning algorithms for its strong theoretical guarantees. By casting the learning problem as a local kernel approximation, KBRL provides a way of computing a decision policy which converges to a unique solution and is statistically consistent. Unfortunately, the model constructed by KBRL grows with the number of sample transitions, resulting in a computational cost that precludes its application to large-scale or on-line domains. In this paper we introduce an algorithm that turns KBRL into a practical reinforcement learning tool. Kernel-based stochastic factorization (KBSF) builds on a simple idea: when a transition probability matrix is represented as the product of two stochastic matrices, one can swap the factors of the multiplication to obtain another transition matrix, potentially much smaller than the original, which retains some fundamental properties of its precursor. KBSF exploits such an insight to compress the information contained in KBRL's model into an approximator of fixed size. This makes it possible to build an approximation considering both the difficulty of the problem and the associated computational cost. KBSF's computational complexity is linear in the number of sample transitions, which is the best one can do without discarding data. Moreover, the algorithm's simple mechanics allow for a fully incremental implementation that makes the amount of memory used independent of the number of sample transitions. The result is a kernel-based reinforcement learning algorithm that can be applied to large-scale problems in both off-line and on-line regimes. We derive upper bounds for the distance between the value functions computed by KBRL and KBSF using the same data. We also prove that it is possible to control the magnitude of the variables appearing in our bounds, which means that, given enough computational resources, we can make KBSF's value function as close as desired to the value function that would be computed by KBRL using the same set of sample transitions. The potential of our algorithm is demonstrated in an extensive empirical study in which KBSF is applied to difficult tasks based on real-world data. Not only does KBSF solve problems that had never been solved before, but it also significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms on the tasks studied",

The proposed approach is particularly motivated by the setting in which the response is conditionally independent of the features given the projection to a low dimensional manifold. Conditionally on the random compression matrix and a smoothness parameter, the posterior distribution for the regression surface and posterior predictive distributions are available analytically. Running the analysis in parallel for many random compression matrices and smoothness parameters, model averaging is used to combine the results.

Due to computational issues with minimizing the empirical 0/1 loss, Fisher consistent losses have been proposed as viable proxies. However, even with smooth losses, direct minimization remains a daunting task. To approximate such a minimizer, various boosting algorithms have been suggested. For example, with exponential loss, the AdaBoost algorithm (Freund and Schapire, 1995) is widely used for two- class problems and has been extended to the multi-class setting (Zhu et al., 2009). Alternative loss functions, such as the logistic and the hinge losses, and their corresponding boosting algorithms have also been proposed (Zou et al., 2008; Wang, 2012).  In this paper we demonstrate that a broad class of losses, including non-convex functions, achieve Fisher consistency, and in addition can be used for explicit estimation of the conditional class probabilities. Furthermore, we provide a generic boosting algorithm that is not loss-specific. Extensive simulation results suggest that the proposed boosting algorithms could outperform existing methods with properly chosen losses and bags of weak learners",

    "abstract": "We present the path-sum formulation for exact statistical inference of marginals on Gaussian graphical models of arbitrary topology. The path-sum formulation gives the covariance between each pair of variables as a branched continued fraction of finite depth and breadth. Our method originates from the closed- form resummation of infinite families of terms of the walk-sum representation of the covariance matrix. We prove that the path- sum formulation always exists for models whose covariance matrix is positive definite: i.e. it is valid for both walk-summable and non-walk-summable graphical models of arbitrary topology.

We began right at the start of the \\kinect revolution when inexpensive infrared cameras providing image depth recordings became available. We published papers using this technology and other more conventional methods, including regular video cameras, to record data, thus providing a good overview of uses of machine learning and computer vision using multimodal data in this area of application. Notably, we organized a series of challenges and made available several datasets we recorded for that purpose, including tens of thousands of videos, which are available to conduct further research.

In particular, we show that varying the emphasis of linear TD($\\lambda$)'s updates in a particular way causes its expected update to become stable under off-policy training. The only prior model-free TD methods to achieve this with per- step computation linear in the number of function approximation parameters are the gradient-TD family of methods including TDC, GTD($\\lambda$), and GQ$\\lambda$). Compared to these methods, our emphatic TD($\\lambda$) is simpler and easier to use; it has only one learned parameter vector and one step-size parameter.

    "title": "Scaling-up Empirical Risk Minimization: Optimization of Incomplete $U$-statistics",
    "abstract": "In a wide range of statistical learning problems such as ranking, clustering or metric learning among others, the risk is accurately estimated by $U$-statistics of degree $d\\geq 1$, i.e. functionals of the training data with low variance that take the form of averages over $k$-tuples. From a computational perspective, the calculation of such statistics is highly expensive even for a moderate sample size $n$, as it requires averaging $O(n^d)$ terms. This makes learning procedures relying on the optimization of such data functionals hardly feasible in practice. It is the major goal of this paper to show that, strikingly, such empirical risks can be replaced by drastically computationally simpler Monte-Carlo estimates based on $O(n)$ terms only, usually referred to as incomplete $U$-statistics, without damaging the $O_{\\mathbb{P}}(1/\\sqrt{n})$ learning rate of Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) procedures. For this purpose, we establish uniform deviation results describing the error made when approximating a $U$-process by its incomplete version under appropriate complexity assumptions. Extensions to model selection, fast rate situations and various sampling techniques are also considered, as well as an application to stochastic gradient descent for ERM. Finally, numerical examples are displayed in order to provide strong empirical evidence that the approach we promote largely surpasses more naive subsampling techniques",

We propose a scalable approach for modeling and inferring latent spaces in Internet-scale networks, with an eye towards overlapping community detection as a key application. By applying a succinct representation of networks as a bag of triangular motifs, developing a parsimonious statistical model, deriving an efficient stochastic variational inference algorithm, and implementing it as a distributed cluster program via the Petuum parameter server system, we demonstrate overlapping community detection on real networks with up to 100 million nodes and 1000 communities on 5 machines in under 40 hours.

    "title": "Patient Risk Stratification with Time-Varying Parameters: A Multitask Learning Approach",
    "abstract": "The proliferation of electronic health records (EHRs) frames opportunities for using machine learning to build models that help healthcare providers improve patient outcomes. However, building useful risk stratification models presents many technical challenges including the large number of factors (both intrinsic and extrinsic) influencing a patient's risk of an adverse outcome and the inherent evolution of that risk over time. We address these challenges in the context of learning a risk stratification model for predicting which patients are at risk of acquiring a Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). We take a novel data-centric approach, leveraging the contents of EHRs from nearly 50,000 hospital admissions. We show how, by adapting techniques from multitask learning, we can learn models for patient risk stratification with unprecedented classification performance. Our model, based on thousands of variables, both time-varying and time-invariant, changes over the course of a patient admission. Applied to a held out set of approximately 25,000 patient admissions, we achieve an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.81 (95% CI 0.78-0.84). The model has been integrated into the health record system at a large hospital in the US, and can be used to produce daily risk estimates for each inpatient. While more complex than traditional risk stratification methods, the widespread development and use of such data-driven models could ultimately enable cost-effective, targeted prevention strategies that lead to better patient outcomes",

One of the components is used across all tasks and the other component is task-specific. Several previous methods can be proved to be special cases of our framework. We study the theoretical properties of this framework when different regularization conditions are applied to the two decomposed components. We prove that this framework is mathematically equivalent to the widely used multitask feature learning methods that are based on a joint regularization of all model parameters, but with a more general form of regularizers. Further, an analytical formula is derived for the across-task component as related to the task- specific component for all these regularizers, leading to a better understanding of the shrinkage effects of different regularizers. Study of this framework motivates new multitask learning algorithms. We propose two new learning formulations by varying the parameters in the proposed framework. An efficient blockwise coordinate descent algorithm is developed suitable for solving the entire family of formulations with rigorous convergence analysis. Simulation studies have identified the statistical properties of data that would be in favor of the new formulations. Extensive empirical studies on various classification and regression benchmark data sets have revealed the relative advantages of the two new formulations by comparing with the state of the art, which provides instructive insights into the feature learning problem with multiple tasks",

Many variable selection methods have been developed under various model assumptions. Whereas success has been widely reported in literature, their performances largely depend on validity of the assumed models, such as the linear or additive models. This article introduces a model-free variable selection method via learning the gradient functions. The idea is based on the equivalence between whether a variable is informative and whether its corresponding gradient function is substantially non-zero. The proposed variable selection method is then formulated in a framework of learning gradients in a flexible reproducing kernel Hilbert space. The key advantage of the proposed method is that it requires no explicit model assumption and allows for general variable effects. Its asymptotic estimation and selection consistencies are studied, which establish the convergence rate of the estimated sparse gradients and assure that the truly informative variables are correctly identified in probability. The effectiveness of the proposed method is also supported by a variety of simulated examples and two real-life examples",

Structured mammography reports and breast imaging features have long been part of a standard electronic health record (EHR), and genetic markers likely will be in the near future.

Recently, optimal algorithms based on Sliced Inverse Regression (SIR) were suggested. These algorithms work provably under the assumption that the design $X$ comes from an i.i.d.

In the present paper we analyze algorithms based on covariance screening and least squares with $L_1$ penalization (i.e. LASSO) and demonstrate that they can also enjoy optimal (up to a scalar) rescaled sample size in terms of support recovery, albeit under slightly different assumptions on $f$ and $\\varepsilon$ compared to the SIR based algorithms. Furthermore, we show more generally, that LASSO succeeds in recovering the signed support of $\\beta_0$ if $X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\Sigma)$, and the covariance $\\Sigma$ satisfies the irrepresentable condition.

We first show that this spectral seriation algorithm recovers the true ranking when all pairwise comparisons are observed and consistent with a total order. We then show that ranking reconstruction is still exact when some pairwise comparisons are corrupted or missing, and that seriation based spectral ranking is more robust to noise than classical scoring methods. Finally, we bound the ranking error when only a random subset of the comparions are observed. An additional benefit of the seriation formulation is that it allows us to solve semi-supervised ranking problems. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that seriation based spectral ranking achieves competitive and in some cases superior performance compared to classical ranking methods",

Are there some network structures which are more difficult than others to recover? Can we design efficient inference algorithms with provable  guarantees? Despite the increasing availability of cascade data and methods for inferring networks from these data, a thorough theoretical understanding of the above questions  remains largely unexplored in the literature. In this paper, we investigate the network structure inference problem for a general family of continuous- time diffusion models  using an $\\ell_1$-regularized likelihood maximization framework.

Moreover, we develop a  simple and efficient soft-thresholding network inference algorithm which demonstrate the match between our theoretical prediction and empirical results.

Real world settings are challenging due to large and continuous state-action spaces that are prohibitive for exhaustive sampling methods. We define the problem of learning sub-policies in continuous state action spaces as finding a hierarchical policy that is composed of a high-level gating policy to select the low-level sub-policies for execution by the agent. In order to efficiently share experience with all sub-policies, also called inter-policy learning, we treat these sub-policies as latent variables which allows for distribution of the update information between the sub-policies.

    "title": "Integrated Common Sense Learning and Planning in POMDPs",
    "abstract": "We formulate a new variant of the problem of planning in an unknown environment, for which we can provide algorithms with reasonable theoretical guarantees in spite of large state spaces and time horizons, partial observability, and complex dynamics. In this variant, an agent is given a collection of example traces produced by a reference policy, which may, for example, capture the agent's past behavior. The agent is (only) asked to find policies that are supported by regularities in the dynamics that are observable on these example traces. We describe an efficient algorithm that uses such common sense knowledge reflected in the example traces to construct decision tree policies for goal-oriented factored POMDPs. More precisely, our algorithm (provably) succeeds at finding a policy for a given input goal when (1) there is a CNF that is almost always observed satisfied on the traces of the POMDP, capturing a sufficient approximation of its dynamics and (2) for a decision tree policy of bounded complexity, there exist small- space resolution proofs that the goal is achieved on each branch using the aforementioned CNF capturing the common sense rules. Such a CNF always exists for noisy STRIPS domains, for example. Our results thus essentially establish that the possession of a suitable exploration policy for collecting the necessary examples is the fundamental obstacle to learning to act in such environments",

The RNNs can contain special units, the long short-term memory (LSTM) cells. They are able to learn long term dependencies but they get unstable when the dimension is chosen greater than one. We defined some useful and necessary properties for the one-dimensional LSTM cell and extend them in the multi-dimensional case. Thereby we introduce several new cells with better stability. We present a method to design cells using the theory of linear shift invariant systems. The new cells are compared to the LSTM cell on the IFN/ENIT and Rimes database, where we can improve the recognition rate compared to the LSTM cell. So each application where the LSTM cells in MDRNNs are used could be improved by substituting them by the new developed cells",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study flat and hierarchical classification strategies in the context of large-scale taxonomies. Addressing the problem from a learning-theoretic point of view, we first propose a multi-class, hierarchical data dependent bound on the generalization error of classifiers deployed in large-scale taxonomies. This bound provides an explanation to several empirical results reported in the literature, related to the performance of flat and hierarchical classifiers. Based on this bound, we also propose a technique for modifying a given taxonomy through pruning, that leads to a lower value of the upper bound as compared to the original taxonomy. We then present another method for hierarchy pruning by studying approximation error of a family of classifiers, and derive from it features used in a meta-classifier to decide which nodes to prune. We finally illustrate the theoretical developments through several experiments conducted on two widely used taxonomies",

Furthermore, we present numerical simulations suggesting that (i) optimal generative performance is achieved by subtracting mean values from visible as well as hidden variables, (ii) centered binary RBMs/DBMs reach significantly higher log-likelihood values than normal binary RBMs/DBMs, (iii) centering variants whose offsets depend on the model mean, like the enhanced gradient, suffer from severe divergence problems, (iv) learning is stabilized if an exponentially moving average over the batch means is used for the offset values instead of the current batch mean, which also prevents the enhanced gradient from severe divergence, (v) on a similar level of log-likelihood values centered binary RBMs/DBMs have smaller weights and bigger bias parameters than normal binary RBMs/DBMs, (vi) centering leads to an update direction that is closer to the natural gradient, which is extremely efficient for training as we show for small binary RBMs, (vii) centering eliminates the need for greedy layer-wise pre-training of DBMs, which often even deteriorates the results independently of whether centering is used or not, and (ix) centering is also beneficial for auto encoders",

    "abstract": "The instrumental variable method consistently estimates the effect of a treatment when there is unmeasured confounding and a valid instrumental variable. A valid instrumental variable is a variable that is independent of unmeasured confounders and affects the treatment but does not have a direct effect on the outcome beyond its effect on the treatment. Two commonly used estimators for using an instrumental variable to estimate a treatment effect are the two stage least squares estimator and the control function estimator. For linear causal effect models, these two estimators are equivalent, but for nonlinear causal effect models, the estimators are different. We provide a systematic comparison of these two estimators for nonlinear causal effect models and develop an approach to combing the two estimators that generally performs better than either one alone. We show that the control function estimator is a two stage least squares estimator with an augmented set of instrumental variables. If these augmented instrumental variables are valid, then the control function estimator can be much more efficient than usual two stage least squares without the augmented instrumental variables while if the augmented instrumental variables are not valid, then the control function estimator may be inconsistent while the usual two stage least squares remains consistent. We apply the Hausman test to test whether the augmented instrumental variables are valid and construct a pretest estimator based on this test. The pretest estimator is shown to work well in a simulation study. An application to the effect of exposure to violence on time preference is considered",

The Dawid-Skene estimator has been widely used for inferring the true labels from the noisy labels provided by non-expert crowdsourcing workers. However, since the estimator maximizes a non-convex log-likelihood function, it is hard to theoretically justify its performance. In this paper, we propose a two-stage efficient algorithm for multi-class crowd labeling problems. The first stage uses the spectral method to obtain an initial estimate of parameters. Then the second stage refines the estimation by optimizing the objective function of the Dawid-Skene estimator via the EM algorithm. We show that our algorithm achieves the optimal convergence rate up to a logarithmic factor. We conduct extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is comparable to the most accurate empirical approach, while outperforming several other recently proposed methods",

Our main objective is to assess the accuracy of the approximative LOO cross-validation estimators. That is, for each method (Laplace and EP) we compare the approximate fast computation with the exact brute force LOO computation. Secondarily, we evaluate the accuracy of the Laplace and EP approximations themselves against a ground truth established through extensive Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation.

In many applications an exhaustive search for the Pareto-optimal set is infeasible. To address this challenge, we propose the $\\epsilon$-Pareto Active Learning ($\\epsilon$-PAL) algorithm which adaptively samples the design space to predict a set of Pareto-optimal solutions that cover the true Pareto front of the design space with some granularity regulated by a parameter $\\epsilon$. Key features of $\\epsilon$-PAL include (1) modeling the objectives as draws from a Gaussian process distribution to capture structure and accommodate noisy evaluation; (2) a method to carefully choose the next design to evaluate to maximize progress; and (3) the ability to control prediction accuracy and sampling cost. We provide theoretical bounds on $\\epsilon$-PAL's sampling cost required to achieve a desired accuracy. Further, we perform an experimental evaluation on three real-world data sets that demonstrate $\\epsilon$-PAL's effectiveness; in comparison to the state-of-the-art active learning algorithm PAL, $\\epsilon$-PAL reduces the amount of computations and the number of samples from the design space required to meet the user's desired level of accuracy. In addition, we show that $\\epsilon$-PAL improves significantly over a state-of-the-art multi- objective optimization method, saving in most cases 30\\% to 70\\% evaluations to achieve the same accuracy",

    "abstract": "Parallel processing frameworks (Dean and Ghemawat, 2004) accelerate jobs by breaking them into tasks that execute in parallel. However, slow running or straggler tasks can run up to 8 times slower than the median task on a production cluster (Ananthanarayanan et al., 2013), leading to delayed job completion and inefficient use of resources. Existing straggler mitigation techniques wait to detect stragglers and then relaunch them, delaying straggler detection and wasting resources. We built Wrangler (Yadwadkar et al., 2014), a system that predicts when stragglers are going to occur and makes scheduling decisions to avoid such situations. To capture node and workload variability, Wrangler built separate models for every node and workload, requiring the time-consuming collection of substantial training data. In this paper, we propose multi- task learning formulations that share information between the various models, allowing us to use less training data and bring training time down from 4 hours to 40 minutes. Unlike naive multi-task learning formulations, our formulations capture the shared structure in our data, improving generalization performance on limited data. Finally, we extend these formulations using group sparsity inducing norms to automatically discover the similarities between tasks and improve interpretability",

Existing techniques that have attempted to match the distributions of the source and target domains typically compare these distributions in the original feature space. This space, however, may not be directly suitable for such a comparison, since some of the features may have been distorted by the domain shift, or may be domain specific. In this paper, we introduce a Distribution-Matching Embedding approach: An unsupervised domain adaptation method that overcomes this issue by mapping the data to a latent space where the distance between the empirical distributions of the source and target examples is minimized. In other words, we seek to extract the information that is invariant across the source and target data. In particular, we study two different distances to compare the source and target distributions: the Maximum Mean Discrepancy and the Hellinger distance. Furthermore, we show that our approach allows us to learn either a linear embedding, or a nonlinear one.

Surgical resection of the lesion is the most effective treatment to stop seizures. Technical advances in MRI have revolutionized the diagnosis of FCD, leading to high success rates for resective surgery. However, 45% of histologically confirmed FCD patients have normal MRIs (MRI-negative). Without a visible lesion, the success rate of surgery drops from 66% to 29%. In this work, we cast the problem of detecting potential FCD lesions using MRI scans of MRI-negative patients in an image segmentation framework based on hierarchical conditional random fields (HCRF). We use surface based morphometry to model the cortical surface as a two-dimensional surface which is then segmented at multiple scales to extract superpixels of different sizes. Each superpixel is assigned an outlier score by comparing it to a control population. The lesion is detected by fusing the outlier probabilities across multiple scales using a tree- structured HCRF.

A major challenge arising from data integration pertains to data heterogeneity in terms of study population, study design, or study coordination. Ignoring such heterogeneity in data analysis may result in biased estimation and misleading inference. Traditional techniques of remedy to data heterogeneity include the use of interactions and random effects, which are inferior to achieving desirable statistical power or providing a meaningful interpretation, especially when a large number of smaller data sets are combined. In this paper, we propose a regularized fusion method that allows us to identify and merge inter-study homogeneous parameter clusters in regression analysis, without the use of hypothesis testing approach. Using the fused lasso, we establish a computationally efficient procedure to deal with large-scale integrated data.

A popular approach to address this problem is the graphical lasso technique, which employs a sparsity-promoting regularization term. This paper derives a simple condition under which the computationally- expensive graphical lasso behaves the same as the simple heuristic method of thresholding. This condition depends only on the solution of graphical lasso and makes no direct use of the sample correlation matrix or the regularization coefficient. It is proved that this condition is always satisfied if the solution of graphical lasso is close to its first-order Taylor approximation or equivalently the regularization term is relatively large. This condition is tested on several random problems, and it is shown that graphical lasso and the thresholding method lead to highly similar results in the case where a sparse graph is sought. We also conduct two case studies on brain connectivity networks of twenty subjects based on fMRI data and the topology identification of electrical circuits to support the findings of this work on the similarity of graphical lasso and thresholding",

Existing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms for estimating these posterior probabilities are slow in mixing and convergence, especially for large networks. We present a novel Markov blanket resampling (MBR) scheme that intermittently reconstructs the Markov blanket of nodes, thus allowing the sampler to more effectively traverse low-probability regions between local maxima. As we can derive the complementary forward and backward directions of the MBR proposal distribution, the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm can be used to account for any asymmetries in these proposals. Experiments across a range of network sizes show that the MBR scheme outperforms other state- of-the-art algorithms, both in terms of learning performance and convergence rate. In particular, MBR achieves better learning performance than the other algorithms when the number of observations is relatively small and faster convergence when the number of variables in the network is large",

    "abstract": "Numerous learning problems that contain exploration, such as experiment design, multi-arm bandits, online routing, search result aggregation and many more, have been studied extensively in isolation. In this paper we consider a generic and efficiently computable method for action space exploration based on convex geometry. We define a novel geometric notion of an exploration mechanism with low variance called volumetric spanners, and give efficient algorithms to construct such spanners. We describe applications of this mechanism to the problem of optimal experiment design and the general framework for decision making under uncertainty of bandit linear optimization. For the latter we give efficient and near-optimal regret algorithm over general convex sets. Previously such results were known only for specific convex sets, or under special conditions such as the existence of an efficient self- concordant barrier for the underlying set",

In this paper, we propose to use  Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) approximations instead, where the relevant integrands are evaluated on a low-discrepancy sequence of points as opposed to random point sets as in the Monte Carlo approach. We derive a new discrepancy measure called box discrepancy based on theoretical characterizations of the integration error with respect to a given sequence. We then propose to learn QMC sequences adapted to our setting based on explicit box discrepancy minimization. Our theoretical analyses are complemented with empirical results that demonstrate the effectiveness of classical and adaptive QMC techniques for this problem",

    "abstract": "In high-dimensional data, structured noise caused by observed and unobserved factors affecting multiple target variables simultaneously, imposes a serious challenge for modeling, by masking the often weak signal. Therefore, (1) explaining away the structured noise in multiple-output regression is of paramount importance. Additionally, (2) assumptions about the correlation structure of the regression weights are needed. We note that both can be formulated in a natural way in a latent variable model, in which both the interesting signal and the noise are mediated through the same latent factors. Under this assumption, the signal model then borrows strength from the noise model by encouraging similar effects on correlated targets. We introduce a hyperparameter for the latent signal-to-noise ratio which turns out to be important for modelling weak signals, and an ordered infinite-dimensional shrinkage prior that resolves the rotational unidentifiability in reduced-rank regression models. Simulations and prediction experiments with metabolite, gene expression, FMRI measurement, and macroeconomic time series data show that our model equals or exceeds the state-of-the-art performance and, in particular, outperforms the standard approach of assuming independent noise and signal models",

    "title": "The Constrained Dantzig Selector with Enhanced Consistency",
    "abstract": "The Dantzig selector has received popularity for many applications such as compressed sensing and sparse modeling, thanks to its computational efficiency as a linear programming problem and its nice sampling properties. Existing results show that it can recover sparse signals mimicking the accuracy of the ideal procedure, up to a logarithmic factor of the dimensionality. Such a factor has been shown to hold for many regularization methods. An important question is whether this factor can be reduced to a logarithmic factor of the sample size in ultra-high dimensions under mild regularity conditions. To provide an affirmative answer, in this paper we suggest the constrained Dantzig selector, which has more flexible constraints and parameter space. We prove that the suggested method can achieve convergence rates within a logarithmic factor of the sample size of the oracle rates and improved sparsity, under a fairly weak assumption on the signal strength. Such improvement is significant in ultra-high dimensions. This method can be implemented efficiently through sequential linear programming. Numerical studies confirm that the sample size needed for a certain level of accuracy in these problems can be much reduced",

In the simplest case, with an isotropic noise model, our method is equivalent to a classical singular value shrinkage estimator. For non-isotropic noise models---e.g., Poisson noise---the method does not reduce to singular value shrinkage, and instead yields new estimators that perform well in experiments. Moreover, by iterating our stable autoencoding scheme, we can automatically generate low-rank estimates without specifying the target rank as a tuning parameter",

    "abstract": "Our paper deals with inferring simulator-based statistical models given some observed data. A simulator-based model is a parametrized mechanism which specifies how data are generated. It is thus also referred to as generative model. We assume that only a finite number of parameters are of interest and allow the generative process to be very general; it may be a noisy nonlinear dynamical system with an unrestricted number of hidden variables. This weak assumption is useful for devising realistic models but it renders statistical inference very difficult. The main challenge is the intractability of the likelihood function. Several likelihood-free inference methods have been proposed which share the basic idea of identifying the parameters by finding values for which the discrepancy between simulated and observed data is small. A major obstacle to using these methods is their computational cost. The cost is largely due to the need to repeatedly simulate data sets and the lack of knowledge about how the parameters affect the discrepancy. We propose a strategy which combines probabilistic modeling of the discrepancy with optimization to facilitate likelihood-free inference. The strategy is implemented using Bayesian optimization and is shown to accelerate the inference through a reduction in the number of required simulations by several orders of magnitude",

Applications of MIL include 3-D quantitative structure--activity relationship prediction for drug discovery and content-based image retrieval for web search. The goal of an algorithm is to learn a function that correctly labels new bags or a function that correctly labels new instances. We propose that bags should be treated as latent distributions from which samples are observed. We show that it is possible to learn accurate instance- and bag-labeling functions in this setting as well as functions that correctly rank bags or instances under weak assumptions. Additionally, our theoretical results suggest that it is possible to learn to rank efficiently using traditional, well-studied \"supervised\" learning approaches. We perform an extensive empirical evaluation that supports the theoretical predictions entailed by the new framework. The proposed theoretical framework leads to a better understanding of the relationship between the MI and standard supervised learning settings, and it provides new methods for learning from MI data that are more accurate, more efficient, and have better understood theoretical properties than existing MI-specific algorithms",

    "abstract": "The problem of approachability in repeated games with vector payoffs was introduced by Blackwell in the 1950s, along with geometric conditions and corresponding approachability strategies that rely on computing a sequence of direction vectors in the payoff space. For convex target sets, these vectors are obtained as projections from the current average payoff vector to the set. A recent paper by Abernethy, Batlett and Hazan (2011) proposed a class of approachability algorithms that rely on Online Linear Programming for obtaining alternative sequences of direction vectors. This is first implemented for target sets that are convex cones, and then generalized to any convex set by embedding it in a higher-dimensional convex cone. In this paper we present a more direct formulation that relies on general Online Convex Optimization (OCO) algorithms, along with basic properties of the support function of convex sets. This leads to a general class of approachability algorithms, depending on the choice of the OCO algorithm and the used norms. Blackwell's original algorithm and its convergence are recovered when Follow The Leader (or a regularized version thereof) is used for the OCO algorithm",

The proposed estimators are obtained by minimizing the quadratic loss function and joint penalty of $\\ell_1$ norm and variance of its eigenvalues. In contrast to some of the existing methods of covariance and inverse covariance matrix estimation, where often the interest is to estimate a sparse matrix, the proposed method is flexible in estimating both a sparse and well-conditioned covariance matrix simultaneously. The proposed estimators are optimal in the sense that they achieve the mini-max rate of estimation in operator norm for the underlying class of covariance and inverse covariance matrices. We give a very fast algorithm for computation of these covariance and inverse covariance matrices which is easily scalable to large scale data analysis problems. The simulation study for varying sample sizes and variables shows that the proposed estimators performs better than several other estimators for various choices of structured covariance and inverse covariance matrices.

Firstly, we introduce a class of stochastic processes we refer to as string Gaussian processes (string GPs which are not to be mistaken for Gaussian processes operating on text). We construct string GPs so that their finite- dimensional marginals exhibit suitable local conditional independence structures, which allow for scalable, distributed, and flexible nonparametric Bayesian inference, without resorting to approximations, and while ensuring some mild global regularity constraints. Furthermore, string GP priors naturally cope with heterogeneous input data, and the gradient of the learned latent function is readily available for explanatory analysis. Secondly, we provide some theoretical results relating our approach to the standard GP paradigm. In particular, we prove that some string GPs are Gaussian processes, which provides a complementary global perspective on our framework. Finally, we derive a scalable and distributed MCMC scheme for supervised learning tasks under string GP priors. The proposed MCMC scheme has computational time complexity $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ and memory requirement $\\mathcal{O}(dN)$, where $N$ is the data size and $d$ the dimension of the input space.

    "abstract": "Systematic reviews underpin Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) by addressing precise clinical questions via comprehensive synthesis of all relevant published evidence. Authors of systematic reviews typically define a Population/Problem, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome (a PICO criteria) of interest, and then retrieve, appraise and synthesize results from all reports of clinical trials that meet these criteria. Identifying PICO elements in the full-texts of trial reports is thus a critical yet time-consuming step in the systematic review process. We seek to expedite evidence synthesis by developing machine learning models to automatically extract sentences from articles relevant to PICO elements. Collecting a large corpus of training data for this task would be prohibitively expensive. Therefore, we derive distant supervision (DS) with which to train models using previously conducted reviews. DS entails heuristically deriving 'soft' labels from an available structured resource. However, we have access only to unstructured, free-text summaries of PICO elements for corresponding articles; we must derive from these the desired sentence-level annotations. To this end, we propose a novel method -- supervised distant supervision (SDS) -- that uses a small amount of direct supervision to better exploit a large corpus of distantly labeled instances by learning to pseudo-annotate articles using the available DS. We show that this approach tends to outperform existing methods with respect to automated PICO extraction",

In this paper, we aim to bridge the gap between adjustment of measures based on pair- counting and measures based on information theory. We solve the key technical challenge of analytically computing the expected value and variance of generalized IT measures. This allows us to propose adjustments of generalized IT measures, which reduce to well known adjusted clustering comparison measures as special cases.

    "abstract": "There is a widespread need for statistical methods that can analyze high-dimensional datasets without imposing restrictive or opaque modeling assumptions. This paper describes a domain- general data analysis method called CrossCat. CrossCat infers multiple non-overlapping views of the data, each consisting of a subset of the variables, and uses a separate nonparametric mixture to model each view. CrossCat is based on approximately Bayesian inference in a hierarchical, nonparametric model for data tables. This model consists of a Dirichlet process mixture over the columns of a data table in which each mixture component is itself an independent Dirichlet process mixture over the rows; the inner mixture components are simple parametric models whose form depends on the types of data in the table. CrossCat combines strengths of mixture modeling and Bayesian network structure learning. Like mixture modeling, CrossCat can model a broad class of distributions by positing latent variables, and produces representations that can be efficiently conditioned and sampled from for prediction. Like Bayesian networks, CrossCat represents the dependencies and independencies between variables, and thus remains accurate when there are multiple statistical signals. Inference is done via a scalable Gibbs sampling scheme; this paper shows that it works well in practice. This paper also includes empirical results on heterogeneous tabular data of up to 10 million cells, such as hospital cost and quality measures, voting records, unemployment rates, gene expression measurements, and images of handwritten digits. CrossCat infers structure that is consistent with accepted findings and common-sense knowledge in multiple domains and yields predictive accuracy competitive with generative, discriminative, and model-free alternatives",

The core of these algorithms are the regularized extensions of the Least- Squares Temporal Difference (LSTD) learning and Bellman Residual Minimization (BRM), which are used in the algorithms' policy evaluation steps. Regularization provides a convenient way to control the complexity of the function space to which the estimated value function belongs and as a result enables us to work with rich nonparametric function spaces. We derive efficient implementations of our methods when the function space is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We analyze the statistical properties of REG-LSPI and provide an upper bound on the policy evaluation error and the performance loss of the policy returned by this method. Our bound shows the dependence of the loss on the number of samples, the capacity of the function space, and some intrinsic properties of the underlying Markov Decision Process. The dependence of the policy evaluation bound on the number of samples is minimax optimal. This is the first work that provides such a strong guarantee for a nonparametric approximate policy iteration algorithm.

It is much cheaper and easier to collect large quantities of image-level labels from search engines than it is to collect scene-centric images with precisely localized labels. We develop methods for learning large scale recognition models which exploit joint training over both weak (image-level) and strong (bounding box) labels and which transfer learned perceptual representations from strongly-labeled auxiliary tasks. We provide a novel formulation of a joint multiple instance learning method that includes examples from object-centric data with image-level labels when available, and also performs domain transfer learning to improve the underlying detector representation.

    "title": "Covariance-based Clustering in Multivariate and Functional Data Analysis",
    "abstract": "In this paper we propose a new algorithm to perform clustering of multivariate and functional data. We study the case of two populations different in their covariances, rather than in their means. The algorithm relies on a proper quantification of distance between the estimated covariance operators of the populations, and subdivides data in two groups maximising the distance between their induced covariances. The naive implementation of such an algorithm is computationally forbidding, so we propose a heuristic formulation with a much lighter complexity and we study its convergence properties, along with its computational cost. We also propose to use an enhanced estimator for the estimation of discrete covariances of functional data, namely a linear shrinkage estimator, in order to improve the precision of the clustering. We establish the effectiveness of our algorithm through applications to both synthetic data and a real data set coming from a biomedical context, showing also how the use of shrinkage estimation may lead to substantially better results",

    "title": "MOCCA: Mirrored Convex/Concave Optimization for Nonconvex Composite Functions",
    "abstract": "Many optimization problems arising in high-dimensional statistics decompose naturally into a sum of several terms, where the individual terms are relatively simple but the composite objective function can only be optimized with iterative algorithms. In this paper, we are interested in optimization problems of the form $F(Kx) + G(x)$, where $K$ is a fixed linear transformation, while $F$ and $G$ are functions that may be nonconvex and/or nondifferentiable. In particular, if either of the terms are nonconvex, existing alternating minimization techniques may fail to converge; other types of existing approaches may instead be unable to handle nondifferentiability. We propose the MOCCA (mirrored convex/concave) algorithm, a primal/dual optimization approach that takes a local convex approximation to each term at every iteration. Inspired by optimization problems arising in computed tomography (CT) imaging, this algorithm can handle a range of nonconvex composite optimization problems, and offers theoretical guarantees for convergence when the overall problem is approximately convex (that is, any concavity in one term is balanced out by convexity in the other term). Empirical results show fast convergence for several structured signal recovery problems",

    "title": "True Online Temporal-Difference Learning",
    "abstract": "The temporal-difference methods TD($\\lambda$) and Sarsa($\\lambda$) form a core part of modern reinforcement learning. Their appeal comes from their good performance, low computational cost, and their simple interpretation, given by their forward view. Recently, new versions of these methods were introduced, called true online TD($\\lambda$) and true online Sarsa($\\lambda$), respectively (van Seijen & Sutton, 2014). Algorithmically, these true online methods only make two small changes to the update rules of the regular methods, and the extra computational cost is negligible in most cases. However, they follow the ideas underlying the forward view much more closely. In particular, they maintain an exact equivalence with the forward view at all times, whereas the traditional versions only approximate it for small step-sizes. We hypothesize that these true online methods not only have better theoretical properties, but also dominate the regular methods empirically. In this article, we put this hypothesis to the test by performing an extensive empirical comparison. Specifically, we compare the performance of true online TD($\\lambda$)/Sarsa($\\lambda$) with regular TD($\\lambda$)/Sarsa($\\lambda$) on random MRPs, a real-world myoelectric prosthetic arm, and a domain from the Arcade Learning Environment. We use linear function approximation with tabular, binary, and non-binary features. Our results suggest that the true online methods indeed dominate the regular methods. Across all domains/representations the learning speed of the true online methods are often better, but never worse than that of the regular methods. An additional advantage is that no choice between traces has to be made for the true online methods. Besides the empirical results, we provide an in-dept analysis of the theory behind true online temporal-difference learning. In addition, we show that new true online temporal- difference methods can be derived by making changes to the online forward view and then rewriting the update equations",

We establish the consistency of the estimator in a high-dimensional setting.

    "abstract": "Local network community detection is the task of finding a single community of nodes concentrated around few given seed nodes in a localized way. Conductance is a popular objective function used in many algorithms for local community detection. This paper studies a continuous relaxation of conductance. We show that continuous optimization of this objective still leads to discrete communities. We investigate the relation of conductance with weighted kernel k-means for a single community, which leads to the introduction of a new objective function, $\\sigma$-conductance. Conductance is obtained by setting $\\sigma$ to $0$. Two algorithms, EMc and PGDc, are proposed to locally optimize $\\sigma$-conductance and automatically tune the parameter $\\sigma$. They are based on expectation maximization and projected gradient descent, respectively. We prove locality and give performance guarantees for EMc and PGDc for a class of dense and well separated communities centered around the seeds. Experiments are conducted on networks with ground-truth communities, comparing to state-of-the-art graph diffusion algorithms for conductance optimization. On large graphs, results indicate that EMc and PGDc stay localized and produce communities most similar to the ground, while graph diffusion algorithms generate large communities of lower quality.

Under a flexible problem setup, we establish asymptotic strong consistency and perform a finite- time regret analysis for a sequential randomized allocation strategy based on kernel estimation. In addition, since many nonparametric and parametric methods in supervised learning may be applied to estimating the mean reward functions but guidance on how to choose among them is generally unavailable, we propose a model combining allocation strategy for adaptive performance.

We also establish the corresponding convergence rate within each region. Under general spike covariance models, the dimension (or number of variables) discourages the consistency of PCA, while the sample size and spike information (the relative size of the population eigenvalues) encourage PCA consistency. Our framework nicely illustrates the relationship among these three types of information in terms of dimension, sample size and spike size, and rigorously characterizes how their relationships affect PCA consistency",

Both conditions have been extensively used for causal inference by refuting factorizations for which the condition does not hold. Violation of faithfulness happens when there are CIs that do not follow from the Markov condition. For those CIs, non-trivial constraints among some parameters of the Conditional Probability Distributions (CPDs) must hold. When such a constraint is defined over parameters of different CPDs, we prove that IC is also violated unless the parameters have a simple description. To understand which non-Markovian CIs are permitted we define a new condition closely related to IC: the Independence from Product Constraints (IPC). The condition reflects that CIs might be the result of specific parameterizations of individual CPDs but not from constraints on parameters of different CPDs. In that sense it is more restrictive than IC: parameters may have a simple description. On the other hand, IC also excludes other forms of algorithmic dependencies between CPDs. Finally, we prove that on top of the CIs permitted by the Markov condition (faithfulness), IPC allows non-minimality, deterministic relations and what we called proportional CPDs. These are the only cases in which a CI follows from a specific parameterization of a single CPD",

    "title": "Learning Theory for Distribution Regression",
    "abstract": "We focus on the distribution regression problem: regressing to vector-valued outputs from probability measures. Many important machine learning and statistical tasks fit into this framework, including multi-instance learning and point estimation problems without analytical solution (such as hyperparameter or entropy estimation). Despite the large number of available heuristics in the literature, the inherent two-stage sampled nature of the problem makes the theoretical analysis quite challenging, since in practice only samples from sampled distributions are observable, and the estimates have to rely on similarities computed between sets of points. To the best of our knowledge, the only existing technique with consistency guarantees for distribution regression requires kernel density estimation as an intermediate step (which often performs poorly in practice), and the domain of the distributions to be compact Euclidean. In this paper, we study a simple, analytically computable, ridge regression-based alternative to distribution regression, where we embed the distributions to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, and learn the regressor from the embeddings to the outputs. Our main contribution is to prove that this scheme is consistent in the two-stage sampled setup under mild conditions (on separable topological domains enriched with kernels): we present an exact computational-statistical efficiency trade-off analysis showing that our estimator is able to match the  one-stage sampled minimax optimal rate (Caponnetto and De Vito, 2007; Steinwart et al., 2009). This result answers a $17 $-year-old open question, establishing the consistency of the classical set kernel (Haussler, 1999; GÃÂ¤rtner et al., 2002) in regression. We also cover consistency for more recent kernels on distributions, including those due to Christmann and Steinwart (2010)",

Our new method, called Geometric Resampling (GR), is described and analyzed in the context of online combinatorial optimization under semi-bandit feedback, where a learner sequentially selects its actions from a combinatorial decision set so as to minimize its cumulative loss. In particular, we show that the well-known Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader (FPL) prediction method coupled with Geometric Resampling yields the first computationally efficient reduction from offline to online optimization in this setting. We provide a thorough theoretical analysis for the resulting algorithm, showing that its performance is on par with previous, inefficient solutions. Our main contribution is showing that, despite the relatively large variance induced by the GR procedure, our performance guarantees hold with high probability rather than only in expectation. As a side result, we also improve the best known regret bounds for FPL in online combinatorial optimization with full feedback, closing the perceived performance gap between FPL and exponential weights in this setting.

Centering the norm is important for multitask learning and we also provide a method to use centered versions of the norms as regularizers.

The proposed minimum density hyperplane minimises the integral of the empirical probability density function along it, thereby avoiding intersection with high density clusters. We show that the minimum density and the maximum margin hyperplanes are asymptotically equivalent, thus linking this approach to maximum margin clustering and semi-supervised support vector classifiers. We propose a projection pursuit formulation of the associated optimisation problem which allows us to find minimum density hyperplanes efficiently in practice, and evaluate its performance on a range of benchmark data sets.

    "abstract": "Applying standard Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms to large data sets is computationally infeasible. The recently proposed stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) method circumvents this problem in three ways: it generates proposed moves using only a subset of the data, it skips the Metropolis- Hastings accept-reject step, and it uses sequences of decreasing step sizes. In Teh et al. (2014), we provided the mathematical foundations for the decreasing step size SGLD, including consistency and a central limit theorem. However, in practice the SGLD is run for a relatively small number of iterations, and its step size is not decreased to zero. The present article investigates the behaviour of the SGLD with fixed step size. In particular we characterise the asymptotic bias explicitly, along with its dependence on the step size and the variance of the stochastic gradient. On that basis a modified SGLD which removes the asymptotic bias due to the variance of the stochastic gradients up to first order in the step size is derived. Moreover, we are able to obtain bounds on the finite-time bias, variance and mean squared error (MSE). The theory is illustrated with a Gaussian toy model for which the bias and the MSE for the estimation of moments can be obtained explicitly. For this toy model we study the gain of the SGLD over the standard Euler method in the limit of large data sets",

Of particular interest to us is to efficiently solve problems with decoupled constraints, in which subsets of the objective and constraint functions may be evaluated independently. For example, when the objective is evaluated on a CPU and the constraints are evaluated independently on a GPU. These problems require an acquisition function that can be separated into the contributions of the individual function evaluations. We develop one such acquisition function and call it Predictive Entropy Search with Constraints (PESC). PESC is an approximation to the expected information gain criterion and it compares favorably to alternative approaches based on improvement in several synthetic and real- world problems. In addition to this, we consider problems with a mix of functions that are fast and slow to evaluate. These problems require balancing the amount of time spent in the meta- computation of PESC and in the actual evaluation of the target objective. We take a bounded rationality approach and develop a partial update for PESC which trades off accuracy against speed. We then propose a method for adaptively switching between the partial and full updates for PESC. This allows us to interpolate between versions of PESC that are efficient in terms of function evaluations and those that are efficient in terms of wall-clock time. Overall, we demonstrate that PESC is an effective algorithm that provides a promising direction towards a unified solution for constrained Bayesian optimization",

Example results illustrate interesting relationships between the width of the first layer and the inferred network structure, and demonstrate that the GBN can add more layers to improve its performance in both unsupervisedly extracting features and predicting heldout data. For exploratory data analysis, we extract trees and subnetworks from the learned deep network to visualize how the very specific factors discovered at the first hidden layer and the increasingly more general factors discovered at deeper hidden layers are related to each other, and we generate synthetic data by propagating random variables through the deep network from the top hidden layer back to the bottom data layer",

Crowdsourcing is cheap and fast, but suffers from the problem of low-quality data. To address this fundamental challenge in crowdsourcing, we propose a simple payment mechanism to incentivize workers to answer only the questions that they are sure of and skip the rest. We show that surprisingly, under a mild and natural no-free-lunch requirement, this mechanism is the one and only incentive-compatible payment mechanism possible. We also show that among all possible incentive- compatible mechanisms (that may or may not satisfy no-free- lunch), our mechanism makes the smallest possible payment to spammers. We further extend our results to a more general setting in which workers are required to provide a quantized confidence for each question. Interestingly, this unique mechanism takes a multiplicative form. The simplicity of the mechanism is an added benefit. In preliminary experiments involving over 900 worker-task pairs, we observe a significant drop in the error rates under this unique mechanism for the same or lower monetary expenditure",

    "title": "Joint Structural Estimation of Multiple Graphical Models",
    "abstract": "Gaussian graphical models capture dependence relationships between random variables through the pattern of nonzero elements in the corresponding inverse covariance matrices. To date, there has been a large body of literature on both computational methods and analytical results on the estimation of a single graphical model. However, in many application domains, one has to estimate several related graphical models, a problem that has also received attention in the literature. The available approaches usually assume that all graphical models are globally related. On the other hand, in many settings different relationships between subsets of the node sets exist between different graphical models. We develop methodology that jointly estimates multiple Gaussian graphical models, assuming that there exists prior information on how they are structurally related. For many applications, such information is available from external data sources. The proposed method consists of first applying neighborhood selection with a group lasso penalty to obtain edge sets of the graphs, and a maximum likelihood refit for estimating the nonzero entries in the inverse covariance matrices. We establish consistency of the proposed method for sparse high-dimensional Gaussian graphical models and examine its performance using simulation experiments. Applications to a climate data set and a breast cancer data set are also discussed",

    "title": "Support Vector Hazards Machine: A Counting Process Framework for Learning Risk Scores for Censored Outcomes",
    "abstract": "Learning risk scores to predict dichotomous or continuous outcomes using machine learning approaches has been studied extensively. However, how to learn risk scores for time-to-event outcomes subject to right censoring has received little attention until recently. Existing approaches rely on inverse probability weighting or rank-based regression, which may be inefficient. In this paper, we develop a new support vector hazards machine (SVHM) approach to predict censored outcomes. Our method is based on predicting the counting process associated with the time-to-event outcomes among subjects at risk via a series of support vector machines. Introducing counting processes to represent time-to-event data leads to a connection between support vector machines in supervised learning and hazards regression in standard survival analysis. To account for different at risk populations at observed event times, a time-varying offset is used in estimating risk scores. The resulting optimization is a convex quadratic programming problem that can easily incorporate non-linearity using kernel trick. We demonstrate an interesting link from the profiled empirical risk function of SVHM to the Cox partial likelihood. We then formally show that SVHM is optimal in discriminating covariate-specific hazard function from population average hazard function, and establish the consistency and learning rate of the predicted risk using the estimated risk scores. Simulation studies show improved prediction accuracy of the event times using SVHM compared to existing machine learning methods and standard conventional approaches. Finally, we analyze two real world biomedical study data where we use clinical markers and neuroimaging biomarkers to predict age-at- onset of a disease, and demonstrate superiority of SVHM in distinguishing high risk versus low risk subjects",

In this paper, we introduce $\\alpha$-stable graphical ($\\alpha$-SG) models, a class of multivariate stable densities that can also be represented as Bayesian networks whose edges encode linear dependencies between random variables. One major hurdle to the extensive use of stable distributions is the lack of a closed- form analytical expression for their densities. This makes penalized maximum-likelihood based learning computationally demanding. We establish theoretically that the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) can asymptotically be reduced to the computationally more tractable minimum dispersion criterion (MDC) and develop StabLe, a structure learning algorithm based on MDC. We use simulated datasets for five benchmark network topologies to empirically demonstrate how  StabLe improves upon ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. We also apply StabLe to microarray gene expression data for lymphoblastoid cells from 727 individuals belonging to eight global population groups. We establish that StabLe improves test set performance relative to OLS via ten-fold cross-validation. Finally, we develop SGEX, a method for quantifying differential expression of genes between different population groups",

    "abstract": "Training a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with algorithms employing global search strategies has been an important research direction in the field of neural networks. Despite a number of significant results, an important matter concerning the bounds of the search region---typically defined as a box---where a global optimization method has to search for a potential global minimizer seems to be unresolved. The approach presented in this paper builds on interval analysis and attempts to define guaranteed bounds in the search space prior to applying a global search algorithm for training an MLP. These bounds depend on the machine precision and the term guaranteed denotes that the region defined surely encloses weight sets that are global minimizers of the neural network's error function. Although the solution set to the bounding problem for an MLP is in general non-convex, the paper presents the theoretical results that help deriving a box which is a convex set. This box is an outer approximation of the algebraic solutions to the interval equations resulting from the function implemented by the network nodes. An experimental study using well known benchmarks is presented in accordance with the theoretical results",

This paper proposes and studies an approach, called feature-level domain adaptation (FLDA), that models the dependence between the two domains by means of a feature-level transfer model that is trained to describe the transfer from source to target domain. Subsequently, we train a domain-adapted classifier by minimizing the expected loss under the resulting transfer model. For linear classifiers and a large family of loss functions and transfer models, this expected loss can be computed or approximated analytically, and minimized efficiently. Our empirical evaluation of FLDA focuses on problems comprising binary and count data in which the transfer can be naturally modeled via a dropout distribution, which allows the classifier to adapt to differences in the marginal probability of features in the source and the target domain. Our experiments on several real- world problems show that FLDA performs on par with state- of- the-art domain-adaptation techniques",

The conventional local GP approach first partitions a domain into multiple non-overlapping local regions, and then fits an independent GP regression for each local region using the training data belonging to the region. Two key issues with the local GP are (1) the prediction around the boundary of a local region is not as accurate as the prediction at interior of the local region, and (2) two local GP regressions for two neighboring local regions produce different predictions at the boundary of the two regions, creating undesirable discontinuity in the prediction. We address these issues by constraining the predictions of local GP regressions sharing a common boundary to satisfy the same boundary constraints, which in turn are estimated by the data. The boundary constrained local GP regressions are solved by a finite element method. Our approach shows competitive performance when compared with several state- of-the-art methods using two synthetic data sets and three real data sets",

    "abstract": "We connect shift-invariant characteristic kernels to infinitely divisible distributions on $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$. Characteristic kernels play an important role in machine learning applications with their kernel means to distinguish any two probability measures. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we show, using the Levy--Khintchine formula, that any shift- invariant kernel given by a bounded, continuous, and symmetric probability density function (pdf) of an infinitely divisible distribution on $\\mathbb{R}^d$ is characteristic. We mention some closure properties of such characteristic kernels under addition, pointwise product, and convolution. Second, in developing various kernel mean algorithms, it is fundamental to compute the following values: (i) kernel mean values $m_P(x)$, $x \\in \\mathcal{X}$, and (ii) kernel mean RKHS inner products ${\\left\\langle m_P, m_Q \\right\\rangle _{\\mathcal{H}}}$, for probability measures $P, Q$. If $P, Q$, and kernel $k$ are Gaussians, then the computation of (i) and (ii) results in Gaussian pdfs that are tractable. We generalize this Gaussian combination to more general cases in the class of infinitely divisible distributions. We then introduce a conjugate kernel and a convolution trick, so that the above (i) and (ii) have the same pdf form, expecting tractable computation at least in some cases. As specific instances, we explore $\\alpha$-stable distributions and a rich class of generalized hyperbolic distributions, where the Laplace, Cauchy, and Student's $t$ distributions are included",

    "abstract": "While machine learning has proven to be a powerful data-driven solution to many real-life problems,  its use in sensitive domains has been limited due to privacy concerns.  A popular approach known as differential privacy offers provable privacy guarantees, but it is  often observed in practice that it could substantially hamper learning accuracy. In this paper we study the learnability (whether a problem can be learned by any algorithm)  under Vapnik's general learning setting with differential privacy constraint, and reveal some  intricate relationships between privacy, stability and learnability. In particular, we show that a problem is privately learnable if an only if there is a private algorithm that asymptotically minimizes the empirical risk (AERM).  In contrast, for non- private learning AERM alone is not sufficient for learnability. This result suggests that when searching for private learning algorithms, we can restrict the search to algorithms  that are AERM. In light of this, we propose a conceptual procedure that always finds a universally consistent algorithm  whenever the problem is learnable under privacy constraint.  We also propose a generic and practical algorithm and show that under very general conditions it privately learns a wide  class of learning problems.  Lastly, we extend some of the results to the more practical $(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-differential privacy and establish the existence of a phase-transition on the class of problems that are approximately privately learnable with respect  to how small $\\delta$ needs to be",

These features may be used to identify at-risk patients and improve prediction of patient morbidity and mortality. We present a novel deep multi-modality architecture for EHR analysis (applicable to joint analysis of multiple forms of EHR data), based on Poisson Factor Analysis (PFA) modules. Each modality, composed of observed counts, is represented as a Poisson distribution, parameterized in terms of hidden binary units. Information from different modalities is shared via a deep hierarchy of common hidden units. Activation of these binary units occurs with probability characterized as Bernoulli- Poisson link functions, instead of more traditional logistic link functions. In addition, we demonstrate that PFA modules can be adapted to discriminative modalities. To compute model parameters, we derive efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inference that scales efficiently, with significant computational gains when compared to related models based on logistic link functions. To explore the utility of these models, we apply them to a subset of patients from the Duke-Durham patient cohort. We identified a cohort of over 16,000 patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) based on diagnosis codes and laboratory tests out of our patient population of over 240,000. Examining the common hidden units uniting the PFA modules, we identify patient features that represent medical concepts.

    "abstract": "Cluster analysis by nonnegative low-rank approximations has experienced a remarkable progress in the past decade. However, the majority of such approximation approaches are still restricted to nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) and suffer from the following two drawbacks: 1) they are unable to produce balanced partitions for large-scale manifold data which are common in real-world clustering tasks; 2) most existing NMF-type clustering methods cannot automatically determine the number of clusters. We propose a new low-rank learning method to address these two problems, which is beyond matrix factorization. Our method approximately decomposes a sparse input similarity in a normalized way and its objective can be used to learn both cluster assignments and the number of clusters. For efficient optimization, we use a relaxed formulation based on Data- Cluster-Data random walk, which is also shown to be equivalent to low-rank factorization of the doubly-stochastically normalized cluster incidence matrix. The probabilistic cluster assignments can thus be learned with a multiplicative majorization-minimization algorithm.

    "title": "Classification of Imbalanced Data with a Geometric Digraph Family",
    "abstract": "We use a geometric digraph family called class cover catch digraphs (CCCDs) to tackle the class imbalance problem in statistical classification. CCCDs provide graph theoretic solutions to the class cover problem and have been employed in classification. We assess the classification performance of CCCD classifiers by extensive Monte Carlo simulations, comparing them with other classifiers commonly used in the literature. In particular, we show that CCCD classifiers perform relatively well when one class is more frequent than the other in a two- class setting, an example of the class imbalance problem. We also point out the relationship between class imbalance and class overlapping problems, and their influence on the performance of CCCD classifiers and other classification methods as well as some state-of-the-art algorithms which are robust to class imbalance by construction. Experiments on both simulated and real data sets indicate that CCCD classifiers are robust to the class imbalance problem. CCCDs substantially undersample from the majority class while preserving the information on the discarded points during the undersampling process. Many state- of-the-art methods, however, keep this information by means of ensemble classifiers, but CCCDs yield only a single classifier with the same property, making it both appealing and fast",

    "title": "A Variational Approach to Path Estimation and Parameter Inference of Hidden Diffusion Processes",
    "abstract": "We consider a hidden Markov model, where the signal process, given by a diffusion, is only indirectly observed through some noisy measurements. The article develops a variational method for approximating the hidden states of the signal process given the full set of observations. This, in particular, leads to systematic approximations of the smoothing densities of the signal process. The paper then demonstrates how an efficient inference scheme, based on this variational approach to the approximation of the hidden states, can be designed to estimate the unknown parameters of stochastic differential equations. Two examples at the end illustrate the efficacy and the accuracy of the presented method",
