    "abstract": "In this paper, we study a novel problem, Minimum Robust Multi-Submodular Cover for Fairness (MinRF), as follows: given a ground set V; m monotone submodular functions f_1,...,f_m; m thresholds T_1,...,T_m and a non-negative integer r; MinRF asks for the smallest set S such that f_i(S \\ X) ≥ T_i for all i ∈ [m] and |X| ≤ r. We prove that MinRF is inapproximable within (1- ε) ln m; and no algorithm, taking fewer than exponential number of queries in term of r, is able to output a feasible set to MinRF with high certainty. Three bicriteria approximation algorithms with performance guarantees are proposed: one for r = 0, one for r = 1, and one for general r. We further investigate our algorithms' performance in two applications of MinRF, Information Propagation for Multiple Groups and Movie Recommendation for Multiple Users. Our algorithms have shown to outperform baseline heuristics in both solution quality and the number of queries in most cases",

Keeping guessing the target document in mind, it converses with the user conditioned on both document engagement and user feedback. In order to incorporate large-scale external documents into the dialogue, it pretrains a document representation which is sensitive to attributes it talks about an object. Then it tracks dialogue state by detecting evolvement of document belief and attribute belief, and finally optimizes dialogue policy in principle of entropy decreasing and reward increasing, which is expected to successfully guess the user's target in a minimum number of turns. Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms several strong baseline methods and is very close to human's performance",

    "abstract": "Natural language inference (NLI) is a fundamental NLP task, investigating the entailment relationship between two texts.  Popular NLI datasets present the task at sentence-level. While adequate for testing semantic representations, they fall short for testing contextual reasoning over long texts, which is a natural part of the human inference process. We introduce ConTRoL, a new dataset for ConTextual Reasoning over Long texts. Consisting of 8,325 expert-designed \"context-hypothesis\" pairs with gold labels, ConTRoL is a passage-level NLI dataset with a focus on complex contextual reasoning types such as logical reasoning. It is derived from competitive selection and recruitment test (verbal reasoning test) for police recruitment, with expert level quality. Compared with previous NLI benchmarks, the materials in ConTRoL are much more challenging, involving a range of reasoning types. Empirical results show that state-of-the-art language models perform by far worse than educated humans. Our dataset can also serve as a testing-set for downstream tasks like checking the factual correctness of summaries",

    "title": "How to Train Your Agent to Read and Write",
    "abstract": "Reading and writing research papers is one of the most privileged abilities that a qualified researcher should master. However, it is difficult for new researchers (e.g., students) to fully grasp this ability. It would be fascinating if we could train an intelligent agent to help people read and summarize papers, and perhaps even discover and exploit the potential knowledge clues to write novel papers. Although there have been existing works focusing on summarizing (i.e., reading) the knowledge in a given text or generating (i.e., writing) a text based on the given knowledge, the ability of simultaneously reading and writing is still under development. Typically, this requires an agent to fully understand the knowledge from the given text materials and generate correct and fluent novel paragraphs, which is very challenging in practice. In this paper, we propose a Deep ReAder-Writer (DRAW) network, which consists of a Reader that can extract knowledge graphs (KGs) from input paragraphs and discover potential knowledge,  a graph-to-text Writer that generates a novel paragraph, and a Reviewer that reviews the generated paragraph from three different aspects. Extensive experiments show that our DRAW network outperforms considered baselines and several state-of-the-art methods on AGENDA and M-AGENDA datasets.

    "abstract": "A multi-turn dialogue is composed of multiple utterances from two or more different speaker roles. Thus utterance- and speaker-aware clues are supposed to be well captured in models. However, in the existing retrieval-based multi-turn dialogue modeling, the pre-trained language models (PrLMs) as encoder represent the dialogues coarsely by taking the pairwise dialogue history and candidate response as a whole, the hierarchical information on either utterance interrelation or speaker roles coupled in such representations is not well addressed. In this work, we propose a novel model to fill such a gap by modeling the effective utterance-aware and speaker-aware representations entailed in a dialogue history. In detail, we decouple the contextualized word representations by masking mechanisms in Transformer-based PrLM, making each word only focus on the words in current utterance, other utterances, two speaker roles (i.e., utterances of sender and utterances of receiver), respectively. Experimental results show that our method boosts the strong ELECTRA baseline substantially in four public benchmark datasets, and achieves various new state-of-the-art performance over previous methods. A series of ablation studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method",

We thus try to evaluate the generation faithfulness with two entity-centric metrics: table record coverage and the ratio of hallucinated entities in text, both of which are shown to have strong agreement with human judgements. Then based on these metrics, we quantitatively analyze the correlation between training data quality and generation fidelity which indicates the potential usage of entity information in faithful generation. Motivated by these findings, we propose two methods for faithful generation: 1) augmented training by incorporating the auxiliary entity information, including both an augmented plan-based model and an unsupervised model and 2) training instance selection based on faithfulness ranking. We show these approaches improve generation fidelity in both full dataset setting and few shot setting by both automatic and human evaluations",

    "title": "Faster Depth-Adaptive Transformers",
    "abstract": "Depth-adaptive neural networks can dynamically adjust depths according to the hardness of input words, and thus improve efficiency. The main challenge is how to measure such hardness and decide the required depths (i.e., layers) to conduct. Previous works generally build a halting unit to decide whether the computation should continue or stop at each layer. As there is no specific supervision of depth selection, the halting unit may be under-optimized and inaccurate, which results in suboptimal and unstable performance when modeling sentences. In this paper, we get rid of the halting unit and estimate the required depths in advance, which yields a faster depth-adaptive model. Specifically, two approaches are proposed to explicitly measure the hardness of input words and estimate corresponding adaptive depth, namely 1) mutual information (MI) based estimation and 2) reconstruction loss based estimation. We conduct experiments on the text classification task with 24 datasets in various sizes and domains. Results confirm that our approaches can speed up the vanilla Transformer (up to 7x) while preserving high accuracy. Moreover, efficiency and robustness are significantly improved when compared with other depth-adaptive approaches",

GRN first conducts pre-training based on ALBERT using next utterance prediction and utterance order prediction tasks specifically devised for response selection. These two customized pre-training tasks can endow our model with the ability of capturing semantical and chronological dependency between utterances. We then fine-tune the model on an integrated network with sequence reasoning and graph reasoning structures. The sequence reasoning module conducts inference based on the highly summarized context vector of utterance-response pairs from the global perspective. The graph reasoning module conducts the reasoning on the utterance-level graph neural network from the local perspective.

The rich semantics inside these structures may help us to better handle relations among categories and bring more robustness into existing supertaggers.

We show that with this finer view on categories, annotations of different categories could be shared and interactions with sentence contexts could be enhanced. The proposed category generator is able to achieve state-of-the-art tagging (95.5% accuracy) and parsing (89.8% labeled F1) performances on the standard CCGBank . Further-more, its performances on infrequent (even unseen) categories, out-of-domain texts and low resource language give promising results on introducing generation models to the general CCG analyses",

However, most of the existing NER benchmarks lack domain-specialized entity types or do not focus on a certain domain, leading to a less effective cross-domain evaluation. To address these obstacles, we introduce a cross-domain NER dataset (CrossNER), a fully-labeled collection of NER data spanning over five diverse domains with specialized entity categories for different domains. Additionally, we also provide a domain-related corpus since using it to continue pre-training language models (domain-adaptive pre-training) is effective for the domain adaptation. We then conduct comprehensive experiments to explore the effectiveness of leveraging different levels of the domain corpus and pre-training strategies to do domain-adaptive pre-training for the cross-domain task. Results show that focusing on the fractional corpus containing domain-specialized entities and utilizing a more challenging pre-training strategy in domain-adaptive pre-training are beneficial for the NER domain adaptation, and our proposed method can consistently outperform existing cross-domain NER baselines. Nevertheless, experiments also illustrate the challenge of this cross-domain NER task. We hope that our dataset and baselines will catalyze research in the NER domain adaptation area.

However, since word order variances generally exist in different languages, cross-lingual models that overfit into the word order of the source language could have sub-optimal performance in target languages. In this paper, we hypothesize that reducing the word order information fitted into the models can improve the adaptation performance in target languages. To verify this hypothesis, we introduce several methods to make models encode less word order information of the source language and test them based on cross-lingual word embeddings and the pre-trained multilingual model. Experimental results on three sequence labeling tasks (i.e., part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition and slot filling tasks) show that reducing word order information injected into the model can achieve better zero-shot cross-lingual performance. Further analysis illustrates that fitting excessive or insufficient word order information into the model results in inferior cross-lingual performance. Moreover, our proposed methods can also be applied to strong cross-lingual models and further improve their performance",

Motivated by descriptive ethics, a field of study that focuses on people's descriptive judgments rather than theoretical prescriptions on morality, we investigate a novel, data-driven approach to machine ethics. We introduce SCRUPLES, the first large-scale dataset with 625,000 ethical judgments over 32,000 real-life anecdotes. Each anecdote recounts a complex ethical situation, often posing moral dilemmas, paired with a distribution of judgments contributed by the community members. Our dataset presents a major challenge to state-of-the-art neural language models, leaving significant room for improvement. However, when presented with simplified moral situations, the results are considerably more promising, suggesting that neural models can effectively learn simpler ethical building blocks. A key take-away of our empirical analysis is that norms are not always clean-cut; many situations are naturally divisive. We present a new method to estimate the best possible performance on such tasks with inherently diverse label distributions, and explore likelihood functions that separate intrinsic from model uncertainty.

Second, we propose a novel evaluation, the cost equivalent curve, that sheds new insight on how the choice of source datasets, pretrained language models, and transfer learning methods impacts performance and data efficiency. We perform extensive experiments---over 200 experiments encompassing 4800 models---and report multiple valuable and sometimes surprising findings, e.g., that transfer almost always leads to better or equivalent performance if following a particular recipe, that QA-based commonsense datasets transfer well with each other, while commonsense knowledge graphs do not, and that perhaps counter-intuitively, larger models benefit more from transfer than smaller ones.

Our experiments on 10 models show changes in model ranking and an overall reduction in previously reported performance- thus rectifying the overestimation of AI systems' capabilities. Inspired by behavioral testing principles, we further develop a prototype of a visual analytics tool that enables leaderboard revamping through customization, based on an end user's focus area.

    "abstract": "Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a vital task in various NLP applications. However, in many real-world scenarios (e.g., voice-enabled assistants) new named entities are frequently introduced, entailing re-training NER models to support these new entities. Re-annotating the original training data for the new entities could be costly or even impossible when storage limitations or security concerns restrict access to that data, and annotating a new dataset for all of the entities becomes impractical and error-prone as the number of entities increases. To tackle this problem, we introduce a novel Continual Learning approach for NER, which requires new training material to be annotated only for the new entities. To preserve the existing knowledge previously learned by the model, we exploit the Knowledge Distillation (KD) framework, where the existing NER model acts as the teacher for a new NER model (i.e., the student), which learns the new entity by using the new training material and retains knowledge of old entities by imitating the teacher's outputs on this new training set. Our experiments show that this approach allows the student model to ``progressively'' learn to identify new entities without forgetting the previously learned ones.

    "title": "MASKER: Masked Keyword Regularization for Reliable Text Classification",
    "abstract": "Pre-trained language models have achieved state-of-the-art accuracies on various text classification tasks, e.g., sentiment analysis, natural language inference, and semantic textual similarity. However, the reliability of the fine-tuned text classifiers is an often underlooked performance criterion. For instance, one may desire a model that can detect out-of-distribution (OOD) samples (drawn far from training distribution) or be robust against domain shifts. We claim that one central obstacle to the reliability is the over-reliance of the model on a limited number of keywords, instead of looking at the whole context. In particular, we find that (a) OOD samples often contain in-distribution keywords, while (b) cross-domain samples may not always contain keywords; over-relying on the keywords can be problematic for both cases. In light of this observation, we propose a simple yet effective fine-tuning method, coined masked keyword regularization (MASKER), that facilitates context-based prediction. MASKER regularizes the model to reconstruct the keywords from the rest of the words and make low-confidence predictions without enough context. When applied to various pre-trained language models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa, and ALBERT), we demonstrate that MASKER improves OOD detection and cross-domain generalization without degrading classification accuracy.

Developing from the sequential to the dense graph model, existing works capture coarse-grained context but fail to distinguish the diversity of context among phrases and image regions. In contrast, we pay special attention to different motifs implied in the context of the scene graph and devise the disentangled graph network to integrate the motif-aware contextual information into representations. Besides, we adopt interventional strategies at the feature and the structure levels to consolidate and generalize representations. Finally, the cross-modal attention network is utilized to fuse intra-modal features, where each phrase can be computed similarity with regions to select the best-grounded one. We validate the efficiency of disentangled and interventional graph network (DIGN) through a series of ablation studies, and our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on Flickr30K Entities and ReferIt Game benchmarks",

    "title": "Knowledge-aware Named Entity Recognition with Alleviating Heterogeneity",
    "abstract": "Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a fundamental and important research topic for many downstream NLP tasks, aiming at detecting and classifying named entities (NEs) mentioned in unstructured text into pre-defined categories. Learning from labeled data only is far from enough when it comes to domain-specific or temporally-evolving entities (medical terminologies or restaurant names). Luckily, open-source Knowledge Bases (KBs) (Wikidata and Freebase) contain NEs that are manually labeled with predefined types in different domains, which is potentially beneficial to identify entity boundaries and recognize entity types more accurately.   However, the type system of a domain-specific NER task is typically independent of that of current KBs and thus exhibits heterogeneity issue inevitably, which makes matching between the original NER and KB types (Person in NER potentially matches President in KBs) less likely, or introduces unintended noises without considering domain-specific knowledge (Band in NER should be mapped to Out_of_Entity_Types in the restaurant-related task). To better incorporate and denoise the abundant knowledge in KBs, we propose a new KB-aware NER framework (KaNa), which utilizes type-heterogeneous knowledge to improve NER.  Specifically, for an entity mention along with a set of candidate entities that are linked from KBs, KaNa first uses a type projection mechanism that maps the mention type and entity types into a shared space to homogenize the heterogeneous entity types. Then, based on projected types, a noise detector filters out certain less-confident candidate entities in an unsupervised manner. Finally, the filtered mention-entity pairs are injected into a NER model as a graph to predict answers. The experimental results demonstrate KaNa's state-of-the-art performance on five public benchmark datasets from different domains",

    "abstract": "Multi-headed attention heads are a mainstay in transformer-based models. Different methods have been proposed to classify the role of each attention head based on the relations between tokens which have high pair-wise attention. These roles include syntactic (tokens with some syntactic relation), local (nearby tokens), block (tokens in the same sentence) and delimiter (the special [CLS], [SEP] tokens). There are two main challenges with existing methods for classification: (a) there are no standard scores across studies or across functional roles, and (b) these scores are often average quantities measured across sentences without capturing statistical significance. In this work, we formalize a simple yet effective score that generalizes to all the roles of attention heads and employs hypothesis testing on this score for robust inference. This provides us the right lens to systematically analyze attention heads and confidently comment on many commonly posed questions on analyzing the BERT model. In particular, we comment on the co-location of multiple functional roles in the same attention head, the distribution of attention heads across layers, and effect of fine-tuning for specific NLP tasks on these functional roles.

This extension means that there are now many ways of generating the same output, which we handle by deriving a new objective for training and a variation of beam search for inference that explicitly handles this problem.

    "abstract": "Recent research has pointed to a limitation of word-level neural language models with softmax outputs. This limitation, known as the softmax bottleneck refers to the inability of these models to produce high-rank log probability (log P) matrices. Various solutions have been proposed to break this bottleneck, including Mixture of Softmaxes, SigSoftmax, and Linear Monotonic Softmax with Piecewise Linear Increasing Functions. They were reported to offer better performance in terms of perplexity on test data. A natural perception from these results is a strong positive correlation between the rank of the log P matrix and the model's performance. In this work, we show via an extensive empirical study that such a correlation is fairly weak and that the high-rank of the log P matrix is neither necessary nor sufficient for better test perplexity. Although our results are empirical, they are established in part via the construction of a rich family of models, which we call Generalized SigSoftmax. They are able to create diverse ranks for the log P matrices. We also present an investigation as to why the proposed solutions achieve better performance",

    "abstract": "Transformer-based architectures brought a breeze of change to Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD), improving models' performances by a large margin.  The fast development of new approaches has been further encouraged by a well-framed evaluation suite for English, which has allowed their performances to be kept track of and compared fairly.  However, other languages have remained largely unexplored, as testing data are available for a few languages only and the evaluation setting is rather matted.  In this paper, we untangle this situation by proposing XL-WSD, a cross-lingual evaluation benchmark for the WSD task featuring sense-annotated development and test sets in 18 languages from six different linguistic families, together with language-specific silver training data.  We leverage XL-WSD datasets to conduct an extensive evaluation of neural and knowledge-based approaches, including the most recent multilingual language models.   Results show that the zero-shot knowledge transfer across languages is a promising research direction within the WSD field, especially when considering low-resourced languages where large pre-trained multilingual models still perform poorly.

    "abstract": "Knowledge distillation is considered as a training and compression strategy in which two neural networks, namely a teacher and a student, are coupled together during training. The teacher network is supposed to be a trustworthy predictor and the student tries to mimic its predictions. Usually, a student with a lighter architecture is selected so we can achieve compression and yet deliver high-quality results. In such a setting, distillation only happens for final predictions whereas the student could also benefit from teacher’s supervision for internal components. Motivated by this, we studied the problem of distillation for intermediate layers. Since there might not be a one-to-one alignment between student and teacher layers, existing techniques skip some teacher layers and only distill from a subset of them. This shortcoming directly impacts quality, so we instead propose a combinatorial technique which relies on attention. Our model fuses teacher-side information and takes each layer’s significance into consideration, then it performs distillation between combined teacher layers and those of the student. Using our technique, we distilled a 12-layer BERT (Devlin et al. 2019) into 6-, 4-, and 2-layer counterparts and evaluated them on GLUE tasks (Wang et al. 2018). Experimental results show that our combinatorial approach is able to outperform other existing techniques",

    "abstract": "Real-life applications, heavily relying on machine learning, such as dialog systems, demand for out-of-domain detection methods. Intent classification models should be equipped with a mechanism to distinguish seen intents from unseen ones so that the dialog agent is capable of rejecting the latter and avoiding undesired behavior. However, despite increasing attention paid to the task, the best practices for out-of-domain intent detection have not yet been fully established.  This paper conducts a thorough comparison of out-of-domain intent detection methods. We prioritize the methods, not requiring access to out-of-domain data during training, gathering of which is extremely time- and labor-consuming due to lexical and stylistic variation of user utterances. We evaluate multiple contextual encoders and methods, proven to be efficient, on three common datasets for intent classification, expanded with out-of-domain utterances. Our main findings show that fine-tuning Transformer-based encoders on in-domain data leads to superior results. Mahalanobis distance, together with utterance representations, derived from Transformer-based encoders, outperform other methods by a wide margin(1-5% in  terms of AUROC) and establish new state-of-the-art results for all datasets.  The broader analysis shows that the reason for success lies in the fact that the fine-tuned Transformer is capable of constructing homogeneous representations of in-domain utterances, revealing geometrical disparity to out of domain utterances. In turn, the Mahalanobis distance captures this disparity easily",

Gaussian distribution is innately more expressive than point vector owing to the ability to additionally capture semantic uncertainties of words, and thus can express asymmetric relations among words more naturally (e.g., animal entails cat but not the reverse. However, previous Gaussian embedders neglect inner-word conceptual knowledge and lack tailored Gaussian contextualizer, leading to inferior performance on both intrinsic (context-agnostic) and extrinsic (context-sensitive) tasks. In this paper, we first propose a novel Gaussian embedder which explicitly accounts for inner-word conceptual units (sememes) to represent word semantics more precisely; during learning, we propose Gaussian Distribution Attention over Gaussian representations to adaptively aggregate multiple sememe distributions into a word distribution, which guarantees the Gaussian linear combination property. Additionally, we propose a Gaussian contextualizer to utilize outer-word contexts in a sentence, producing contextualized Gaussian representations for context-sensitive tasks. Extensive experiments on intrinsic and extrinsic tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance with near 5.00% relative improvement",

We propose an efficient domain adaptive task-oriented dialog system model, which incorporates a meta-teacher model to emphasize the different impacts between generated tokens with respect to the context. We first train our base dialog model and meta-teacher model adversarially in a meta-learning setting on rich-resource domains. The meta-teacher learns to quantify the importance of tokens under different contexts across different domains. During adaptation, the meta-teacher guides the dialog model to focus on important tokens in order to achieve better adaptation efficiency.

Our model consists of an auxiliary KB reasoning task for learning meta KB knowledge, an auxiliary dialogue reasoning task for learning dialogue patterns, and a TDS task (primary task) that aims at not only retrieving accurate entities from KB but also generating natural responses, which are coordinated to achieve collective success in both retrieving accurate KB entities and generating human-like responses via meta learning. Concretely, the dialog generation model amalgamates complementary meta KB and dialog knowledge from two novel auxiliary reasoning tasks that together provide integrated guidance to build a high-quality TDS by adding regularization terms to force primary network to produce similar results to auxiliary networks. While MCL automatically learns appropriate labels for the two auxiliary reasoning tasks from the primary task, without requiring access to any further data. The key idea behind MCL is to use the performance of the primary task, which is trained alongside the auxiliary tasks in one iteration, to improve the auxiliary labels for the next iteration with meta learning. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets show that MCL can generate higher quality responses compared to several strong baselines in terms of both automatic and human evaluations.

First, modeling a long history can be costly as it requires more computation resources. Second, the long context history consists of a lot of irrelevant information that makes it difficult to model appropriate information relevant to the user query. To alleviate these problems, we propose a reinforcement learning based method to capture and backtrack the related conversation history to boost model performance in this paper. Our method seeks to automatically backtrack the history information with the implicit feedback from the model performance. We further consider both immediate and delayed rewards to guide the reinforced backtracking policy.

To address this problem, we propose to adopt a human learner's approach: when we cannot make sense of a word in a sentence, we often consult the dictionary for specific meanings; but can the same work for empirical models? In this work, we try to inform the pre-trained masked language models of word meanings for semantics-enhanced pre-training. To achieve a contrastive and holistic view of word meanings, a definition pair of two related words is presented to the masked language model such that the model can better associate a word with its crucial semantic features.

    "abstract": "The majority of current research in Automated Essay Scoring (AES) focuses on prompt-specific scoring of either the overall quality of an essay or the quality with regards to certain traits. In real-world applications obtaining labelled data for a target essay prompt is often expensive or unfeasible, requiring the AES system to be able to perform well when predicting scores for essays from unseen prompts. As a result, some recent research has been dedicated to cross-prompt AES. However, this line of research has thus far only been concerned with holistic, overall scoring, with no exploration into the scoring of different traits. As users of AES systems often require feedback with regards to different aspects of their writing, trait scoring is a necessary component of an effective AES system. Therefore, to address this need, we introduce a new task named Automated Cross-prompt Scoring of Essay Traits, which requires the model to be trained solely on non-target-prompt essays and to predict the holistic, overall score as well as scores for a number of specific traits for target-prompt essays. This task challenges the model's ability to generalize in order to score essays from a novel domain as well as its ability to represent the quality of essays from multiple different aspects. In addition, we introduce a new, innovative approach which builds on top of a state-of-the-art method for cross-prompt AES. Our method utilizes a trait-attention mechanism and a multi-task architecture that leverages the relationships between each trait to simultaneously predict the overall score and the score of each individual trait. We conduct extensive experiments on the widely used ASAP and ASAP++ datasets and demonstrate that our approach is able to outperform leading prompt-specific trait scoring and cross-prompt AES methods",

An end-to-end (E2E) system that goes directly from speech to a hypothesis is a more attractive option. These systems were shown to be smaller, faster, and better optimized. However, they require massive amounts of end-to-end training data and in addition, don't take advantage of the already available ASR and NLU training data.

We call this the Audio-Text All-Task (AT-AT) Model and we show that it beats the performance of E2E models trained on individual tasks, especially ones trained on limited data. We show this result on an internal music dataset and two public datasets, FluentSpeech and SNIPS Audio, where we achieve state-of-the-art results. Since our model can process both speech and text input sequences and learn to predict a target sequence, it also allows us to do zero-shot E2E SLU by training on only text-hypothesis data (without any speech) from a new domain. We evaluate this ability of our model on the Facebook TOP dataset and set a new benchmark for zeroshot E2E performance. We release the audio data collected for the TOP dataset for future research",

    "abstract": "Advances in NLP have yielded impressive results for the task of machine reading comprehension (MRC), with approaches having been reported to achieve performance comparable to that of humans. In this paper, we investigate whether state-of-the-art MRC models are able to correctly process Semantics Altering Modifications (SAM): linguistically-motivated phenomena that alter the semantics of a sentence while preserving most of its lexical surface form. We present a method to automatically generate and align challenge sets featuring original and altered examples. We further propose a novel evaluation methodology to correctly assess the capability of MRC systems to process these examples independent of the data they were optimised on, by discounting for effects introduced by domain shift. In a large-scale empirical study, we apply the methodology in order to evaluate extractive MRC models with regard to their capability to correctly process SAM-enriched data. We comprehensively cover 12 different state-of-the-art neural architecture configurations and four training datasets and find that -- despite their well-known remarkable performance -- optimised models consistently struggle to correctly process semantically altered data",

    "title": "Learning from the Best: Rationalizing Predictions by Adversarial Information Calibration",
    "abstract": "Explaining the predictions of AI models is paramount in safety-critical applications, such as in legal or medical domains.  One form of explanation for a prediction is an extractive rationale, i.e., a subset of features of an instance that lead the model to give its prediction on the instance. Previous works on generating extractive rationales usually employ a two-phase model: a selector that selects the most important features (i.e., the rationale) followed by a predictor that makes the prediction based exclusively on the selected features. One disadvantage of these works is that the main signal for learning to select features comes from the comparison of the final answers given by the predictor and the ground-truth answers. In this work, we propose to squeeze more information from the predictor via an information calibration method. More precisely, we train two models jointly: one is a typical neural model that solves the task at hand in an accurate but black-box manner, and the other is a selector-predictor model that additionally produces a rationale for its prediction. The first model is used as a guide to the second model. We use an adversarial-based technique to calibrate the information extracted by the two models such that the difference between them is an indicator of the missed or over-selected features. In addition, for natural language tasks, we propose to use a language-model-based regularizer to encourage the extraction of fluent rationales. Experimental results on a sentiment analysis task as well as on three tasks from the legal domain show the effectiveness of our approach to rationale extraction",

    "abstract": "This paper presents our pioneering effort for emotion recognition in conversation (ERC) with pre-trained language models. Unlike regular documents, conversational utterances appear alternately from different parties and are usually organized as hierarchical structures in previous work. Such structures are not conducive to the application of pre-trained language models such as XLNet. To address this issue, we propose an all-in-one XLNet model, namely DialogXL, with enhanced memory to store longer historical context and dialog-aware self-attention to deal with the multi-party structures. Specifically, we first modify the recurrence mechanism of XLNet from segment-level to utterance-level in order to better model the conversational data. Second, we introduce dialog-aware self-attention in replacement of the vanilla self-attention in XLNet to capture useful intra- and inter-speaker dependencies. Extensive experiments are conducted on four ERC benchmarks with mainstream models presented for comparison. The experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms the baselines on all the datasets. Several other experiments such as ablation study and error analysis are also conducted and the results confirm the role of the critical modules of DialogXL",

    "abstract": "Automatic song writing aims to compose a song (lyric and/or melody) by machine, which is an interesting topic in both academia and industry. In automatic song writing, lyric-to-melody generation and melody-to-lyric generation are two important tasks, both of which usually suffer from the following challenges: 1) the paired lyric and melody data are limited, which affects the generation quality of the two tasks, considering a lot of paired training data are needed due to the weak correlation between lyric and melody; 2) Strict alignments are required between lyric and melody, which relies on specific alignment modeling. In this paper, we propose SongMASS to address the above challenges, which leverages masked sequence to sequence (MASS) pre-training and attention based alignment modeling for lyric-to-melody and melody-to-lyric generation. Specifically, 1) we extend the original sentence-level MASS pre-training to song level to better capture long contextual information in music, and use a separate encoder and decoder for each modality (lyric or melody); 2) we leverage sentence-level attention mask and token-level attention constraint during training to enhance the alignment between lyric and melody. During inference, we use a dynamic programming strategy to obtain the alignment between each word/syllable in lyric and note in melody. We pre-train SongMASS on unpaired lyric and melody datasets, and both objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that SongMASS generates lyric and melody with significantly better quality than the baseline method",

Based on a pilot study, we observe three issues of existing general-purpose language models when they are applied in the text-to-SQL semantic parsers: fail to detect the column mentions in the utterances, to infer the column mentions from the cell values, and to compose target SQL queries when they are complex. To mitigate these issues, we present a model pretraining framework, Generation-Augmented Pre-training (GAP), that jointly learns representations of natural language utterance and table schemas, by leveraging generation models to generate high-quality pre-train data. GAP Model is trained on 2 million utterance-schema pairs and 30K utterance-schema-SQL triples, whose utterances are generated by generation models. Based on experimental results, neural semantic parsers that leverage GAP Model as a representation encoder obtain new state-of-the-art results on both Spider and Criteria-to-SQL benchmarks",

However, recent deep learning based topic models, specifically aspect-based autoencoder, suffer from several problems such as extracting noisy aspects and poorly mapping aspects discovered by models to the aspects of interest. To tackle these challenges, in this paper, we first propose a self-supervised contrastive learning framework and an attention-based model equipped with a novel smooth self-attention (SSA) module for the UAD task in order to learn better representations for aspects and review segments. Secondly, we introduce a high-resolution selective mapping (HRSMap) method to efficiently assign aspects discovered by the model to the aspects of interest. We also propose using a knowledge distillation technique to further improve the aspect detection performance. Our methods outperform several recent unsupervised and weakly supervised approaches on publicly available benchmark user review datasets. Aspect interpretation results show that extracted aspects are meaningful, have a good coverage, and can be easily mapped to aspects of interest. Ablation studies and attention weight visualization also demonstrate effectiveness of SSA and the knowledge distillation method",

The majority of existing text generation methods either afford limited supplementary information or lose consistency between the input and output which makes the synthetic news less trustworthy. To address these issues, FACTGEN retrieves external facts to enrich the output and reconstructs the input claim from the generated content to improve the consistency among the input and the output. Experiment results on real-world datasets demonstrate that the generated news contents of FACTGEN are consistent and contain rich facts.

    "abstract": "Determining the plausibility of causal relations between clauses is a commonsense reasoning task that requires complex inference ability. The general approach to this task is to train a large pretrained language model on a specific dataset. However, the available training data for the task is often scarce, which leads to instability of model training or reliance on the shallow features of the dataset. This paper presents a number of techniques for making models more robust in the domain of causal reasoning. Firstly, we perform adversarial training by generating perturbed inputs through synonym substitution. Secondly, based on a linguistic theory of discourse connectives, we perform data augmentation using a discourse parser for detecting causally linked clauses in large text, and a generative language model for generating distractors. Both methods boost model performance on the Choice of Plausible Alternatives (COPA) dataset, as well as on a Balanced COPA dataset, which is a modified version of the original data that has been developed to avoid superficial cues, leading to a more challenging benchmark. We show a statistically significant improvement in performance and robustness on both datasets, even with only a small number of additionally generated data points",

    "abstract": "TACRED is one of the largest and most widely used sentence-level relation extraction datasets. Proposed models that are evaluated using this dataset consistently set new state-of-the-art performance. However, they still exhibit large error rates despite leveraging external knowledge and unsupervised pretraining on large text corpora. A recent study suggested that this may be due to poor dataset quality. The study observed that over 50% of the most challenging sentences from the development and test sets are incorrectly labeled and account for an average drop of 8% f1-score in model performance. However, this study was limited to a small biased sample of 5k (out of a total of 106k) sentences, substantially restricting the generalizability and broader implications of its findings. In this paper, we address these shortcomings by: (i) performing a comprehensive study over the whole TACRED dataset, (ii) proposing an improved crowdsourcing strategy and deploying it to re-annotate the whole dataset, and (iii) performing a thorough analysis to understand how correcting the TACRED annotations affects previously published results. After verification, we observed that 23.9% of TACRED labels are incorrect. Moreover, evaluating several models on our revised dataset yields an average f1-score improvement of 14.3% and helps uncover significant relationships between the different models (rather than simply offsetting or scaling their scores by a constant factor). Finally, aside from our analysis we also release Re-TACRED, a new completely re-annotated version of the TACRED dataset that can be used to perform reliable evaluation of relation extraction models",

One goal of multitask learning is to extract a good representation that sufficiently captures the relevant part of the input about the output for each learning task. To achieve this objective, in this paper we design a multitask learning architecture based on the observation that correlations exist between outputs of some related tasks (e.g. entity recognition and relation extraction tasks), and they reflect the relevant features that need to be extracted from the input. As outputs are unobserved, our proposed model exploits task predictions in lower layers of the neural model, also referred to as early predictions in this work. But we control the injection of early predictions to ensure that we extract good task-specific representations for classification.

We integrate soft or hard gates to select visual clues and propose a multitask algorithm to train and validate the effects of relation propagation on the MNER datasets.

Previous work models dialogue structure by extracting latent states for each utterance first and then calculating the transition probabilities among states. These two-stage methods ignore the contextual information when calculating the probabilities, which makes the transitions between the states ambiguous. This paper proposes a conversational graph (CG) to represent deterministic dialogue structure where nodes and edges represent the utterance and context information respectively. An unsupervised Edge-Enhanced Graph Auto-Encoder (EGAE) architecture is designed to model local-contextual and global-structural information for conversational graph learning. Furthermore, a self-supervised objective is introduced with the response selection task to guide the unsupervised learning of the dialogue structure. Experimental results on several public datasets demonstrate that the novel model outperforms several alternatives in aggregating utterances with similar semantics. The effectiveness of the learned dialogue structured is also verified by more than 5\\% joint accuracy improvement in the downstream task of low resource dialogue state tracking",

In this task, mentions must be linked to unseen entities and only the textual information is available. In order to make full use of the documents, previous work has proposed a BERT-based model which can only take fixed length of text as input. However, the key information for entity linking may exist in nearly everywhere of the documents thus the proposed model cannot capture them all. To leverage more textual information and enhance text understanding capability, we propose a bidirectional multi-paragraph reading model for the zero-shot entity linking task. Firstly, the model treats the mention context as a query and matches it with multiple paragraphs of the entity description documents. Then, the mention-aware entity representation obtained from the first step is used as a query to match multiple paragraphs in the document containing the mention through an entity-mention attention mechanism. In particular, a new pre-training strategy is employed to strengthen the representative ability. Experimental results show that our bidirectional model can capture long-range context dependencies and outperform the baseline model by 3-4% in terms of accuracy",

    "abstract": "Cognitive psychology research shows that humans have the instinct for abstract thinking, where association plays an essential role in language comprehension. Especially for Chinese, its ideographic writing system allows radicals to trigger semantic association without the need of phonetics. In fact, subconsciously using the associative information guided by radicals is a key for readers to ensure the robustness of semantic understanding. Fortunately, many basic and extended concepts related to radicals are systematically included in Chinese language dictionaries, which leaves a handy but unexplored way for improving Chinese text representation and classification. To this end, we draw inspirations from cognitive principles between ideography and human associative behavior to propose a novel Radical-guided Associative Model (RAM) for Chinese text classification. RAM comprises two coupled spaces, namely Literal Space and Associative Space, which imitates the real process in people's mind when understanding a Chinese text. To be specific, we first devise a serialized modeling structure in Literal Space to thoroughly capture the sequential information of Chinese text. Then, based on the authoritative information provided by Chinese language dictionaries, we design an association module and put forward a strategy called Radical-Word Association to use ideographic radicals as the medium to associate prior concept words in Associative Space. Afterwards, we design an attention module to imitate people's matching and decision between Literal Space and Associative Space, which can balance the importance of each associative words under specific contexts. Finally, extensive experiments on two real-world datasets prove the effectiveness and rationality of RAM, with good cognitive insights for future language modeling",

To better cater for newcomers with few resources, we propose a personalized conversation model (PCM) that learns to adapt to new speakers as well as enabling new speakers to learn from resource-rich speakers. Particularly, based on a meta-learning based PCM, we propose a task aggregator (TA) to collect other speakers' information from the social network.

Existing methods for SRE consider extracting social relation only from unimodal information such as text or image, ignoring the high coupling of multimodal information. Moreover, previous studies overlook the serious unbalance distribution on social relations. To address these issues, this paper proposes FL-MSRE, a few-shot learning based approach to extracting social relations from both texts and face images. Considering the lack of multimodal social relation datasets, this paper also presents three multimodal datasets annotated from four classical masterpieces and corresponding TV series. Inspired by the success of BERT, we propose a strong BERT based baseline to extract social relation from text only. FL-MSRE is empirically shown to outperform the baseline significantly. This demonstrates that using face images benefits text-based SRE. Further experiments also show that using two faces from different images achieves similar performance as from the same image. This means that FL-MSRE is suitable for a wide range of SRE applications where the faces of two people can only be collected from different images",

By revealing the latent centrality and interactions between sentences, along with scores for novelty and relevance, users are given a window into the choices a model is making and an opportunity to guide those choices in a more desirable direction. A novel pair-wise matrix captures the sentence interactions, centrality and attribute scores, and a mask with tunable attribute thresholds allows the user to control which sentences are likely to be included in the extraction. A sentence-deployed attention mechanism in the abstractor ensures the final summary emphasizes the desired content.

    "title": "Encoding Syntactic Knowledge in Transformer Encoder for Intent Detection and Slot Filling",
    "abstract": "We propose a novel Transformer encoder-based architecture with syntactical knowledge encoded for intent detection and slot filling. Specifically, we encode syntactic knowledge into the Transformer encoder by jointly training it to predict syntactic parse ancestors and part-of-speech of each token via multi-task learning. Our model is based on self-attention and feed-forward layers and does not require external syntactic information to be available at inference time. Experiments show that on two benchmark datasets, our models with only two Transformer encoder layers achieve state-of-the-art results. Compared to the previously best performed model without pre-training, our models achieve absolute F1 score and accuracy improvement of 1.59 % and 0.85 % for slot filling and intent detection on the SNIPS dataset, respectively. Our models also achieve absolute F1 score and accuracy improvement of 0.1 % and 0.34 % for slot filling and intent detection on the ATIS dataset, respectively, over the previously best performed model. Furthermore, the visualization of the self-attention weights illustrates the benefits of incorporating syntactic information during training",

    "abstract": "Slot filling is a challenging task in Spoken Language Understanding (SLU). Supervised methods usually require large amounts of annotation to maintain desirable performance. A solution to relieve the heavy dependency on labeled data is to employ bootstrapping, which leverages unlabeled data. However, bootstrapping is known to suffer from semantic drift. We argue that semantic drift can be tackled by exploiting the correlation between slot values (phrases) and their respective types. By using some particular weakly labeled data, namely the plain phrases included in sentences, we propose a weakly-supervised slot filling approach. Our approach trains two models, namely a classifier and a tagger, which can effectively learn from each other on the weakly labeled data. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves better results than standard baselines on multiple datasets, especially in the low-resource setting",

    "abstract": "We study the cocktail party problem and propose a novel attention network called Tune-In, abbreviated for training under negative environments with interference. It firstly learns two separate spaces of speaker-knowledge and speech-stimuli based on a shared feature space, where a new block structure is designed as the building block for all spaces, and then cooperatively solves different tasks. Between the two spaces, information is cast towards each other via a novel cross- and dual-attention mechanism, mimicking the bottom-up and top-down processes of a human's cocktail party effect. It turns out that substantially discriminative and generalizable speaker representations can be learnt in severely interfered conditions via our self-supervised training. The experimental results verify this seeming paradox. The learnt speaker embedding has superior discriminative power than a standard speaker verification method; meanwhile, Tune-In achieves remarkably better speech separation performances in terms of SI-SNRi and SDRi consistently in all test modes, and especially at lower memory and computational consumption, than state-of-the-art benchmark systems",

    "abstract": "Despite the near-human performances already achieved on formal texts such as news articles, neural machine translation still has difficulty in dealing with \"user-generated\" texts that have diverse linguistic phenomena but lack large-scale high-quality parallel corpora. To address this problem, we propose a counterfactual domain adaptation method to better leverage both large-scale source-domain data (formal texts) and small-scale target-domain data (informal texts). Specifically, by considering effective counterfactual conditions (the concatenations of source-domain texts and the target-domain tag), we construct the counterfactual representations to fill the sparse latent space of the target domain caused by a small amount of data, that is, bridging the gap between the source-domain data and the target-domain data. Experiments on English-to-Chinese and Chinese-to-English translation tasks show that our method outperforms the base model that is trained only on the informal corpus by a large margin, and consistently surpasses different baseline methods by +1.12 ~ 4.34 BLEU points on different datasets. Furthermore, we also show that our method achieves competitive performances on cross-domain language translation on four language pairs",

Previous studies on this task usually utilized contextual information to enrich utterance representations and to further influence the decoding process. While they ignored to describe and track the interaction states which are determined by history SQL queries and are related with the intent of current utterance. In this paper, two kinds of interaction states are defined based on schema items and SQL keywords separately. A relational graph neural network and a non-linear layer are designed to update the representations of these two states respectively. The dynamic schema-state and SQL-state representations are then utilized to decode the SQL query corresponding to current utterance.

To address this issue, we propose a unified reader-aware topic modeling and saliency information detection framework to enhance the quality of generated comments. For reader-aware topic modeling, we design a variational generative clustering algorithm for latent semantic learning and topic mining from reader comments. For saliency information detection, we introduce Bernoulli distribution estimating on news content to select saliency information. The obtained topic representations as well as the selected saliency information are incorporated into the decoder to generate diversified and informative comments.

    "abstract": "Adversarial training is the most empirically successful approach in improving the robustness of deep neural networks for image classification. For text classification, however, existing synonym substitution based adversarial attacks are effective but not very efficient to be incorporated into practical text adversarial training. Gradient-based attacks, which are very efficient for images, are hard to be implemented for synonym substitution based text attacks due to the lexical, grammatical and semantic constraints and the discrete text input space. Thereby, we propose a fast text adversarial attack method called Fast Gradient Projection Method (FGPM) based on synonym substitution, which is about 20 times faster than existing text attack methods and could achieve similar attack performance. We then incorporate FGPM with adversarial training and propose a text defense method called Adversarial Training with FGPM enhanced by Logit pairing (ATFL).

To alleviate these problems, we propose a new code completion approach named CCAG, which models the flattened sequence of a partial AST as an AST graph. CCAG uses our proposed AST Graph Attention Block to capture different dependencies in the AST graph for representation learning in code completion. The sub-tasks of code completion are optimized via multi-task learning in CCAG, and the task balance is automatically achieved using uncertainty without the need to tune task weights.

    "abstract": "Spurious correlations threaten the validity of statistical classifiers. While model accuracy may appear high when the test data is from the same distribution as the training data, it can quickly degrade when the test distribution changes. For example, it has been shown that classifiers perform poorly when humans make minor modifications to change the label of an example. One solution to increase model reliability and generalizability is to identify causal associations between features and classes. In this paper, we propose to train a robust text classifier by augmenting the training data with automatically generated counterfactual data. We first identify likely causal features using a statistical matching approach. Next, we generate counterfactual samples for the original training data by substituting causal features with their antonyms and then assigning opposite labels to the counterfactual samples. Finally, we combine the original data and counterfactual data to train a robust classifier. Experiments on two classification tasks show that a traditional classifier trained on the original data does very poorly on human-generated counterfactual samples (e.g., 10%-37% drop in accuracy). However, the classifier trained on the combined data is more robust and performs well on both the original test data and the counterfactual test data (e.g., 12%-25% increase in accuracy compared with the traditional classifier). Detailed analysis shows that the robust classifier makes meaningful and trustworthy predictions by emphasizing causal features and de-emphasizing non-causal features",

    "abstract": "Neural autoregressive sequence models are used to generate sequences in a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, where they are evaluated according to sequence-level task losses. These models are typically trained with maximum likelihood estimation, which ignores the task loss, yet empirically performs well as a surrogate objective. Typical approaches to directly optimizing the task loss such as policy gradient and minimum risk training are based around sampling in the sequence space to obtain candidate update directions that are scored based on the loss of a single sequence. In this paper, we develop an alternative method based on random search in the parameter space that leverages access to the maximum likelihood gradient. We propose maximum likelihood guided parameter search (MGS), which samples from a distribution over update directions that is a mixture of random search around the current parameters and around the maximum likelihood gradient, with each direction weighted by its improvement in the task loss. MGS shifts sampling to the parameter space, and scores candidates using losses that are pooled from multiple sequences. Our experiments show that MGS is capable of optimizing sequence-level losses, with substantial reductions in repetition and non-termination in sequence completion, and similar improvements to those of minimum risk training in machine translation",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the task of selecting the optimal response given a user and system utterance history in retrieval-based multi-turn dialog systems. Recently, pre-trained language models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa, and ELECTRA) showed significant improvements in various natural language processing tasks. This and similar response selection tasks can also be solved using such language models by formulating the tasks as dialog--response binary classification tasks. Although existing works using this approach successfully obtained state-of-the-art results, we observe that language models trained in this manner tend to make predictions based on the relatedness of history and candidates, ignoring the sequential nature of multi-turn dialog systems. This suggests that the response selection task alone is insufficient for learning temporal dependencies between utterances. To this end, we propose utterance manipulation strategies (UMS) to address this problem. Specifically, UMS consist of several strategies (i.e., insertion, deletion, and search), which aid the response selection model towards maintaining dialog coherence. Further, UMS are self-supervised methods that do not require additional annotation and thus can be easily incorporated into existing approaches. Extensive evaluation across multiple languages and models shows that UMS are highly effective in teaching dialog consistency, which leads to models pushing the state-of-the-art with significant margins on multiple public benchmark datasets",

However, why positional encoding works well in attention models remains largely unanswered. In this paper, we study the scalar relative positional encoding (SRPE) proposed in the T5 transformer. Such an encoding method has two features. First, it uses a scalar to embed relative positions. Second, the relative positions are bucketized using a fixed heuristic algorithm, and positions in the same bucket share the same embedding. In this work, we show that SRPE in attention has an elegant probabilistic interpretation. More specifically, the positional encoding serves to produce a prior distribution for the attended positions. The resulting attentive distribution can be viewed as a posterior distribution of the attended position given the observed input sequence. Furthermore, we propose a new SRPE (AT5) that adopts a learnable bucketization protocol and automatically adapts to the dependency range specific to the learning task. Empirical studies show that the AT5 achieves superior performance than the T5's SRPE",

Specifically, EVIN first captures the core semantic segments of claims and the users' principal opinions in relevant articles. Then, it finely-grained identifies the semantic conflicts contained in each relevant article from these opinions. Finally, it constructs coherence modeling to match the conflicts that queries the core semantic fragments of claims as explainable evidence.

To address the challenge of insufficient training data on tail label classification, we propose a Head-to-Tail Network (HTTN) to transfer the meta-knowledge from the data-rich head labels to data-poor tail labels.

    "title": "Adversarial Meta Sampling for Multilingual Low-Resource Speech Recognition",
    "abstract": "Low-resource automatic speech recognition (ASR) is challenging, as the low-resource target language data cannot well train an ASR model. To solve this issue, meta-learning formulates ASR for each source language into many small ASR tasks and meta-learns a model initialization on all tasks from different source languages to access fast adaptation on unseen target languages. However, for different source languages, the quantity and difficulty vary greatly because of their different data scales and diverse phonological systems, which leads to task-quantity and task-difficulty imbalance issues and thus a failure of multilingual meta-learning ASR (MML-ASR). In this work, we solve this problem by developing a novel adversarial meta sampling (AMS) approach to improve MML-ASR. When sampling tasks in MML-ASR, AMS adaptively determines the task sampling probability for each source language. Specifically, for each source language, if the query loss is large, it means that its tasks are not well sampled to train ASR model in terms of its quantity and difficulty and thus should be sampled more frequently for extra learning. Inspired by this fact, we feed the historical task query loss of all source language domain into a network to learn a task sampling policy for adversarially increasing the current query loss of MML-ASR. Thus, the learnt task sampling policy can master the learning situation of each language and thus predicts good task sampling probability for each language for more effective learning. Finally, experiment results on two multilingual datasets show significant performance improvement when applying our AMS on MML-ASR, and also demonstrate the applicability of AMS to other low-resource speech tasks and transfer learning ASR approaches",

Currently, among dominant models, it is treated as a sequence-to-tree task, where a decoder outputs a sequence of actions corresponding to the pre-order traversal of an Abstract Syntax Tree. However, such a decoder only exploits the pre-order traversal based preceding actions, which are insufficient to ensure correct action predictions. In this paper, we first throughly analyze the context modeling difference between neural code generation models with different traversals based decodings (preorder traversal vs breadth-first traversal), and then propose to introduce a mutual learning framework to jointly train these models. Under this framework, we continuously enhance both two models via mutual distillation, which involves synchronous executions of two one-to-one knowledge transfers at each training step. More specifically, we alternately choose one model as the student and the other as its teacher, and require the student to fit the training data and the action prediction distributions of its teacher. By doing so, both models can fully absorb the knowledge from each other and thus could be improved simultaneously.

    "abstract": "Recently, the vulnerability of deep neural network (DNN)-based audio systems to adversarial attacks has obtained increasing attention. However, the existing audio adversarial attacks allow the adversary to possess the entire user's audio input as well as granting sufficient time budget to generate the adversarial perturbations. These idealized assumptions, however, make the existing audio adversarial attacks mostly impossible to be launched in a timely fashion in practice (e.g., playing unnoticeable adversarial perturbations along with user's streaming input). To overcome these limitations, in this paper we propose fast audio adversarial perturbation generator (FAPG), which uses generative model to generate adversarial perturbations for the audio input in a single forward pass, thereby drastically improving the perturbation generation speed. Built on the top of FAPG, we further propose universal audio adversarial perturbation generator (UAPG), a scheme to craft universal adversarial perturbation that can be imposed on arbitrary benign audio input to cause misclassification. Extensive experiments on DNN-based audio systems show that our proposed FAPG can achieve high success rate with up to 214X speedup over the existing audio adversarial attack methods. Also our proposed UAPG generates universal adversarial perturbations that can achieve much better attack performance than the state-of-the-art solutions",

    "title": "Nyströmformer: A Nyström-based Algorithm for Approximating Self-Attention",
    "abstract": "Transformers have emerged as a powerful tool for a broad range of natural language processing tasks. A key component that drives the impressive performance of Transformers is the self-attention mechanism that encodes the influence or dependence of other tokens on each specific token. While beneficial, the quadratic complexity of self-attention on the input sequence length has limited its application to longer sequences - a topic being actively studied in the community. To address this limitation, we propose Nyströmformer - a model that exhibits favorable scalability as a function of sequence length. Our idea is based on adapting the Nyström method to approximate standard self-attention with O(n) complexity. The scalability of Nyströmformer enables application to longer sequences with thousands of tokens. We perform evaluations on multiple downstream tasks on the GLUE benchmark and IMDB reviews with standard sequence length, and find that our Nyströmformer performs comparably, or in a few cases, even slightly better, than standard self-attention. On longer sequence tasks in the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark, Nyströmformer performs favorably relative to other efficient self-attention methods.

In this work, we formulate such entity structure as distinctive dependencies between mention pairs. We then propose SSAN, which incorporates these structural dependencies within the standard self-attention mechanism and throughout the overall encoding stage. Specifically, we design two alternative transformation modules inside each self-attention building block to produce attentive biases so as to adaptively regularize its attention flow. Our experiments demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed entity structure and the effectiveness of SSAN. It significantly outperforms competitive baselines, achieving new state-of-the-art results on three popular document-level relation extraction datasets.

    "title": "Learning an Effective Context-Response Matching Model with Self-Supervised Tasks for Retrieval-based Dialogues",
    "abstract": "Building an intelligent dialogue system with the ability to select a proper response according to a multi-turn context is a great challenging task.  Existing studies focus on building a context-response matching model with various neural architectures or pretrained language models (PLMs)  and typically learning with a single response prediction task.  These approaches overlook many potential training signals contained in dialogue data, which might be beneficial for context understanding and produce better features for response prediction.   Besides, the response retrieved from existing dialogue systems supervised by the conventional way  still faces some critical challenges, including incoherence and inconsistency.  To address these issues, in this paper, we propose learning a context-response matching model with auxiliary self-supervised tasks designed for the dialogue data based on pre-trained language models.  Specifically, we introduce four self-supervised tasks including next session prediction, utterance restoration, incoherence detection and consistency discrimination, and jointly train the PLM-based response selection model with these auxiliary tasks in a multi-task manner.   By this means, the auxiliary tasks can guide the learning of the matching model to achieve a better local optimum and select a more proper response.  Experiment results on two benchmarks indicate that the proposed auxiliary self-supervised tasks bring significant improvement for multi-turn response selection in retrieval-based dialogues, and our model achieves new state-of-the-art results on both datasets",

    "title": "Document-Level Relation Extraction with Reconstruction",
    "abstract": "In document-level relation extraction (DocRE), graph structure is generally used to encode relation information in the input document to classify the relation category between each entity pair, and has greatly advanced the DocRE task over the past several years. However, the learned graph representation universally models relation information between all entity pairs regardless of whether there are relationships between these entity pairs. Thus, those entity pairs without relationships disperse the attention of the encoder-classifier DocRE for ones with relationships, which may further hind the improvement of DocRE. To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel encoder-classifier-reconstructor model for DocRE. The reconstructor manages to reconstruct the ground-truth path dependencies from the graph representation, to ensure that the proposed DocRE model pays more attention to encode entity pairs with relationships in the training. Furthermore, the reconstructor is regarded as a relationship indicator to assist relation classification in the inference, which can further improve the performance of DocRE model. Experimental results on a large-scale DocRE dataset show that the proposed model can significantly improve the accuracy of relation extraction on a strong heterogeneous graph-based baseline.

    "title": "Topic-Aware Multi-turn Dialogue Modeling",
    "abstract": "In the retrieval-based multi-turn dialogue modeling, it remains a challenge to select the most appropriate response according to extracting salient features in context utterances. As a conversation goes on, topic shift at discourse-level naturally happens through the continuous multi-turn dialogue context. However, all known retrieval-based systems are satisfied with exploiting local topic words for context utterance representation but fail to capture such essential global topic-aware clues at discourse-level. Instead of taking topic-agnostic n-gram utterance as processing unit for matching purpose in existing systems, this paper presents a novel topic-aware solution for multi-turn dialogue modeling, which segments and extracts topic-aware utterances in an unsupervised way, so that the resulted model is capable of capturing salient topic shift at discourse-level in need and thus effectively track topic flow during multi-turn conversation. Our topic-aware modeling is implemented by a newly proposed unsupervised topic-aware segmentation algorithm and Topic-Aware Dual-attention Matching (TADAM) Network, which matches each topic segment with the response in a dual cross-attention way. Experimental results on three public datasets show TADAM can outperform the state-of-the-art method, especially by 3.3% on E-commerce dataset that has an obvious topic shift",

    "abstract": "In recent years, researchers have shown an increased interest in recognizing the overlapping entities that have nested structures. However, most existing models ignore the semantic correlation between words under different entity types. Considering words in sentence play different roles under different entity types, we argue that the correlation intensities of pairwise words in sentence for each entity type should be considered. In this paper, we treat named entity recognition as a multi-class classification of word pairs and design a simple neural model to handle this issue. Our model applies a supervised multi-head self-attention mechanism, where each head corresponds to one entity type, to construct the word-level correlations for each type. Our model can flexibly predict the span type by the correlation intensities of its head and tail under the corresponding type. In addition, we fuse entity boundary detection and entity classification by a multitask learning framework, which can capture the dependencies between these two tasks. To verify the performance of our model, we conduct extensive experiments on both nested and flat datasets. The experimental results show that our model can outperform the previous state-of-the-art methods on multiple tasks without any extra NLP tools or human annotations",

    "abstract": "Relation Extraction (RE) is to predict the relation type of two entities that are mentioned in a piece of text, e.g., a sentence or a dialogue. When the given text is long, it is challenging to identify indicative words for the relation prediction. Recent advances on RE task are from BERT-based sequence modeling and graph-based modeling of relationships among the tokens in the sequence. In this paper, we propose to construct a latent multi-view graph to capture various possible relationships among tokens. We then refine this graph to select important words for relation prediction. Finally, the representation of the refined graph and the BERT-based sequence representation are concatenated for relation extraction. Specifically, in our proposed GDPNet (Gaussian Dynamic Time Warping Pooling Net), we utilize Gaussian Graph Generator (GGG) to generate edges of the multi-view graph. The graph is then refined by Dynamic Time Warping Pooling (DTWPool). On DialogRE and TACRED, we show that GDPNet achieves the best performance on dialogue-level RE, and comparable performance with the state-of-the-arts on sentence-level RE.

We attain interpretability by converting the intricate position-dependent textual semantics into binary form, mapping all the features into bag-of-words (BOWs). The binary form BOWs are encoded so that the information on the aspect and context words are nearly lossless for sentiment classification. We further adapt the BOWs as input to the TM, enabling learning of aspect-based sentiment patterns in propositional logic. To evaluate interpretability and accuracy, we conducted experiments on two widely used ABSA datasets of SemEval 2014: Restaurant 14 and Laptop 14. The experiments show how each relevant feature takes part in conjunctive clauses that contain the context information for the corresponding aspect word, demonstrating human-level interpretability. At the same time, the obtained accuracy is competitive with existing neural network models, reaching 78.02% on Restaurant 14 and 73.51% on Laptop 14",

Using a new dataset of fourteen thousand sentence pairs human-labeled according to their semantic similarity, we demonstrate that none of the metrics widely used in the literature is close enough to human judgment in these tasks.

    "abstract": "Personality detection aims to identify the personality traits implied in social media posts. The core of this task is to put together information in multiple scattered posts to depict an overall personality profile for each user. Existing approaches either encode each post individually or assemble posts arbitrarily into a new document that can be encoded sequentially or hierarchically. While the first approach ignores the connection between posts, the second tends to introduce unnecessary post-order bias into posts. In this paper, we propose a multi-document Transformer, namely Transformer-MD, to tackle the above issues. When encoding each post, Transformer-MD allows access to information in the other posts of the user through Transformer-XL’s memory tokens which share the same position embedding.Besides, personality is usually defined along different traits and each trait may need to attend to different post information, which has rarely been touched by existing research. To address this concern, we propose a dimension attention mechanism on top of Transformer-MD to obtain trait-specific representations for multi-trait personality detection. We evaluate the proposed model on the Kaggle and Pandora MBTI datasets and the experimental results show that it compares favorably with baseline methods",

Specifically, UBAR is acquired by fine-tuning the large pre-trained unidirectional language model GPT-2 on the sequence of the entire dialog session which is composed of user utterance, belief state, database result, system act, and system response of every dialog turn. Additionally, UBAR is evaluated in a more realistic setting, where its dialog context has access to user utterances and all content it generated such as belief states, system acts, and system responses.  Experimental results on the MultiWOZ datasets show that UBAR achieves state-of-the-art performances in multiple settings, improving the combined score of response generation, policy optimization, and end-to-end modeling by 4.7, 3.5, and 9.4 points respectively. Thorough analyses demonstrate that the session-level training sequence formulation and the generated dialog context are essential for UBAR to operate as a fully end-to-end task-oriented dialog system in real life.   We also examine the transfer ability of UBAR to new domains with limited data and provide visualization and a case study to illustrate the advantages of UBAR in modeling on a dialog session level",

Thus, we propose learning a response generation model with both image-grounded dialogues and textual dialogues by assuming that the visual scene information at the time of a conversation can be represented by an image, and trying to recover the latent images of the textual dialogues through text-to-image generation techniques. The likelihood of the two types of dialogues is then formulated by a response generator and an image reconstructor that are learned within a conditional variational auto-encoding framework. Empirical studies are conducted in both image-grounded conversation and text-based conversation. In the first scenario, image-grounded dialogues, especially under a low-resource setting, can be effectively augmented by textual dialogues with latent images; while in the second scenario, latent images can enrich the content of responses and at the same time keep them relevant to contexts",

While adversarial language games are ubiquitous in human activities, little attention has been devoted to this field in natural language processing. In this work, we propose a challenging adversarial language game called Adversarial Taboo as an example, in which an attacker and a defender compete around a target word. The attacker is tasked with inducing the defender to utter the target word invisible to the defender, while the defender is tasked with detecting the target word before being induced by the attacker. In Adversarial Taboo, a successful attacker and defender need to hide or infer the intention, and induce or defend during conversations. This requires several advanced language abilities, such as adversarial pragmatic reasoning and goal-oriented language interactions in open domain, which will facilitate many downstream NLP tasks. To instantiate the game, we create a game environment and a competition platform. Comprehensive experiments on several baseline attack and defense strategies show promising and interesting results, based on which we discuss some directions for future research",

    "abstract": "In most machine learning tasks, we evaluate a model M on a given data population S by measuring a population-level metric F(S;M). Examples of such evaluation metric F include precision/recall for (binary) recognition, the F1 score for multi-class classification, and the BLEU metric for language generation. On the other hand, the model M is trained by optimizing a sample-level loss G(S_t; M) at each learning step t, where S_t is a subset of S (a.k.a. the mini-batch). Popular choices of G include cross-entropy loss, the Dice loss, and sentence-level BLEU scores. A fundamental assumption behind this paradigm is that the mean value of the sample-level loss G, if averaged over all possible samples, should effectively represent the population-level metric F of the task, such as, that E[ G(S_t; M) ] ~ F(S; M).  In this paper, we systematically investigate the above assumption in several NLP tasks. We show, both theoretically and experimentally, that some popular designs of the sample-level loss G may be inconsistent with the true population-level metric F of the task, so that models trained to optimize the former can be substantially sub-optimal to the latter, a phenomenon we call it, Simpson's bias, due to its deep connections with the classic paradox known as Simpson's reversal paradox in statistics and social sciences",

Here we study using such LMs to fill in entities in human-authored comparative questions, like ``Which country is older, India or _____?''---i.e., we study the ability of neural LMs to ask (not answer) reasonable questions. We show that accuracy in this fill-in-the-blank task is well-correlated with human judgements of whether a question is reasonable, and that these models can be trained to achieve nearly human-level performance in completing comparative questions in three different subdomains. However, analysis shows that what they learn fails to model any sort of broad notion of which entities are semantically comparable or similar---instead the trained models are very domain-specific, and performance is highly correlated with co-occurrences between specific entities observed in the training set. This is true both for models that are pretrained on general text corpora, as well as models trained on a large corpus of comparison questions. Our study thus reinforces recent results on the difficulty of making claims about a deep model's world knowledge or linguistic competence based on performance on specific benchmark problems.

    "abstract": "In product description generation (PDG), the user-cared aspect is critical for the recommendation system, which can not only improve user's experiences but also obtain more clicks. High-quality customer reviews can be considered as an ideal source to mine user-cared aspects. However, in reality, a large number of new products (known as long-tailed commodities) cannot gather sufficient amount of customer reviews, which brings a big challenge in the product description generation task. Existing works tend to generate the product description solely based on item information, i.e., product attributes or title words, which leads to tedious contents and cannot attract customers effectively. To tackle this problem, we propose an adaptive posterior network based on Transformer architecture that can utilize user-cared information from customer reviews. Specifically, we first extend the self-attentive Transformer encoder to encode product titles and attributes. Then, we apply an adaptive posterior distillation module to utilize useful review information, which integrates user-cared aspects to the generation process. Finally, we apply a Transformer-based decoding phase with copy mechanism to automatically generate the product description. Besides, we also collect a large-scare Chinese product description dataset to support our work and further research in this field. Experimental results show that our model is superior to traditional generative models in both automatic indicators and human evaluation",

    "abstract": "Existing speech to speech translation systems heavily rely on the text of target language: they usually translate source language either to target text and then synthesize target speech from text, or directly to target speech with target text for auxiliary training. However, those methods cannot be applied to unwritten target languages, which have no written text or phoneme available. In this paper, we develop a translation system for unwritten languages, named as UWSpeech, which converts target unwritten speech into discrete tokens with a converter, and then translates source-language speech into target discrete tokens with a translator, and finally synthesizes target speech from target discrete tokens with an inverter. We propose a method called XL-VAE, which enhances vector quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE) with cross-lingual (XL) speech recognition, to train the converter and inverter of UWSpeech jointly. Experiments on Fisher Spanish-English conversation translation dataset show that UWSpeech outperforms direct translation and VQ-VAE baseline by about 16 and 10 BLEU points respectively, which demonstrate the advantages and potentials of UWSpeech",

In this scenario, we consider not only the label-to-label dependency, but also the feature-to-label and modality-to-label dependencies.

However, dominant MNER models do not fully exploit fine-grained semantic correspondences between semantic units of different modalities, which have the potential to refine multi-modal representation learning. To deal with this issue, we propose a unified multi-modal graph fusion (UMGF) approach for MNER. Specifically, we first represent the input sentence and image using a unified multi-modal graph, which captures various semantic relationships between multi-modal semantic units (words and visual objects). Then, we stack multiple graph-based multi-modal fusion layers that iteratively perform semantic interactions to learn node representations. Finally, we achieve an attention-based multi-modal representation for each word and perform entity labeling with a CRF decoder.

    "abstract": "Large model size and high computational complexity prevent the neural machine translation (NMT) models from being deployed to low resource devices (e.g. mobile phones). Due to the large vocabulary, a large storage memory is required for the word embedding matrix in NMT models, in the meantime, high latency is introduced when constructing the word probability distribution. Based on reusing the word embedding matrix in the softmax layer, it is possible to handle the two problems brought by large vocabulary at the same time. In this paper, we propose Partial Vector Quantization (P-VQ) for NMT models, which can both compress the word embedding matrix and accelerate word probability prediction in the softmax layer. With P-VQ, the word embedding matrix is split into two low dimensional matrices, namely the shared part and the exclusive part. We compress the shared part by vector quantization and leave the exclusive part unchanged to maintain the uniqueness of each word. For acceleration, in the softmax layer, we replace most of the multiplication operations with the efficient looking-up operations based on our compression to reduce the computational complexity. Furthermore, we adopt curriculum learning and compact the word embedding matrix gradually to improve the compression quality. Experimental results on the Chinese-to-English translation task show that our method can reduce 74.35% of parameters of the word embedding and 74.42% of the FLOPs of the softmax layer. Meanwhile, the average BLEU score on the WMT test sets only drops 0.04",

Moreover, we propose an alignment strategy to tackle the label inconsistency problem during clustering assignments. Finally, we learn the intent representations under the supervision of the aligned pseudo-labels. With an unknown number of new intents, we predict the number of intent categories by eliminating low-confidence intent-wise clusters.

In this paper, we propose a post-processing method to learn the adaptive decision boundary (ADB) for open intent classification.

However, the stacking of many layers and components generates huge parameters, leading to low parameter efficiency. In response to this issue, we propose a lightweight architecture named Continuous Self-Attention models with neural ODE networks (CSAODE). In CSAODE, continuous dynamical models (i.e., neural ODEs) are coupled with our proposed self-attention block to form a self-attention ODE solver. This solver continuously calculates and optimizes the hidden states via only one layer of parameters to improve the parameter efficiency. In addition, we design a novel accelerated continuous dynamical model to reduce computing costs, and integrate it in CSAODE. Moreover, since the original self-attention ignores local information, CSAODE makes use of N-gram convolution to encode local representations, and a fusion layer with only two trainable scalars are designed for generating sentence vectors. We perform a series of experiments on text classification, neural language inference (NLI) and text matching tasks. With fewer parameters, CSAODE outperforms state-of-the-art models on text classification tasks (e.g., 1.3% accuracy improved on SUBJ task), and has competitive performances for NLI and text matching tasks as well",

Separate encoders are dedicated to processing the tongue and lip data streams respectively. The decoder predicts acoustic features conditioned on encoder outputs and speaker codes.To mitigate for having only relatively small amounts of dual articulatory-acoustic data available for training, and since our task here shares with text-to-speech (TTS) the common goal of speech generation, we propose a novel transfer learning strategy to exploit the much larger amounts of acoustic-only data available to train TTS models. For this, a Tacotron 2 TTS model is first trained, and then the parameters of its decoder are transferred to the TaLNet decoder. We have evaluated our approach on an unconstrained multi-speaker voice recovery task. Our results show the effectiveness of both the proposed model and the transfer learning strategy. Speech reconstructed using our proposed method significantly outperformed all baselines (DNN, BLSTM and without transfer learning) in terms of both naturalness and intelligibility. When using an ASR model decoding the recovery speech, the WER of our proposed method is relatively reduced over 30% compared to baselines",

    "abstract": "Sentence semantic matching is one of the fundamental tasks in natural language processing, which requires an agent to determine the semantic relation among input sentences. Recently, deep neural networks have achieved impressive performance in this area, especially BERT. Despite the effectiveness of these models, most of them treat output labels as meaningless one-hot vectors, underestimating the semantic information and guidance of relations that these labels reveal, especially for tasks with a small number of labels. To address this problem, we propose a Relation of Relation Learning Network (R2-Net) for sentence semantic matching. Specifically, we first employ BERT to encode the input sentences from a global perspective. Then a CNN-based encoder is designed to capture keywords and phrase information from a local perspective. To fully leverage labels for better relation information extraction, we introduce a self-supervised relation of relation classification task for guiding R2-Net to consider more about labels. Meanwhile, a triplet loss is employed to distinguish the intra-class and inter-class relations in a finer granularity. Empirical experiments on two sentence semantic matching tasks demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model. As a byproduct, we have released the codes to facilitate other researches",

    "abstract": "Previous work has shown the effectiveness of using event representations for tasks such as script event prediction and stock market prediction. It is however still challenging to learn the subtle semantic differences between events based solely on textual descriptions of events often represented as (subject, predicate, object) triples. As an alternative, images offer a more intuitive way of understanding event semantics. We observe that event described in text and in images show different abstraction levels and therefore should be projected onto heterogeneous embedding spaces, as opposed to what have been done in previous approaches which project signals from different modalities onto a homogeneous space. In this paper, we propose a Multimodal Event Representation Learning framework (MERL) to learn event representations based on both text and image modalities simultaneously. Event textual triples are projected as Gaussian density embeddings by a dual-path Gaussian triple encoder, while event images are projected as point embeddings by a visual event component-aware image encoder. Moreover, a novel score function motivated by statistical hypothesis testing is introduced to coordinate two embedding spaces. Experiments are conducted on various multimodal event-related tasks and results show that MERL outperforms a number of unimodal and multimodal baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework",

For the low training speed, we propose an incremental Transformer with an average embedding layer (AEL) to accelerate the speed of calculation of the hidden states during training. For future-guided training, we propose a conventional Transformer as the teacher of the incremental Transformer, and try to invisibly embed some future information in the model through knowledge distillation. We conducted experiments on Chinese-English and German-English simultaneous translation tasks and compared with the wait-k policy to evaluate the proposed method. Our method can effectively increase the training speed by about 28 times on average at different k and implicitly embed some predictive abilities in the model, achieving better translation quality than wait-k baseline",

This work shows the first attempt of a source-target bilingual syntactic alignment approach SyntAligner by mutual information maximization-based self-supervised neural deep modeling. Building on the word alignment for NMT, our SyntAligner firstly aligns the syntactic structures of source and target sentences and then maximizes their mutual dependency by introducing a lower bound on their mutual information. In SyntAligner, the syntactic structure of span granularity is represented by transforming source or target word hidden state into a source or target syntactic span vector. A border-sensitive span attention mechanism then captures the correlation between the source and target syntactic span vectors, which also captures the self-attention between span border-words as alignment bias. Lastly, a self-supervised bilingual syntactic mutual information maximization-based learning objective dynamically samples the aligned syntactic spans to maximize their mutual dependency. Experiment results on three typical NMT tasks: WMT'14 English to German, IWSLT'14 German to English, and NC'11 English to French show the SyntAligner effectiveness and universality of syntactic alignment",

The mainstream approaches learn to generate answer ranking scores based on the matching degree between question and answer representations as well as the influence of respondents. However, they encounter two main limitations: (1) Correlations between answers in the same question are often overlooked. (2) Question and respondent representations are built independently of specific answers before affecting answer representations. To address the limitations, we devise a novel graph-based tri-attention network, namely GTAN, which has two innovations. First, GTAN proposes to construct a graph for each question and learn answer correlations from each graph through graph neural networks (GNNs). Second, based on the representations learned from GNNs, an alternating tri-attention method is developed to alternatively build target-aware respondent representations, answer-specific question representations, and context-aware answer representations by attention computation. GTAN finally integrates the above representations to generate answer ranking scores. Experiments on three real-world CQA datasets demonstrate GTAN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art answer ranking methods, validating the rationality of the network architecture",

    "abstract": "Human judgments of word similarity have been a popular method of evaluating the quality of word embedding. But it fails to measure the geometry properties such as asymmetry. For example, it is more natural to say ``Ellipses are like Circles'' than ``Circles are like Ellipses''. Such asymmetry has been observed from the word evocation experiment, where one word is used to recall another. This association data have been understudied for measuring embedding quality. In this paper, we use three well-known evocation datasets for the purpose and study both static embedding as well as contextual embedding, such as BERT. To fight for the dynamic nature of BERT embedding, we probe BERT's conditional probabilities as a language model, using a large number of Wikipedia contexts to derive a theoretically justifiable Bayesian asymmetry score. The result shows that the asymmetry judgment and similarity judgments disagree, and asymmetry judgment aligns with its strong performance on ``extrinsic evaluations''. This is the first time we can show contextual embeddings's strength on intrinsic evaluation, and the asymmetry judgment provides a new perspective to evaluate contextual embedding and new insights for representation learning",

Then each instance in the batch is regarded as either correct or noisy one according to its label confidence derived from previous training step, as well as the noise distribution in this sampled batch.

In a tete-a-tete, such as a customer-agent conversation, SuTaT aims to summarize for each speaker by modeling the customer utterances and the agent utterances separately while retaining their correlations. SuTaT consists of a conditional generative module and two unsupervised summarization modules. The conditional generative module contains two encoders and two decoders in a variational autoencoder framework where the dependencies between two latent spaces are captured. With the same encoders and decoders, two unsupervised summarization modules equipped with sentence-level self-attention mechanisms generate summaries without using any annotations. Experimental results show that SuTaT is superior on unsupervised dialogue summarization for both automatic and human evaluations, and is capable of dialogue classification and single-turn conversation generation",

Image selection, which involves choosing appropriate images according to some specified contexts, is crucial for formulating good news. However, it presents two challenges: where to place images and which images to use. The difficulties associated with this where-which problem lie in the fact that news typically contains linguistically rich text that delivers complex information and more than one image. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end two-stage framework to address these issues comprehensively. In the first stage, we identify key information in news by using location embeddings, which represent the local contextual information of each candidate location for image insertion. Then, in the second stage, we thoroughly examine the candidate images and select the most context-related ones to insert into each location identified in the first stage. We also introduce three insertion strategies to formulate different scenarios influencing the image selection procedure.

This paper devotes itself to exploring better verifier design for the MRC task with unanswerable questions. Inspired by how humans solve reading comprehension questions, we proposed a retrospective reader (Retro-Reader) that integrates two stages of reading and verification strategies: 1) sketchy reading that briefly investigates the overall interactions of passage and question, and yields an initial judgment; 2) intensive reading that verifies the answer and gives the final prediction.

    "title": "Dynamic Modeling Cross- and Self-Lattice Attention Network for Chinese NER",
    "abstract": "Word-character lattice models have been proved to be effective for Chinese named entity recognition (NER), in which word boundary information is fused into character sequences for enhancing character representations. However, prior approaches have only used simple methods such as feature concatenation or position encoding to integrate word-character lattice information, but fail to capture fine-grained correlations in word-character spaces. In this paper, we propose DCSAN, a Dynamic Cross- and Self-lattice Attention Network that aims to model dense interactions over word-character lattice structure for Chinese NER. By carefully combining cross-lattice and self-lattice attention modules with gated word-character semantic fusion unit, the network can explicitly capture fine-grained correlations across different spaces (e.g., word-to-character and character-to-character), thus significantly improving model performance. Experiments on four Chinese NER datasets show that DCSAN obtains stateof-the-art results as well as efficiency compared to several competitive approaches",

    "title": "A Unified Multi-Task Learning Framework for Joint Extraction of Entities and Relations",
    "abstract": "Joint extraction of entities and relations focuses on detecting entity pairs and their relations simultaneously with a unified model. Based on the extraction order, previous works mainly solve this task through relation-last, relation-first and relation-middle manner. However, these methods still suffer from the template-dependency, non-entity detection and non-predefined relation prediction problem. To overcome these challenges, in this paper, we propose a unified multi-task learning framework to divide the task into three interacted sub-tasks. Specifically, we first introduce the type-attentional method for subject extraction to provide prior type information explicitly. Then, the subject-aware relation prediction is presented to select useful relations based on the combination of global and local semantics. Third, we propose a question generation based QA method for object extraction to obtain diverse queries automatically. Notably, our method detects subjects or objects without relying on NER models and thus it is capable of dealing with the non-entity scenario. Finally, three sub-tasks are integrated into a unified model through parameter sharing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms all the baseline methods on two benchmark datasets, and further achieve excellent performance for non-predefined relations",

    "title": "LIREx: Augmenting Language Inference with Relevant Explanations",
    "abstract": "Natural language explanations (NLEs) are a special form of data annotation in which annotators identify rationales (most significant text tokens) when assigning labels to data instances, and write out explanations for the labels in natural language based on the rationales. NLEs have been shown to capture human reasoning better, but not as beneficial for natural language inference (NLI). In this paper, we analyze two primary flaws in the way NLEs are currently used to train explanation generators for language inference tasks. We find that the explanation generators do not take into account the variability inherent in human explanation of labels, and that the current explanation generation models generate spurious explanations. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework, LIREx, that incorporates both a rationale-enabled explanation generator and an instance selector to select only relevant, plausible NLEs to augment NLI models. When evaluated on the standardized SNLI data set, LIREx achieved an accuracy of 91.87%, an improvement of 0.32 over the baseline and matching the best-reported performance on the data set. It also achieves significantly better performance than previous studies when transferred to the out-of-domain MultiNLI data set. Qualitative analysis shows that LIREx generates flexible, faithful, and relevant NLEs that allow the model to be more robust to spurious explanations.

    "abstract": "Dialogue policy learning based on reinforcement learning is difficult to be applied to real users to train dialogue agents from scratch because of the high cost. User simulators, which choose random user goals for the dialogue agent to train on, have been considered as an affordable substitute for real users. However, this random sampling method ignores the law of human learning, making the learned dialogue policy inefficient and unstable. We propose a novel framework, Automatic Curriculum Learning-based Deep Q-Network (ACL-DQN), which replaces the traditional random sampling method with a teacher policy model to realize the dialogue policy for automatic curriculum learning. The teacher model arranges a meaningful ordered curriculum and automatically adjusts it by monitoring the learning progress of the dialogue agent and the over-repetition penalty without any requirement of prior knowledge. The learning progress of the dialogue agent reflects the relationship between the dialogue agent's ability and the sampled goals' difficulty for sample efficiency. The over-repetition penalty guarantees the sampled diversity. Experiments show that the ACL-DQN significantly improves the effectiveness and stability of dialogue tasks with a statistically significant margin. Furthermore, the framework can be further improved by equipping with different curriculum schedules, which demonstrates that the framework has strong generalizability",

In this paper, we propose a novel idea to model speech and noise simultaneously in a two-branch convolutional neural network, namely SN-Net. In SN-Net, the two branches predict speech and noise, respectively. Instead of information fusion only at the final output layer, interaction modules are introduced at several intermediate feature domains between the two branches to benefit each other. Such an interaction can leverage features learned from one branch to counteract the undesired part and restore the missing component of the other and thus enhance their discrimination capabilities. We also design a feature extraction module, namely residual-convolution-and-attention (RA), to capture the correlations along temporal and frequency dimensions for both the speech and the noises. Evaluations on public datasets show that the interaction module plays a key role in simultaneous modeling and the SN-Net outperforms the state-of-the-art by a large margin on various evaluation metrics. The proposed SN-Net also shows superior performance for speaker separation",

However, this task is far from well-explored due to the difficulties of rendering a particular style in coherent responses, especially when the target style is embedded only in unpaired texts that cannot be directly used to train the dialogue model. This paper proposes a stylized dialogue generation method that can capture stylistic features embedded in unpaired texts. Specifically, our method can produce dialogue responses that are both coherent to the given context and conform to the target style. In this study, an inverse dialogue model is first introduced to predict possible posts for the input responses. Then this inverse model is used to generate stylized pseudo dialogue pairs based on these stylized unpaired texts. Further, these pseudo pairs are employed to train the stylized dialogue model with a joint training process. A style routing approach is proposed to intensify stylistic features in the decoder. Automatic and manual evaluations on two datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms competitive baselines in producing coherent and style-intensive dialogue responses",

    "abstract": "We study the problem of imposing conversational goals/keywords on open-domain conversational agents, where the agent is required to lead the conversation to a target keyword smoothly and fast. Solving this problem enables the application of conversational agents in many real-world scenarios, e.g., recommendation and psychotherapy. The dominant paradigm for tackling this problem is to 1) train a next-turn keyword classifier, and 2) train a keyword-augmented response retrieval model. However, existing approaches in this paradigm have two limitations: 1) the training and evaluation datasets for next-turn keyword classification are directly extracted from conversations without human annotations, thus, they are noisy and have low correlation with human judgements, and 2) during keyword transition, the agents solely rely on the similarities between word embeddings to move closer to the target keyword, which may not reflect how humans converse. In this paper, we assume that human conversations are grounded on commonsense and propose a keyword-guided neural conversational model that can leverage external commonsense knowledge graphs (CKG) for both keyword transition and response retrieval. Automatic evaluations suggest that commonsense improves the performance of both next-turn keyword prediction and keyword-augmented response retrieval. In addition, both self-play and human evaluations show that our model produces responses with smoother keyword transition and reaches the target keyword faster than competitive baselines",

However, in the field of conversational AI, most existing models only specialize in one aspect and neglect the other, which often leads to dull or unrelated responses. In this paper, we hypothesize that combining rationality and emotion into conversational agents can improve response quality. To test the hypothesis, we focus on one fundamental aspect of rationality, i.e., commonsense, and propose CARE, a novel model for commonsense-aware emotional response generation. Specifically, we first propose a framework to learn and construct commonsense-aware emotional latent concepts of the response given an input message and a desired emotion. We then propose three methods to collaboratively incorporate the latent concepts into response generation. Experimental results on two large-scale datasets support our hypothesis and show that our model can produce more accurate and commonsense-aware emotional responses and achieve better human ratings than state-of-the-art models that only specialize in one aspect",

To address these limitations, this paper proposes a multi-task adversarial active learning model for medical named entity recognition and normalization. In our model, the adversarial learning keeps the effectiveness of multi-task learning module and active learning module.

    "abstract": "Sentiment analysis on user-generated content has achieved notable progress by introducing user information to consider each individual’s preference and language usage. However, most existing approaches ignore the data sparsity problem, where the content of some users is limited and the model fails to capture discriminative features of users. To address this issue, we hypothesize that users could be grouped together based on their rating biases as well as degree of rating consistency and the knowledge learned from groups could be employed to analyze the users with limited data. Therefore, in this paper, a neural group-wise sentiment analysis model with data sparsity awareness is proposed. The user-centred document representations are generated by incorporating a group-based user encoder. Furthermore, a multi-task learning framework is employed to jointly modelusers’ rating biases and their degree of rating consistency. One task is vanilla populationlevel sentiment analysis and the other is groupwise sentiment analysis. Experimental results on three real-world datasets show that the proposed approach outperforms some state-of the-art methods.

    "abstract": "As one of the most powerful topic models, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) has been used in a vast range of tasks, including document understanding, information retrieval and peer-reviewer assignment. Despite its tremendous popularity, the security of LDA has rarely been studied. This poses severe risks to security-critical tasks such as sentiment analysis and peer-reviewer assignment that are based on LDA. In this paper, we are interested in knowing whether LDA models are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations of benign document examples during inference time. We formalize the evasion attack to LDA models as an optimization problem and prove it to be NP-hard. We then propose a novel and efficient algorithm, EvaLDA to solve it. We show the effectiveness of EvaLDA via extensive empirical evaluations. For instance, in the NIPS dataset, EvaLDA can averagely promote the rank of a target topic from 10 to around 7 by only replacing 1% of the words with similar words in a victim document. Our work provides significant insights into the power and limitations of evasion attacks to LDA models",

The isotropy of the pre-trained embeddings in PTLMs, however, is relatively under-explored. In this paper, we analyze the isotropy of the pre-trained [CLS] embeddings of PTLMs with straightforward visualization, and point out two major issues: high variance in their standard deviation, and high correlation between different dimensions. We also propose a new network regularization method, isotropic batch normalization (IsoBN) to address the issues, towards learning more isotropic representations in fine-tuning by dynamically penalizing dominating principal components.

Recently, methods based on adversarial training have been applied to this task and achieved promising results. In such methods, both the source and target data are utilized to learn domain-invariant features through deceiving a domain discriminator. However, the task classifier is only trained on the source data, which causes the aspect and sentiment information lying in the target data can not be exploited by the task classifier. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Hybrid Framework (AHF) for cross-domain aspect-based sentiment analysis. We integrate pseudo-label based semi-supervised learning and adversarial training in a unified network. Thus the target data can be used not only to align the features via the training of domain discriminator, but also to refine the task classifier. Furthermore, we design an adaptive mean teacher as the semi-supervised part of our network, which can mitigate the effects of noisy pseudo labels generated on the target data.

We solve the issues in existing studies under low-resource situations from two sides.

And from the perspective of the data, most existing methods focus on data generation and data augmentation. However, these methods rely heavily on external resources, which is more laborious to create than obtain unlabeled data. In this paper, we propose DualQA, a novel framework, which models the event argument extraction task as question answering to alleviate the problem of data sparseness and leverage the duality of event argument recognition which is to ask \"What plays the role\", as well as event role recognition which is to ask \"What the role is\", to mutually improve each other.Experimental results on two datasets prove the effectiveness of our approach, especially in extremely low-resource situations",
