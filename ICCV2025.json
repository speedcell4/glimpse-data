    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Chirality information (i.e. information that allows distinguishing left from right) is ubiquitous for various data modes in computer vision, including images, videos, point clouds, and meshes. While chirality has been extensively studied in the image domain, its exploration in shape analysis (such as point clouds and meshes) remains underdeveloped. Although many shape vertex descriptors have shown appealing properties (e.g. robustness to rigid-body transformations), they are often not able to disambiguate between left and right symmetric parts. Considering the ubiquity of chirality information in different shape analysis problems and the lack of chirality-aware features within current shape descriptors, developing a chirality feature extractor becomes necessary and urgent. Based on the recent Diff3F framework, we propose an unsupervised chirality feature extraction pipeline to decorate shape vertices with chirality-aware information, extracted from 2D foundation models. We evaluated the extracted chirality features through quantitative and qualitative experiments across diverse datasets. Results from downstream tasks including left-right disentanglement, shape matching, and part segmentation demonstrate their effectiveness and practical utility.

    "title": "Efficient Adaptation of Pre-trained Vision Transformer underpinned by Approximately Orthogonal Fine-Tuning Strategy",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "A prevalent approach in Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViT) involves freezing the majority of the backbone parameters and solely learning low-rank adaptation weight matrices to accommodate downstream tasks. These low-rank matrices are commonly derived through the multiplication structure of down-projection and up-projection matrices, exemplified by methods such as LoRA and Adapter. In this study, we observe an approximate orthogonality among any two row or column vectors within any weight matrix of the backbone parameters; however, this property is absent in the vectors of the down/up-projection matrices. Approximate orthogonality implies a reduction in the upper bound of the model's generalization error, signifying that the model possesses enhanced generalization capability. If the fine-tuned down/up-projection matrices were to exhibit this same property as the pre-trained backbone matrices, could the generalization capability of fine-tuned ViTs be further augmented? To address this question, we propose an Approximately Orthogonal Fine-Tuning (AOFT) strategy for representing the low-rank weight matrices. This strategy employs a single learnable vector to generate a set of approximately orthogonal vectors, which form the down/up-projection matrices, thereby aligning the properties of these matrices with those of the backbone. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance across a range of downstream image classification tasks, confirming the efficacy of the enhanced generalization capability embedded in the down/up-projection matrices.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Speech-driven methods for portraits are figuratively known as \"Talkers\" because of their capability to synthesize speaking mouth shapes and facial movements. Especially with the rapid development of the Text-to-Image (T2I) models, AI-Generated Talking Heads (AGTHs) have gradually become an emerging digital human media. However, challenges persist regarding the quality of these talkers and AGTHs they generate, and comprehensive studies addressing these issues remain limited. To address this gap, this paper presents the largest AGTH quality assessment dataset THQA-10K to date, which selects 12 prominent T2I models and 14 advanced talkers to generate AGTHs for 14 prompts. After excluding instances where AGTH generation is unsuccessful, the THQA-10K dataset contains 10,457 AGTHs, which provides rich material for AGTH quality assessment. Then, volunteers are recruited to subjectively rate the AGTHs and give the corresponding distortion categories. In our analysis for subjective experimental results, we evaluate the performance of talkers in terms of generalizability and quality, and also expose the distortions of existing AGTHs. Finally, an objective quality assessment method based on the first frame, Y-T slice and tone-lip consistency is proposed. Experimental results show that this method can achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in AGTH quality assessment. The work is released at https://github.com/zyj-2000/Talker",

The development of a layer-aware framework faces a significant data scarcity challenge due to the commercial sensitivity of professional animation assets. To address the limitation, we propose a data curation pipeline featuring Automated Element Segmentation and Motion-based Hierarchical Merging. Through quantitative and qualitative comparisons and user study, we demonstrate that LayerAnimate outperforms current methods in terms of animation quality, control precision, and usability, making it an effective tool for both professional animators and amateur enthusiasts.

    "abstract": "Advances in Earth observation (EO) foundation models have unlocked the potential of big satellite data to learn generic representations from space, benefiting a wide range of downstream applications crucial to our planet. However, most existing efforts remain limited to fixed spectral sensors, focus solely on the Earth's surface, and overlook valuable metadata beyond imagery. In this work, we take a step towards next-generation EO foundation models with three key components: 1) Copernicus-Pretrain, a massive-scale pretraining dataset that integrates 18.7M aligned images from all major Copernicus Sentinel missions, spanning from the Earth's surface to its atmosphere; 2) Copernicus-FM, a unified foundation model capable of processing any spectral or non-spectral sensor modality using extended dynamic hypernetworks and flexible metadata encoding; and 3) Copernicus-Bench, a systematic evaluation benchmark with 15 hierarchical downstream tasks ranging from preprocessing to specialized applications for each Sentinel mission. Our dataset, model, and benchmark greatly improve the scalability, versatility, and multimodal adaptability of EO foundation models, while also creating new opportunities to connect EO, weather, and climate research.

We propose the ROADWork dataset to learn to recognize, observe, analyze, and drive through work zones. State-of-the-art foundation models fail when applied to work zones. Fine-tuning models on our dataset significantly improves perception and navigation in work zones. With ROADWork, we discover new work zone images with higher precision (+32.5%) at a much higher rate (12.8x) around the world. Open-vocabulary methods fail too, whereas fine-tuned detectors improve performance (+32.2 AP).Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle to describe work zones, but fine-tuning substantially improves performance (+36.7 SPICE). Beyond fine-tuning, we show the value of simple techniques. Video label propagation provides additional gains (+2.6 AP) for instance segmentation. While reading work zone signs, composing a detector and text spotter via crop-scaling improves performance (+14.2% 1-NED). Composing work zone detections to provide context further reduces hallucinations (+3.9 SPICE) in VLMs. We predict navigational goals and compute drivable paths from work zone videos. Incorporating road work semantics ensures 53.6% goals have angular error (AE) < 0.5 (+9.9%) and 75.3% pathways have AE < 0.5 (+8.1%)",

In this paper, we propose a novel framework for IOD that leverages a decoupled gradient alignment technique on top of the specially proposed pseudo-labeling strategy. Our method employs a Gaussian Mixture Model to accurately estimate pseudo-labels of previously learned objects in current training images, effectively functioning as a knowledge-replay mechanism. This strategy reinforces prior knowledge retention and prevents the misclassification of unannotated foreground objects from earlier classes as background. Furthermore, we introduce an adaptive gradient decomposition and alignment method to maintain model stability while facilitating positive knowledge transfer. By aligning gradients from both old and new classes, our approach preserves previously learned knowledge while enhancing plasticity for new tasks. Extensive experiments on two IOD benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving superior performances to state-of-the-art methods",

    "abstract": "Polyp segmentation is vital for early colorectal cancer detection, yet traditional fully supervised methods struggle with morphological variability and domain shifts, requiring frequent retraining. Additionally, reliance on large-scale annotations is a major bottleneck due to the time-consuming and error-prone nature of polyp boundary labeling. Recently, vision foundation models like Segment Anything Model (SAM) have demonstrated strong generalizability and fine-grained boundary detection with sparse prompts, effectively addressing key polyp segmentation challenges. However, SAM's prompt-dependent nature limits automation in medical applications, since manually inputting prompts for each image is labor-intensive and time-consuming. We propose OP-SAM, a One-shot Polyp segmentation framework based on SAM that automatically generates prompts from a single annotated image, ensuring accurate and generalizable segmentation without additional annotation burdens. Our method introduces Correlation-based Prior Generation (CPG) for semantic label transfer and Scale-cascaded Prior Fusion (SPF) to adapt to polyp size variations as well as filter out noisy transfers. Instead of dumping all prompts at once, we devise Euclidean Prompt Evolution (EPE) for iterative prompt refinement, progressively enhancing segmentation quality. Extensive evaluations across five datasets validate OP-SAM's effectiveness. Notably, on Kvasir, it achieves 76.93% IoU, surpassing the state-of-the-art by 11.44%",

    "abstract": "Machine learning classification models trained with empirical risk minimization (ERM) often inadvertently rely on spurious correlations. When absent in the test data, these unintended associations between non-target attributes and target labels lead to poor generalization. This paper addresses this problem from a model optimization perspective and proposes a novel method, Gradient Extrapolation for Debiased Representation Learning (GERNE), designed to learn debiased representations in both known and unknown attribute training cases. GERNE uses two distinct batches with different amounts of spurious correlations and defines the target gradient as a linear extrapolation of the gradients computed from each batch's loss. Our analysis shows that when the extrapolated gradient points toward the batch gradient with fewer spurious correlations, it effectively guides training toward learning a debiased model. GERNE serves as a general framework for debiasing, encompassing ERM and Resampling methods as special cases. We derive the theoretical upper and lower bounds of the extrapolation factor employed by GERNE. By tuning this factor, GERNE can adapt to maximize either Group-Balanced Accuracy (GBA) or Worst-Group Accuracy (WGA). We validate GERNE on five vision and one NLP benchmarks, demonstrating competitive and often superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

We introduce PILOT, a programmatic imitation learning approach that predicts a driver's eye movements based on a set of rule-based conditions. These conditions--derived from driving operations and traffic flow characteristics--define how gaze shifts occur. They are initially identified through incremental synthesis, a heuristic search method, and then refined via L-BFGS, a numerical optimization technique. These human-readable rules enable us to understand drivers' eye movement patterns and make efficient and explainable predictions. We also propose DATAD, a dataset that covers 12 types of autonomous driving takeover scenarios, collected from 60 participants and comprising approximately 600,000 frames of gaze point data. Compared to existing eye-tracking datasets, DATAD includes additional driving metrics and surrounding traffic flow characteristics, providing richer contextual information for modeling gaze behavior. Experimental evaluations of PILOT on DATAD demonstrate superior accuracy and faster prediction speeds compared to four baseline models. Specifically, PILOT reduces the MSE of predicted trajectories by 38.59% to 88.02% and improves the accuracy of gaze object predictions by 6.90% to 55.06%.

In this study, we propose a highly-consistent data synthesis pipeline to tackle these challenges. This pipeline harnesses the intrinsic in-context generation capabilities of diffusion transformers and generates high-consistent multi-subject paired data. Additionally, we introduce UNO, a multi-subject driven customization architecture based on a diffusion transformer. UNO incorporates a progressive cross-modal alignment training paradigm that progresses from simpler single-subject conditioning to more complex multi-subject conditioning. Along with this, a universal rotary position embedding (UnoPE) adjusts the position indices.

Existing MHFL methods face significant limitations when it comes to transferring global knowledge to clients as a result of sharing only partial homogeneous model parameters or calculating distance loss, leading to inferior model generalization. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel model-heterogeneous Federated learning method with Representation Angle Learning (FedRAL). It consists of three innovative designs: (1) We first introduce representation angle learning into MHFL. Specifically, we embed a homogeneous square matrix into the local heterogeneous model of each client, which learns the angle information of local representations. These homogeneous representation angle square matrices are aggregated on the server to fuse representation angle knowledge shared by clients for enhancing the generalization of local representations. (2) As different clients might have heterogeneous system resources, we propose an adaptive diagonal sparsification strategy to reduce the numbers of the parameters of representation angle square matrices uploaded to the server, to improve FL communication efficiency. (3) To enable the effective fusion of sparsified homogeneous local representation angle square matrices, we design an element-wise weighted aggregation approach. Experiments on 4 benchmark datasets under 2 types of non-IID divisions over 6 state-of-the-art baselines demonstrate that FedRAL achieves the best performance.

    "abstract": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made significant progress in recent years but are also prone to hallucination issues. They exhibit more hallucinations in longer, free-form responses, often attributed to accumulated uncertainties. In this paper, we ask: Does increased hallucination result solely from length-induced errors, or is there a deeper underlying mechanism? After a series of preliminary experiments and findings, we suggest that the risk of hallucinations is not caused by length itself but by the increased reliance on context for coherence and completeness in longer responses. Building on these insights, we propose a novel \"induce-detect-suppress\" framework that actively induces hallucinations through deliberately designed contexts, leverages induced instances for early detection of high-risk cases, and ultimately suppresses potential object-level hallucinations during actual decoding. Our approach achieves consistent, significant improvements across all benchmarks, demonstrating its efficacy. The strong detection and improved hallucination mitigation not only validate our framework but, more importantly, re-validate our hypothesis on context. Rather than solely pursuing performance gains, this study aims to provide new insights and serves as a first step toward a deeper exploration of hallucinations in LVLMs' longer responses",

We propose a novel method, Retrieval and Reasoning for Personalization (R2P), leveraging internal knowledge of VLMs. First, we leverage VLMs to extract the concept fingerprint, i.e., key attributes uniquely defining the concept within its semantic class. When a query arrives, the most similar fingerprints are retrieved and scored via chain of thought reasoning. To reduce the risk of hallucinations, the scores are validated through cross-modal verification at the attribute level:in case of a discrepancy between the scores, R2P refines the concept association viapairwise multimodal matching, where the retrieved fingerprints and their images aredirectly compared with the query.We validate R2P on two publicly available benchmarks and a newly introduced dataset, Personal Concepts with Visual Ambiguity (PerVA), for concept identification highlighting challenges in visual ambiguity. R2P consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on various downstream tasks across all benchmarks",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in video diffusion models enable the generation of photorealistic videos with impressive 3D consistency and temporal coherence. However, the extent to which these AI-generated videos simulate the 3D visual world remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce Learned 3D Evaluation (L3DE), an objective, quantifiable, and interpretable method for assessing AI-generated videos' ability to simulate the real world in terms of 3D visual qualities and consistencies, without requiring manually labeled defects or quality annotations. Instead of relying on 3D reconstruction, which is prone to failure with in-the-wild videos, L3DE employs a 3D convolutional network, trained on monocular 3D cues of motion, depth, and appearance, to distinguish real from synthetic videos. Confidence scores from L3DE quantify the gap between real and synthetic videos in terms of 3D visual coherence, while a gradient-based visualization pinpoints unrealistic regions, improving interpretability. We validate L3DE through extensive experiments, demonstrating strong alignment with 3D reconstruction quality and human judgments. Our evaluations on leading generative models (e.g., Sora, MiniMax, and Kling) reveal persistent simulation gaps and subtle inconsistencies. Beyond generative video assessment, L3DE extends to broader applications: benchmarking video generation models, serving as a deepfake detector, and enhancing video synthesis by inpainting flagged inconsistencies",

    "title": "Rethinking Detecting Salient and Camouflaged Objects in Unconstrained Scenes",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "While the human visual system employs distinct mechanisms to perceive salient and camouflaged objects, existing models struggle to disentangle these tasks. Specifically, salient object detection (SOD) models frequently misclassify camouflaged objects as salient, while camouflaged object detection (COD) models conversely misinterpret salient objects as camouflaged. We hypothesize that this can be attributed to two factors: (i) the specific annotation paradigm of current SOD and COD datasets, and (ii) the lack of explicit aspect relationship modeling in current models. Prevalent SOD/COD datasets enforce a mutual exclusivity constraint, assuming scenes contain either salient or camouflaged objects, which poorly aligns with the real world. Furthermore, current SOD/COD methods are primarily designed for these highly constrained datasets and lack explicit modeling of the relationship between salient and camouflaged objects. In this paper, to promote the development of unconstrained salient and camouflaged object detection, we construct a large-scale dataset, USC12K, which features comprehensive labels and four different scenes that cover all possible logical existence scenarios of both salient and camouflaged objects. To explicitly model the relationship between salient and camouflaged objects, we propose a model called USCNet, which introduces two distinct prompt query mechanisms for modeling inter-sample and intra-sample aspect relationships. Additionally, to assess the model's ability to distinguish between salient and camouflaged objects, we design an evaluation metric called CSCS. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance across all scenes in various metrics. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/ssecv/USCNet",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In large-scale scene reconstruction using 3D Gaussian splatting, it is common to partition the scene into multiple smaller regions and reconstruct them individually. However, existing division methods are occlusion-agnostic, meaning that each region may contain areas with severe occlusions. As a result, the cameras within those regions are less correlated, leading to a low average contribution to the overall reconstruction. In this paper, we propose an occlusion-aware scene division strategy that clusters training cameras based on their positions and co-visibilities to acquire multiple regions. Cameras in such regions exhibit stronger correlations and a higher average contribution, facilitating high-quality scene reconstruction. We further propose a region-based rendering technique to accelerate large scene rendering, which culls Gaussians invisible to the region where the viewpoint is located. Such a technique significantly speeds up the rendering without compromising quality. Extensive experiments on multiple large scenes show that our method achieves superior reconstruction results with faster rendering speeds compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches.

    "abstract": "Mathematical problems in real-world scenarios are often presented in a purely vision-form, where textual problem statement and accompanying math figures, e.g., geometry figures and functional graphs, are integrated into a single image. This vision-form problem-solving task requires precise comprehension and reasoning on both textual and graphical elements in the images, posing significant challenge to current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which process text and math figures in isolation. In this work, we propose VisionMath, the first exploration for vision-form mathematical problem-solving model, which employs a three-stage progressive multimodal reasoning alignment strategy to systematically enhance task-specific capabilities. Building upon a LLM proficient in unimodal mathematical reasoning, VisionMath first establishes foundational OCR capabilities through capturing rendered mathematical problem images. Subsequently, the model develops comprehensive understanding of figure structures and properties via learning from figure descriptions and mathematical educational videos. Finally, the model's reasoning capacity is activated using carefully constructed visual-form problem-solving datasets VisionMath-IT with chain-of-thought annotations.

With the rapid advancement of RGB-D sensors, unsupervised point cloud registration methods based on RGB-D sequences have demonstrated excellent performance. However, existing methods struggle in scenes with low overlap and photometric inconsistency. Low overlap results in numerous correspondence outliers, while photometric inconsistency hinders the model's ability to extract discriminative features. To address these challenges, we first propose the Overlapping Constraint for Inliers Detection (OCID) module, which filters and optimizes the initial correspondence set using an overlappping constraint. This module robustly selects reliable correspondences within the overlapping region while maintaining a balance between accuracy and efficiency. Additionally, we introduce a novel scene representation, 3DGS, which integrates both geometric and texture information, making it particularly well-suited for RGB-D registration tasks. Building on this, we propose the Gaussian Rendering for Photometric Adaptation (GRPA) module, which refines the geometric transformation and enhances the model's adaptability to scenes with inconsistent photometric information.

To address these limitations, we propose CWNet (Causal Wavelet Network), a novel architecture that leverages wavelet transforms for causal reasoning. Specifically, our approach comprises two key components: 1) Inspired by the concept of intervention in causality, we adopt a causal reasoning perspective to reveal the underlying causal relationships in low-light enhancement. From a global perspective, we employ a metric learning strategy to ensure causal embeddings adhere to causal principles, separating them from non-causal confounding factors while focusing on the invariance of causal factors. At the local level, we introduce an instance-level CLIP semantic loss to precisely maintain causal factor consistency. 2) Based on our causal analysis, we present a wavelet transform-based backbone network that effectively optimizes the recovery of frequency information, ensuring precise enhancement tailored to the specific attributes of wavelet transforms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CWNet significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets, showcasing its robust performance across diverse scenes.

The red-teaming VLM analyzes prompt-image pairs based on evaluation results, provides feedback and modification strategies to enhance adversarial effectiveness while preserving safety constraints, and iteratively improves prompts.

OpenAI's recent model, O1, showcased impressive capabilities in solving complex problems by utilizing extensive reasoning chains. This prompts an important question: can robot models achieve better performance in multi-task, complex environments by reviewing prior observations and then providing task-specific reasoning to guide action prediction?In this paper, we introduce Chain-of-Affordance (CoA-VLA), a novel approach to scaling robot models by incorporating reasoning in the format of sequential robot affordances to facilitate task completion. Specifically, we prompt the model to consider the following four types of affordances before taking action: (1) object affordance-- what object to manipulate and where it is; (2) grasp affordance -- the specific object part to grasp; (3) spatial affordance -- the optimal space to place the object; and (4) movement affordance-- the collision-free path for movement. We further transform each affordance into two prompting formats: visual affordance and textual affordance. We introduce a novel vision-language co-injection module that integrates this knowledge into the policy network. This allows the robot to leverage essential contextual information during action inference, resulting in improved precision and robustness. Our experiments demonstrate that CoA-VLA outperforms state-of-the-art robot foundation models, including OpenVLA and Octo, on a variety of tasks.

A significant limitation of these methods is their slow sampling speed when using VDMs. In this paper, we present FVGen, a novel framework that addresses this challenge by enabling fast novel view synthesis using VDMs in as few as 4 sampling steps.

    "abstract": "Open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding is indispensable for embodied agents. Recent works leverage pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) for object segmentation and project them to point clouds to build 3D maps. Despite progress, a point cloud is a set of unordered coordinates that requires substantial storage space and can not directly convey occupancy information or spatial relation, making existing methods inefficient for downstream tasks, e.g., path planning and complex text-based object retrieval. To address these issues, we propose Octree-Graph, a novel scene representation for open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding. Specifically, a Chronological Group-wise Segment Merging (CGSM) strategy and an Instance Feature Aggregation (IFA) algorithm are first designed to get 3D instances and corresponding semantic features. Subsequently, an adaptive-octree structure is developed that stores semantics and depicts the occupancy of an object adjustably according to its shape. Finally, the Octree-Graph is constructed where each adaptive-octree acts as a graph node, and edges describe the spatial relations among nodes. Extensive experiments on various tasks are conducted on several widely-used datasets, demonstrating the versatility and effectiveness of our method.

FlexGen tackles the challenges of controllable multi-view synthesis through additional conditioning on 3D-aware text annotations. We utilize the strong reasoning capabilities of GPT-4V to generate 3D-aware text annotations. By analyzing four orthogonal views of an object arranged as tiled multi-view images, GPT-4V can produce text annotations that include 3D-aware information with spatial relationship. By integrating the control signal with proposed adaptive dual-control module, our model can generate multi-view images that correspond to the specified text. FlexGen supports multiple controllable capabilities, allowing users to modify text prompts to generate reasonable and corresponding unseen parts. Additionally, users can influence attributes such as appearance and material properties, including metallic and roughness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach offers enhanced multiple controllability, marking a significant advancement over existing multi-view diffusion models.

Adopting diffusion models for the first time in video summarization, our proposed method, SummDiff, dynamically adapts to visual contexts and generates multiple candidate summaries conditioned on the input video. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SummDiff not only achieves the state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks but also produces summaries that closely align with individual annotator preferences.

While closely related to diffusion models, it provides a more general perspective on generative modeling.Although inverse problem solving has been extensively explored using diffusion models, it has not been rigorously examined within the broader context of flow models. Therefore, here we extend the diffusion inverse solvers (DIS)-- which perform posterior sampling by combining a denoising diffusion prior with an likelihood gradient--into the flow framework. Specifically, by driving the flow-version of Tweedie's formula, we decompose the flow ODE into two components: one for clean image estimation and the other for noise estimation.By integrating the likelihood gradient and stochastic noise into each component, respectively, we demonstrate that posterior sampling for inverse problem solving can be effectively achieved using flows. Our proposed solver, Flow-Driven Posterior Sampling (FlowDPS), can also be seamlessly integrated into a latent flow model with a transformer architecture.

However, the task is challenging due to limited visibility of body parts in first-person views and the sparseness of sensory data, with only a single device placed on the head. To address these challenges, we introduce Head2Body, a novel framework for body pose estimation that effectively combines IMU and visual data. First, we introduce a pre-trained IMU encoder, trained on over 1,700 hours of head-IMU data from wearable eyeglasses, to better capture detailed temporal motion cues given limited labeled egocentric pose data. For visual processing, we leverage large vision-language models (LVLMs) to segment body parts that appear sporadically in video frames to improve visual feature extraction. To better guide the pose generation process with sparse signals from only head-mounted devices, we incorporates a Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to represent poses as discrete tokens, which capture high-frequency motion patterns and provide a more structured representation of body pose. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, yielding 6-13% gains over state-of-the-art baselines on four datasets: AMASS, KinPoly, GIMO, and EgoExo4D.

Instead, this study introduces LoopTrans, a novel closed-loop framework that not only transfers knowledge from exocentric to egocentric but also transfers back to enhance exocentric knowledge extraction. Within LoopTrans, several innovative mechanisms are introduced, including unified cross-modal localization and denoising knowledge distillation, to bridge domain gaps between object-centered egocentric and interaction-centered exocentric images while enhancing knowledge transfer.

However, as LLMs grow in size, the memory demands for backpropagation become increasingly prohibitive. Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization methods offer a memory-efficient alternative by using forward passes to estimate gradients, but the variance of gradient estimates typically scales linearly with the model's parameter dimension--a significant issue for LLMs. In this paper, we propose the random Subspace Zeroth-order (SubZero) optimization to address the challenges posed by LLMs' high dimensionality. We introduce a low-rank perturbation tailored for LLMs that significantly reduces memory consumption while improving performance. Additionally, we prove that our gradient estimation closely approximates the backpropagation gradient, exhibits lower variance than traditional ZO methods, and ensures convergence when combined with SGD. Experimental results show that SubZero enhances fine-tuning performance and achieves faster convergence compared to standard ZO approaches like MeZO across various language modeling tasks.

Despite progress in same-domain composition, cross-domain composition remains under-explored. The main challenges are the stochastic nature of diffusion models and the style gap between input images, leading to failures and artifacts. Additionally, heavy reliance on text prompts limits practical applications. This paper presents the first cross-domain image composition method that does not require text prompts, allowing natural stylization and seamless compositions. Our method is efficient and robust, preserving the diffusion prior, as it involves minor steps for backward inversion and forward denoising without training the diffuser. Our method also uses a simple multilayer perceptron network to integrate CLIP features from foreground and background, manipulating diffusion with a local cross-attention strategy. It effectively preserves foreground content while enabling stable stylization without a pre-stylization network. Finally, we create a benchmark dataset with diverse contents and styles for fair evaluation, addressing the lack of testing datasets for cross-domain image composition. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, significantly improving the LPIPS score by 30.5% and the CSD metric by 18.1%.

Conventional deep learning methods assume perfect pixel-wise alignment and rely on per-pixel reconstruction losses, leading to spectral distortion, double edges, and blurring when misalignment is present. To address this, we propose PAN-Crafter, a modality-consistent alignment framework that explicitly mitigates the misalignment gap between PAN and MS modalities. At its core, Modality-Adaptive Reconstruction (MARs) enables a single network to jointly reconstruct HRMS and PAN images, leveraging PAN's high-frequency details as auxiliary self-supervision. Additionally, we introduce Cross-Modality Alignment-Aware Attention (CM3A), a novel mechanism that bidirectionally aligns MS texture to PAN structure and vice versa, enabling adaptive feature refinement across modalities. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our PAN-Crafter outperforms the most recent state-of-the-art method in all metrics, even with 50.11xfaster inference time and 0.63xthe memory size.

As most datasets have been seen by the CLIP model, the resultant setting can be termed as partially transductive. To solve this, we propose a pipeline that uses an unlearning technique to obtain true inductive baselines. In this new inductive setting, methods show a significant drop in performance (-55% on average among 13 baselines with multiple datasets). We validate the unlearning technique using oracle baselines. An improved few-shot classification technique is proposed that consistently obtains state-of-the-art performance over 13 other recent baseline methods on a comprehensive analysis with 5880 experiments - varying the datasets, differing number of few-shot examples, unlearning setting, and with different seeds.

Specifically, 1) the embeddings derived from commonly used foundation models exhibit discrepancies with the optimal embeddings required for feature matching; 2) lacking an effective mechanism to leverage the single-image understanding ability into cross-image understanding. A significant consequence of the misalignment is they struggle when addressing multi-instance feature matching problems. To address this, we introduce a simple but effective framework, called IMD (Image feature Matching with a pre-trained Diffusion model) with two parts: 1) Unlike the dominant solutions employing contrastive-learning based foundation models that emphasize global semantics, we integrate the generative-based diffusion models to effectively capture instance-level details. 2) We leverage the prompt mechanism in generative model as a natural tunnel, propose a novel cross-image interaction prompting module to facilitate bidirectional information interaction between image pairs. To more accurately measure the misalignment, we propose a new benchmark called IMIM, which focuses on multi-instance scenarios. Our proposed IMD establishes a new state-of-the-art in commonly evaluated benchmarks, and the superior improvement 12% in IMIM indicates our method efficiently mitigates the misalignment",

    "abstract": "Anticipating and recognizing surgical workflows are critical for intelligent surgical assistance systems. However, existing methods rely on deterministic decision-making, struggling to generalize across the large anatomical and procedural variations inherent in real-world surgeries. In this paper, we introduce an innovative framework that incorporates stochastic modeling through a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) into conventional deterministic learning for surgical workflow analysis. At the heart of our approach is a collaborative co-training paradigm: the DDPM branch captures procedural uncertainties to enrich feature representations, while the task branch focuses on predicting surgical phases and instrument usage. Theoretically, we demonstrate that this mutual refinement mechanism benefits both branches: the DDPM reduces prediction errors in uncertain scenarios, and the task branch directs the DDPM toward clinically meaningful representations. Notably, the DDPM branch is discarded during inference, enabling real-time predictions without sacrificing accuracy. Experiments on the Cholec80 dataset show that for the anticipation task, our method achieves a 16% reduction in eMAE compared to state-of-the-art approaches, and for phase recognition, it improves the Jaccard score by 1.0%. Additionally, on the AutoLaparo dataset, our method achieves a 1.5% improvement in the Jaccard score for phase recognition, while also exhibiting robust generalization to patient-specific variations.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a novel benchmark, GSOT3D, that aims at facilitating development of generic 3D single object tracking (SOT) in the wild. Specifically, GSOT3D offers 620 sequences with 123K frames, and covers a wide selection of 54 object categories. Each sequence is offered with multiple modalities, including the point cloud (PC), RGB image, and depth. This allows GSOT3D to support various 3D tracking tasks, such as single-modal 3D SOT on PC and multi-modal 3D SOT on RGB-PC or RGB-D, and thus greatly broadens research directions for 3D object tracking. To provide high-quality per-frame 3D annotations, all sequences are labeled manually with multiple rounds of meticulous inspection and refinement. To our best knowledge, GSOT3D is the largest benchmark dedicated to various generic 3D object tracking tasks. To understand how existing 3D trackers perform and to provide comparisons for future research on GSOT3D, we assess eight representative point cloud-based tracking models. Our evaluation results exhibit that these models heavily degrade on GSOT3D, and more efforts are required for robust and generic 3D object tracking. Besides, to encourage future research, we present a simple yet effective generic 3D tracker, named PROT3D, that localizes the target object via a progressive spatial-temporal network and outperforms all current solutions by a large margin. By releasing GSOT3D, we expect to advance further 3D tracking in future research and applications.

UnZipLoRA ensures that the resulting LoRAs are compatible, i.e., they can be seamlessly combined using direct addition. UnZipLoRA enables independent manipulation and recontextualization of subject and style, including generating variations of each, applying the extracted style to new subjects, and recombining them to reconstruct the original image or create novel variations. To address the challenge of subject and style entanglement, UnZipLoRA employs a novel prompt separation technique, as well as column and block separation strategies to accurately preserve the characteristics of subject and style, and ensure compatibility between the learned LoRAs.

However, sensor synchronization challenges often compromise data availability, particularly in video settings where shortages can be temporal. Despite its importance, this area remains underexplored. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study on tracker performance with temporally incomplete multimodal data. Unsurprisingly, under such a circumstance, existing trackers exhibit significant performance degradation, as their rigid architectures lack the adaptability needed to effectively handle missing modalities.To address these limitations, we propose a flexible framework for robust multimodal tracking. We venture that a tracker should dynamically activate computational units based on missing data rates. This is achieved through a novel Heterogeneous Mixture-of-Experts fusion mechanism with adaptive complexity, coupled with a video-level masking strategy that ensures both temporal consistency and spatial completeness -- critical for effective video tracking. Surprisingly, our model not only adapts to varying missing rates but also adjusts to scene complexity. Extensive experiments show that our model achieves SOTA performance across 9 benchmarks, excelling in both conventional complete and missing modality settings.

    "abstract": "Large vision-language models such as CLIP have made significant strides in zero-shot anomaly detection through prompt engineering. However, most existing methods typically process each test image individually, ignoring the practical rarity of abnormal patches in real-world scenarios. Although some batch-based approaches exploit the rarity by processing multiple samples concurrently, they generally introduce unacceptable latency for real-time applications. To mitigate these limitations, we propose RareCLIP, a novel online zero-shot anomaly detection framework that enables sequential image processing in real-time without requiring prior knowledge of the target domain. RareCLIP capitalizes on the zero-shot capabilities of CLIP and integrates a dynamic test-time rarity estimation mechanism. A key innovation of our framework is the introduction of a prototype patch feature memory bank, which aggregates representative features from historical observations and continuously updates their corresponding rarity measures. For each incoming image patch, RareCLIP computes a rarity score by aggregating the rarity measures of its nearest neighbors within the memory bank. Moreover, we introduce a prototype sampling strategy based on dissimilarity to enhance computational efficiency, as well as a similarity calibration strategy to enhance the robustness of rarity estimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RareCLIP attains state-of-the-art performance with 98.2% image-level AUROC on MVTec AD and 94.4% on VisA, while achieving a latency of 59.4 ms.

However, fine-tuning VFM to parse various adverse scenes (e.g., fog, snow, night) is particularly challenging, as these samples are difficult to collect. Using easy-to-acquire clear scenes as the source domain is a feasible solution, but a huge domain gap exists between clear and adverse scenes due to their dramatically different appearances. To address this challenge, this paper proposes AdaDCP, a VFM adapter with discrete cosine prior. The innovation originates from the observation that, the frequency components from a VFM exhibit either variant or invariant properties on adverse weather conditions after discrete cosine transform. Technically, the weather-invariant property learning preceives most of the scene content that is invariant to the adverse condition. The weather-variant property learning, in contrast, perceives the weather-specific information from different types of adverse conditions. Finally, the weather-invariant property alignment implicitly enforces the weather-variant components to incorporate the weather-invariant information, therefore mitigating the clear-to-adverse domain gap.

The pipeline consists of (i) a content-aware offset estimator that leverages content information for lightweight correlation volume encoding and decoding; (ii) a locally consistent match rectifier robust to large global initial errors; (iii) a locally consistent upsampler that yields fewer artifacts around depth-discontinuous edges.

Attention mechanisms in modern restoration transformers undermine this property, adversely impacting both training convergence and generalization. To alleviate this issue, we propose two key strategies for incorporating translation equivariance: slide indexing and component stacking. Slide indexing maintains operator responses at fixed positions, with sliding window attention being a notable example, while component stacking enables the arrangement of translation-equivariant operators in parallel or sequentially, thereby building complex architectures while preserving translation equivariance. However, these strategies still create a dilemma in model design between the high computational cost of self-attention and the fixed receptive field associated with sliding window attention. To address this, we develop an adaptive sliding indexing mechanism to efficiently select key-value pairs for each query, which are then concatenated in parallel with globally aggregated key-value pairs.

Training models for this purpose requires large amounts of labeled image data with precise pose and shape annotations. However, capturing such data requires the use of multi-view or marker-based motion-capture systems, which are impractical to adapt to wild animals in situ and impossible to scale across a comprehensive set of animal species. Some have attempted to address the challenge of procuring training data by pseudo-labeling individual real-world images through manual 2D annotation, followed by 3D-parameter optimization to those labels. While this approach may produce silhouette-aligned samples, the obtained pose and shape parameters are often implausible due to the ill-posed nature of the monocular fitting problem. Sidestepping real-world ambiguity, others have designed complex synthetic-data-generation pipelines leveraging game engines and collections of artist-designed 3D assets. Such engines yield perfect ground-truth labels but are often lacking in visual realism and require considerable manual effort to adapt to new species or environments.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) possess encompassing capabilities that can process diverse language-related tasks. However, finetuning on LLMs will diminish this general skills and continual finetuning will further cause severe degradation on accumulated knowledge. Recently, Continual Learning (CL) in Large Language Models (LLMs) arises which aims to continually adapt the LLMs to new tasks while maintaining previously learned knowledge and inheriting general skills. Existing techniques either leverage previous data to replay, leading to extra computational costs, or utilize a single parameter-efficient module to learn the downstream task, constraining new knowledge absorption with interference between different tasks. Toward these issues, this paper proposes Analytic Subspace Routing(Any-SSR) to address these challenges. For each task, we isolate the learning within a subspace of deep layers' features via low-rank adaptation, eliminating knowledge interference between different tasks. Additionally, we propose an analytic routing mechanism to properly utilize knowledge learned in different subspaces. Our approach employs Recursive Least Squares to train a multi-task router model, allowing the router to dynamically adapt to incoming data without requiring access to historical data. Also, the router effectively assigns the current task to an appropriate subspace and has a non-forgetting property of previously learned tasks with a solid theoretical guarantee.

With the RapVerse dataset, we investigate the extent to which scaling autoregressive multimodal transformers across language, audio, and motion can enhance the coherent and realistic generation of vocals and whole-body human motions. For modality unification, a vector-quantized variational autoencoder is employed to encode whole-body motion sequences into discrete motion tokens, while a vocal-to-unit model is leveraged to obtain quantized audio tokens preserving content, prosodic information and singer identity. By jointly performing transformer modeling on these three modalities in a unified way, our framework ensures a seamless and realistic blend of vocals and human motions.

While existing methods focus on detecting face retouching, how to accurately recover the original faces from the retouched ones has yet to be answered. This paper introduces Face Retouching Restoration (FRR), a novel computer vision task aimed at restoring original faces from their retouched counterparts. FRR differs from traditional image restoration tasks by addressing the complex retouching operations with various types and degrees, which focuses more on the restoration of the low-frequency information of the faces. To tackle this challenge, we propose MoFRR, Mixture of Diffusion Models for FRR. Inspired by DeepSeek's expert isolation strategy, the MoFRR uses sparse activation of specialized experts handling distinct retouching types and the engagement of a shared expert dealing with universal retouching traces. Each specialized expert follows a dual-branch structure with a DDIM-based low-frequency branch guided by an Iterative Distortion Evaluation Module (IDEM) and a Cross-Attention-based High-Frequency branch (HFCAM) for detail refinement. Extensive experiments on a newly constructed face retouching dataset, RetouchingFFHQ++, demonstrate the effectiveness of MoFRR for FRR",

    "abstract": "Source-free object detection adapts a detector pre-trained on a source domain to an unlabeled target domain without requiring access to labeled source data. While this setting is practical as it eliminates the need for the source dataset during domain adaptation, it operates under the restrictive assumption that only pre-defined objects from the source domain exist in the target domain. This closed-set setting prevents the detector from detecting undefined objects. To ease this assumption, we propose Source-Free Unknown Object Detection (SFUOD), a novel scenario which enables the detector to not only recognize known objects but also detect undefined objects as unknown objects. To this end, we propose CollaPAUL (Collaborative tuning and Principal Axis-based Unknown Labeling), a novel framework for SFUOD. Collaborative tuning enhances knowledge adaptation by integrating target-dependent knowledge from the auxiliary encoder with source-dependent knowledge from the pre-trained detector through a cross-domain attention mechanism. Additionally, principal axis-based unknown labeling assigns pseudo-labels to unknown objects by estimating objectness via principal axes projection and confidence scores from model predictions. The proposed CollaPAUL achieves state-of-the-art performances on SFUOD benchmarks, and extensive experiments validate its effectiveness. The code will be released after the review",

    "abstract": "Egocentric human motion generation and forecasting with scene-context is crucial for enhancing AR/VR experiences, improving human-robot interaction, advancing assistive technologies, and enabling adaptive healthcare solutions by accurately predicting and simulating movement from a first-person perspective. However, existing methods primarily focus on third-person motion synthesis with structured 3D scene contexts, limiting their effectiveness in real-world egocentric settings where limited field of view, frequent occlusions, and dynamic cameras hinder scene perception. To bridge this gap, we introduce Egocentric Motion Generation and Egocentric Motion Forecasting, two novel tasks that utilize first-person images for scene-aware motion synthesis without relying on explicit 3D scene. We propose UniEgoMotion, a unified conditional motion diffusion model with a novel head-centric motion representation tailored for egocentric devices. UniEgoMotion's simple yet effective design supports egocentric motion reconstruction, forecasting, and generation from first-person visual inputs in a unified framework. Unlike previous works that overlook scene semantics, our model effectively extracts image-based scene context to infer plausible 3D motion. To facilitate training, we introduce EE4D-Motion, a large-scale dataset derived from EgoExo4D, augmented with pseudo-ground-truth 3D motion annotations. UniEgoMotion achieves state-of-the-art performance in egocentric motion reconstruction and is the first to generate motion from a single egocentric image. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our unified framework, setting a new benchmark for egocentric motion modeling and unlocking new possibilities for egocentric applications",

Deep learning for stereo matching has been demonstrated to improve performance for stereo rectified depth estimation but these methods require straightforward left-right camera setups.

This paper introduces a novel and principled spherical epipolar rectification model, which handles all camera motions. This rectification model is differentiable and allows self-supervised deep stereo matching algorithms to compute disparity and recover depth, given known camera pose.

Our framework introduces three core innovations that work in concert:1) Adaptive Edge-Texture Perceptor (AETP), which creates an edge prediction behaviour where edge and texture information are mutually reinforcing based on the multi-scale features of the image integrated with the global semantic context of the Transformer;2) Dual-Stream Feature Augmentor (DSFA), which dynamically adjusts the kernel sampling position according to the local texture complexity and edge orientation, thus accurately enhancing the feature information at fractal boundaries and amorphous texture locations;3) Multi-Feature Modulation Module (MFMM), which establishes incremental fine-grained improvements for feature calibration and model prediction through enhanced characterisation of edge perception and hierarchical integration of multiple textures.

To produce natural stitched images, we first determine the middle plane through homography decomposition and globally project the original images toward the desired plane. Compared with unidirectional homography transformation, it evenly spreads projective distortion across two views and decreases the proportion of invalid pixels. Then, the bidirectional optical flow fields are established to carry out residual pixel-wise deformation with projection-weighted natural coefficients, encouraging pixel motions to be as unnoticeable as possible in non-overlapping regions while smoothly transitioning into overlapping areas. Crucially, this flexible deformation enables PixelStitch to align large-parallax images and preserve the structural integrity of non-overlapping contents. To obtain high-quality stitched images in the absence of labels, a comprehensive unsupervised objective function is proposed to simultaneously encourage content alignment, structure preservation, and bidirectional consistency.

Our hybrid distillation strategy combines sCM with latent adversarial distillation (LADD): sCM ensures alignment with the teacher model, while LADD enhances single-step generation fidelity.

Conventional network binarization approaches, which directly quantize both weights and activations in change detection models, severely limit the network's ability to represent input data and distinguish between changed and unchanged regions. This results in significantly lower detection accuracy compared to real-valued networks. To overcome these challenges, BiCD enhances both the representational power and feature separability of BNNs, improving detection performance. Specifically, we introduce an auxiliary objective based on the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle, guiding the encoder to retain essential input information while promoting better feature discrimination. Since directly computing mutual information under the IB principle is intractable, we design a compact, learnable auxiliary module as an approximation target, leading to a simple yet effective optimization strategy that minimizes both reconstruction loss and standard change detection loss.Extensive experiments on street-view and remote sensing datasets demonstrate that BiCD establishes a new benchmark for BNN-based change detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance in this domain",

Protecting these datasets is of paramount importance for the interests of their owners. The verification of dataset ownership has evolved into a crucial approach in this domain; however, existing verification techniques are predominantly tailored to supervised models and contrastive pre-trained models, rendering them ill-suited for direct application to the increasingly prevalent masked models. In this work, we introduce the inaugural methodology addressing this critical, yet unresolved challenge, termed Dataset Ownership Verification for Masked Modeling (DOV4MM). The central objective is to ascertain whether a suspicious black-box model has been pre-trained on a particular unlabeled dataset, thereby assisting dataset owners in safeguarding their rights. DOV4MM is grounded in our empirical observation that when a model is pre-trained on the target dataset, the difficulty of reconstructing masked information within the embedding space exhibits a marked contrast to models not pre-trained on that dataset. We validated the efficacy of DOV4MM through ten masked image models on ImageNet-1K and four masked language models on WikiText-103. The results demonstrate that DOV4MM rejects the null hypothesis, with a p-value considerably below 0.05, surpassing all prior approaches. Code is available at https://github.com/xieyc99/DOV4MM",

However, when confronted with intricate and ambiguous traffic scenarios, the lack of logical reasoning and cognitive decision-making capabilities remains the primary challenge impeding the realization of embodied autonomous driving. Although Vision Language Models (VLMs) have enhanced the deep semantic understanding of autonomous driving systems, they exhibit notable limitations in decision explainability when handling rare and long-tail traffic scenarios. In this paper, we propose VLR-Driver, a novel multi-modal Vision-Language-Reasoning (VLR) framework based on Chain of Thought (CoT) for embodied autonomous driving. The framework employs a spatiotemporal CoT reasoning approach to recursively analyze potential safety risks and driving intentions of other agents, thereby delivering an efficient and transparent decision-making process. Furthermore, we construct a multi-modal reasoning-decision dataset to support the advancement of hierarchical reasoning of VLMs in autonomous driving. Closed-loop experiments conducted in CARLA demonstrate that the VLR-Driver significantly outperforms state-of-the-art end-to-end methods.

    "abstract": "Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has prevailed in novel view synthesis, achieving high fidelity and efficiency. However, it often struggles to capture rich details and complete geometry. Our analysis reveals that the 3D-GS densification operation lacks adaptiveness and faces a dilemma between geometry coverage and detail recovery. To address this, we introduce a novel densification operation, residual split, which adds a downscaled Gaussian as a residual. Our approach is capable of adaptively retrieving details and complementing missing geometry. To further support this method, we propose a pipeline named ResGS. Specifically, we integrate a Gaussian image pyramid for progressive supervision and implement a selection scheme that prioritizes the densification of coarse Gaussians over time. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves SOTA rendering quality. Consistent performance improvements can be achieved by applying our residual split on various 3D-GS variants, underscoring its versatility and potential for broader application in 3D-GS-based applications",

To alleviate the inaccurate supervision, we propose a semantic transitive labeling pipeline to generate dense and fine-grained 3D language occupancy ground truth. Our pipeline presents a feasible way to dig into the valuable semantic information of images, transferring text labels from images to LiDAR point clouds and ultimately to voxels, to establish precise voxel-to-text correspondences. By replacing the original prediction head of supervised occupancy models with a geometry head for binary occupancy states and a language head for language features, LOcc effectively uses the generated language ground truth to guide the learning of 3D language volume. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our transitive semantic labeling pipeline can produce more accurate pseudo-labeled ground truth, diminishing labor-intensive human annotations. Additionally, we validate LOcc across various architectures, where all models consistently outperform state-of-the-art zero-shot occupancy prediction approaches on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset",

As state-of-the-art methods rely on a pre-defined set of classes, they struggle with novel categories and out-of-distribution (OOD) data.

We address the gap between outstanding benchmark performance and reliability by proposing Prior2Former (P2F), the first approach for segmentation vision transformers rooted in evidential learning. P2F extends the mask vision transformer architecture by incorporating a Beta prior for computing model uncertainty in pixel-wise binary mask assignments. This design enables high-quality uncertainty estimation that effectively detects novel and OOD objects, enabling state-of-the-art anomaly instance segmentation and open-world panoptic segmentation. Unlike most segmentation models addressing unknown classes, P2F operates without access to OOD data samples or contrastive training on void (i.e., unlabeled) classes, making it highly applicable in real-world scenarios where such prior information is unavailable. Additionally, P2F can be flexibly applied to anomaly instance and panoptic segmentation. Through comprehensive experiments on the Cityscapes, COCO, SegmentMeIfYouCan, and OoDIS datasets, P2F demonstrates state-of-the-art performance. Especially in OoDIS, P2F ranks first in its category",

Traditional frame-based cameras struggle to detect small objects in complex environments due to their low frame rates, limited dynamic range, and data redundancy. Event cameras, with microsecond temporal resolution and high dynamic range, provide a more effective solution for SOD. However, existing event-based object detection datasets are limited in scale, feature large targets size, and lack diverse backgrounds, making them unsuitable for SOD benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce a Event-based Small object detection (EVSOD) dataset (namely EV-UAV), the first large-scale, highly diverse benchmark for anti-UAV tasks. It includes 147 sequences with over 2.3 million event-level annotations, featuring extremely small targets (averaging 6.8 x 5.4 pixels) and diverse scenarios such as urban clutter and extreme lighting conditions. Furthermore, based on the observation that small moving targets form continuous curves in spatiotemporal event point clouds, we propose Event based Sparse Segmentation Network (EV-SpSegNet), a novel baseline for event segmentation in point cloud space, along with a Spatiotemporal Correlation (STC) loss that leverages motion continuity to guide the network in retaining target events.

    "abstract": "The design of artificial neural networks (ANNs) is inspired by the structure of the human brain, and in turn, ANNs offer a potential means to interpret and understand brain signals. Existing methods primarily align brain signals with stimulus signals using Mean Squared Error (MSE), which focuses only on local point-wise alignment and ignores global matching, leading to coarse interpretations and inaccuracies in brain signal decoding. In this paper, we address these issues through optimal transport (OT) and theoretically demonstrate why OT provides a more effective alignment strategy than MSE. Specifically, we construct a transport plan between brain voxel embeddings and image embeddings, enabling more precise matching. By controlling the amount of transport, we mitigate the influence of redundant information. We apply our alignment model directly to the Brain Captioning task by feeding brain signals into a large language model (LLM) instead of images. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across ten evaluation metrics, surpassing the previous best method by an average of 6.11% in singlesubject training and 3.81% in cross-subject training. Additionally, we have uncovered several insightful conclusions that align with existing brain research. We unveil the redundancy and synergy of brain information processing through region masking and data dimensionality reduction visualization experiments. We believe our approach paves the way for a more precise understanding of brain signals in the future. The code is available at https://github.com/NKUShaw/OT-Alignment4brain-to-image",

This characteristic makes ES well-suited to open-world applications with adaptation to diverse and dynamically changing environments, where new and previously unseen entities may appear frequently. Existing ES methods either require large annotated datasets or high training costs, limiting their scalability and adaptability. Recently, the Segment Anything Model (SAM), especially in its Automatic Mask Generation (AMG) mode, has shown potential for holistic image segmentation. However, it struggles with over-segmentation and under-segmentation, making it less effective for ES. In this paper, we introduce E-SAM, a novel training-free framework that exhibits exceptional ES capability. Specifically, we first propose Multi-level Mask Generation (MMG) that hierarchically processes SAM's AMG outputs to generate reliable object-level masks while preserving fine details at other levels. Entity-level Mask Refinement (EMR) then refines these object-level masks into accurate entity-level masks. That is, it separates overlapping masks to address the redundancy issues inherent in SAM's outputs and merges similar masks by evaluating entity-level consistency. Lastly, Under-Segmentation Refinement (USR) addresses under-segmentation by generating additional high-confidence masks fused with EMR outputs to produce the final ES map. These three modules are seamlessly optimized to achieve the best ES without additional training overhead.

First, the Simple Relation Decoupling (SRD) module restructures complex multi-anchor queries into a set of targeted single-anchor statements, generating a structured set of perspective-aware descriptions that clarify positional relationships. These decomposed representations serve as the foundation for the Multi-view Textual-Scene Interaction (Multi-TSI) module, which integrates textual and scene features across multiple viewpoints using shared, Cross-modal Consistent View Tokens (CCVTs) to preserve spatial correlations. Finally, a Textual-Scene Reasoning module synthesizes multi-view predictions into a unified and robust 3D visual grounding.Experiments on 3D visual grounding datasets show that ViewSRD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in complex queries requiring precise spatial differentiation.Code is available at https://github.com/visualjason/ViewSRD",

Furthermore, considering the diverse factors influencing each degradation type, factor-level prototypes are incorporated to capture variations in individual degradation factors. Image features are matched with both degradation-level and factor-level prototypes, producing detailed scene embeddings that enhance the network's understanding of composite degradations. These scene embeddings are then processed through Dual Scene Embedding Transformer Blocks to guide the restoration process. To further refine the prototype distribution, we propose a Prototype Scatter Learning Loss, which enables prototypes within the same degradation to learn more information and push prototypes between different degradations to be separate.

To avoid the spread of misinformation and identify synthetic content, research on synthetic image detection becomes urgent. Unfortunately, limited to the singular forensic perspective, existing methods struggle to explore sufficient traces encountered with diverse synthetic techniques. In response to this, we argue that different synthetic images encompass a variety of forensic traces, and utilizing multiple experts to explore traces from diverse perspectives will be beneficial. Accordingly, a novel detector with the Mixture of multiple forensic Experts is proposed, named Forensic-MoE. To integrate multiple experts and enhance the knowledge interaction, Forensic-MoE follows an adapter-backbone architecture. Specifically, multiple adapters trained on different synthetic images serve as the trace exploration experts, and they are uniformly integrated into a pretrained backbone model to learn the detection prior and encourage the expert interaction. By guiding multiple experts to align with each other and collaborate, Forensic-MoE can integrate comprehensive and discriminative detection traces from multiple perspectives. Moreover, for the discrimination improvement of each expert, a multi-stage structure is proposed for efficient trace perception, and a patch decentralization strategy is applied to encourage the model's attention on every local region.

    "abstract": "Adverse weather conditions cause diverse and complex degradation patterns, driving the development of All-in-One (AiO) models. However, recent AiO solutions still struggle to capture diverse degradations, since global filtering methods like direct operations on the frequency domain fail to handle highly variable and localized distortions. To address these issue, we propose Spectral-based Spatial Grouping Transformer (SSGformer), a novel approach that leverages spectral decomposition and group-wise attention for multi-weather image restoration. SSGformer decomposes images into high-frequency edge features using conventional edge detection and low-frequency information via Singular Value Decomposition. We utilize multi-head linear attention to effectively model the relationship between these features. The fused features are integrated with the input to generate a grouping-mask that clusters regions based on the spatial similarity and image texture. To fully leverage this mask, we introduce a group-wise attention mechanism, enabling robust adverse weather removal and ensuring consistent performance across diverse weather conditions. We also propose a Spatial Grouping Transformer Block that uses both channel attention and spatial attention, effectively balancing feature-wise relationships and spatial dependencies. Extensive experiments show the superiority of our approach, validating its effectiveness in handling the varied and intricate adverse weather degradations",

The key challenge arises from depth variation induced spatio-temporal motion inconsistencies, disrupting the assumptions of local spatial or temporal motion smoothness in previous motion estimation frameworks. In contrast, event cameras offer new possibilities for 3D motion estimation through continuous adaptive pixel-level responses to scene changes. This paper presents EMoTive, a novel event-based framework that models spatio-temporal trajectories via event-guided non-uniform parametric curves, effectively characterizing locally heterogeneous spatio-temporal motion. Specifically, we first introduce Event Kymograph - an event projection method that leverages a continuous temporal projection kernel and decouples spatial observations to encode fine-grained temporal evolution explicitly. For motion representation, we introduce a density-aware adaptation mechanism to fuse spatial and temporal features under event guidance, coupled with a non-uniform rational curve parameterization framework to adaptively model heterogeneous trajectories. The final 3D motion estimation is achieved through multi-temporal sampling of parametric trajectories, yielding optical flow and depth motion fields.

The stereo consistency module ensures structural alignment across synthesized image pairs, preserving geometric integrity and enhancing depth estimation accuracy. Second, we design a robust feature encoder that combines a specialized ConvNet with a denoising transformer to extract stable and reliable features from degraded images. The ConvNet captures fine-grained local structures, while the denoising transformer refines global representations, effectively mitigating the impact of noise, low visibility, and weather-induced distortions.

    "abstract": "Human pose estimation is critical for applications such as rehabilitation, sports analytics, and AR/VR systems. However, rapid motion and low-light conditions often introduce motion blur, significantly degrading pose estimation due to the domain gap between sharp and blurred images. Most datasets assume stable conditions, making models trained on sharp images struggle in blurred environments. To address this, we introduce a novel domain adaptation approach that leverages event cameras, which capture high temporal resolution motion data and are inherently robust to motion blur. Using event-based augmentation, we generate motion-aware blurred images, effectively bridging the domain gap between sharp and blurred domains without requiring paired annotations. Additionally, we develop a student-teacher framework that iteratively refines pseudo-labels, leveraging mutual uncertainty masking to eliminate incorrect labels and enable more effective learning. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms conventional domain-adaptive human pose estimation methods, achieving robust pose estimation under motion blur without requiring annotations in the target domain.

In image classification, these models may rely on spurious correlations that often exist between labels and irrelevant features of images, making predictions unreliable when those features do not exist. We propose a Diffusion Driven Balancing (DDB) technique to generate training samples with text-to-image diffusion models for addressing the spurious correlation problem. First, we compute the best describing token for the visual features pertaining to the causal components of samples by a textual inversion mechanism. Then, leveraging a language segmentation method and a diffusion model, we generate new samples by combining the causal component with the elements from other classes. We also meticulously prune the generated samples based on the prediction probabilities and attribution scores of the ERM model to ensure their correct composition for our objective. Finally, we retrain the ERM model on our augmented dataset. This process reduces the model's reliance on spurious correlations by learning from carefully crafted samples in which this correlation does not exist.

    "abstract": "Training-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation has advanced with vision-language models like CLIP, which exhibit strong zero-shot abilities. However, CLIP's attention mechanism often wrongly emphasises specific image tokens, namely outliers, which results in irrelevant over-activation. Existing approaches struggle with these outliers that arise in intermediate layers and propagate through the model, ultimately degrading spatial perception. In this paper, we propose a Self-adaptive Feature Purifier framework (SFP) to suppress propagated outliers and enhance semantic representations for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. Specifically, based on an in-depth analysis of attention responses between image and class tokens, we design a self-adaptive outlier mitigator to detect and mitigate outliers at each layer for propagated feature purification. In addition, we introduce a semantic-aware attention enhancer to augment attention intensity in semantically relevant regions, which strengthens the purified feature to focus on objects. Further, we introduce a hierarchical attention integrator to aggregate multi-layer attention maps to refine spatially coherent feature representations for final segmentation. Our proposed SFP enables robust outlier suppression and object-centric feature representation, leading to a more precise segmentation.

Traditionally, the labels of classification and regression are represented by a single set of candidate boxes generated by motion or geometry heuristics. However, due to the similarity of many objects to the background in shape or lack of motion, the labels often fail to achieve high accuracy in two tasks simultaneously. Using these labels to directly train the network results in decreased detection performance. To address this challenge, we introduce Motal that performs unsupervised 3D object detection by Modality and task-specific knowledge transfer. Motal decouples the pseudo-labels into two sets of candidates, from which Motal discovers classification knowledge by motion and image appearance prior, and discovers box regression knowledge by geometry prior, respectively. Motal finally transfers all knowledge to a single student network by a TMT (Task-specific Masked Training) scheme, attaining high performance in both classification and regression. Motal can greatly enhance various unsupervised methods by about 2x mAP. For example, on the WOD test set, Motal improves the state-of-the-art CPD by 21.56% mAP L1 (from 20.54% to 42.10%) and 19.90% mAP L2 (from 18.18% to 38.08%).

Furthermore, we introduce principled modifications to the original DiT architecture to better suit the fusion task.

    "abstract": "Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) has emerged as a strong base model in various pinhole imaging segmentation tasks. However, when applying it to 360^\\circ domain, the significant field-of-view (FoV) gap between pinhole (70^\\circ x70^\\circ) and panoramic images (180^\\circ x360^\\circ) poses unique challenges. Two major concerns for this application includes 1) inevitable distortion and object deformation brought by the large FoV disparity between domains; 2) the lack of pixel-level semantic understanding that the original SAM2 cannot provide. To address these issues, we propose a novel OmniSAM framework, which makes the first attempt to apply SAM2 for panoramic semantic segmentation. Specifically, to bridge the first gap, OmniSAM first divides the panorama into sequences of patches. These patches are then treated as image sequences in similar manners as in video segmentation tasks. We then leverage the SAM2's memory mechanism to extract cross-patch correspondences that embeds the cross-FoV dependencies, improving feature continuity and the prediction consistency along mask boundaries. For the second gap, OmniSAM fine-tunes the pretrained image encoder and reutilize the mask decoder for semantic prediction. An FoV-based prototypical adaptation module with dynamic pseudo label update mechanism is also introduced to facilitate the alignment of memory and backbone features, thereby improving model generalization ability across different sizes of source models.

ProbIP utilizes RU-Mamba blocks to predict a matrix Fisher distribution over rotations, effectively estimating both rotation matrices and associated uncertainties. To refine motion distribution through layers, our Progressive Distribution Narrowing (PDN) technique enables stable learning across a diverse range of motions. Experimental results demonstrate that ProbIP achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple public datasets with six and fewer IMU sensors.

To overcome this limitation, we introduce a self-supervised method based on bi-level optimization. In the inner loop, we pretrain a vision encoder only on photographic face images using a set of linearly weighted pretext tasks: classification of categorical exchangeable image file format (EXIF) tags, ranking of ordinal EXIF tags, and detection of artificial face manipulations. The outer loop then optimizes the relative weights of these pretext tasks to enhance the coarse-grained detection of manipulated faces, serving as a proxy task for identifying AI-generated faces. In doing so, it aligns self-supervised learning more closely with the ultimate goal of AI-generated face detection. Once pretrained, the encoder remains fixed, and AI-generated faces are detected either as anomalies under a Gaussian mixture model fitted to photographic face features or by a lightweight two-layer perceptron serving as a binary classifier. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our detectors significantly outperform existing approaches in both one-class and binary classification settings, exhibiting strong generalization to unseen generators",

    "abstract": "The multi-modal 3D semantic occupancy task provides a comprehensive understanding of the scene and has received considerable attention in the field of autonomous driving. However, existing methods mainly focus on processing large-scale voxels, which bring high computational costs and degrade details. Additionally, they struggle to accurately capture occluded targets and distant information. In this paper, we propose a novel LiDAR-Camera 3D semantic occupancy prediction framework called RIOcc, with collaborative feature refinement and multi-scale cross-modal fusion transformer. Specifically, RIOcc encodes multi-modal data into a unified Bird's Eye View (BEV) space, which reduces computational complexity and enhances the efficiency of feature alignment. Then, multi-scale feature processing substantially expands the receptive fields. Meanwhile, in the LiDAR branch, we design the Dual-branch Pooling (DBP) to adaptively enhance geometric features across both the Channel and Grid dimensions. In the camera branch, the Wavelet and Semantic Encoders are developed to extract high-level semantic features with abundant edge and structural information. Finally, to facilitate effective cross-modal complementarity, we develop the Deformable Dual-Attention (DDA) module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RIOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 54.2 mIoU and 25.9 mIoU on the Occ3D-nuScenes and nuScenes-Occupancy datasets, respectively",

    "abstract": "Text-to-image diffusion model is a popular paradigm that synthesizes personalized images by providing a text prompt and a random Gaussian noise. While people observe that some noises are \"golden noises\" that can achieve better text-image alignment and higher human preference than others, we still lack a machine learning framework to obtain those golden noises. To learn golden noises for diffusion sampling, we mainly make three contributions in this paper. First, we identify a new concept termed the noise prompt, which aims at turning a random Gaussian noise into a golden noise by adding a small desirable perturbation derived from the text prompt. Following the concept, we first formulate the noise prompt learning framework that systematically learns \"prompted\" golden noise associated with a text prompt for diffusion models. Second, we design a noise prompt data collection pipeline and collect a large-scale noise prompt dataset (NPD) that contains 100k pairs of random noises and golden noises with the associated text prompts. With the prepared NPD as the training dataset, we trained a small noise prompt network (NPNet) that can directly learn to transform a random noise into a golden noise. The learned golden noise perturbation can be considered as a kind of prompt for noise, as it is rich in semantic information and tailored to the given text prompt. Third, our extensive experiments demonstrate the impressive effectiveness and generalization of NPNet on improving the quality of synthesized images across various diffusion models, including SDXL, DreamShaper-xl-v2-turbo, and Hunyuan-DiT. Moreover, NPNet is a small and efficient controller that acts as a plug-and-play module with very limited additional inference and computational costs, as it just provides a golden noise instead of a random noise without accessing the original pipeline",

To address these problems, we propose CharaConsist, which employs point-tracking attention and adaptive token merge along with decoupled control of the foreground and background.CharaConsist enables fine-grained consistency for both foreground and background, supporting the generation of one character in continuous shots within a fixed scene or in discrete shots across different scenes.Moreover, CharaConsist is the first consistent generation method tailored for text-to-image DiT model.

With increasing demands for higher quality standards, anomaly detection during the IC manufacturing process has become a significant research focus. However, the progress of IC anomaly detection is hampered by the scarcity of defective samples and the shortage of well-defined annotations. To address this challenge, this paper focuses on the research in the field of IC, especially on ceramic package substrates (CPS). We construct a systematic automated optical inspection (AOI) equipment, and based on this, collected large-scale CPS 2D images to build a novel anomaly detection dataset (CPS2D-AD), which offers copious samples with precise annotations, including category, mask, and bounding box. To the best of our knowledge, CPS2D-AD is the largest dataset in the field of IC. Meanwhile, we conduct an extensive benchmark of CPS2D-AD, intending to supplement existing research by providing a baseline for the detection and localization of anomalies in high-resolution data of ceramic package substrates. In addition, we have developed a novel large vision model, Segment Any Integrated Circuits (SAIC), by embedding-based distillation mechanism based on CPS2D-AD datasets. Our CPS2D-AD is the first open-source anomaly detection dataset about ceramic package substrates, which can be accessed at https://github.com/Bingyang0410/CPS2D-AD",

This limitation reduces their effectiveness in applications that require user-friendly interactions driven by vision-language prompts.

In this task, a model produces a group of masks based on arbitrary prompts specified by text only or text plus reference visual entities. To address this new challenge, we propose a novel framework to \"Refer to Any Segmentation Mask Group\" (RAS), which augments segmentation models with complex multimodal interactions and comprehension via a mask-centric large multimodal model. For training and benchmarking ORES models, we create datasets MaskGroups-2M and MaskGroups-HQ to include diverse mask groups specified by text and reference entities. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate superior performance of RAS on our new ORES task, as well as classic referring expression segmentation (RES) and generalized referring expression segmentation (GRES) tasks.

    "abstract": "Current large vision-language models (LVLMs) typically employ a connector module to link visual features with text embeddings of large language models (LLMs) and use end-to-end training to achieve multi-modal understanding in a unified process. Well alignment needs high-quality pre-training data and a carefully designed training process. Current LVLMs face challenges when addressing complex vision-language reasoning tasks, with their reasoning capabilities notably lagging behind those of LLMs. This paper proposes a paradigm shift: instead of training end-to-end vision-language reasoning models, we advocate for developing a decoupled reasoning framework based on existing visual interpretation specialists and text-based reasoning LLMs. Our approach leverages (1) a dedicated vision-language model to transform the visual content of images into textual descriptions and (2) an LLM to perform reasoning according to the visual-derived text and the original question. This method presents a cost-efficient solution for multi-modal model development by optimizing existing models to work collaboratively, avoiding end-to-end development of vision-language models from scratch. By transforming images into language model-compatible text representations, it facilitates future low-cost and flexible upgrades to upcoming powerful LLMs. We introduce an outcome-rewarded joint-tuning strategy to optimize the cooperation between the visual interpretation and linguistic reasoning model. Evaluation results on vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that the decoupled reasoning framework outperforms recent LVLMs. Our approach yields particularly significant performance gains on visually intensive geometric mathematics problems.

Existing approaches predominantly leverage the Mean Teacher framework for self-training in the target domain. The exponential moving average (EMA) mechanism in the Mean Teacher stabilizes the training by averaging the student weights over training steps. However, in domain adaptation, its inherent lag in responding to emerging knowledge can hinder the rapid adaptation of the student to target-domain shifts. To address this challenge, Dual-rate Dynamic Teacher (DDT) with Asynchronous EMA (AEMA) is proposed, which implements group-wise parameter updates. In contrast to traditional EMA, which simultaneously updates all parameters, AEMA dynamically decomposes teacher parameters into two functional groups based on their contributions to capture the domain shift. By applying a distinct smoothing coefficient to two groups, AEMA simultaneously enables fast adaptation and historical knowledge retention. Comprehensive experiments carried out on three widely used traffic benchmarks have demonstrated that the proposed DDT achieves superior performance, outperforming SOTA methods by a clear margin.

    "abstract": "The rapid advancing of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has spurred interest in complex multimodal reasoning tasks in the real-world and virtual environment, which require coordinating multiple abilities, including visual perception, visual reasoning, spatial awareness, and target deduction. However, existing evaluations primarily assess the final task completion, often degrading assessments to isolated abilities such as visual grounding and visual question answering. Less attention is given to comprehensively and quantitatively analyzing reasoning process in multimodal environments, which is crucial for understanding model behaviors and underlying reasoning mechanisms beyond merely task success. To address this, we introduce MM-Escape, an extensible benchmark for investigating multimodal reasoning, inspired by real-world escape games. MM-Escape emphasizes intermediate model behaviors alongside final task completion. To achieve this, we develop EscapeCraft, a customizable and open environment that enables models to engage in free-form exploration for assessing multimodal reasoning. Extensive experiments show that MLLMs, regardless of scale, can successfully complete the simplest room escape tasks, with some exhibiting human-like exploration strategies. Yet, performance dramatically drops as task difficulty increases. Moreover, we observe that models severely suffer from accidental success, and that performance bottlenecks vary across models, revealing distinct failure modes and limitations in their multimodal reasoning abilities, such as repetitive trajectories without adaptive exploration, getting stuck in corners due to poor visual spatial awareness, and ineffective use of acquired props, such as the key. We hope our work sheds light on new challenges in multimodal reasoning, and uncovers potential improvements in MLLMs capabilities",

Although Selective State Space Models (SSMs) have shown good performance in sequence modeling with linear complexity, the spatio-temporal disorder of point cloud videos hinders their unidirectional modeling when directly unfolding the point cloud video into a 1D sequence through temporally sequential scanning. To address this challenge, we propose the Unified Spatio-Temporal State Space Model (UST-SSM), which extends the latest advancements in SSMs to point cloud videos. Specifically, we introduce Spatial-Temporal Selection Scanning (STSS), which reorganizes unordered points into semantic-aware sequences through prompt-guided clustering, thereby enabling the effective utilization of points that are spatially and temporally distant yet similar within the sequence. For missing 4D geometric and motion details, Spatio-Temporal Structure Aggregation (STSA) aggregates spatio-temporal features and compensates. To improve temporal interaction within the sampled sequence, Temporal Interaction Sampling (TIS) enhances fine-grained temporal dependencies through non-anchor frame utilization and expanded receptive fields.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "A major breakthrough in 3D reconstruction is the feedforward paradigm to generate pixel-wise 3D points or Gaussian primitives from sparse, unposed images. To further incorporate semantics while avoiding the significant memory and storage costs of high-dimensional semantic features, existing methods extend this paradigm by associating each primitive with a compressed semantic feature vector.However, these methods have two major limitations: (a) the naively compressed feature compromises expressiveness, affecting the model's ability to capture fine-grained semantics, and (b) the pixel-wise primitive prediction introduces redundancy in overlapping areas, causing unnecessary memory overhead. To this end, we introduce SpatialSplat, a feedforward framework that produces redundancy-aware Gaussians and capitalizes on a dual-field semantic representation. Particularly, with the insight that primitives within the same instance exhibit high semantic consistency, we decompose the semantic representation into a coarse feature field that encodes uncompressed semantics with minimal primitives, and a fine-grained yet low-dimensional feature field that captures detailed inter-instance relationships. Moreover, we propose a selective Gaussian mechanism, which retains only essential Gaussians in the scene, effectively eliminating redundant primitives. Our proposed Spatialsplat learns accurate semantic information and detailed instances prior with more compact 3D Gaussians, making semantic 3D reconstruction more applicable. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our method, demonstrating a remarkable 60% reduction in scene representation parameters while achieving superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.

Existing methods typically align textual prototypes with visual features using Vision-Language Models (VLMs), but they face two key limitations: (1) modality gaps hinder the ability to distinguish semantically similar attribute-object pairs, and (2) textual prototypes alone lack the fine-grained visual cues needed for accurate recognition. To address these challenges, we propose Visual Proxy Learning, a method that reduces modality gaps and enhances compositional generalization by initializing visual proxies for attributes, objects, and their compositions from text representations and optimizing the visual space to better capture fine-grained visual cues. To further strengthen cross-modal understanding, we introduce Cross-Modal Joint Learning (CMJL), which enforces consistency between text-image embeddings and fine-grained visual representations. This dual strategy improves generalization to unseen compositions and enhances the discrimination of similar pairs.

When this occurs, they introduce a form of distribution shift at test time, often leading to performance degradation. The primary focus has been on severe corruptions that, when applied aggressively, distort useful signals necessary for accurate semantic predictions. We take a different perspective by analyzing parameters of the image acquisition process and transformations that may be subtle or even imperceptible to the human eye. We find that such parameters are systematically encoded in the learned visual representations and can be easily recovered. More strikingly, their presence can have a profound impact, either positively or negatively, on semantic predictions. This effect depends on whether there is a strong correlation or anti-correlation between semantic labels and these acquisition-based or processing-based labels.

Moreover, because most visual tokenizers map local image patches into latent tokens, global information is limited. To address this, we introduce Hita, a novel image tokenizer for autoregressive (AR) image generation. It introduces a holistic-to-local tokenization scheme with learnable holistic queries and local patch tokens. Hita incorporates two key strategies to better align with the AR generation process: 1) arranging a sequential structure with holistic tokens at the beginning, followed by patch-level tokens, and using causal attention to maintain awareness of previous tokens; and 2) adopting a lightweight fusion module before feeding the de-quantized tokens into the decoder to control information flow and prioritize holistic tokens. Extensive experiments show that Hita accelerates the training speed of AR generators and outperforms those trained with vanilla tokenizers, achieving 2.59 FID and 281.9 IS on the ImageNet benchmark. Detailed analysis of the holistic representation highlights its ability to capture global image properties, such as textures, materials, and shapes. Additionally, Hita also demonstrates effectiveness in zero-shot style transfer and image in-painting. The code is available at https://github.com/CVMI-Lab/Hita",

Operating in a pretrained occupancy VQ-VAE latent space, our SF-DiT generates temporally consistent 3D occupancy, which provides guidance for controlled image and video diffusion for scene synthesis. To address the temporal consistency, SF-DiT enhances standard DiT blocks with temporal semantic modeling through two designs: (1) A Semantic Flow Estimation module capturing scene motions (flow, uncertainty, and classification) from sequential BEV semantic maps, and (2) A Semantic Flow-Modulated Cross-Attention module that dynamically adapts attention based on semantic flow patterns. This integration of semantic flow modeling in DiT enables consistent scene evolution understanding.

To this end, we suggest taking images as morphological proxies, facilitating cross-species generalization through large-scale multimodal pretraining. We propose the first genotype-to-phenotype diffusion model (G2PDiffusion) that generates morphological images from DNA considering two critical evolutionary signals, i.e., multiple sequence alignments (MSA) and environmental contexts.

Trained histopathologists overcome this challenge by navigating the WSI, looking for relevant patches, taking notes, and compiling them to produce a final holistic diagnostic. Traditional AI approaches, such as multiple instance learning and transformer-based models, fail short of such a holistic, iterative, multi-scale diagnostic procedure, limiting their adoption in the real-world. We introduce PathFinder, a multi-modal, multi-agent framework that emulates the decision-making process of expert pathologists. PathFinder integrates four AI agents, the Triage Agent, Navigation Agent, Description Agent, and Diagnosis Agent, that collaboratively navigate WSIs, gather evidence, and provide comprehensive diagnoses with natural language explanations. The Triage Agent classifies the WSI as benign or risky; if risky, the Navigation and Description Agents iteratively focus on significant regions, generating importance maps and descriptive insights of sampled patches. Finally, the Diagnosis Agent synthesizes the findings to determine the patient's diagnostic classification. Our Experiments show that PathFinder outperforms state-of-the-art methods in skin melanoma diagnosis by 8% while offering inherent explainability through natural language descriptions of diagnostically relevant patches. Qualitative analysis by pathologists shows that the Description Agent's outputs are of high quality and comparable to GPT-4o. PathFinder is also the first AI-based system to surpass the average performance of pathologists in this challenging melanoma classification task by 9%, setting a new record for efficient, accurate, and interpretable AI-assisted diagnostics in pathology.

The benchmark assesses multiple competencies including understanding of mesh&texture, spatial relationship, semantic instruction, physical laws, knowledge transfer and reasoning, etc. To support the downstream finetuning, we provide high-quality training data collected via an automated framework incorporating heuristic skills and prior information.

Although the number of training samples can be reduced substantially, current state-of-the-art methods heavily rely on enormous soft labels to achieve satisfactory performance. As a result, the required storage can be comparable even to original datasets, especially for large-scale ones. To solve this problem, instead of storing these heavy labels, we propose a novel label-lightening framework termed HeLlO aiming at effective image-to-label projectors, with which synthetic labels can be directly generated online from synthetic images. Specifically, to construct such projectors, we leverage prior knowledge in open-source foundation models, e.g., CLIP, and introduce a LoRA-like fine-tuning strategy to mitigate the gap between pre-trained and target distributions, so that original models for soft-label generation can be distilled into a group of low-rank matrices. Moreover, an effective image optimization method is proposed to further mitigate the potential error between the original and distilled label generators. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly reduces the storage cost to merely 0.001% compared to full soft-label storage methods while achieving comparable performance to state-of-the-art dataset distillation methods on large-scale datasets.

However, for end-to-end video understanding with LLMs, uniformly sampling video frames results in LLMs being overwhelmed by a vast amount of irrelevant information as video length increases. Existing hierarchical key frame extraction methods improve the accuracy of video understanding but still face two critical challenges. 1) How can the interference of extensive redundant information in long videos be mitigated? 2) How can a model dynamically adapt to complex hierarchical structures while accurately identifying key frames? To address these issues, we propose VideoMiner, which iteratively segments, captions, and clusters long videos, forming a hierarchical tree structure. The proposed VideoMiner progresses from long videos to events to frames while preserving temporal coherence, effectively addressing the first challenge. To precisely locate key frames, we introduce T-GRPO, a tree-based group relative policy optimization in reinforcement learning method that guides the exploration of the VideoMiner. The proposed T-GRPO is specifically designed for tree structures, integrating spatiotemporal information at the event level while being guided by the question, thus solving the second challenge. We achieve superior performance in all long-video understanding tasks and uncover several interesting insights. Our proposed T-GRPO surprisingly incentivizes the model to spontaneously generate a reasoning chain.

To resolve these challenges, we develop a novel Hierarchical Visual Prompt Learning (HVPL) model that overcomes catastrophic forgetting of previous categories from both frame-level and video-level perspectives. Specifically, to mitigate forgetting at the frame level, we devise a task-specific frame prompt and an orthogonal gradient correction (OGC) module. The OGC module helps the frame prompt encode task-specific global instance information for new classes in each individual frame by projecting its gradients onto the orthogonal feature space of old classes. Furthermore, to address forgetting at the video level, we design a task-specific video prompt and a video context decoder. This decoder first embeds structural inter-class relationships across frames into the frame prompt features, and then propagates task-specific global video contexts from the frame prompt features to the video prompt.

To address this issue, we propose FROSS (Faster-than-Real-Time Online 3D Semantic Scene Graph Generation), an innovative approach for online and faster-than-real-time 3D SSG generation that leverages the direct lifting of 2D scene graphs to 3D space and represents objects as 3D Gaussian distributions.

    "abstract": "Capturing the spatial patterns of neurons and generating high-fidelity morphological data remain critical challenges in developing biologically realistic large-scale brain network models. Existing methods fail to reconcile anatomical complexity with diversity and computational scalability. We propose MorphoGen, a hierarchical framework integrating global structure prediction through denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) with local neurites optimization. The pipeline initiates with DDPM-generated coarse-grained neuronal point clouds, followed by skeletonization and growth-guided linking to derive plausible tree-like structures, and culminates in natural neural fibers refinement via a pragmatic smoothing network. Comprehensive evaluations across three distinct long-range projection neuron datasets demonstrate that the proposed method improves 1-Nearest Neighbor Accuracy by approximately 12% on average compared to state-of-the-art baseline, reduces average training time by around 55%, and aligns the distributions of several morphometrics with real data. This work establishes a novel global-to-local paradigm for neuronal morphology generation, offering a more direct and efficient approach compared to current branch-sequential modeling methods.

    "abstract": "Commercial video generation models have exhibited realistic, high-fidelity results but are still restricted to limited access.One crucial obstacle for large-scale applications is the expensive training and inference cost.In this paper, we argue that videos contain significantly more redundant information than images, allowing them to be encoded with very few motion latents.Towards this goal, we design an image-conditioned VAE that projects videos into extremely compressed latent space and decode them based on content images. This magic Reducio charm enables 64xreduction of latents compared to a common 2D VAE, without sacrificing the quality.Building upon Reducio-VAE, we can train diffusion models for high-resolution video generation efficiently. Specifically, we adopt a two-stage generation paradigm, first generating a condition image via text-to-image generation, followed by text-image-to-video generation with the proposed Reducio-DiT. Extensive experiments show that our model achieves strong performance in evaluation.More importantly, our method significantly boosts the training and inference efficiency of video LDMs. Reducio-DiT is trained in just 3.2K A100 GPU hours in total and can generate a 16-frame 1024x1024 video clip within 15.5 seconds on a single A100 GPU.

    "abstract": "Learning an agent model that behaves like humans--capable of jointly perceiving the environment, predicting the future, and taking actions from a first-person perspective--is a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Existing methods typically train separate models for these abilities, which fail to capture their intrinsic relationships and prevent them from learning from each other. Inspired by how humans learn through the perception-action loop, we propose EgoAgent, a unified agent model that simultaneously learns to represent, predict, and act within a single transformer. EgoAgent explicitly models the causal and temporal dependencies among these abilities by formulating the task as an interleaved sequence of states and actions. It further introduces a joint embedding-action-prediction architecture with temporally asymmetric predictor and observer branches, enabling synergistic optimization across all three capabilities. Comprehensive evaluations of EgoAgent on representative tasks such as image classification, egocentric future state prediction, and 3D human motion prediction demonstrate the superiority of our method.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Large vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in open-world multimodal understanding, yet their high computational overheads pose great challenges for practical deployment. Some recent works have proposed methods to accelerate VLMs by pruning redundant visual tokens guided by the attention maps of VLM's early layers. Despite the success of these token pruning methods, they still suffer from two major shortcomings: (i) considerable accuracy drop due to insensitive attention signals in early layers, and (ii) limited speedup when generating long responses (e.g., 30 tokens). To address the limitations above, we present TwigVLM---a simple and general architecture by \"growing\" a lightweight twig upon an early layer of the base VLM. Compared with most existing VLM acceleration methods purely based on visual token pruning, our TwigVLM not only achieves better accuracy retention by employing a twig-guided token pruning (TTP) strategy, but also yields higher generation speed by utilizing a self-speculative decoding (SSD) strategy. Taking LLaVA-1.5-7B as the base VLM, experimental results show that TwigVLM preserves 96% of the original performance after pruning 88.9% of visual tokens and achieves 154% speedup in generating long responses, delivering significantly better performance in terms of both accuracy and speed over the state-of-the-art VLM acceleration methods",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) excels at learning generalizable image representations but often falls short in zero-shot inference on certain downstream datasets. Test-time adaptation (TTA) mitigates this issue by adjusting components like normalization layers or context prompts, yet it typically requires large batch sizes and extensive augmentations, leading to high computational costs. This raises a key question: Can VLMs' performance drop in specific test cases be mitigated through efficient, training-free approaches? To explore the solution, we investigate token condensation (TC) techniques, originally designed to enhance vision transformer efficiency by refining token usage during inference. We observe that informative tokens improve visual-text alignment in VLMs like CLIP on unseen datasets. However, existing TC methods often fail to maintain in-distribution performance when reducing tokens, prompting us to ask: How can we transform TC into an effective \"free-lunch\" adaptation strategy for VLMs? To address this, we propose Token Condensation as Adaptation (TCA), a training-free adaptation method that takes a step beyond standard TC. Rather than passively discarding tokens, TCA condenses token representation by introducing reservoir-based domain anchor tokens for information-preserving token reduction and logit correction. TCA achieves up to a 21.4% performance improvement over the strongest baseline on cross-dataset benchmark and the CIFAR-100-Corrupted dataset while reducing GFLOPs by 12.2% to 48.9%, with minimal hyperparameter dependency on both CLIP and SigLIP series.

The structure map is then used as condition to train a structure-guided inpainting diffusion model for removing shadows in a generative manner. Finally, to restore the fine-scale details (e.g., eyelashes, moles and spots) that may not be captured by the structure map, we take the gradients inside the shadow regions as guidance and train a detail restoration diffusion model to refine the shadow removal result. Extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets show that our method clearly outperforms existing methods, and is effective to avoid previously common issues such as facial identity tampering, shadow residual, color distortion, structure blurring, and loss of details.

While Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a natural fit for slide-level tasks, training robust models requires large and diverse datasets. Even though image augmentation techniques could be utilized to increase data variability and reduce overfitting, implementing them effectively is not a trivial task. Traditional patch-level augmentation is prohibitively expensive due to the large number of patches extracted from each WSI, and existing feature-level augmentation methods lack control over transformation semantics. We introduce HistAug, a fast and efficient generative model for controllable augmentations in the latent space for digital pathology. By conditioning on explicit patch-level transformations (e.g., hue, erosion), HistAug generates realistic augmented embeddings while preserving initial semantic information. Our method allows the processing of a large number of patches in a single forward pass efficiently, while at the same time consistently improving MIL model performance. Experiments across multiple slide-level tasks and diverse organs show that HistAug outperforms existing methods, particularly in low-data regimes.

A simple yet flexible diffusion-based framework, named UniRes, is proposed to address such degradations in an end-to-end manner. It combines several specialized models during the diffusion sampling steps, hence transferring the knowledge from several well-isolated restoration tasks to the restoration of complex in-the-wild degradations. This only requires well-isolated training data for several degradation types. The framework is flexible as extensions can be added through a unified formulation, and the fidelity-quality trade-off can be adjusted through a new paradigm.

However, using large 3D Gaussian counts significantly increases the GPU device memory for storing model parameters. A large model thus requires powerful GPUs with high memory capacities for training and has slower training/rendering latencies due to the inefficiencies of memory access and data movement. In this work, we introduce ContraGS, a method to enable training directly on compressed 3DGS representations without reducing the Gaussian Counts, and thus with a little loss in model quality. ContraGS leverages codebooks to compactly store a set of Gaussian parameter vectors throughout the training process, thereby significantly reducing memory consumption. While codebooks have been demonstrated to be highly effective at compressing fully trained 3DGS models, directly training using codebook representations is an unsolved challenge. ContraGS solves the problem of learning non-differentiable parameters in codebook-compressed representations by posing parameter estimation as a Bayesian inference problem. To this end, ContraGS provides a framework that effectively uses MCMC sampling to sample over a posterior distribution of these compressed representations. With ContraGS, we demonstrate that ContraGS significantly reduces the peak memory during training (on average 3.49X) and accelerated training and rendering 1.36Xand 1.88X on average, respectively), while retraining close to state-of-art quality",

    "abstract": "Trajectory prediction aims to forecast an agent's future trajectories based on its historical observed trajectories, which is a critical task for various applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, and surveillance systems. Most existing trajectory prediction methods assume that the observed trajectories collected for forecasting are clean. However, in real-world scenarios, noise is inevitably introduced into the observations, resulting in the collapse of the existing approaches. Therefore, it is essential to perform robust trajectory prediction based on noisy observations, which is a more practical scenario. In this paper, we propose **NATRA**, a **N**oise-**A**gnostic framework capable of tackling the problem of **TRA**jectory prediction with arbitrary types of noisy observations. Specifically, we put forward a mutual information-based mechanism to denoise the original noisy observations. It optimizes the produced trajectories to exhibit a pattern that closely resembles the clean trajectory pattern while deviating from the noisy one.Considering that the trajectory structure may be destroyed through the only optimization of mutual information, we introduce an additional reconstruction loss to preserve the structure information of the produced observed trajectories. Moreover, we further propose a ranking loss to further enhance the performance. Because NATRA does not rely on any specific module tailored to particular noise distributions, it can handle arbitrary types of noise in principle. Additionally, our proposed NATRA can be easily integrated into existing trajectory prediction models.

    "abstract": "Visual imitation learning is effective for robots to learn versatile tasks. However, many existing methods rely on behavior cloning with supervised historical trajectories, limiting their 3D spatial and 4D spatiotemporal awareness. Consequently, these methods struggle to capture the 3D structures and 4D spatiotemporal relationships necessary for real-world deployment. In this work, we propose 4D Diffusion Policy (DP4), a novel visual imitation learning method that incorporates spatiotemporal awareness into diffusion-based policies. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on trajectory cloning, DP4 leverages a dynamic Gaussian world model to guide the learning of 3D spatial and 4D spatiotemporal perceptions from interactive environments. Our method constructs the current 3D scene from a single-view RGB-D observation and predicts the future 3D scene, optimizing trajectory generation by explicitly modeling both spatial and temporal dependencies. Extensive experiments across 17 simulation tasks with 173 variants and 3 real-world robotic tasks demonstrate that the 4D Diffusion Policy (DP4) outperforms baseline methods, improving the average simulation task success rate by 16.4% (Adroit), 14% (DexArt), and 6.45% (RLBench), and the average real-world robotic task success rate by 8.6%",

Advances in computing, data availability, and self-supervised learning (SSL) have paved the way for slide-level foundation models (SLFMs) that can improve prediction tasks in low-data regimes. However, current methods under-utilize shared information between tasks and modalities. To overcome this challenge, we propose ModalTune, a novel fine-tuning framework which introduces the Modal Adapter to integrate new modalities without modifying SLFM weights. Additionally, we use large-language models (LLMs) to encode labels as text, capturing semantic relationships across multiple tasks and cancer types in a single training recipe. ModalTune achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results against both uni-modal and multi-modal models across four cancer types, jointly improving survival and cancer subtype prediction while remaining competitive in pan-cancer settings. Additionally, we show ModalTune is generalizable to two out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets.

    "abstract": "While CLIP has advanced open-vocabulary predictions, its performance on semantic segmentation remains suboptimal. This shortfall primarily stems from its spatial-invariant semantic features and constrained resolution. While previous adaptations addressed spatial invariance semantic by modifying the self-attention in CLIP's image encoder, the issue of limited resolution remains unexplored. Different from previous segment-then-splice methods that segment sub-images via a sliding window and splice the results, we introduce a splice-then-segment paradigm that incorporates Segment-Anything Model (SAM) to tackle the resolution issue since SAM excels at extracting fine-grained semantic correlations from high-resolution images. Specifically, we introduce Trident, a training-free framework that first splices features extracted by CLIP and DINO from sub-images, then leverages SAM's encoder to create a correlation matrix for global aggregation, enabling a broadened receptive field. Besides, we propose a refinement strategy for CLIP's coarse segmentation outputs by transforming them into prompts for SAM. Trident achieves a significant improvement in the mIoU across eight popular benchmarks compared with the current SOTA. Furthermore, it can also be utilized to generate visual prompts that enhance the performance of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Code is available at https://github.com/YuHengsss/Trident",

However, existing methods often suffer from identity leakage (IL) and rendering artifacts (RA), particularly in extreme cases. Through an in-depth analysis of previous approaches, we identify two key insights: (1) IL arises from identity information embedded within motion features, and (2) this identity information can be leveraged to address RA. Building on these findings, this paper introduces FixTalk, a novel framework designed to simultaneously resolve both issues for high-quality talking head generation. Firstly, we propose an Enhanced Motion Indicator (EMI) to effectively decouple identity information from motion features, mitigating the impact of IL on generated talking heads. To address RA, we introduce an Enhanced Detail Indicator (EDI), which utilizes the leaked identity information to supplement missing details, thus fixing the artifacts.

    "abstract": "Image-to-point-cloud (I2P) registration is a fundamental problem in computer vision, focusing on establishing 2D-3D correspondences between an image and a point cloud. Recently, the differentiable perspective-n-point (PnP) has been widely used to supervise I2P registration networks by enforcing projective constraints on 2D-3D correspondences. However, differentiable PnP is highly sensitive to noise and outliers in the predicted correspondences, which hinders the effectiveness of correspondence learning. Inspired by the robustness of blind PnP to noise and outliers in correspondences, we propose an approximate blind PnP-based correspondence learning approach. To mitigate the high computational cost of blind PnP, we reformulate it as a more tractable problem: minimizing the Chamfer distance between learned 2D and 3D keypoints, referred to as MinCD-PnP. To effectively solve MinCD-PnP, we introduce a lightweight multi-task learning module, MinCD-Net, which can be easily integrated into the existing I2P registration architectures. Extensive experiments on 7-Scenes, RGBD-V2, ScanNet, self-collected, and KITTI datasets demonstrate that MinCD-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods and achieves higher inlier ratio and registration recall in both cross-scene and cross-dataset settings.

Thus motivated, in this paper we propose TRACT, an open-vocabulary tracker that leverages trajectory information to improve both object association and classification in OV-MOT.

Our analysis reveals that a small subset of image tokens with high attention scores are the main drivers of object hallucination. By removing these hallucinatory image tokens (only 1.5% of all image tokens), the issue can be effectively mitigated. This finding holds consistently across different models.

Within computer vision, adapter-based PEFT methods are often favored over prompt-based approaches like Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) due to the latter's performance and efficiency limitations. Our analysis reveals that VPT's shortcomings stem from its prompt deployment strategy, which can distort the model's inherent self-attention mechanism. To address this, we propose Cross Visual Prompt Tuning (CVPT). CVPT introduces a cross-attention module to directly model interactions between prompts and image tokens. This design decouples the prompts from the input sequence, preserving the original self-attention integrity while enabling efficient feature integration. Furthermore, we employ a weight-sharing mechanism for cross-attention initialization, which enhances representative capability without a large parameter overhead. Extensive experiments across 25 datasets show that CVPT significantly outperforms VPT. For instance, on the VTAB-1K benchmark, CVPT achieves over 4% higher average accuracy, rivaling leading adapter-based methods in both performance and efficiency.

In contrast, fine-tuning information-heavy layers, such as attention layers via Compacter, achieves a better Pareto frontier on more complex tasks---57.5% and 34.6% above the average on Caltech-256 and CUB-200, respectively.

However, existing methods, whether training-free or training-based, continue to face challenges in maintaining subject consistency due to the lack of fine-grained guidance and inter-frame interaction. Additionally, the scarcity of high-quality data in this field makes it difficult to precisely control storytelling tasks, including the subject's position, appearance, clothing, expression, and posture, thereby hindering further advancements. In this paper, we demonstrate that layout conditions, such as the subject's position and detailed attributes, effectively facilitate fine-grained interactions between frames. This not only strengthens the consistency of the generated frame sequence but also allows for precise control over the subject's position, appearance, and other key details. Building on this, we introduce an advanced storytelling task: Layout-Toggable Storytelling, which enables precise subject control by incorporating layout conditions. To address the lack of high-quality datasets with layout annotations for this task, we develop Lay2Story-1M, which contains over 1 million 720p and higher-resolution images, processed from approximately 11,300 hours of cartoon videos. Building on Lay2Story-1M, we create Lay2Story-Bench, a benchmark with 3,000 prompts designed to evaluate the performance of different methods on this task. Furthermore, we propose Lay2Story, a robust framework based on the Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) architecture for Layout-Togglable Storytelling tasks.

However, our analysis from the feature learning perspective reveals that the backbone struggles to maintain high sensitivity to sample-scarce categories but retains the ability to localize specific areas effectively. Based on this observation, we propose a new model for long-tailed multi-label image classification named category-specific selective feature enhancement (CSSFE). First, it utilizes the retained localization capability of the backbone to capture label-dependent class activation maps. Then, a progressive attention enhancement mechanism, updating from head to medium to tail categories, is introduced to address the low-confidence issue in medium and tail categories. Finally, visual features are extracted according to the optimized class activation maps and combined with semantic information to perform the classification task. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets highlight our findings' generalizability and the proposed CSSFE's superior performance",

For this, most methods rely solely on final-layer features of frozen large pre-trained backbones, limiting their adaptability to new domains. While full fine-tuning is often impractical, parameter-efficient fine-tuning --and particularly side-tuning (ST)-- has emerged as an effective alternative. However, prior ST approaches this problem from a frame-level refinement perspective, overlooking the inherent sparse nature of MR. To address this, we propose the Sparse-Dense Side-Tuner (SDST), the first anchor-free ST architecture for VTG. We also introduce the Reference-based Deformable Self-Attention, a novel mechanism that enhances the context modeling of the deformable attention --a key limitation of existing anchor-free methods. Additionally, we present the first effective integration of InternVideo2 backbone into an ST framework, showing its profound implications in performance. Overall, our method significantly improves existing ST methods, achieving highly competitive or SOTA results on QVHighlights, TACoS, and Charades-STA, while reducing up to a 73% the parameter count w.r.t. the existing SOTA methods.

However, leading open-source MLLMs exhibit significant limitations in complex and structured reasoning, particularly in tasks requiring deep reasoning for decision-making and problem-solving. In this work, we present Corvid, an MLLM with enhanced chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities. Architecturally, Corvid incorporates a hybrid vision encoder for informative visual representation and a meticulously designed connector (GateMixer) to facilitate cross-modal alignment. To enhance Corvid's CoT reasoning capabilities, we introduce MCoT-Instruct-287K, a high-quality multimodal CoT instruction-following dataset, refined and standardized from diverse public reasoning sources. Leveraging this dataset, we fine-tune Corvid with a two-stage CoT-formatted training approach to progressively enhance its step-by-step reasoning abilities. Furthermore, we propose an effective inference-time scaling strategy that enables Corvid to mitigate over-reasoning and under-reasoning through self-verification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Corvid outperforms existing o1-like MLLMs and state-of-the-art MLLMs with similar parameter scales, with notable strengths in mathematical reasoning and science problem-solving.

Composite images (CIs) are synthetic visuals created by merging multiple visual elements, such as charts, posters, or screenshots, rather than being captured directly by a camera. While CIs are prevalent in real-world applications, recent MLLM developments have primarily focused on interpreting natural images (NIs). Our research reveals that current MLLMs face significant challenges in accurately understanding CIs, often struggling to extract information or perform complex reasoning based on these images. We find that existing training data for CIs are mostly formatted for question-answer tasks (e.g., in datasets like ChartQA and ScienceQA), while high-quality image-caption datasets, critical for robust vision-language alignment, are only available for NIs. To bridge this gap, we introduce Composite Captions (CompCap), a flexible framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and automation tools to synthesize CIs with accurate and detailed captions. Using CompCap, we curate CompCap-118K, a dataset containing 118K image-caption pairs across six CI types. We validate the effectiveness of CompCap-118K by supervised fine-tuning MLLMs of three sizes: xGen-MM-inst.-4B and LLaVA-NeXT-Vicuna-7B/13B. Empirical results show that CompCap-118K significantly enhances MLLMs' understanding of CIs, yielding average gains of 1.7%, 2.0%, and 2.9% across eleven benchmarks, respectively",

    "abstract": "Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks have gained prominence within artificial intelligence research due to their potential application in fields like home assistants. Many contemporary VLN approaches, while based on transformer architectures, have increasingly incorporated additional components such as external knowledge bases or map information to enhance performance. These additions, while boosting performance, also lead to larger models and increased computational costs. In this paper, to achieve both high performance and low computational costs, we propose a novel architecture with the **co**mbination of **s**elective **m**em**o**rization (COSMO), which integrates state-space modules (SSMs) and transformer modules. However, direct application of SSMs in VLN results in significant performance degradation. Therefore, we propose two VLN-customized selective state space modules: the Round Selective Scan (RSS) and the Cross-modal Selective State Space Module (CS3). RSS facilitates comprehensive inter-modal interactions within a single scan, while the CS3 module adapts the selective state space module into a dual-stream architecture, thereby enhancing the acquisition of cross-modal interactions. Experimental validations on three mainstream VLN benchmarks, REVERIE, R2R, and R2R-CE, not only demonstrate competitive navigation performance of our model but also show a significant reduction in computational costs.

    "abstract": "Open-set 3D object retrieval (3DOR) is an emerging task aiming to retrieve 3D objects of unseen categories beyond the training set. Existing methods typically utilize all modalities (i.e., voxels, point clouds, multi-view images) and train specific backbones before fusion. However, they still struggle to produce generalized representations due to insufficient 3D training data. Being contrastively pre-trained on web-scale image-text pairs, CLIP inherently produces generalized representations for a wide range of downstream tasks. Building upon it, we present a simple yet effective framework named Describe, Adapt and Combine (DAC) by taking only multi-view images for open-set 3DOR. DAC innovatively synergizes a CLIP model with a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) to learn generalized 3D representations, where the MLLM is used for dual purposes. First, it describes the seen category information to align with CLIP's training objective for adaptation during training. Second, it provides external hints about unknown objects complementary to visual cues during inference. To improve the synergy, we introduce an Additive-Bias Low-Rank adaptation (AB-LoRA), which alleviates overfitting and further enhances the generalization to unseen categories. With only multi-view images, DAC significantly surpasses prior arts by an average of +10.01% mAP on four open-set 3DOR datasets. Moreover, its generalization is also validated on image-based and cross-dataset setups. Code is available at https://github.com/wangzhichuan123/DAC",

First, an agent explores the environment, collecting noisy image-caption pairs. Then, a consistent pseudo-caption for each object instance is distilled via consensus using a large language model. Finally, these pseudo-captions are used to fine-tune an off-the-shelf captioning model, with the addition of contrastive learning. We analyse the performance of the combination of captioning models, exploration policies, pseudo-labeling methods, and fine-tuning strategies, on our manually labeled test set. Results show that a policy can be trained to mine samples with higher disagreement compared to classical baselines. Our pseudo-captioning method, in combination with all policies, has a higher semantic similarity compared to other existing methods, and fine-tuning improves caption accuracy and consistency by a significant margin.

While recent efforts have introduced few- or single-step solutions, existing methods either inefficiently model the process from noisy input or fail to fully exploit iterative generative priors, compromising the fidelity and quality of the reconstructed images. To address this issue, we propose FlowSR, a novel approach that reformulates the SR problem as a rectified flow from low-resolution (LR) to high-resolution (HR) images. Our method leverages an improved consistency learning strategy to enable high-quality SR in a single step. Specifically, we refine the original consistency distillation process by incorporating HR regularization, ensuring that the learned SR flow not only enforces self-consistency but also converges precisely to the ground-truth HR target. Furthermore, we introduce a fast-slow scheduling strategy, where adjacent timesteps for consistency learning are sampled from two distinct schedulers: a fast scheduler with fewer timesteps to improve efficiency, and a slow scheduler with more timesteps to capture fine-grained texture details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlowSR achieves outstanding performance in both efficiency and image quality",

Fine-tuning is often impractical due to data preparation challenges, time limits, and optimization issues. To boost segmentation performance while keeping zero-shot features, one approach is pre-augmenting images for the segmentation model. However, existing image augmentations mainly depend on rule-based methods, restricting augmentation effectiveness. Though learning-based methods can diversify augmentation, rule-based ones are degree-describable (e.g., slight/intense brightening), while learning-based methods usually predict non-degree-describable ground truths (e.g., depth estimation), creating a heterogeneous search space when combined. To this end, we propose an \"Augmenting-to-Adapt\" paradigm, replacing traditional rule-based augmentation with an optimal heterogeneous augmentation policy to enhance segmentation. Our method uses 32 augmentation techniques (22 rule-based, 10 learning-based) to ease parameter misalignment, forming a robust, multi-discrete heterogeneous search space.To apply the optimal policy in real-world scenarios, we distill the augmentation process to speed up the preprocess.

Specifically, in macro mode, we introduce a language-controlled segmentation strategy (LS) to generate an initial mask based on user-provided language prompts. In micro mode, a window-controlled refinement strategy (WR) allows flexible refinement of user-defined regions (i.e., size-adjustable windows) within the initial mask.

Large Language Models (LLMs) are beneficial solutions for user-robot interaction due to their natural language understanding and reasoning abilities.

However, existing methods often overlook specific body part movements and their timing. In this paper, we address this issue by enriching the textual description with more details. Specifically, we propose the FineMotion dataset, which contains over 442,000 human motion snippets -- short segments of human motion sequences -- and their corresponding detailed descriptions of human body part movements. Additionally, the dataset includes about 95k detailed paragraphs describing the movements of human body parts in entire motion sequences. Experimental results demonstrate the significance of our dataset on the text-driven fine-grained human motion generation task, especially with a remarkable +15.3% improvement in Top-3 accuracy for the MDM model. Notably, we further support a zero-shot pipeline of fine-grained motion editing, which focuses on detailed editing in both spatial and temporal dimensions via text.

    "abstract": "While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated extraordinary vision-language understanding capabilities, their abilities to solve instance-level visual-language problems beyond a single image warrant further exploration. To assess these unproven abilities of MLLMs, this paper proposes a new visual grounding task called multi-context visual grounding, which aims to localize instances of interest across multiple images based on open-ended text prompts. In order to facilitate this research, we construct a new dataset MC-Bench that features 2K high-quality and manually annotated samples. Each sample consists of an instance-level labeled image pair and a corresponding text prompt that indicates the target instances in the images. These text prompts are highly open-ended and follow three distinct styles, covering 20 practical skills. We benchmark over 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs and foundation models with potential multi-context visual grounding capabilities, along with our developed simple yet effective agentic baseline and a finetuned baseline by multi-context instruction tuning. Our evaluation reveals a non-trivial performance gap between existing MLLMs and humans, along with some insightful observations that suggest potential future directions. We hope that MC-Bench and our empirical findings encourage the research community to further advance the untapped potentials of MLLMs in instance-level tasks, particularly in multi-image contexts.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recent prosperity of text-to-image diffusion models, e.g. Stable Diffusion, has stimulated research to adapt them to 360-degree panorama generation. Prior work has demonstrated the feasibility of using conventional low-rank adaptation techniques on pre-trained diffusion models to generate panoramic images. However, the substantial domain gap between perspective and panoramic images raises questions about the underlying mechanisms enabling this empirical success. We hypothesize and examine that the trainable counterparts exhibit distinct behaviors when fine-tuned on panoramic data, and such an adaptation conceals some intrinsic mechanism to leverage the prior knowledge within the pre-trained diffusion models. Our analysis reveals the following: 1) the query and key matrices in the attention modules are responsible for common information that can be shared between the panoramic and perspective domains, thus are less relevant to panorama generation; and 2) the value and output weight matrices specialize in adapting pre-trained knowledge to the panoramic domain, playing a more critical role during fine-tuning for panorama generation. We empirically verify these insights by introducing a simple framework called UniPano, with the objective of establishing an elegant baseline for future research. UniPano not only outperforms existing methods but also significantly reduces memory usage and training time compared to prior dual-branch approaches, making it scalable for end-to-end panorama generation with higher resolution.

This paper introduces HERMES: temporal-coHERent long-forM understanding with Episodes and Semantics, featuring two versatile modules that can enhance existing video-language models or operate as a standalone system. Our Episodic COmpressor (ECO) efficiently aggregates representations from micro to semi-macro levels, reducing computational overhead while preserving temporal dependencies. Our Semantics ReTRiever (SeTR) enriches these representations with semantic information by focusing on broader context, dramatically reducing feature dimensionality while preserving relevant macro-level information. We demonstrate that these modules can be seamlessly integrated into existing SOTA models, consistently improving their performance while reducing inference latency by up to 43% and memory usage by 46%. As a standalone system, HERMES achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple long-video understanding benchmarks in both zero-shot and fully-supervised settings.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We investigate coral reef semantic segmentation, in which coral reefs are governed by multifaceted factors, like genes, environmental changes, and internal interactions. Unlike segmenting structural units/instances, which are predictable and follow a set pattern, also referred to as commonsense or prior, segmenting coral reefs involves modeling self-repeated, asymmetric, and amorphous distribution of elements, e.g., corals can grow in almost any shape and appearance. We revisited existing segmentation approaches and found that both computer vision and coral reef communities failed to incorporate the intrinsic properties of corals into model design. In this work, we propose a simple formulation for coral reef semantic segmentation: we regard the segment as the basis to model both within-segment and cross-segment affinities. We propose CoralSRT, a feature rectification module via self-supervised guidance, to reduce the stochasticity of coral features extracted by powerful foundation models (FMs), as demonstrated in Fig. 1. We incorporate intrinsic properties of corals to strengthen within-segment affinity by guiding the features within generated segments to align with the centrality. We investigate features from FMs that were optimized by various pretext tasks on significantly large-scale unlabeled or labeled data, which already contain rich information for modeling both within-segment and cross-segment affinities, enabling the adaptation of FMs for coral segmentation. CoralSRT can rectify features from FMs to more efficient features for label propagation and lead to further significant semantic segmentation performance gains, all without requiring additional human supervision, retraining/finetuning FMs or even domain-specific data. These advantages help reduce human effort and the need for domain expertise in data collection and labeling. Our method is easy to implement, and also task- and model-agnostic. CoralSRT bridges the self-supervised pre-training and supervised training in the feature space, also offering insights for segmenting elements/stuffs (e.g., grass, plants, cells, and biofoulings)",

    "abstract": "As an important direction of embodied intelligence, 3D Visual Grounding has attracted much attention, aiming to identify 3D objects matching the given language description. Most existing methods often follow a two-stage process, i.e., first detecting proposal objects and identifying the right objects based on the relevance to the given query. However, when the query is complex, it is difficult to leverage an abstract language representation to lock the corresponding objects accurately, affecting the grounding performance. In general, given a specific object, humans usually follow two clues to finish the corresponding grounding, i.e., attribute and location clues. To this end, we explore a new mechanism, attribute-to-location clue reasoning, to conduct accurate grounding. Particularly, we propose a VGMamba network that consists of an SVD-based attribute mamba, location mamba, and multi-modal fusion mamba. Taking a 3D point cloud scene and language query as the input, we first exploit SVD to make a decomposition of the extracted features. Then, a slidingwindow operation is conducted to capture attribute characteristics. Next, a location mamba is presented to obtain the corresponding location information. Finally, by means of multi-modal mamba fusion, the model could effectively localize the object that matches the given query. In the experiment, our method is verified on four datasets.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The motion transfer task aims to transfer motion from a source video to newly generated videos, requiring the model to decouple motion from appearance. Previous diffusion-based methods primarily rely on separate spatial and temporal attention mechanisms within the 3D U-Net. In contrast, state-of-the-art video Diffusion Transformers (DiT) models use 3D full attention, which does not explicitly separate temporal and spatial information. Thus, the interaction between spatial and temporal dimensions makes decoupling motion and appearance more challenging for DiT models. In this paper, we propose DeT, a method that adapts DiT models to improve motion transfer ability. Our approach introduces a simple yet effective temporal kernel to smooth DiT features along the temporal dimension, facilitating the decoupling of foreground motion from background appearance. Meanwhile, the temporal kernel effectively captures temporal variations in DiT features, which are closely related to motion. Moreover, we introduce explicit supervision along dense trajectories in the latent feature space to further enhance motion consistency. Additionally, we present MTBench, a general and challenging benchmark for motion transfer. We also introduce a hybrid motion fidelity metric that considers both the global and local motion similarity. Therefore, our work provides a more comprehensive evaluation than previous works. Extensive experiments on MTBench demonstrate that DeT achieves the best trade-off between motion fidelity and edit fidelity",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in motion diffusion models have enabled spatially controllable text-to-motion generation. However, these models struggle to achieve high-precision control while maintaining high-quality motion generation. To address these challenges, we propose MaskControl, the first approach to introduce controllability to the generative masked motion model. Our approach introduces two key innovations. First, Logits Regularizer implicitly perturbs logits at training time to align the distribution of motion tokens with the controlled joint positions, while regularizing the categorical token prediction to ensure high-fidelity generation. Second, Logit Optimization explicitly optimizes the predicted logits during inference time, directly reshaping the token distribution that forces the generated motion to accurately align with the controlled joint positions. Moreover, we introduce Differentiable Expectation Sampling (DES) to combat the non-differential distribution sampling process encountered by logits regularizer and optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MaskControl outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior motion quality (FID decreases by 77%) and higher control precision (average error 0.91 vs. 1.08). Additionally, MaskControl enables diverse applications, including any-joint-any-frame control, body-part timeline control, and zero-shot objective control.

To address this limitation, we introduce distribution-based probabilistic modeling as a more comprehensive representation of network knowledge.

Based on the second-oder modeling, we propose Evidential Knowledge Distillation (EKD) which distills both the expectation of the teacher distribution and the distribution itself into the student. The expectation captures the macroscopic characteristics of the distribution, while the distribution itself conveys microscopic information about the classification boundaries. Additionally, we theoretically show that EKD's distillation objective provides an upper bound on the student's expected risk when treating the teacher's predictions as ground truth.

To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel alternative called Straighten Viscous Rectified Flow via Noise Optimization (VRFNO), which is a joint training framework integrating an encoder and a neural velocity field. VRFNO introduces two key innovations: (1) a historical velocity term that enhances trajectory distinction, enabling the model to more accurately predict the velocity of the current trajectory, and (2) the noise optimization through reparameterization to form optimized couplings with real images which are then utilized for training, effectively mitigating errors caused by Reflow's limitations.

The goal of information quantization is to achieve efficient storage and transmission by reducing data precision or redundancy. However, the information distortion caused by quantization will lead to the degradation of signal fidelity and the performance of downstream tasks. This paper focuses on the geometry quantization distortion of point clouds and proposes a unified learning-based quality enhancement framework for omni-scene point clouds. Based on the characteristics of geometry quantization distortion, we analyze and find that existing upsampling methods are not competitive in dealing with point reduction and geometry displacement simultaneously caused by coordinate quantization. Therefore, we design a general rooting-growing-pruning paradigm to efficiently perceive the geometry feature of quantized point clouds and improve the quality significantly. In addition, a novel loss constraint term related to the quantization step parameter is proposed to further improve quality and accelerate model convergence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first unified quality enhancement framework for object and scene point clouds with coordinate quantization. Extensive experiments verify the superiority of the proposed method on multi-scale point clouds with different levels of quantization distortion, including object (ModelNet40, 8iVFB) and scene (KITTI).

    "abstract": "Recently, Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) with integrated vision encoders have shown promising performance in vision understanding. They encode visual content into sequences of visual tokens, enabling joint processing of visual and textual data. However, understanding videos, especially long videos, remains a challenge as the rapid growth of visual tokens during video encoding risks exceeding VLLMs' context window length and significantly escalates computational cost. To restrict the number of visual tokens, existing VLLMs either: (1) uniformly downsample videos into a fixed number of frames or (2) reducing the number of visual tokens encoded from each frame. We argue that the former neglects temporal dynamics in videos, while the latter fails to preserve spatial details within individual frame. In this work, we propose Balanced-VLLM (B-VLLM), a novel VLLM framework designed to model task relevant spatio-temporal cues, while restricting the number of visual tokens within the VLLM's context window length. Central to our framework is a text-conditioned adaptive frame selection module that dynamically identifies task-relevant frames, which are further de-duplicated with a temporal frame token merging strategy.The visual tokens of these frames then undergo spatial token sampling and an optional spatial token merging strategy for granular control against the token budget. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of B-VLLM in balancing the number of frames and visual tokens, moreover, our proposed method introduce 10% performance gain on MVBench.

    "abstract": "Simulating driving environments in 4D is crucial for developing accurate and immersive autonomous driving systems. Despite progress in generating driving scenes, challenges in transforming views and modeling the dynamics of space and time remain. To tackle these issues, we propose a fresh methodology that reconstructs real-world driving environments and utilizes a generative network to enable 4D simulation. This approach builds continuous 4D point cloud scenes by leveraging surround-view data from autonomous vehicles. By separating the spatial and temporal elements, it creates smooth keyframe sequences. Furthermore, video generation techniques are employed to produce lifelike 4D simulation videos from any given perspective. To extend the range of possible viewpoints, we incorporate training using decomposed camera poses, which allows for enhanced modeling of distant scenes. Additionally, we merge camera trajectory data to synchronize 3D points across consecutive frames, fostering a richer understanding of the evolving scene. With training across multiple scene levels, our method is capable of simulating scenes from any viewpoint and offers deep insight into the evolution of scenes over time in a consistent spatial-temporal framework. In comparison with current methods, this approach excels in maintaining consistency across views, background coherence, and overall accuracy, significantly contributing to the development of more realistic autonomous driving simulations",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The ever-growing size of training datasets enhances the generalization capability of machine learning models but also incurs exorbitant computational costs. Existing data pruning approaches aim to accelerate training by removing those less important samples. However, they often rely on gradients or proxy models, leading to prohibitive additional costs of gradient back-propagation and proxy model training. In this paper, we propose Partial Forward Blocking (PFB), a novel framework for lossless training acceleration. The efficiency of PFB stems from its unique adaptive pruning pipeline: sample importance is assessed based on features extracted from the shallow layers of the target model. Less important samples are then pruned, allowing only the retained ones to proceed with the subsequent forward pass and loss back-propagation. This mechanism significantly reduces the computational overhead of deep-layer forward passes and back-propagation for pruned samples, while also eliminating the need for auxiliary backward computations and proxy model training. Moreover, PFB introduces probability density as an indicator of sample importance. Combined with an adaptive distribution estimation module, our method dynamically prioritizes relatively rare samples, aligning with the constantly evolving training state. Extensive experiments demonstrate the significant superiority of PFB in performance and speed. On ImageNet, PFB achieves a 0.5% accuracy improvement and 33% training time reduction with 40% data pruned",

However, data heterogeneity can significantly degrade the performance of the global model when each party uses datasets from different sources to train a local model, thereby affecting personalized local models. Among various cases of data heterogeneity, feature drift, feature space difference among parties, is prevalent in real-life data but remains largely unexplored. Feature drift can distract feature extraction learning in clients and thus lead to poor feature extraction and classification performance. To tackle the problem of feature drift in FL, we propose FedPall, an FL framework that utilizes prototype-based adversarial learning to unify feature spaces and collaborative learning to reinforce class information within the features. Moreover, FedPall leverages mixed features generated from global prototypes and local features to enhance the global classifier with classification-relevant information from a global perspective.

    "abstract": "Recently, single-frame infrared small target (SIRST) detection with single point supervision has drawn wide-spread attention. However, the latest label evolution with single point supervision (LESPS) framework suffers from instability, excessive label evolution, and difficulty in exerting embedded network performance. Inspired by organisms gradually adapting to their environment and continuously accumulating knowledge, we construct an innovative Progressive Active Learning (PAL) framework, which drives the existing SIRST detection networks progressively and actively recognizes and learns harder samples. Specifically, to avoid the early low-performance model leading to the wrong selection of hard samples, we propose a model pre-start concept, which focuses on automatically selecting a portion of easy samples and helping the model have basic task-specific learning capabilities. Meanwhile, we propose a refined dual-update strategy, which can promote reasonable learning of harder samples and continuous refinement of pseudo-labels. In addition, to alleviate the risk of excessive label evolution, a decay factor is reasonably introduced, which helps to achieve a dynamic balance between the expansion and contraction of target annotations. Extensive experiments show that existing SIRST detection networks equipped with our PAL framework have achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on multiple public datasets. Furthermore, our PAL framework can build an efficient and stable bridge between full supervision and single point supervision tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/YuChuang1205/PAL",

A new form of asynchronous event error-minimizing noise is proposed to perturb event streams, tricking the unauthorized model into learning embedded noise instead of realistic features.

We introduce a constrained optimization method for simultaneous camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction that does not require SfM support. Core to our approach is decomposing a camera pose into a sequence of camera-to-(device-)center and (device-)center-to-world optimizations. To facilitate, we propose two optimization constraints conditioned to the sensitivity of each parameter group and restricts each parameter's search space. In addition, as we learn the scene geometry directly from the noisy point clouds, we propose geometric constraints to improve the reconstruction quality.

Additionally, training exclusively on SAYCam overlooks the broader, diverse input from which infants naturally learn. To address these limitations, we propose BabyVLM, a novel framework comprising diverse in-domain evaluation benchmarks and a synthetic training dataset created via child-directed transformations of existing datasets. We demonstrate that VLMs trained with our synthetic dataset achieve superior performance on BabyVLM tasks compared to models trained solely on SAYCam or general-purpose data of the SAYCam size. BabyVLM thus provides a robust, developmentally aligned evaluation tool and illustrates how compact models trained on carefully curated data can generalize effectively, opening pathways toward data-efficient vision-language learning paradigms",

    "abstract": "This paper presents an end-to-end framework for reconstructing 3D parametric curves directly from multi-view edge maps. Contrasting with existing two-stage methods that follow a sequential \"edge point cloud reconstruction and parametric curve fitting\" pipeline, our one-stage approach optimizes 3D parametric curves directly from 2D edge maps, eliminating error accumulation caused by the inherent optimization gap between disconnected stages. However, parametric curves inherently lack suitability for rendering-based multi-view optimization, necessitating a complementary representation that preserves their geometric properties while enabling differentiable rendering. We propose a novel bi-directional coupling mechanism between parametric curves and edge-oriented Gaussian components. This tight correspondence formulates a curve-aware Gaussian representation, CurveGaussian, that enables differentiable rendering of 3D curves, allowing direct optimization guided by multi-view evidence. Furthermore, we introduce a dynamically adaptive topology optimization framework during training to refine curve structures through linearization, merging, splitting, and pruning operations. Comprehensive evaluations on the ABC dataset and real-world benchmarks demonstrate our one-stage method's superiority over two-stage alternatives, particularly in producing cleaner and more robust reconstructions. Additionally, by directly optimizing parametric curves, our method significantly reduces the parameter count during training, achieving both higher efficiency and superior performance compared to existing approaches",

Single-encoder architectures like CLIP exhibit inherent constraints in generalizing across diverse multimodal tasks, while recent multi-encoder fusion methods introduce prohibitive computational overhead to achieve superior performance using complementary visual representations from multiple vision encoders. To address this, we propose a progressive pruning framework, namely Multi-Encoder collaboraTivE tOken pRuning (METEOR), that eliminates redundant visual tokens across the encoding, fusion, and decoding stages for multi-encoder MLLMs. For multi-vision encoding, we discard redundant tokens within each encoder via a rank guided collaborative token assignment strategy. Subsequently, for multi-vision fusion, we combine the visual features from different encoders while reducing cross-encoder redundancy with cooperative pruning. Finally, we propose an adaptive token pruning method in the LLM decoding stage to further discard irrelevant tokens based on the text prompts with dynamically adjusting pruning ratios for specific task demands. To our best knowledge, this is the first successful attempt that achieves an efficient multi-encoder based vision language model with multi-stage pruning strategies.

To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that leverages physical prior knowledge alongside a specialized multi-regional inpainting technique tailored for HOI. By incorporating physical constraints derived from human topology and contact information, we define two distinct regions: the primary region, where occluded object parts are most likely to reside, and the secondary region, where occlusions are less probable. Our multi-regional inpainting method employs customized denoising strategies across these regions within a diffusion model, thereby enhancing the accuracy and realism of generated completions in both shape and visual detail. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms existing methods in HOI scenarios, advancing machine perception toward a more human-like understanding of dynamic environments.

We finally encode the resulting features and network parameters into bitstreams through entropy coding. Besides, our NeCGS can handle the dynamic scenario well, where new 3D models are constantly added to a compressed set. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the significant advantages of our NeCGS over state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The mainstream approach for correcting distortions in wide-angle images typically involves a cascading process of rectification followed by rectangling. These tasks address distorted image content and irregular boundaries separately, using two distinct pipelines. However, this independent optimization prevents the two stages from benefiting each other. It also increases susceptibility to error accumulation and misaligned optimization, ultimately degrading the quality of the rectified image and the performance of downstream vision tasks. In this work, we observe and verify that transformations based on motion representations ((e.g.,, Thin-Plate Spline) exhibit structural continuity in both rectification and rectangling tasks. This continuity enables us to establish their relationships through the perspective of structural morphing, allowing for an optimal solution within a single end-to-end framework. To this end, we propose ConBo-Net, a unified Content and Boundary modeling approach for one-stage wide-angle image correction. Our method jointly addresses distortion rectification and boundary rectangling in an end-to-end manner. To further enhance the model's structural recovery capability, we incorporate physical priors based on the wide-angle camera model during training and introduce an ordinal geometric loss to enforce curvature monotonicity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConBo-Net outperforms state-of-the-art two-stage solutions. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/lwttttt/ConBo-Net",

    "abstract": "Albeit existing Single-Domain Generalized Object Detection (Single-DGOD) methods enable models to generalize to unseen domains, most assume that the training and testing data share the same label space. In real-world scenarios, unseen domains often introduce previously unknown objects, a challenge that has been largely overlooked. In this paper, we tackle the practical problem of Single-domain Generalizable Open-Set Object Detection (SG-OSOD), which addresses both unseen domains and unknown classes. We identify two key challenges: (1) detecting unknown classes with only known-class data, and (2) learning robust features to mitigate domain shift. To address these challenges, we propose the framework termed \\texttt ASGS , which leverages adaptive subgraph structures to enhance the understanding of unknown scenes and classes. \\texttt ASGS consists of Subgraph-wise Unknown-class Learning (SUL) and Class-wise Embedding Compaction (CEC). SUL employs non-parametric methods to detect unknown samples and performs Adaptive Subgraph Searching (ASS) for high-order structural feature extraction, enabling domain-robust unknown class learning. Moreover, the CEC module enhances class discrimination robustness through contrastive learning, which results in more compact class clusters in unknown scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed \\texttt ASGS",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Video semantic segmentation aims to assign a class label for each pixel in every video frame. Existing methods predominantly follow the reference-target interaction paradigm, focusing on extracting local temporal contexts while neglecting the integration of global temporal information. Moreover, complex dynamics and varying lighting conditions introduce inter-frame intra-class discrepancies in feature representations, leading to unstable predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, the Dual-Temporal Exemplar Representation Network (DTERN), which utilizes the strong representational capability of cluster centers, i.e., exemplars, to effectively model both local and global temporal information. DTERN consists of two core modules: 1) the Local Temporal Exemplar Module (LTEM), which constructs local exemplars to capture local temporal contexts, ensuring stable and reliable predictions. 2) the Global Temporal Exemplar Module (GTEM), which introduces learnable global exemplars to dynamically model global temporal information, thereby improving the effective consistency of segmentation. Furthermore, we observe that the existing Video Consistency (VC) metric fails to evaluate segmentation accuracy and lacks sensitivity to small-object segmentation. To this end, we propose Video Effective Consistency (VEC) to comprehensively evaluate temporal consistency and segmentation effectiveness. Experiments on VSPW and Cityscape demonstrate that DTERN outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://github.com/zlxilo/DTERN",

    "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) with large effective receptive field (ERF), still in their early stages, have demonstrated promising effectiveness while constrained by high parameters and FLOPs costs and disrupted asymptotically Gaussian distribution (AGD) of ERF. This paper proposes an alternative paradigm: rather than merely employing extremely large ERF, it is more effective and effcient to expand the ERF while maintaining AGD of ERF by proper combination of smaller kernels, such as 7x 7 , 9x 9 , 11x 11 . This paper introduces a Three-layer Receptive Field Aggregator and designs a Layer Operator as the fundamental operator from the perspective of receptive field. The ERF can be expanded to the level of existing large-kernel ConvNets through the stack of proposed modules while maintaining AGD of ERF. Using these designs, we propose a universal ConvNet, termed UniConvNet. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K, COCO2017, and ADE20K demonstrate that UniConvNet outperforms state-of-the-art CNNs and ViTs across various vision recognition tasks for both lightweight and large-scale models with comparable throughput. Surprisingly, UniConvNet-T achieves 84.2% ImageNet top-1 accuracy with 30M parameters and 5.1G FLOPs.

Our proposal harbors an innate agency that remains advantageous in the speed of sequence prediction, and strongly favors high capability in generating quality samples by leveraging the principles of denoising diffusion process.

To address the issue, we propose Uncertainty-Aware Gradient Stabilization (UGS), a framework that reformulates object localization as a classification task to stabilize gradients. UGS quantizes continuous labels into interval non-uniform discrete representations. Under a classification-based objective, the localization branch generates bounded and confidence-driven gradients, mitigating instability. Furthermore, UGS integrates an uncertainty minimization (UM) loss that reduces prediction variance and an uncertainty-guided refinement (UR) module that identifies and refines high-uncertainty regions via perturbations. Evaluated on four benchmarks, UGS consistently improves anchor-based, anchor-free, and leading small object detectors.

This has yielded a significant improvement in rendering speeds due to the efficiency of rasterization algorithms and hardware, but has come at a cost: the approximations that make rasterization efficient also make implementation of light transport phenomena like reflection and refraction much more difficult. We propose a novel scene representation which avoids these approximations, but keeps the efficiency and reconstruction quality of splatting by leveraging a decades-old efficient volumetric mesh ray tracing algorithm which has been largely overlooked in recent computer vision research. The resulting model, which we name Radiant Foam, achieves rendering speed and quality comparable to Gaussian Splatting, without the constraints of rasterization. Unlike ray traced Gaussian models that use hardware ray tracing acceleration, our method requires no special hardware or APIs beyond the standard features of a programmable GPU",

In VPT, we uncover \"burstiness\" in the values arising from the interaction of image patch embeddings, and the key and query projectors within Transformer's self-attention module. Interestingly, the values of patch embeddings and the key and query projectors exhibit Laplacian and hyper-Laplacian distribution, respectively. Intuitively, these non-Gaussian distributions pose challenges for learning prompts. To address this, we propose whitening these data, de-correlating them and equalizing their variance towards more Gaussian before learning prompts. We derive the whitening matrix over random image patch embeddings and ViT's key and query projectors, and multiply it with the prompt to be learned in a bilinear manner.Surprisingly, this method significantly accelerates prompt tuning and boosts accuracy, e.g., >25 points on the CUB dataset; interestingly, it learns \"bursty prompts\".As bilinear models are known to introduce burstiness, we present a compact method by learning two small sets of parameters whose multiplication yields the final prompts. We call the proposed methods Bilinear Prompt Tuning (BPT).

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Text-to-video (T2V) generative models have rapidly advanced and found widespread applications across fields like entertainment, education, and marketing. However, the adversarial vulnerabilities of these models remain rarely explored. We observe that in T2V generation tasks, the generated videos often contain substantial redundant information not explicitly specified in the text prompts, such as environmental elements, secondary objects, and additional details, providing opportunities for malicious attackers to embed hidden harmful content. Exploiting this inherent redundancy, we introduce BadVideo, the first backdoor attack framework tailored for T2V generation. Our attack focuses on designing target adversarial outputs through two key strategies: (1) Spatio-Temporal Composition, which combines different spatiotemporal features to encode malicious information; (2) Dynamic Element Transformation, which introduces transformations in redundant elements over time to convey malicious information. Based on these strategies, the attacker's malicious target seamlessly integrates with the user's textual instructions, providing high stealthiness. Moreover, by exploiting the temporal dimension of videos, our attack successfully evades traditional content moderation systems that primarily analyze spatial information within individual frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BadVideo achieves high attack success rates while preserving original semantics and maintaining excellent performance on clean inputs. Overall, our work reveals the adversarial vulnerability of T2V models, calling attention to potential risks and misuse. Our project page is at https://wrt2000.github.io/BadVideo2025/",

To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel two-stage framework comprising View Synthesis and Contrastive Multi-task View-Semantics Recognition. In the View Synthesis stage, we simulate unseen viewpoints by extracting 3D keypoints from the front-view training dataset and synthesizing common-view 2D skeleton sequences with virtual camera rotation, which enriches view diversity without the cost of multi-camera setups. However, direct training on these synthetic samples leads to limited improvement, as viewpoint-specific and semantics-specific features remain entangled. To overcome this drawback, we present a Contrastive Multi-task View-Semantics Recognition (CMVSR) module that disentangles viewpoint-dependent features from sign semantics. In this way, CMVSR obtains view-invariant representations of the sign video, leading to robust recognition performance against various camera viewpoints. We evaluate our approach on the MM-WLAuslan dataset, the first benchmark for CV-ISLR, and on our extended protocol MTV-Test that includes additional multi-view data captured in the wild.

In this paper, we introduce R1-Onevision, a multimodal reasoning model designed to bridge the gap between visual perception and deep reasoning. To achieve this, we propose a cross-modal reasoning pipeline that transforms images into formal textual representations, enabling precise language-based reasoning. Leveraging this pipeline, we construct the R1-Onevision dataset which provides detailed, step-by-step multimodal reasoning annotations across diverse domains. We further develop the R1-Onevision model through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to cultivate advanced reasoning and robust generalization abilities.

    "title": "Learnable Logit Adjustment for Imbalanced Semi-Supervised Learning under Class Distribution Mismatch",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In class-imbalanced learning (CIL), post-hoc logit adjustment (LA) effectively mitigates class imbalance by adjusting biased logits according to label frequencies. Given the success of LA in CIL, recent class-imbalanced semi-supervised learning (CISSL) algorithms incorporated LA, leading to improved performance when labeled and unlabeled datasets share the same class distribution. However, a common real-world scenario involves the unknown class distribution of the unlabeled set, which may mismatch that of the labeled set. In this case, LA may result in an inappropriate degree of logit adjustments, potentially degrading classification performance due to its inability to incorporate the unknown class distribution of the unlabeled set. To address this problem, we propose a novel CISSL algorithm named learnable logit adjustment (LLA). Unlike the original LA, LLA learns the appropriate degree of logit adjustment by minimizing the class-averaged loss computed for both the labeled and unlabeled sets. Based on the learned degree, LLA refines the biased pseudo-labels of base semi-supervised learning algorithms and adjusts the biased class predictions on the test set by adjusting the logits. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that LLA achieves state-of-the-art performance in CISSL",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Watermarking as a traceable authentication technology has been widely applied in image copyright protection. However, most existing watermarking methods embed watermarks by adding irremovable perturbations to the cover image, causing permanent distortion. To address this issue, we propose a novel watermarking approach termed Cover-Recoverable Watermark (CRMark). CRMark can losslessly recover the cover image and watermark in lossless channels and enables robust watermark extraction in lossy channels. CRMark leverages an integer Invertible Watermarking Network (iIWN) to achieve a lossless invertible mapping between the cover-image-watermark pair and the stego image. During the training phase, CRMark employs an encoder-noise-layer-decoder architecture to enhance its robustness against distortions. In the inference phase, CRMark first maps the cover-image-watermark pair into an overflowed stego image and a latent variable. Subsequently, the overflowed pixels and the latent variable are losslessly compressed into an auxiliary bitstream, which is then embedded into the clipped stego image using reversible data hiding. During extraction, in lossy channels, the noised stego image can directly undergo inverse mapping via iIWN to extract the watermark. In lossless channels, the latent variable and overflowed stego image are first recovered using reversible data hiding, followed by watermark extraction through iIWN. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that CRMark can be perfectly recovered in lossless channels while remaining robust to common distortions.

While most methods are designed for adult brains using Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODE) with fixed step sizes, the neonatal brain, which exhibits dramatic changes in cortical folding patterns early in life, requires a more adaptive approach. To address this, we develop a dual-task framework to directly characterize the brain development trajectory through processes of cortical surface reconstruction. For white matter (inner surfaces), we employ an Age-Conditioned ODE with adaptive step sizes. It is initially trained on a limited set of longitudinal paired data to establish a coarse trajectory, which is then refined through sample training of single-point data and knowledge distillation. For the pial surfaces (outer surfaces), we position the midthickness surfaces as intermediates and employ a cycle-consistent semi-supervised training strategy to depict a coherent brain development trajectory between the inner and outer surfaces. Our approach is the first to achieve precise developmental prediction directly on triangular meshes. Furthermore, by enhancing interpretability at each stage of the deformation process, this approach improves the applicability of diffeomorphic-based methods. The proposed method has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in modeling developmental trajectories and cortical surface reconstruction within the developing Human Connectome Project dataset (dHCP)",

Recent geometric foundation models, such as DUSt3R, enable end-to-end dense 3D reconstruction but remain underexplored in scientific imaging fields like cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) for near-atomic protein reconstruction. In cryo-EM, pose estimation and 3D reconstruction from unordered particle images still depend on time-consuming iterative optimization, primarily due to challenges such as low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and distortions from the contrast transfer function (CTF). We introduce CryoFastAR, the first geometric foundation model that can directly predict poses from Cryo-EM noisy images for Fast ab initio Reconstruction. By integrating multi-view features and training on large-scale simulated cryo-EM data with realistic noise and CTF modulations, CryoFastAR enhances pose estimation accuracy and generalization. To enhance training stability, we propose a progressive training strategy that first allows the model to extract essential features under simpler conditions before gradually increasing difficulty to improve robustness.

To this end, we change the optimizer to LM that runs in conjunction with the 3DGS differentiable rasterizer. For efficient GPU parallelization, we propose a caching data structure for intermediate gradients that allows us to efficiently calculate Jacobian-vector products in custom CUDA kernels. In every LM iteration, we calculate update directions from multiple image subsets using these kernels and combine them in a weighted mean. Overall, our method is 20% faster than the original 3DGS while obtaining the same reconstruction quality. Our optimization is also agnostic to other methods that accelerate 3DGS, thus enabling even faster speedups compared to vanilla 3DGS",

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a prevailing technique to reconstruct large-scale 3D scenes from multiview images for novel view synthesis, like a room, a block, and even a city. Such large-scale scenes are not static with changes constantly happening in these scenes, like a new building being built or a new decoration being set up. To keep the reconstructed 3D Gaussian fields up-to-date, a naive way is to reconstruct the whole scene after changing, which is extremely costly and inefficient. In this paper, we propose a new method called GauUpdate that allows partially updating an old 3D Gaussian field with new objects from a new 3D Gaussian field. However, simply inserting the new objects leads to inconsistent appearances because the old and new Gaussian fields may have different lighting environments from each other. GauUpdate addresses this problem by applying inverse rendering techniques in the 3DGS to recover both the materials and environmental lights. Based on the materials and lighting, we relight the new objects in the old 3D Gaussian field for consistent global illumination. For an accurate estimation of the materials and lighting, we put additional constraints on the materials and lighting conditions, that these two fields share the same materials but different environment lights, to improve their qualities. We conduct experiments on both synthetic scenes and real-world scenes to evaluate GauUpdate, which demonstrate that GauUpdate achieves realistic object insertion in 3D Gaussian fields with consistent appearances",

However, applying VLP to ophthalmic surgery presents unique challenges, including limited vision-language data, intricate procedural workflows, and the need for hierarchical understanding, ranging from fine-grained surgical actions to global clinical reasoning. To address these, we introduce OphVL, a large-scale, hierarchically structured dataset containing over 375K video-text pairs, making it 15x larger than existing surgical VLP datasets. OphVL captures a diverse range of ophthalmic surgical attributes, including surgical phases, operations, actions, instruments, medications, disease causes, surgical objectives, and postoperative care recommendations. By aligning short clips with detailed narratives and full-length videos with structured titles, OphVL provides both fine-grained surgical details and high-level procedural context. Building on OphVL, we propose OphCLIP, a hierarchical retrieval-augmented VLP framework. OphCLIP leverages silent surgical videos as a knowledge base, retrieving semantically relevant content to enhance narrated procedure learning. This enables OphCLIP to integrate explicit linguistic supervision with implicit visual knowledge, improving ophthalmic workflow modeling. Evaluations across 11 benchmark datasets for surgical phase recognition and multi-instrument identification demonstrate OphCLIP's robust generalization and superior performance, establishing it as a foundation model for ophthalmic surgery",

    "abstract": "Transformers have demonstrated remarkable success across vision, language, and video. Yet, increasing task complexity has led to larger models and more tokens, raising the quadratic cost of self-attention and the overhead of GPU memory access. To reduce the computation cost of self-attention, prior work has proposed token compression techniques that drop redundant or less informative tokens. Meanwhile, fused attention kernels such as FlashAttention have been developed to alleviate memory overhead by avoiding attention map construction and its associated I/O to HBM. This, however, makes it incompatible with most training-free token compression methods, which rely on attention maps to determine token importance. Here, we propose Representation Shift, a training-free, model-agnostic metric that measures the degree of change in each token's representation. This seamlessly integrates token compression with FlashAttention, without attention maps or retraining. Our method further generalizes beyond Transformers to CNNs and state space models. Extensive experiments show that Representation Shift enables effective token compression compatible with FlashAttention, yielding significant speedups of up to 5.5x and 4.4x in video-text retrieval and video QA, respectively.

However, the quadratic scaling properties of the attention in DiTs hinder image generation with higher resolution or devices with limited resources. This work introduces an efficient diffusion transformer (EDiT) to alleviate these efficiency bottlenecks in conventional DiTs and Multimodal DiTs (MM-DiTs). First, we present a novel linear compressed attention method that uses a multi-layer convolutional network to modulate queries with local information while keys and values are spatially aggregated. Second, we formulate a hybrid attention scheme for multi-modal inputs that combines linear attention for image-to-image interactions and standard scaled dot-product attention for interactions involving prompts. Merging these two approaches leads to an expressive, linear-time Multimodal Efficient Diffusion Transformer (MM-EDiT). We demonstrate the effectiveness of the EDiT and MM-EDiT architectures by integrating them into PixArt-Sigma (conventional DiT) and Stable Diffusion 3.5-Medium (MM-DiT), achieving up to 2.2x speedup with comparable image quality after distillation",

    "title": "GenHancer: Imperfect Generative Models are Secretly Strong Vision-Centric Enhancers",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The synergy between generative and discriminative models receives growing attention. While discriminative Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) excels in high-level semantics, it struggles with perceiving fine-grained visual details. Generally, to enhance representations, generative models take CLIP's visual features as conditions for reconstruction. However, the underlying principle remains underexplored. In this work, we empirically found that visually perfect generations are not always optimal for representation enhancement. The essence lies in effectively extracting fine-grained knowledge from generative models while mitigating irrelevant information. To explore critical factors, we delve into three aspects: (1) Conditioning mechanisms: We found that even a small number of local tokens can drastically reduce the difficulty of reconstruction, leading to collapsed training. We thus conclude that utilizing only global visual tokens as conditions is the most effective strategy. (2) Denoising configurations: We observed that end-to-end training introduces extraneous information. To address this, we propose a two-stage training strategy to prioritize learning useful visual knowledge. Additionally, we demonstrate that lightweight denoisers can yield remarkable improvements. (3) Generation paradigms: We explore both continuous and discrete denoisers with desirable outcomes, validating the versatility of our method. Through our in-depth explorations, we have finally arrived at an effective method, namely GenHancer, which consistently outperforms prior arts on the MMVP-VLM benchmark, e.g., 6.0% on OpenAICLIP. The enhanced CLIP can be further plugged into multimodal large language models for better vision-centric performance. All the models and codes are made publicly available",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have greatly enhanced their proficiency in 2D visual understanding tasks, enabling them to effectively process and understand images and videos. However, the development of LMMs with 3D scene understanding capabilities has been hindered by the lack of large-scale 3D vision-language datasets and powerful 3D encoders. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective framework called LLaVA-3D. Leveraging the strong 2D visual understanding priors from LLaVA, our LLaVA-3D efficiently adapts LLaVA for 3D scene understanding without compromising 2D understanding capabilities. To achieve this, we utilize the 3D position embeddings to enhance the 2D CLIP Patches with 3D spatial context information and construct 3D patches. By integrating the 3D position embeddings into 2D LMMs and employing joint 2D and 3D vision-language instruction tuning, we establish a unified architecture for both 2D visual understanding and 3D scene understanding. In contrast to previous 3D LMMs, LLaVA-3D supports decoding accurate 3D spatial perception outputs, e.g., 3D bounding boxes, directly from these 3D patches, without relying on the time-consuming off-the-shelf 3D segmentors. Experimental results show that LLaVA-3D converges 3.5x faster than existing 3D LMMs when trained on 3D vision-language datasets. Moreover, LLaVA-3D not only achieves state-of-the-art performance across various 3D tasks but also maintains comparable 2D visual understanding and vision-language conversation capabilities with LLaVA",

Visitors engage with exhibits through curiosity and questions, making expert domain-specific models essential for interactive query resolution and gaining historical insights. Understanding exhibits from images requires analyzing visual features and linking them to historical knowledge to derive meaningful correlations. We facilitate such reasoning by (a) collecting and curating a large-scale dataset of 65M images and 200M question-answer pairs for exhibits from all around the world; (b) training large vision-language models (VLMs) on the collected dataset; (c) benchmarking their ability on five visual question answering tasks, specifically designed to reflect real-world inquiries and challenges observed in museum settings.The complete dataset is labeled by museum experts, ensuring the quality and the practical significance of the labels. We train two VLMs from different categories: BLIP with vision-language aligned embeddings, but lacking the expressive power of large language models, and the LLaVA model, a powerful instruction-tuned LLM enriched with vision-language reasoning capabilities. Through extensive experiments, we find that while both model types effectively answer visually grounded questions, large vision-language models excel in queries requiring deeper historical context and reasoning. We further demonstrate the necessity of fine-tuning models on large-scale domain-specific datasets by showing that our fine-tuned models significantly outperform current SOTA VLMs in answering questions related to specific attributes, highlighting their limitations in handling complex, nuanced queries.

This makes it challenging to assess if models are truly able to combine perceptual and temporal information to reason about videos, or simply get the correct answer by chance or by exploiting linguistic biases. To remedy this, we provide a new video reasoning dataset called MINERVA for modern multimodal models. Each question in the dataset comes with 5 answer choices, as well as detailed, hand-crafted reasoning traces. Our dataset is multimodal, diverse in terms of video domain and length, and consists of complex multi-step questions. Extensive benchmarking shows that our dataset provides a challenge for frontier open-source and proprietary models. We perform fine-grained error analysis to identify common failure modes across various models, and create a taxonomy of reasoning errors. We use this to explore both human and LLM-as-a-judge methods for scoring video reasoning traces, and find that failure modes are primarily related to temporal localization, followed by visual perception errors, as opposed to logical or completeness errors.

This novel multi-task learning approach has been designed to incorporate the auditability of the model as an optimization objective during the training process of neural networks. The proposed approach incorporates intermediate activation maps as inputs to the MINT layers, which are trained to enhance the detection of training data.

    "abstract": "Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models have exhibited unprecedented capability in many applications by taking full advantage of the learned multimodal alignment. However, previous studies have shown they are vulnerable to maliciously crafted adversarial samples. Despite recent success, these attacks are generally instance-specific and require generating perturbations for each input sample. In this paper, we reveal that VLP models are also susceptible to the instance-agnostic universal adversarial perturbation (UAP). Specifically, we design a novel Contrastive-training Perturbation Generator with Cross-modal conditions (C-PGC). In light that the pivotal multimodal alignment in VLP models is achieved via contrastive learning, we devise to turn this powerful weapon against VLP models themselves. I.e., we employ a malicious version of contrastive learning to train the proposed generator using our carefully crafted positive and negative image-text pairs. Once training is complete, the generator is able to produce universal perturbations that can essentially destroy the established alignment relationship in VLP models. Besides, C-PGC fully utilizes the characteristics of Vision-and-Language (V+L) scenarios by incorporating both unimodal and cross-modal information as effective guidance. Extensive experiments show that C-PGC successfully forces adversarial samples to move away from their original area in the VLP model's feature space, thus fundamentally enhancing attack performance across various victim models and V+L tasks",

    "abstract": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success in various tasks, yet their robustness to real-world illumination variations remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose Illumination Transformation Attack (ITA), the first framework to systematically assess VLMs' robustness against illumination changes. However, there still exist two key challenges: (1) how to model global illumination with fine-grained control to achieve diverse lighting conditions and (2) how to ensure adversarial effectiveness while maintaining naturalness. To address the first challenge, we innovatively decompose global illumination into multiple parameterized point light sources based on the illumination rendering equation. This design enables us to model more diverse lighting variations that previous methods could not capture. Then, by integrating these parameterized lighting variations with physics-based lighting reconstruction techniques, we could precisely render such light interactions in the original scenes, finally meeting the goal of fine-grained lighting control. For the second challenge, by controlling illumination through the lighting reconstrution model's latent space rather than direct pixel manipulation, we inherently preserve physical lighting priors. Furthermore, to prevent potential reconstruction artifacts, we design additional perceptual constraints for maintaining visual consistency with original images and diversity constraints for avoiding light source convergence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ITA could significantly reduce the performance of advanced VLMs, e.g., LLaVA-1.6, while possessing competitive naturalness, exposing VLMS' critical illuminiation vulnerabilities",

Recent learning-based methods for low-light LF enhancement are generally tailored to specific illumination inputs, limiting their performance in real-world scenes.

In this paper, we propose to explore the view consistency for scene-adaptive low-light LF enhancement. We first analyze the view consistency for LF illumination maps and design a self-supervised view-consistent loss to keep the consistency between the illumination maps of different views in LFs. To enhance the model's perception of illumination, we combine both global and local information to estimate the illumination map, which is easily plugged into other models. Subsequently, we use the illumination maps to light up the low-light LF images and restore the corruption to produce the final enhanced image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our View-Consistenct Network (VCNet) outperforms state-of-the-art methods on real-world low-light LF datasets in both fixed lighting conditions and dynamic lighting conditions.

Unfortunately, this practical tool has enabled malicious users to freely synthesize misinformative or deepfake contents with greater ease, which promotes the spread of unethical and abusive, as well as privacy-, and copyright-infringing contents. While defensive algorithms such as AdvDM and Photoguard have been shown to disrupt the diffusion process on these images, the misalignment between their objectives and the iterative denoising trajectory at test time results in weak disruptive performance.

    "abstract": "As the core operator of Transformers, Softmax Attention exhibits excellent global modeling capabilities. However, its quadratic complexity limits its applicability to vision tasks. In contrast, Linear Attention shares a similar formulation with Softmax Attention while achieving linear complexity, enabling efficient global information modeling. Nevertheless, Linear Attention suffers from a significant performance degradation compared to standard Softmax Attention. In this paper, we analyze the underlying causes of this issue based on the formulation of Linear Attention. We find that, unlike Softmax Attention, Linear Attention entirely disregards the magnitude information of the Query(Q or \\phi(Q)). The absence of magnitude information prevents the attention score distribution from dynamically adapting as the Query scales. As a result, despite its structural similarity to Softmax Attention, Linear Attention exhibits a significantly different attention score distribution. Based on this observation, we propose **Magnitude-Aware Linear Attention** (MALA), which modifies the computation of Linear Attention to fully incorporate the Query's magnitude. This adjustment allows MALA to generate an attention score distribution that closely resembles Softmax Attention while exhibiting a more well-balanced structure. As a result, MALA surpasses Softmax Attention in performance while maintaining only linear complexity. We build Magnitude-Aware Vision Transformer (MAViT) based on MALA, achieving **84.7%** accuracy on ImageNet-1K with only **27M** parameters and **4.6G** flops, without using any additional data or labels.

In this paper, we aim to expand the scope of computer vision to include the novel task of inferring the hidden liquid levels of opaque containers by sensing the tiny vibrations on their surfaces. Our method provides a first-of-a-kind way to inspect the fill level of multiple sealed containers remotely, at once, without needing physical manipulation and manual weighing. First, we propose a novel speckle-based vibration sensing system for simultaneously capturing scene vibrations on a 2D grid of points. We use our system to efficiently and remotely capture a dataset of vibration responses for a variety of everyday liquid containers. Then, we develop a transformer-based approach for analyzing the captured vibrations and classifying the container type and its hidden liquid level at the time of measurement. Our architecture is invariant to the vibration source, yielding correct liquid level estimates for controlled and ambient scene sound sources. Moreover, our model generalizes to unseen container instances within known classes (e.g., training on five Coke cans of a six-pack, testing on a sixth) and fluid levels.

Although recent self-training approaches achieve promising results, they fail to address three critical biases: distribution bias, training bias, and confirmation bias. Therefore, we propose a Debiased Teacher to address the above biases from three aspects: domain transforming, representation compensating, and pseudo label calibrating. Concretely, the day-to-night domain transforming module (DNDT) leverages physical priors to model some key day-night domain differences, thus transforming daytime images into night-like images. Then, the cross-domain representation compensating module (CDRC) selectively mixes objects from nighttime and night-like images to compensate for the model's general representation of nighttime objects. Further, to correct confirmation bias caused by learning from inaccurate pseudo labels, the pseudo label confirmation calibrating module (ConCal) is designed to obtain accurate pseudo labels for better nighttime knowledge learning.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Spatiotemporal forecasting tasks, such as traffic flow, combustion dynamics, and weather forecasting, often require complex models that suffer from low training efficiency and high memory consumption. This paper proposes a lightweight framework, Spectral Decoupled Knowledge Distillation, which transfers the multi-scale spatiotemporal representations from a complex teacher model to a more efficient lightweight student network. The teacher model follows an encoder-latent evolution-decoder architecture, where its latent evolution module decouples high-frequency details (e.g., instant traffic fluctuations) and low-frequency trends (e.g. long-term weather evolution) using convolution (local high-frequency extractor) and Transformer (global low-frequency modeler). However, the multi-layer convolution and deconvolution structures result in slow training and high memory usage. To address these issues, we propose a frequency-aligned knowledge distillation strategy, which extracts multi-scale spectral features from the teacher's latent space, including high and low frequency components, to guide the lightweight student model (e.g., ResNet, U-Net) in capturing both local fine-grained variations and global evolution patterns. Experiments show that the student model achieves over 95% of the teacher's forecasting accuracy while using only 20%-30% of its memory, with training speed improved by more than 50%. Our theoretical analysis reveals that the frequency-domain decoupling enables the student model to capture long-range dependencies without the need for complex structures. The frequency-aligned distillation mechanism further mitigates the inherent bias of lightweight models in cross-scale spatiotemporal dynamics modeling. This framework offers an effective and general solution for high-accuracy spatiotemporal forecasting in resource-constrained scenarios",

Existing methods often rely on additional models or annotations to learn robust, clothing-invariant features, making them resource-intensive. In contrast, we explore the use of color --specifically foreground and background colors--as a lightweight, annotation-free proxy for mitigating appearance bias in ReID models. We propose Colors See, Colors Ignore (CSCI), an RGB-only method that leverages color information directly from raw images or video frames. CSCI efficiently captures color-related appearance bias ('Color See') while disentangling it from identity-relevant ReID features ('Color Ignore'). To achieve this, we introduce S2A self-attention, a novel self-attention to prevent information leak between color and identity cues within the feature space. Our analysis shows a strong correspondence between learned color embeddings and clothing attributes, validating color as an effective proxy when explicit clothing labels are unavailable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CSCI on both image and video ReID with extensive experiments on four CC-ReID datasets. We improve the baseline by Top-1 2.9% on LTCC and 5.0% on PRCC for image-based ReID, and 1.0% on CCVID and 2.5% on MeVID for video-based ReID without relying on additional supervision.

In essence, our method produces an IMU-like measurement that robustly captures fast and aggressive camera movements.

In contrast, I2V methods are limited by their dependence on real images, which restricts the editability of the synthesized content. Although some methods incorporate ControlNet to introduce image-based conditioning, they often lack explicit motion control and require computationally expensive training. To address these limitations, we propose AnyI2V, a training-free framework that animates any conditional images with user-defined motion trajectories. AnyI2V supports a broader range of modalities as the conditional image, including data types such as meshes and point clouds that are not supported by ControlNet, enabling more flexible and versatile video generation. Additionally, it supports mixed conditional inputs and enables style transfer and editing via LoRA and text prompts.

Motion generation models focus on creating diverse, realistic motions from inputs like text, audio, or keyframes, while motion estimation models aim to reconstruct accurate motion trajectories from observations like videos.

We present GENMO, a unified Generalist Model for Human Motion that bridges motion estimation and generation in a single framework. Our key insight is to reformulate motion estimation as constrained motion generation, where the output motion must precisely satisfy observed conditioning signals. Leveraging the synergy between regression and diffusion, GENMO achieves accurate global motion estimation while enabling diverse motion generation. We also introduce an estimation-guided training objective that exploits in-the-wild videos with 2D annotations and text descriptions to enhance generative diversity. Furthermore, our novel architecture handles variable-length motions and mixed multimodal conditions (text, audio, video) at different time intervals, offering flexible control. This unified approach creates synergistic benefits: generative priors improve estimated motions under challenging conditions like occlusions, while diverse video data enhances generation capabilities.

The spatially sequential arrangement of adjacent MRI slices provides valuable information that enhances segmentation continuity and accuracy, yet this characteristic remains underutilized in many existing models. The spatial correlations between adjacent MRI slices can be regarded as \"temporal-like\" data, similar to frame sequences in video segmentation tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose M-Net, a flexible framework specifically designed for sequential image segmentation. M-Net introduces the novel Mesh-Cast mechanism, which seamlessly integrates arbitrary sequential models into the processing of both channel and temporal information, thereby systematically capturing the inherent \"temporal-like\" spatial correlations between MRI slices and ensuring consistent segmentation across sequences. Additionally, we define an MRI sequential input pattern and design a Two-Phase Sequential (TPS) training strategy, which first focuses on learning common patterns across sequences before refining slice-specific feature extraction. This approach leverages temporal modeling techniques to preserve volumetric contextual information while avoiding the high computational cost of full 3D convolutions, thereby enhancing the generalizability and robustness of M-Net in sequential segmentation tasks. Experiments on the BraTS2019 and BraTS2023 datasets demonstrate that M-Net outperforms existing methods across all key metrics, establishing itself as a robust solution for temporally-aware MRI tumor segmentation",

To improve prediction accuracy, we design a cross-modal relationship fusion mechanism that effectively integrates predictions from different experts. Under the implicit supervision provided by cross-modal identity correspondences, collaborative and consistent learning among the experts is encouraged, significantly enhancing the model's ability to extract modality-invariant features and improve cross-modal identity recognition.

These methods typically require at least a parametric form of the degradation model. However, in real-world scenarios, the degradation may be too complex to define explicitly without relying on crude approximations. To handle this general case, we introduce the DIffusion Image Prior (DIIP). We take inspiration from the Deep Image Prior (DIP), since it can be used to remove artifacts without the need for an explicit degradation model. However, in contrast to DIP, we find that pretrained diffusion models offer a much stronger prior, despite being trained without knowledge from corrupted data. We show that, the optimization process in DIIP first reconstructs a clean version of the image before eventually overfitting to the degraded input, but it does so for a broader range of degradations than DIP. In light of this result, we propose a blind image restoration (IR) method based on early stopping, which does not require prior knowledge of the degradation model.

    "abstract": "Parameter-level model merging is an emerging paradigm in multi-task learning with significant promise. Previous research has explored its connections with prediction-level model ensembling--commonly viewed as the upper bound for merging--to reveal the potential of achieving performance consistency between the two. However, this observation relies on certain preconditions, such as being limited to two models, using ViT-based models, and all models are fine-tuned from the same pre-trained checkpoint. To further understand the intrinsic connections between these two paradigms, this paper explores an interesting possibility: If these restrictions are removed, can performance consistency still be achieved between merging and ensembling? To answer this question, we first theoretically establish a performance correlation between merging and ensembling. We find that even when previous restrictions are not met, there is still a way for model merging to attain a near-identical and superior performance similar to that of ensembling. To verify whether our findings are practical, we introduce a validation framework termed \\underline Neu ral \\underline Lig and (NeuLig). The learning process of NeuLig is meticulously designed with a specialized loss function supported by theoretical foundations. Experimental results demonstrate the robust resilience of NeuLig in terms of both model scale and the number of collaborating models. For instance, for the case involving 5 CLIP-ViT-B/32 models, parameter-level merging achieves the same performance as prediction-level ensembling (merging: 95.44% vs. ensembling: 95.46%)",

    "abstract": "Polarization has found applications in various computer vision tasks by providing additional physical cues. However, due to the limitations of current imaging systems, polarimetric parameters are typically stored in discrete form, which is non-differentiable and limits their applicability in polarization-based vision. While current neural field methods have shown promise for continuous signal reconstruction, they struggle to model the intrinsic physical interdependencies among polarimetric parameters. In this work, we propose a physics-grounded representation scheme to represent polarimetric parameters as a unified complex-valued wave. Tailored to this scheme, we propose a tuning-free fitting strategy along with a lightweight complex-valued neural network, enabling property-preserved reconstruction. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and facilitates smooth polarized image rendering and flexible resolution adjustments",

    "abstract": "In recent years, Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS) has been largely advanced. However, existing methods mostly rely on a pre-trained vision-language model (e.g., CLIP) and require a predefined set of classes to guide the semantic segmentation process during the inference. This not only narrows the application scenario but also constrains comprehension within a finite vocabulary. To overcome this, we reformulate OVSS as a text generation task and propose the CLIP-adapted Region-to-Text Network (CRTNet) that achieves vocabulary-free OVSS by generating category names and descriptions upon segmentation masks. The training process consists of two steps to ensure an accurate and detailed interpretation of the masked regions: (i) the initial step adapts CLIP visual features to mask-level proposal features using binarized masks extracted by a trained mask extractor, and (ii) the subsequent step involves selecting and aggregating these features to become text-aware by integrating CLIP text embeddings, effectively aligning visual data with corresponding linguistic data to facilitate region-to-text learning. Furthermore, we introduce a series of parsing and filtering techniques to integrate multiple sources of training data to improve the generalization ability of our model. Experiments demonstrate that our model not only excels in OVSS but also exhibits scalability and can be adapted to various foundation models (e.g., SAM) without being retrained",

Existing methods primarily predict where drivers look by generating spatial heatmaps, but fail to capture the cognitive motivations behind attention allocation in specific contexts, which limits deeper understanding of attention mechanisms. To bridge this gap, we introduce Explainable Driver Attention Prediction, a novel task paradigm that jointly predicts spatial attention regions (where), parses attended semantics (what), and provides cognitive reasoning for attention allocation (why). To support this, we present W3DA, the first large-scale explainable driver attention dataset. It enriches existing benchmarks with detailed semantic and causal annotations across diverse driving scenarios, including normal conditions, safety-critical situations, and traffic accidents. We further propose LLada, a Large Language model-driven framework for driver attention prediction, which unifies pixel modeling, semantic parsing, and cognitive reasoning within an end-to-end architecture. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LLada, exhibiting robust generalization across datasets and driving conditions. This work serves as a key step toward a deeper understanding of driver attention mechanisms, with significant implications for autonomous driving, intelligent driver training, and human-computer interaction",

This approach processes meshes into a sequence composed of vertices and then generates them vertex by vertex, similar to how a language model generates text. These methods have achieved some success but still struggle to generate complex meshes. One primary reason for this limitation is their inefficient tokenization methods. To address this issue, we introduce MeshAnything V2, an advanced mesh generation model designed to create Artist-Created Meshes that align precisely with specified shapes. A key innovation behind MeshAnything V2 is our novel Adjacent Mesh Tokenization (AMT) method. Unlike traditional approaches that represent each face using three vertices, AMT optimizes this by employing a single vertex wherever feasible, effectively reducing the token sequence length by about half on average. This not only streamlines the tokenization process but also results in more compact and well-structured sequences, enhancing the efficiency of mesh generation. With these improvements, MeshAnything V2 effectively doubles the face limit compared to previous models, delivering superior performance without increasing computational costs. Our extensive experiments across various mesh tokenization methods demonstrate that AMT is pivotal in achieving optimal results in both efficiency and performance",

This enables us to more efficiently compare certain semantic dynamics, such as the shift from an original and fine-tuned model, revealing concept alteration and potential biases that may occur during fine-tuning. We also demonstrate the use of shift vectors to capture these concepts changes. These shift vectors allow us to recover fine-tuned concepts by applying simple, computationally inexpensive additive concept shifts in the original model. Finally, our findings also have direct applications for MLLM steering, which can be used for model debiasing as well as enforcing safety in MLLM output.

    "abstract": "Digital orthodontics represents a prominent and critical application of computer vision technology in the medical field. So far, the labor-intensive process of collecting clinical data, particularly in acquiring paired 3D orthodontic teeth models, constitutes a crucial bottleneck for developing tooth arrangement neural networks. Although numerous general 3D shape generation methods have been proposed, most of them focus on single-object generation and are insufficient for generating anatomically structured teeth models, each comprising 24-32 segmented teeth. In this paper, we propose TeethGenerator, a novel two-stage framework designed to synthesize paired 3D teeth models pre- and post-orthodontic, aiming to facilitate the training of downstream tooth arrangement networks. Specifically, our approach consists of two key modules: (1) a teeth shape generation module that leverages a diffusion model to learn the distribution of morphological characteristics of teeth, enabling the generation of diverse post-orthodontic teeth models; and (2) a teeth style generation module that synthesizes corresponding pre-orthodontic teeth models by incorporating desired styles as conditional inputs. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our synthetic dataset aligns closely with the distribution of real orthodontic data, and promotes tooth alignment performance significantly when combined with real data for training.

Existing approaches for this challenging task only utilize local patch-level features to fuse with text feature, ignoring the important influence of the global image-level feature. In this paper, we propose a universal strategy that can exploit both local patch-level features and global image-level feature simultaneously. Specifically, to improve the localization ability of VLMs, we propose Text-guided Local Ranking. Depending on the prior knowledge that foreground patches have higher similarity with the text prompt, a new local-text rank loss is designed to increase the differences between the similarity scores of foreground and background patches which push foreground and background patches apart. To enhance the counting ability of VLMs, Number-evoked Global Attention is introduced to first align global image-level feature with multiple number-conditioned text prompts. Then, the one with the highest similarity is selected to compute cross-attention with the global image-level feature. Through extensive experiments on widely used datasets and methods, the proposed approach has demonstrated superior advancements in performance, generalization, and scalability.

Recent work leverages multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to improve retrieval, especially for long or complex query-candidate pairs. However, we observe that the naive application of MLLMs, i.e., retrieval based on candidate likelihood, introduces candidate prior bias, favoring candidates with inherently higher priors over those more relevant to the query. To this end, we propose a novel retrieval framework, Bidirectional Likelihood Estimation with MLLM (BLiM), which leverages both query and candidate likelihoods by training the model to generate text from a given video as well as video features from a given text. Furthermore, we introduce Candidate Prior Normalization (CPN), a simple yet effective training-free score calibration module designed to mitigate candidate prior bias in candidate likelihood. On four Text-Video Retrieval benchmarks, our BLiM equipped with CPN outperforms previous state-of-the-art models by 6.4 R@1 on average, effectively alleviating candidate prior bias and emphasizing query-candidate relevance. Our in-depth analysis across various multi-modal tasks beyond retrieval highlights the broad applicability of CPN which enhances visual understanding by reducing reliance on textual priors.

    "abstract": "Mamba has shown great potential for computer vision due to its linear complexity in modeling the global context with respect to the input length. However, existing lightweight Mamba-based backbones cannot demonstrate performance that matches Convolution or Transformer-based methods. By observing, we find that simply modifying the scanning path in the image domain is not conducive to fully exploiting the potential of vision Mamba. In this paper, we first perform comprehensive spectral and quantitative analyses, and verify that the Mamba block mainly models low-frequency information under Convolution-Mamba hybrid architecture. Based on the analyses, we introduce a novel Laplace mixer to decouple the features in terms of frequency and input only the low-frequency components into the Mamba block. In addition, considering the redundancy of the features and the different requirements for high-frequency details and low-frequency global information at different stages, we introduce a frequency ramp inception, i.e., gradually reduce the input dimensions of the high-frequency branches, so as to efficiently trade-off the high-frequency and low-frequency components at different layers. By integrating mobile-friendly convolution and efficient Laplace mixer, we build a series of tiny hybrid vision Mamba called TinyViM. The proposed TinyViM achieves impressive performance on several downstream tasks including image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection and instance segmentation. In particular, TinyViM outperforms Convolution, Transformer and Mamba-based models with similar scales, and the throughput is about 2-3 times higher than that of other Mamba-based models. The good balance between the efficiency and performance of TinyViM shows that a properly designed and optimized vision mamba can achieve high performance with a small model size.

Although existing DG techniques, such as data manipulation, learning strategies, and representation learning, have shown significant progress, they predominantly address single-modal data. With the emergence of numerous multi-modal datasets and increasing demand for multi-modal tasks, a key challenge in Multi-modal Domain Generalization (MMDG) has emerged: enabling models trained on multi-modal sources to generalize to unseen target distributions within the same modality set. Due to the inherent differences between modalities, directly transferring methods from single-modal DG to MMDG typically yields sub-optimal results. These methods often exhibit randomness during generalization due to the invisibility of target domains and fail to consider inter-modal consistency. Applying these methods independently to each modality in the MMDG setting before combining them can lead to divergent generalization directions across different modalities, resulting in degraded generalization capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that leverages Unified Representations to map different paired modalities together, effectively adapting DG methods to MMDG by enabling synchronized multi-modal improvements within the unified space. Additionally, we introduce a supervised disentanglement framework that separates modal-general and modal-specific information, further enhancing the alignment of unified representations.

However, existing metrics compare generated images against ground truth target views, which is not suitable for generative tasks where multiple solutions exist while differing from ground truth. Furthermore, different MVGs are trained on different view angles, synthetic data and specific lightings robustness to these factors and generalization to real data are rarely evaluated thoroughly. Without a rigorous evaluation protocol, it is also unclear what design choices contribute to the progress of MVGs. MVGBench evaluates three different aspects: best setup performance, generalization to real data and robustness. Instead of comparing against ground truth, we introduce a novel 3D self-consistency metric which compares 3D reconstructions from disjoint generated multi-views. We systematically compare 12 existing MVGs on 4 different curated real and synthetic datasets. With our analysis, we identify important limitations of existing methods specially in terms of robustness and generalization, and we find the most critical design choices.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Diffusion models have shown remarkable success across generative tasks, yet their high computational demands challenge deployment on resource-limited platforms. This paper investigates a critical question for compute-optimal diffusion model deployment: Under a post-training setting without fine-tuning, is it more effective to reduce the number of denoising steps or to use a cheaper per-step inference? Intuitively, reducing the number of denoising steps increases the variability of the distributions across steps, making the model more sensitive to compression. In contrast, keeping more denoising steps makes the differences smaller, preserving redundancy, and making post-training compression more feasible. To systematically examine this, we propose PostDiff, a training-free framework for accelerating pre-trained diffusion models by reducing redundancy at both the input level and module level in a post-training manner. At the input level, we propose a mixed-resolution denoising scheme based on the insight that reducing generation resolution in early denoising steps can enhance low-frequency components and improve final generation fidelity. At the module level, we employ a hybrid module caching strategy to reuse computations across denoising steps. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that (1) PostDiff can significantly improve the fidelity-efficiency trade-off of state-of-the-art diffusion models, and (2) to boost efficiency while maintaining decent generation fidelity, reducing per-step inference cost is often more effective than reducing the number of denoising steps.

    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have significantly advanced the field of computer vision. To improve DNN training process, knowledge distillation methods demonstrate their effectiveness in accelerating network training by introducing a fixed learning direction from the teacher network to student networks. In this context, several distillation-based optimization strategies are proposed, e.g., deep mutual learning and self-distillation, as an attempt to achieve generic training performance enhancement through the cooperative training of multiple networks. However, such strategies achieve limited improvements due to the poor understanding of the impact of learning directions among networks across different iterations. In this paper, we propose a novel competitive distillation strategy that allows each network in a group to potentially act as a teacher based on its performance, enhancing the overall learning performance. Competitive distillation organizes a group of networks to perform a shared task and engage in competition, where competitive optimization is proposed to improve the parameter updating process. We further introduce stochastic perturbation in competitive distillation, aiming to motivate networks to induce mutations to achieve better visual representations and global optimum. The experimental results show that competitive distillation achieves promising performance in diverse tasks and datasets",

    "abstract": "Blind Face Restoration aims to recover high-fidelity, detail-rich facial images from unknown degraded inputs, presenting significant challenges in preserving both identity and detail. Pre-trained diffusion models have been increasingly used as image priors to generate fine details. Still, existing methods often use fixed diffusion sampling timesteps and a global guidance scale, assuming uniform degradation. This limitation and potentially imperfect degradation kernel estimation frequently lead to under- or over-diffusion, resulting in an imbalance between fidelity and quality. We propose DynFaceRestore, a novel blind face restoration approach that learns to map any blindly degraded input to Gaussian blurry images. By leveraging these blurry images and their respective Gaussian kernels, we dynamically select the starting timesteps for each blurry image and apply closed-form guidance during the diffusion sampling process to maintain fidelity. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic guidance scaling adjuster that modulates the guidance strength across local regions, enhancing detail generation in complex areas while preserving structural fidelity in contours. This strategy effectively balances the trade-off between fidelity and quality. DynFaceRestore achieves state-of-the-art performance in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, demonstrating robustness and effectiveness in blind face restoration",

Unlike existing optical flow methods, our approach corresponds one frame to hundreds of subsequent frames, rather than just the next frame. We develop a new architecture for this task, blending techniques from existing work in optical flow and point tracking: the model performs iterative inference on low-resolution grids of correspondence estimates, propagating information spatially via 2D convolution layers, and propagating information temporally via pixel-aligned attention layers. The model is fast and parameter-efficient (16 million parameters), and delivers state-of-the-art point tracking accuracy at high resolution (i.e., tracking 768x1024 pixels, on a 40G GPU). A benefit of our design is that we can train jointly on optical flow datasets and point tracking datasets, and we find that doing so is crucial for top performance.

In 1st stage, Gaussian representation learner utilizes self-supervised pretraining to learn robust Gaussian representation. Gaussian representation integrates semantic and geometric information and establishes a robust probabilistic understanding of the environment. In 2nd stage, GWM seamlessly integrates learning, simulation, and planning into a unified framework, empowering the uncertainty-aware simulator & planner to jointly forecast future scene evolutions and vehicle trajectories. Simulator generates future scene predictions by modeling both static and dynamic elements, while planner calculates optimal paths to minimize collision risks, thus enhancing navigation safety. Overall, GWM employs a sensor-to-planning world model that directly processes raw sensor data, setting it apart from previous methods. Experiments show that GWM outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by 1.46% in semantic comprehension and 0.07m in motion prediction.

    "abstract": "Edges are one of the most basic parametric primitives to describe structural information in 3D. In this paper, we study parametric 3D edge reconstruction from calibrated multi-view images. Previous methods usually reconstruct a 3D edge point set from multi-view 2D edge images, and then fit 3D edges to the point set. However, noise in the point set may cause gaps among fitted edges, and the recovered edges may not align with input multi-view images since the edge fitting depends only on the reconstructed 3D point set. To mitigate these problems, we propose SketchSplat, a method to reconstruct accurate, complete, and compact 3D edges via differentiable multi-view sketch splatting. We represent 3D edges as sketches, which are parametric lines and curves defined by attributes including control points, scales, and opacity. During reconstruction, we iteratively sample Gaussian points from a set of sketches and rasterize the Gaussians onto 2D edge images. Then the gradient of the image loss can be back-propagated to optimize the sketch attributes. Our method bridges 2D edge images and 3D edges in a differentiable manner, which ensures that 3D edges align well with 2D images and leads to accurate and complete results. We also propose a series of adaptive topological operations to reduce redundant edges and apply them along with the sketch optimization, yielding a more compact reconstruction. Finally, we contribute an accurate 2D edge detector that improves the performance of both ours and existing methods.

    "abstract": "In this work, we present DreamDance, a novel method for animating human images using only skeleton pose sequences as conditional inputs. Existing approaches struggle with generating coherent, high-quality content in an efficient and user-friendly manner. Concretely, baseline methods relying on only 2D pose guidance lack the cues of 3D information like depth and normal maps, leading to suboptimal results. Other works introduce extra representations to provide additional 3D information but inevitably involve a cumbersome and time-intensive process. To address these limitations, DreamDance enriches 3D geometry cues from 2D poses by introducing an efficient diffusion model, enabling high-quality human image animation with various guidance. Our key insight is that human images naturally exhibit multiple levels of correlation, progressing from coarse skeleton poses to fine-grained geometry cues, and further from these geometry cues to explicit appearance details. Capturing such correlations could enrich the guidance signals, facilitating intra-frame coherency and inter-frame consistency. Specifically, we construct the TikTok-Dance5K dataset, comprising 5K high-quality dance videos with detailed frame annotations, including human pose, depth, and normal maps. Next, we introduce a Mutually Aligned Geometry Diffusion Model to generate fine-grained depth and normal maps for enriched guidance. Finally, a Cross-domain Controller incorporates multi-level guidance to animate human images effectively with a video diffusion model.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Human motion estimation models typically assume a fixed number of input frames, making them sensitive to variations in frame rate and leading to inconsistent motion predictions across different temporal resolutions. This limitation arises because input frame rates inherently determine the temporal granularity of motion capture, causing discrepancies when models trained on a specific frame rate encounter different sampling frequencies. To address this challenge, we propose MBTI (Masked Blending Transformers with Implicit Positional Encoding), a frame rate-agnostic human motion estimation framework designed to maintain temporal consistency across varying input frame rates. Our approach leverages a masked autoencoder (MAE) architecture with masked token blending, which aligns input tokens with a predefined high-reference frame rate, ensuring a standardized temporal representation. Additionally, we introduce implicit positional encoding, which encodes absolute time information using neural implicit functions, enabling more natural motion reconstruction beyond discrete sequence indexing. By reconstructing motion at a high reference frame rate and optional downsampling, MBTI ensures both frame rate generalization and temporal consistency. To comprehensively evaluate MBTI, we introduce EMDB-FPS, an augmented benchmark designed to assess motion estimation robustness across multiple frame rates in both local and global motion estimation tasks. To further assess MBTI's robustness, we introduce the Motion Consistency across Frame rates (MCF), a novel metric to quantify the deviation of motion predictions across different input frame rates. Our results demonstrate that MBTI outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both motion accuracy and temporal consistency, achieving the most stable and consistent motion predictions across varying frame rates",

Unlike existing works that utilize many reference images and have large network parameters, we directly match points based on the multi-view information between the query and reference images with a lightweight network. Thanks to our reference image fusion strategy, we significantly decrease the number of reference images, thus decreasing the time needed to process these images and the memory required to store them. Furthermore, with our lightweight network, our method requires less inference time. Though with fewer reference images, experiments on seven core datasets in the BOP challenge show that our method achieves comparable results with other methods that require more reference images and larger network parameters",

In this work, we review the limitations of existing pipelines and address the research question: Can we leverage physical audio-visual associations to enhance neural acoustic synthesis? We introduce Physics-Integrated Audio-Visual Acoustic Synthesis (PI-AVAS or \\pi-AVAS), a novel framework designed with two key objectives. i) Generalization: We develop a vision-guided audio simulation framework that leverages physics-based sound propagation. By explicitly modeling vision-grounded geometry and sound rays, our approach achieves robust performance across diverse visual environments. ii) Realism: While simulation-based approaches offer generalizability, they often compromise on realism. To mitigate this, we incorporate a second stage for data-centric refinement, where we propose a flow matching-based audio refinement model to narrow the gap between simulation and real-world audio-visual scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on the RWAVS-Gen, RWAVS, and RAF datasets.

    "abstract": "Affordance, defined as the potential actions that an object offers, is crucial for embodied AI agents. For example, such knowledge directs an agent to grasp a knife by the handle for cutting or by the blade for safe handover. While existing approaches have made notable progress, affordance research still faces three key challenges: data scarcity, poor generalization, and real-world deployment. Specifically, there is a lack of large-scale affordance datasets with precise segmentation maps, existing models struggle to generalize across different domains or novel object and affordance classes, and little work demonstrates deployability in real-world scenarios. In this work, we address these issues by proposing a complete affordance learning system that (1) takes in egocentric videos and outputs precise affordance annotations without human labeling, (2) leverages geometric information and vision foundation models to improve generalization, and (3) introduces a framework that facilitates affordance-oriented robotic manipulation such as tool grasping and robot-to-human tool handover. Experimental results show that our model surpasses the state-of-the-art by 13.8% in mIoU, and the framework achieves 77.1% successful grasping among 179 trials, including evaluations on seen, unseen classes, and cluttered scenes.

    "abstract": "While diffusion models have demonstrated significant success in standard dynamic range (SDR) image synthesis, generating high dynamic range (HDR) images with higher luminance and broader color gamuts remains challenging. This arises primarily from two factors: (1) The incompatibility between pretrained SDR image auto-encoders and the high-bit-depth HDR images; (2) The lack of large-scale HDR image datasets for effective learning and supervision. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for HDR image generation with two key innovations: (1) Decomposed HDR Image Generation: We leverage a double-layer HDR image format to decompose the HDR image into two low-bit-depth components: an SDR image with a corresponding Gain Map (GM).This format is inherently compatible with pretrained SDR auto-encoders, motivating the decomposition of HDR image generation into SDR image and GM prediction. (2) Unsupervised Data Construction: We develop an automated pipeline to construct \"Text-SDR-GM\" triplets from large-scale text-image datasets by brightness-aware compression and gamut-constrained reduction, enabling unsupervised learning of GMs without ground-truth data. Building upon these innovations, we adapt the Stable Diffusion model to jointly predict GMs and SDR images, enabling high-quality decomposed HDR image generation.

    "abstract": "Deep functional maps have recently emerged as a powerful tool for solving non-rigid shape correspondence tasks. Methods that use this approach combine the power and flexibility of the functional map framework, with data-driven learning for improved accuracy and generality. However, most existing methods in this area restrict the learning aspect only to the feature functions and still rely on axiomatic modeling for formulating the training loss or for functional map regularization inside the networks. This limits both the accuracy and the applicability of the resulting approaches only to scenarios where assumptions of the axiomatic models hold. In this work, we show, for the first time, that both in-network regularization and functional map training can be replaced with data-driven methods. For this, we first train a generative model of functional maps in the spectral domain using score-based generative modeling, built from a large collection of high-quality maps. We then exploit the resulting model to promote the structural properties of ground truth functional maps on new shape collections. Remarkably, we demonstrate that the learned models are category-agnostic, and can fully replace commonly used strategies such as enforcing Laplacian commutativity or orthogonality of functional maps. Our key technical contribution is a novel distillation strategy from diffusion models in the spectral domain. Experiments demonstrate that our learned regularization leads to better results than axiomatic approaches for zero-shot non-rigid shape matching.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We present MoGA, a novel method to reconstruct high-fidelity 3D Gaussian avatars from a single-view image. The main challenge lies in inferring unseen appearance and geometric details while ensuring 3D consistency and realism. Most previous methods rely on 2D diffusion models to synthesize unseen views; however, these generated views are sparse and inconsistent, resulting in unrealistic 3D artifacts and blurred appearance. To address these limitations, we leverage a generative avatar model, that can generate diverse 3D avatars by sampling deformed Gaussians from a learned prior distribution. Due to limited 3D training data, such a 3D model alone cannot capture all image details of unseen identities. Consequently, we integrate it as a prior, ensuring 3D consistency by projecting input images into its latent space and enforcing additional 3D appearance and geometric constraints. Our novel approach formulates Gaussian avatar creation as model inversion by fitting the generative avatar to synthetic views from 2D diffusion models. The generative avatar provides an initialization for model fitting, enforces 3D regularization, and helps in refining pose. Experiments show that our method surpasses state-of-the-art techniques and generalizes well to real-world scenarios. Our Gaussian avatars are also inherently animatable.

This task poses several challenges, such as the need for semantic frame-level alignment and modeling complex dependencies between query and target videos. To tackle this challenging problem, we introduce MATR (Moment Alignment TRansformer), a transformer-based model designed to capture semantic context as well as the temporal details necessary for precise moment localization. MATR conditions target video representations on query video features using dual-stage sequence alignment that encodes the required correlations and dependencies. These representations are then used to guide foreground/background classification and boundary prediction heads, enabling the model to accurately identify moments in the target video that semantically match with the query video. Additionally, to provide a strong task-specific initialization for MATR, we propose a self-supervised pre-training technique that involves training the model to localize random clips within videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MATR achieves notable performance improvements of 13.1% in R@1 and 8.1% in mIoU on an absolute scale compared to state-of-the-art methods on the popular ActivityNet-VRL dataset.

    "abstract": "The advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has advanced 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. With the growing interest of interactive applications that need immediate feedback, online 3DGS reconstruction in real-time is in high demand. However, none of existing methods yet meet the demand due to three main challenges: the absence of predetermined camera parameters, the need for generalizable 3DGS optimization, and the necessity of reducing redundancy. We propose StreamGS, an online generalizable 3DGS reconstruction method for unposed image streams, which progressively transform image streams to 3D Gaussian streams by predicting and aggregating per-frame Gaussians. Our method overcomes the limitation of the initial point reconstruction in tackling out-of-domain (OOD) issues by introducing a content adaptive refinement. The refinement enhances cross-frame consistency by establishing reliable pixel correspondences between adjacent frames. Such correspondences further aid in merging redundant Gaussians through cross-frame feature aggregation. The density of Gaussians is thereby reduced, empowering online reconstruction by significantly lowering computational and memory costs. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets have demonstrated that StreamGS achieves quality on par with optimization-based approaches but does so 150 times faster, and exhibits superior generalizability in handling OOD scenes",

Existing adversarial perturbation methods for object detection are either limited to attacking CNN-based detectors or weak against transformer-based detectors. This paper presents an Attention-Focused Offensive Gradient (AFOG) attack against object detection transformers. By design, AFOG is neural-architecture agnostic and effective for attacking both large transformer-based object detectors and conventional CNN-based detectors with a unified adversarial attention framework. This paper makes three original contributions. First, AFOG utilizes a learnable attention mechanism that focuses perturbations on vulnerable image regions in multi-box detection tasks, increasing performance over non-attention baselines by up to 30.6%. Second, AFOG's attack loss is formulated by integrating two types of feature loss through learnable attention updates with iterative injection of adversarial perturbations. Finally, AFOG is an efficient and stealthy adversarial perturbation method. It probes the weak spots of detection transformers by adding strategically generated and visually imperceptible perturbations which can cause well-trained object detection models to fail. Extensive experiments conducted with twelve large detection transformers on COCO demonstrate the efficacy of AFOG. Our empirical results also show that AFOG outperforms existing attacks on transformer-based and CNN-based object detectors by up to 83% with superior speed and imperceptibility.

However, this clean set often becomes dominated by easy examples, limiting the model's meaningful exposure to more challenging cases and reducing its expressive power. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel metric called Dynamic Center Distance (DCD), which can quantify sample difficulty and provide information that critically complements loss values. Unlike approaches that rely on predictions, DCD is computed in feature space as the distance between sample features and a dynamically updated center, established through a proposed meta-learning framework. Building on preliminary semi-supervised training that captures fundamental data patterns, we incorporate DCD to further refine the classification loss, down-weighting well-classified examples and strategically focusing training on a sparse set of hard instances. This strategy prevents easy examples from dominating the classifier, leading to more robust learning.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Unsupervised object discovery (UOD) aims to detect and segment objects in 2D images without handcrafted annotations. Recent progress in self-supervised representation learning has led to some success in UOD algorithms. However, the absence of ground truth provides existing UOD methods with two challenges: 1) determining if a discovered region is foreground or background, and 2) knowing how many objects remain undiscovered. To address these two problems, previous solutions rely on foreground priors to distinguish if the discovered region is foreground, and conduct one or fixed iterations of discovery. However, the existing foreground priors are heuristic and not always robust, and a fixed number of discoveries leads to under or over-segmentation, since the number of objects in images varies. This paper introduces UnionCut, a robust and well-grounded foreground prior based on min-cut and ensemble methods that detects the union of foreground areas of an image, allowing UOD algorithms to identify foreground objects and stop discovery once the majority of the foreground union in the image is segmented. In addition, we propose UnionSeg, a distilled transformer of UnionCut that outputs the foreground union more efficiently and accurately. Our experiments show that by combining with UnionCut or UnionSeg, previous state-of-the-art UOD methods witness an increase in the performance of single object discovery, saliency detection and self-supervised instance segmentation on various benchmarks.

In this paper, aligned with the sensory-decision-motor (SDM) flow of the human brain, we propose a real-time 3D crowd evacuation simulation framework that integrates a 3D-adaptive SFM (Social Force Model) Decision Mechanism and a Personalized Gait Control Motor.

In this work, we introduce a multilingual sign language model, Signs as Tokens (SOKE), which can generate 3D sign avatars autoregressively from text inputs using a pretrained LM. To align sign language with the LM, we leverage a decoupled tokenizer that discretizes continuous signs into token sequences representing various body parts. During decoding, unlike existing approaches that flatten all part-wise tokens into a single sequence and predict one token at a time, we propose a multi-head decoding method capable of predicting multiple tokens simultaneously. This approach improves inference efficiency while maintaining effective information fusion across different body parts.

    "abstract": "Zero-shot depth completion with metric scales poses significant challenges, primarily due to performance limitations such as domain specificity and sensor characteristics. One recent emerging solution is to integrate monocular depth foundation models into depth completion frameworks, yet these efforts still face issues with suboptimal performance and often require further adaptation to the target task. Surprisingly, we find that a simple test-time training, which fine-tunes monocular depth foundation models on sparse depth measurements from sensors just as it is, yields reasonable results. However, this test-time training obviously incurs high computational costs and introduces biases towards specific conditions, making it impractical for real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a new approach toward parameter-efficient zero-shot depth completion. Our key idea of this work is to leverage visual prompt tuning, achieving sensor-specific depth scale adaptation without forgetting foundational knowledge. Experimental results on diverse datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms relevant state-of-the-art methods, showing superior generalization and efficiency.

However, prior GUI agents often trained with datasets comprising tasks that can be completed within a single app, leading to poor performance in cross-app navigation. To address this problem, we present GUIOdyssey, a comprehensive dataset for cross-app mobile GUI navigation. GUIOdyssey comprises 8,334 episodes with an average of 15.3 steps per episode, covering 6 mobile devices, 212 distinct apps, and 1,357 app combinations. Each step is enriched with detailed semantic reasoning annotations, which aid the model in building cognitive processes and enhancing its reasoning abilities for complex cross-app tasks. Building on GUIOdyssey, we develop OdysseyAgent, an exploratory multimodal agent for long-step cross-app navigation equipped with a history resampler module that efficiently attends to historical screenshot tokens, balancing performance and inference speed. Extensive experiments conducted in both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios validate the effectiveness of our approach. Moreover, we demonstrate that historial information involving actions, screenshots and context in our dataset can significantly enhances OdysseyAgent's performance on complex cross-app tasks",

A Trend-Conditional Mamba Decomposer generates the motion latent distribution of the future motion trends and predicts future motion trajectories through sampling decomposition.

    "abstract": "Thousands of photos of Earth are taken every day by astronauts from the International Space Station. Localizing these photos, which has been performed manually for decades, has recently been approached through image retrieval solutions: given an astronaut photo, the goal is to find its most similar match among a large database of geo-tagged satellite images, in a task called Astronaut Photography Localization (APL). Yet, existing APL approaches are trained only using satellite images, without taking advantage of the millions of open-source astronaut photos. In this work we present the first APL pipeline capable of leveraging astronaut photos for training. We first produce full localization information for 300,000 manually weakly-labeled astronaut photos through an automated pipeline, and then use these images to train a model, called AstroLoc. AstroLoc learns a robust representation of Earth's surface features through two objective functions: pairing astronaut photos with their matching satellite counterparts in a pairwise loss, and a second loss on clusters of satellite imagery weighted by their relevance to astronaut photography through unsupervised mining. AstroLoc achieves a staggering 35% average improvement in recall@1 over previous SOTA, reaching a recall@100 consistently over 99% for existing datasets. Moreover, without fine-tuning, AstroLoc provides excellent results for related tasks like the lost-in-space satellite problem and historical space imagery localization",

To address these challenges, we propose a training-free Dual Recursive Feedback (DRF) system that properly reflects control conditions in controllable T2I models. The proposed DRF consists of appearance feedback and generation feedback that recursively refines the intermediate latents to better reflect the given appearance information and the user's intent.This dual-update mechanism guides latent representations toward reliable manifolds, effectively integrating structural and appearance attributes. Our approach enables fine-grained generation even between class-invariant structure-appearance fusion, such as transferring human motion onto a tiger's form.

However, these models often exhibit limited specialized capabilities for domain-specific tasks that require extensive domain prior knowledge. An intuitive solution is to post-train LMMs on a specific domain, but often suffers from the labor-intensive annotating process and the inaccessibility of private training data. Directly integrating expert models tailored for those tasks is also challenging due to representational gaps and imbalanced optimization. To address these challenges, we introduce Chimera, a scalable and low-cost multi-modal pipeline designed to boost the ability of existing LMMs with domain-specific experts. Specifically, we design a progressive training strategy to integrate features from expert models into the input of a generalist LMM. To address the imbalanced optimization caused by the well-aligned general visual encoder, we introduce a novel Generalist-Specialist Collaboration Masking (GSCM) mechanism. This results in a versatile model that excels across the chart, table, math, and document domains, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multi-modal reasoning and visual content extraction tasks, both of which are challenging tasks for assessing existing LMMs. We will release model weights, along with the data used for training and evaluation, to facilitate future research on LMMs",

    "abstract": "Understanding multimodal signals in egocentric vision, such as RGB video, depth, camera poses, and gaze, is essential for applications in augmented reality, robotics, and human-computer interaction, enabling systems to better interpret the camera wearer's actions, intentions, and surrounding environment. However, building large-scale egocentric multimodal and multitask models presents unique challenges. Egocentric data are inherently heterogeneous, with large variations in modality coverage across devices and settings. Generating pseudo-labels for missing modalities, such as gaze or head-mounted camera trajectories, is often infeasible, making standard supervised learning approaches difficult to scale. Furthermore, dynamic camera motion and the complex temporal and spatial structure of first-person video pose additional challenges for the direct application of existing multimodal foundation models. To address these challenges, we introduce a set of efficient temporal tokenizers and propose EgoM2P, a masked modeling framework that learns from temporally-aware multimodal tokens to train a large, general-purpose model for egocentric 4D understanding. This unified design supports multitasking across diverse egocentric perception and synthesis tasks, including gaze prediction, egocentric camera tracking, and monocular depth estimation from egocentric video, and also serves as a generative model for conditional egocentric video synthesis. Across these tasks, EgoM2P matches or outperforms specialist models while being an order of magnitude faster. We will fully open-source EgoM2P to support the community and advance egocentric vision research",

In this work, we address this gap by thoroughly evaluating LMM classification performance in a truly open-world setting. We first formalize the task and introduce an evaluation protocol, defining various metrics to assess the alignment between predicted and ground truth classes. We then evaluate 13 models across 10 benchmarks, encompassing prototypical, non-prototypical, fine-grained, and very fine-grained classes, demonstrating the challenges LMMs face in this task. Further analyses based on the proposed metrics reveal the types of errors LMMs make, highlighting challenges related to granularity and fine-grained capabilities, showing how tailored prompting and reasoning can alleviate them",

Besides, virtual connections are often designed to support efficient feature aggregation, implicitly extending the spectrum of dependencies within the skeleton.By injecting virtual connections into hyper-graphs, the semantic clues of diverse action categories can be highlighted. The results of experiments conducted on the NTU-60, NTU-120, and NW-UCLA datasets demonstrate the merits of our Hyper-GCN, compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "Event cameras are emerging vision sensors whose noise is challenging to characterize. Existing denoising methods for event cameras are often designed in isolation and thus consider other tasks, such as motion estimation, separately (i.e., sequentially after denoising). However, motion is an intrinsic part of event data, since scene edges cannot be sensed without motion. We propose, to the best of our knowledge, the first method that simultaneously estimates motion in its various forms (e.g., ego-motion, optical flow) and noise. The method is flexible, as it allows replacing the one-step motion estimation of the widely-used Contrast Maximization framework with any other motion estimator, such as deep neural networks. The experiments show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on the E-MLB denoising benchmark and competitive results on the DND21 benchmark, while demonstrating effectiveness across motion estimation and intensity reconstruction tasks.

Our probability volume is constructed in a coarse-to-fine manner: We first sample a small set of rays to obtain an initial low-resolution probability volume. We then refine these probabilities by performing a denser sampling only in high-probability regions and process the refined values for predicting a 2D location and orientation angle. We conduct an evaluation on two standard floorplan localization benchmarks.

However, processing multiple frames leads to lengthy visual token sequences, presenting challenges such as the limited context length cannot accommodate the entire video, and the inclusion of irrelevant frames hinders visual perception. Hence, effective frame selection is crucial. This paper emphasizes that frame selection should follow three key principles: query relevance, list-wise diversity, and sequentiality. Existing methods, such as uniform frame sampling and query-frame matching, do not capture all of these principles. Thus, we propose Markov decision determinantal point process with dynamic programming (MDP^3) for frame selection, a training-free and model-agnostic method that can be seamlessly integrated into existing Video-LLMs. Our method first estimates frame similarities conditioned on the query using a conditional Gaussian kernel within the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). We then apply the determinantal point process (DPP) to the similarity matrix to capture both query relevance and list-wise diversity. To incorporate sequentiality, we segment the video and apply DPP within each segment, conditioned on the preceding segment selection, modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP) for allocating selection sizes across segments. Theoretically, MDP^3 provides a (1-1/e)-approximate solution to the NP-hard list-wise frame selection problem with pseudo-polynomial time complexity, demonstrating its efficiency.

    "abstract": "Previous works have attempted to improve tracking efficiency through lightweight architecture design or knowledge distillation from teacher models to compact student trackers. However, these solutions often sacrifice accuracy for speed to a great extent, and also have the problems of complex training process and structural limitations. Thus, we propose a general model compression framework for efficient transformer object tracking, named CompressTracker, to reduce model size while preserving tracking accuracy. Our approach features a novel stage division strategy that segments the transformer layers of the teacher model into distinct stages to break the limitation of model structure. Additionally, we also design a unique replacement training technique that randomly substitutes specific stages in the student model with those from the teacher model, as opposed to training the student model in isolation. Replacement training enhances the student model's ability to replicate the teacher model's behavior and simplifies the training process. To further forcing student model to emulate teacher model, we incorporate prediction guidance and stage-wise feature mimicking to provide additional supervision during the teacher model's compression process. CompressTracker is structurally agnostic, making it compatible with any transformer architecture. We conduct a series of experiment to verify the effectiveness and generalizability of our CompressTracker. Our CompressTracker-SUTrack, compressed from SUTrack, retains about 99% performance on LaSOT (72.2% AUC) while achieves 2.42x speed up.

In addition, online AD learning has also been explored. In this work, we expand in both directions to a realistic setting by considering the new novel task of long-tailed online AD (LTOAD). We first identified that the offline state-of-the-art LTAD methods cannot be directly applied to the online setting. Specifically, LTAD is class-aware, requiring class labels that are not available in the online setting. To address this challenge, we propose a class-agnostic framework for LTAD and then adapt it to our online learning setting. Our method outperforms the SOTA baselines in most offline LTAD settings, including both the industrial manufacturing and the medical domain. In particular, we observe +4.63% image-AUROC on MVTec even compared to methods that have access to class labels and the number of classes.

Though existing ARD approaches enhance student model's robustness, the inevitable by-product leads to the degraded performance on clean examples. We summarize the causes of this problem inherent in existing methods with dual-teacher framework as: 1 The divergent optimization objectives of dual-teacher models, i.e., the clean and robust teachers, impede effective knowledge transfer to the student model, and 2 The iteratively generated adversarial examples during training lead to performance deterioration of the robust teacher model. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Cyclic Iterative ARD (CIARD) method with two key innovations: 1 A multi-teacher framework with contrastive push-loss alignment to resolve conflicts in dual-teacher optimization objectives, and 2 Continuous adversarial retraining to maintain dynamic teacher robustness against performance degradation from the varying adversarial examples. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that CIARD achieves remarkable performance with an average 3.53% improvement in adversarial defense rates across various attack scenarios and a 5.87% increase in clean sample accuracy, establishing a new benchmark for balancing model robustness and generalization.

    "abstract": "The image difference captioning (IDC) task is to describe the distinctions between two images. However, existing datasets do not offer comprehensive coverage across all image-difference categories. In this work, we introduce a high-quality dataset, DiffTell with various types of image manipulations, including global image alterations, object-level changes, and text manipulations. The data quality is controlled by careful human filtering. Additionally, to scale up the data collection without prohibitive human labor costs, we explore the possibility of automatically filtering for quality control. We demonstrate that both traditional methods and recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit performance improvements on the IDC task after training on the DiffTell dataset. Through extensive ablation studies, we provide a detailed analysis of the performance gains attributed to DiffTell. Experiments show DiffTell significantly enhances the availability of resources for IDC research, offering a more comprehensive foundation and benchmark for future investigations",

    "abstract": "Extracting physically plausible 3D human motion from videos is a critical task. Although existing simulation-based motion imitation methods can enhance the physical quality of daily motions estimated from monocular video capture, extending this capability to high-difficulty motions remains an open challenge. This can be attributed to some flawed motion clips in video-based motion capture results and the inherent complexity in modeling high-difficulty motions. Therefore, sensing the advantage of segmentation in localizing human body, we introduce a mask-based motion correction module (MCM) that leverages motion context and video mask to repair flawed motions; and propose a physics-based motion transfer module (PTM), which employs a prior injected pretrain and adapt approach for motion imitation, improving physical plausibility with the ability to handle in-the-wild and challenging motions. Our approach is designed as a plug-and-play module to physically refine the video motion capture, which also excels in motion generation tasks. Finally, we collected a challenging in-the-wild test set to establish a benchmark, and our method has demonstrated effectiveness on both the new benchmark and existing public datasets.

Furthermore, after the recursive decoupling, we distill the remaining non-target knowledge to ensure knowledge completeness and enhance performance. Ultimately, our method improves the student's performance by transferring fine-grained knowledge and emphasizing the most critical relationships.Extensive experiments on datasets such as CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1K, and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that our method compares favorably with state-of-the-art logit-based knowledge distillation approaches.

In this work, we propose a context-aware simplification framework for building an efficient and effective GUI Agent, termed **SimpAgent**. To mitigate potential interference from numerous unrelated elements, we introduce a **masking-based element pruning** method that circumvents the intractable relation modeling through an efficient masking mechanism. To reduce the redundancy in historical information, we devise a **consistency-guided history compression** module, which enhances implicit LLM-based compression through innovative explicit guidance, achieving an optimal balance between performance and efficiency.

    "abstract": "We tackle the problem of localizing traffic cameras within a 3D reference map and propose a novel image-to-point cloud registration (I2P) method, TrafficLoc, in a coarse-to-fine matching fashion. To overcome the lack of large-scale real-world intersection datasets, we first introduce Carla Intersection, a new simulated dataset with 75 urban and rural intersections in Carla. We find that current I2P methods struggle with cross-modal matching under large viewpoint differences, especially at traffic intersections. TrafficLoc thus employs a novel Geometry-guided Attention Loss (GAL) to focus only on the corresponding geometric regions under different viewpoints during 2D-3D feature fusion. To address feature inconsistency in paired image patch-point groups, we further propose Inter-intra Contrastive Learning (ICL) to enhance separating 2D patch / 3D group features within each intra-modality and introduce Dense Training Alignment (DTA) with soft-argmax for improving position regression. Extensive experiments show our TrafficLoc greatly improves the performance over the SOTA I2P methods (up to 86%) on Carla Intersection and generalizes well to real-world data. TrafficLoc also achieves new SOTA performance on KITTI and NuScenes datasets, demonstrating the superiority across both in-vehicle and traffic cameras.

We introduce DetAny3D, a promptable 3D detection foundation model capable of detecting any novel object under arbitrary camera configurations using only monocular inputs. Training a foundation model for 3D detection is fundamentally constrained by the limited availability of annotated 3D data, which motivates DetAny3D to leverage the rich prior knowledge embedded in extensively pre-trained 2D foundation models to compensate for this scarcity. To effectively transfer 2D knowledge to 3D, DetAny3D incorporates two core modules: the 2D Aggregator, which aligns features from different 2D foundation models, and the 3D Interpreter with Zero-Embedding Mapping, which stabilizes early training in 2D-to-3D knowledge transfer. Experimental results validate the strong generalization of our DetAny3D, which not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on unseen categories and novel camera configurations, but also surpasses most competitors on in-domain data. DetAny3D sheds light on the potential of the 3D foundation model for diverse applications in real-world scenarios, e.g., rare object detection in autonomous driving, and demonstrates promise for further exploration of 3D-centric tasks in open-world settings.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Adversarial Training (AT) is one of the most effective methods to train robust Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, AT creates an inherent trade-off between clean accuracy and adversarial robustness, which is commonly attributed to the more complicated decision boundary caused by the insufficient learning of hard adversarial samples. In this work, we reveal a counterintuitive fact for the first time: **From the perspective of perception consistency, hard adversarial samples that can still attack the robust model after AT are already learned better than those successfully defended**. Thus, different from previous views, we argue that it is rather the over-sufficient learning of hard adversarial samples that degrades the decision boundary and contributes to the trade-off problem. Specifically, the excessive pursuit of perception consistency would force the model to view the perturbations as noise and ignore the information within them, which should have been utilized to induce a smoother perception transition towards the decision boundary to support its establishment to an appropriate location. In response, we define a new AT objective named **Robust Perception**, encouraging the model perception to change smoothly with input perturbations, based on which we propose a novel **R**obust **P**erception **A**dversarial **T**raining (**RPAT**) method, effectively mitigating the current accuracy-robustness trade-off. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet with ResNet-18, PreActResNet-18, and WideResNet-34-10 demonstrate the effectiveness of our method beyond four common baselines and 12 state-of-the-art (SOTA) works.

Direct 4D diffusion modeling is extremely challenging due to costly data construction and the high-dimensional nature of jointly representing 3D shape, appearance, and motion. We address these challenges by introducing a Direct 4DMesh-to-GS Variation Field VAE that directly encodes canonical Gaussian Splats (GS) and their temporal variations from 3D animation data without per-instance fitting, and compresses high-dimensional animations into a compact latent space. Building upon this efficient representation, we train a Gaussian Variation Field diffusion model with temporal-aware Diffusion Transformer conditioned on input videos and canonical GS. Trained on carefully-curated animatable 3D objects from the Objaverse dataset, our model demonstrates superior generation quality compared to existing methods. It also exhibits remarkable generalization to in-the-wild video inputs despite being trained exclusively on synthetic data, paving the way for generating high-quality animated 3D content.

Feedforward 3D scene-level generation has been rarely explored due to the lack of models capable of scaling-up latent representation learning on 3D scene-level data. Unlike object-level generative models, which are trained on well-labeled 3D data in a bounded canonical space, scene-level generations with 3D scenes represented by 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) are unbounded and exhibit scale inconsistency across different scenes, making unified latent representation learning for generative purposes extremely challenging. In this paper, we introduce Can3Tok, the first 3D scene-level variational autoencoder (VAE) capable of encoding a large number of Gaussian primitives into a low-dimensional latent embedding, which effectively captures both semantic and spatial information of the inputs. Beyond model design, we propose a general pipeline for 3D scene data processing to address scale inconsistency issue. We validate our method on the recent scene-level 3D dataset DL3DV-10K, where we found that only Can3Tok successfully generalizes to novel 3D scenes, while compared methods fail to converge on even a few hundred scene inputs during training and exhibit zero generalization ability during inference.

However, existing methods often struggle to recover high-frequency details, such as regions with fine structures or weak signals, since depth sensors may fail to capture accurate depth maps in those regions, leading to imperfect supervision ground truth. To overcome this limitation, it is essential to introduce an alternative training source for the models. Emerging depth foundation models excel at producing high-frequency details from RGB images, yet their depth maps suffer from inconsistent scaling. Therefore, we propose a novel teacher-student framework that enhances depth completion by distilling high-frequency knowledge from depth foundation models across multiple scales.

The emergence of Vision Mamba, which draws inspiration from the advanced state space model Mamba, marks a significant advancement in this field.

Despite its strengths, Vision Mamba encounters challenges in low-level vision tasks, including computational complexity that scales with the number of scanning sequences and local pixel forgetting. To address these limitations, this study introduces Efficient All-Around Mamba (EAMamba), an enhanced framework that incorporates a Multi-Head Selective Scan Module (MHSSM) with an all-around scanning mechanism. MHSSM efficiently aggregates multiple scanning sequences, which avoids increases in computational complexity and parameter count. The all-around scanning strategy implements multiple patterns to capture holistic information and resolves the local pixel forgetting issue. Our experimental evaluations validate these innovations across several restoration tasks, including super resolution, denoising, deblurring, and dehazing.

However, its large storage requirements and high computational cost pose challenges for practical deployment. Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as an effective strategy for efficient deployment, but we identify two key challenges in SAM that hinder the effectiveness of existing PTQ methods: the heavy-tailed and skewed distribution of post-GELU activations, and significant inter-channel variation in linear projection activations. To address these challenges, we propose AHCPTQ, an accurate and hardware-efficient PTQ method for SAM. AHCPTQ introduces hardware-compatible Hybrid Log-Uniform Quantization (HLUQ) to manage post-GELU activations, employing log2 quantization for dense small values and uniform quantization for sparse large values to enhance quantization resolution. Additionally, AHCPTQ incorporates Channel-Aware Grouping (CAG) to mitigate inter-channel variation by progressively clustering activation channels with similar distributions, enabling them to share quantization parameters and improving hardware efficiency. The combination of HLUQ and CAG not only enhances quantization effectiveness but also ensures compatibility with efficient hardware execution. For instance, under the W4A4 configuration on the SAM-L model, AHCPTQ achieves 36.6% mAP on instance segmentation with the DINO detector, while achieving a 7.89x speedup and 8.64x energy efficiency over its floating-point counterpart in FPGA implementation",

However, a critical challenge in current 3D generation technologies lies in achieving real-time interactivity. To address this issue, we introduce WonderTurbo, the first real-time interactive 3D scene generation framework capable of generating novel perspectives of 3D scenes within 0.72 seconds. Specifically, WonderTurbo accelerates both geometric and appearance modeling in 3D scene generation. In terms of geometry, we propose StepSplat, an innovative method that constructs efficient 3D geometric representations through dynamic updates, each taking only 0.26 seconds. Additionally, we design QuickDepth, a lightweight depth completion module that provides consistent depth input for StepSplat, further enhancing geometric accuracy. For appearance modeling, we develop FastPaint, a 2-steps diffusion model tailored for instant inpainting, which focuses on maintaining spatial appearance consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that WonderTurbo achieves a remarkable 15xspeedup compared to baseline methods, while preserving excellent spatial consistency and delivering high-quality output",

    "abstract": "In recent years, neural networks have achieved significant progress in offline image processing. However, in online scenarios, particularly in on-chip implementations, memory usage emerges as a critical bottleneck due to the limited memory resources of integrated image processors. In this study, we focus on reducing the memory footprint of neural networks for on-chip image processing by optimizing network design for efficient memory utilization. Specifically, we consider a typical scenario in which images outputted from an image sensor are processed sequentially using line buffers in a line-by-line manner. This setting necessitates the modeling of both intra-line and inter-line correlations--capturing dependencies among pixels within a single line group and across different line groups, respectively.To model intra-line correlations, we propose a progressive feature enhancement strategy, where line pixels are processed with expanding strip convolutions in multiple stages.For inter-line correlation modeling, we introduce a hierarchical line buffer formulation, where features extracted from previous lines are incrementally reused and compressed across multiple hierarchical levels.Comprehensive experiments on various image processing tasks, including RAW denoising, Gaussian denoising, and super-resolution, demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a superior trade-off between performance and memory efficiency than previous solutions, e.g., up to 1dB PSNR gain in RAW denoising at one-fifth of peak memory usage",

As such, they do not explain the intrinsic feature space and decision boundaries learned by the classifier. To address this limitation, we propose Mirror-CFE, a novel method that generates faithful counterfactual explanations by operating directly in the classifier's feature space, treating decision boundaries as mirrors that \"reflect\" feature representations in the mirror. Mirror-CFE learns a mapping function from feature space to image space while preserving distance relationships, enabling smooth transitions between source images and their counterfactuals. Through extensive experiments on four image datasets, we demonstrate that Mirror-CFE achieves superior performance in validity while maintaining input resemblance compared to state-of-the-art explanation methods.

Inspired by recent advances in conditional sampling, our approach recasts student model sampling as a proximal optimization problem with a score distillation sampling loss (SDS). To this end, we integrate distillation optimization during reverse sampling, which can be viewed as teacher guidance that drives student sampling trajectory towards the clean manifold using pre-trained diffusion models.

S^3E fully explores the association between exteroceptive radar and proprioceptive inertial sensor to achieve complementary benefits.

    "abstract": "Micro-expression recognition (MER) is a highly challenging task in affective computing. With the reduced-sized micro-expression (ME) input that contains key information based on key-frame indexes, key-frame-based methods have significantly improved the performance of MER. However, most of these methods focus on improving the performance with relatively accurate key-frame indexes, while ignoring the difficulty of obtaining accurate key-frame indexes and the objective existence of key-frame index errors, which impedes them from moving towards practical applications. In this paper, we propose CausalNet, a novel framework to achieve robust MER facing key-frame index errors while maintaining accurate recognition. To enhance robustness, CausalNet takes the representation of the entire ME sequence as the input. To address the information redundancy brought by the complete ME range input and maintain accurate recognition, first, the Causal Motion Position Learning Module (CMPLM) is proposed to help the model locate the muscle movement areas related to Action Units (AUs), thereby reducing the attention to other redundant areas. Second, the Causal Attention Block (CAB) is proposed to deeply learn the causal relationships between the muscle contraction and relaxation movements in MEs. Empirical experiments have demonstrated that on popular ME benchmarks, the CausalNet has achieved robust MER under different levels of key-frame index noise. Meanwhile, it has surpassed state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on several standard MER benchmarks when using the provided annotated key-frames.

Traditional debiasing methods for VLMs primarily focus on specific downstream tasks using labeled datasets, which we argue is insufficient given the broad applicability of VLMs. Specifically, these methods struggle with generalizability, transferability, and feasibility due to overfitting, limited task applicability, and regulatory constraints on the use of sensitive data, making them less practical in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel task-agnostic method for learning debiased image embeddings in VLMs. Our approach does not require expensive annotated datasets or curated prompts for downstream tasks, while still preserving the inherent zero-shot capabilities of these models. Instead, we leverage easily accessible information: 1) a bias text corpus generated by a large language model, and 2) a generic unsupervised vision dataset. Our method disentangles the image embedding into bias and neutral components by applying centered kernel alignment (CKA) regularization to the text-vision representational similarity, using the bias text corpus over the generic vision dataset.

Our second phase supervision is spatially guided by a novel localized keypoint loss. This spatial guidance enables user control over abstracted features.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Multimodal sensing has proven valuable for visual tracking, as different sensor types offer unique strengths in handling one specific challenging scene where object appearance varies. While a generalist model capable of leveraging all modalities would be ideal, development is hindered by data sparsity, typically in practice, only one modality is available at a time. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure and achieve that knowledge gained from multimodal sensing -- such as identifying relevant features and regions -- is effectively shared, even when certain modalities are unavailable at inference. We venture with a simple assumption: similar samples across different modalities have more knowledge to share than otherwise. To implement this, we employ a classifier with weak loss tasked with distinguishing between modalities. More specifically, if the classifier \"fails\" to accurately identify the modality of the given sample, this signals an opportunity for cross-modal knowledge sharing. Intuitively, knowledge transfer is facilitated whenever a sample from one modality is sufficiently close and aligned with another. Technically, we achieve this by routing samples from one modality to the expert of the others, within a mixture-of-experts framework designed for multimodal video object tracking. During the inference, the expert of the respective modality is chosen, which we show to benefit from the multimodal knowledge available during training, thanks to the proposed method. Through the exhaustive experiments that use only paired RGB-E, RGB-D, and RGB-T during training, we showcase the benefit of the proposed method for RGB-X tracker during inference, with an average +3% precision improvement over the current SOTA.

In this paper, we study the joint sequential scene flow estimation and future scene flow prediction on point cloud sequences.

However, several recent studies have shown that object detectors can be easily fooled by physically realizable attacks, e.g., adversarial patches and recent adversarial textures, which pose realistic and urgent threats. Adversarial Training (AT) has been recognized as the most effective defense against adversarial attacks. While AT has been extensively studied in the l_infinity-bounded attack settings on classification models, AT against physically realizable attacks on object detectors has received limited exploration. Early attempts are only performed to defend against adversarial patches, leaving AT against a wider range of physically realizable attacks under-explored. In this work, we consider defending against various physically realizable attacks with a unified AT method. We propose PBCAT, a novel Patch-Based Composite Adversarial Training strategy. PBCAT optimizes the model by incorporating the combination of small-area gradient-guided adversarial patches and imperceptible global adversarial perturbations covering the entire image. With these designs, PBCAT has the potential to defend against not only adversarial patches but also unseen physically realizable attacks such as adversarial textures. Extensive experiments in multiple settings demonstrated that PBCAT significantly improved robustness against various physically realizable attacks over state-of-the-art defense methods.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in text-to-image diffusion models enable photorealistic image generation, but they also risk producing malicious content, such as NSFW images. To mitigate risk, concept erasure methods are studied to facilitate the model to unlearn specific concepts. However, current studies struggle to fully erase malicious concepts implicitly embedded in prompts (e.g., metaphorical expressions or adversarial prompts) while preserving the model's normal generation capability. To address this challenge, our study proposes TRCE, using a two-stage concept erasure strategy to achieve an effective trade-off between reliable erasure and knowledge preservation. Firstly, TRCE starts by erasing the malicious semantics implicitly embedded in textual prompts. By identifying a critical mapping objective(i.e., the [EoT] embedding), we optimize the cross-attention layers to map malicious prompts to contextually similar prompts but with safe concepts. This step prevents the model from being overly influenced by malicious semantics during the denoising process. Following this, considering the deterministic properties of the sampling trajectory of the diffusion model, TRCE further steers the early denoising prediction toward the safe direction and away from the unsafe one through contrastive learning, thus further avoiding the generation of malicious content. Finally, we conduct comprehensive evaluations of TRCE on multiple malicious concept erasure benchmarks, and the results demonstrate its effectiveness in erasing malicious concepts while better preserving the model's original generation ability",

    "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for chart comprehension. However, they heavily rely on extracted content via OCR, which leads to numerical hallucinations when chart textual annotations are sparse. While existing methods focus on scaling instructions, they fail to address the fundamental challenge, i.e., reasoning with visual perception. In this paper, we identify a critical observation: MLLMs exhibit weak grounding in chart elements and proportional relationships, as evidenced by their inability to localize key positions to match their reasoning. To bridge this gap, we propose PointCoT, which integrates reflective interaction into chain-of-thought reasoning in charts. By prompting MLLMs to generate bounding boxes and re-render charts based on location annotations, we establish connections between textual reasoning steps and visual grounding regions. We further introduce an automated pipeline to construct ChartPoint-SFT-62k, a dataset featuring 19.2K high-quality chart samples with step-by-step CoT, bounding box, and re-rendered visualizations. Leveraging this data, we develop two instruction-tuned models, ChartPoint_Q2 and ChartPoint_Q2.5, which outperform state-of-the-art across several chart benchmarks, e.g., +5.04% on ChartBench",

This holds significant potential for Earth Observation (EO), where trustworthiness is critical, yet the complexity of EO data poses challenges to uncertainty-aware methods. In this work, we investigate the generalization of representation uncertainty in EO, considering the domain's unique semantic characteristics. We pretrain uncertainties on large EO datasets and propose an evaluation framework to assess their zero-shot performance in multi-label classification and segmentation EO tasks. Our findings reveal that, unlike uncertainties pretrained on natural images, EO-pretraining exhibits strong generalization across unseen EO domains, geographic locations, and target granularities, while maintaining sensitivity to variations in ground sampling distance. We demonstrate the practical utility of pretrained uncertainties showcasing their alignment with task-specific uncertainties in downstream tasks, their sensitivity to real-world EO image noise, and their ability to generate spatial uncertainty estimates out-of-the-box. Initiating the discussion on representation uncertainty in EO, our study provides insights into its strengths and limitations, paving the way for future research in the field.

    "abstract": "Referring Visual Grounding (RVG) tasks revolve around utilizing vision-language interactions to incorporate object information from language expressions, thereby enabling targeted object detection or segmentation within images. Transformer-based methods have enabled effective interaction through attention mechanisms, achieving notable performance in RVG tasks. However, existing strategies for RVG, which involve direct interaction between visual and linguistic features, face three key challenges: (i) tendency to focus on a single target, (ii) insufficient control over linguistic noise, and (iii) high computational cost. To address these challenges, we propose a Region-aware Anchoring Mechanism (RaAM) that mediates vision-language interactions. In RaAM, region-aware anchors engage in alternating interactions with vision and language modalities, acting as indicators for object presence across different regions within the image. RaAM (i) directs attention to multiple target regions for better localization, (ii) reduces cross-modal redundancy by using anchors as buffers, and (iii) lowers time complexity. In addition, we design region and pixel level loss functions to enhance object presence assessment and edge precision. We evaluate our RaAM-RVG on four benchmark datasets and integrate RaAM into various models by replacing their interaction design. Results show that RaAM outperforms state-of-the-art methods with lower computational cost",

Although Scaffold achieves significant performance improvements, we show that this superiority is at the cost of increased security vulnerabilities. Specifically, this paper presents BadSFL, the first backdoor attack targeting Scaffold, which turns benign clients into accomplices to amplify the attack effect. The core idea of BadSFL is to uniquely tamper with the control variate to subtly steer benign clients' local gradient updates towards the attacker's poisoned direction, effectively turning them into unwitting accomplices, significantly enhancing the backdoor persistence. Additionally, BadSFL leverages a GAN-enhanced poisoning strategy to enrich the attacker's dataset, maintaining high accuracy on both benign and backdoored samples while remaining stealthy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BadSFL achieves superior attack durability, maintaining effectiveness for over 60 global rounds--lasting up to three times longer than existing baselines even after ceasing malicious model injections",

Recent CLIP-based approaches have explored two frameworks: Two-Tower versus Single-Tower framework, yet the former suffers from low effectiveness, while the latter suffers from low efficiency. In this study, we explore a new Hybrid-Tower framework that can hybridize the advantages of the Two-Tower and Single-Tower framework, achieving high effectiveness and efficiency simultaneously. We propose a novel hybrid method, Fine-grained Pseudo-query Interaction and Generation for T2VR, i.e. \\name , which includes a new pseudo-query generator designed to generate a pseudo-query for each video. This enables the video feature and the textual features of pseudo-query to interact in a fine-grained manner, similar to the Single-Tower approaches to hold high effectiveness, even before the real textual query is received. Simultaneously, our method introduces no additional storage or computational overhead compared to the Two-Tower framework during the inference stage, thus maintaining high efficiency. Extensive experiments on five commonly used text-video retrieval benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves a significant improvement over the baseline, with an increase of 1.6% ~ 3.9% in R@1.

However, existing human mesh modeling approaches struggle to capture detailed variations across diverse body poses and shapes, largely due to limited training data diversity and restrictive modeling assumptions. Moreover, the common paradigm first optimizes the external body surface using a linear basis, then regresses internal skeletal joints from surface vertices. This approach introduces problematic dependencies between internal skeleton and outer soft tissue, limiting direct control over body height and bone lengths. To address these issues, we present ATLAS, a high-fidelity body model learned from 600k high-resolution scans captured using 240 synchronized cameras. Unlike previous methods, we explicitly decouple the shape and skeleton bases by grounding our mesh representation in the human skeleton. This decoupling enables enhanced shape expressivity, fine-grained customization of body attributes, and keypoint fitting independent of external soft-tissue characteristics. ATLAS outperforms existing methods by fitting unseen subjects in diverse poses more accurately, and quantitative evaluations show that our non-linear pose correctives more effectively capture complex poses compared to linear models",

However, existing evaluation frameworks have failed to evolve in parallel.

To address this issue, we design a novel evaluation score, ICT (Image-Contained-Text) score, that achieves and surpasses the objectives of text-image alignment by assessing the degree to which images represent textual content. Building upon this foundation, we further train a HP (High-Preference) score model using solely the image modality, aiming to enhance image quality in aspects such as aesthetics and detail refinement while maintaining achieved text-image alignment.Experiments demonstrate that the proposed evaluation model improves scoring accuracy by over 10% compared to existing methods, and achieves significant results in optimizing state-of-the-art text-to-image models.

However, existing PTQ methods for SR often fail to achieve satisfactory performance as they overlook the impact of outliers in activation. Our empirical analysis reveals that these prevalent activation outliers are strongly correlated with image color information, and directly removing them leads to significant performance degradation. Motivated by this, we propose a dual-region quantization strategy that partitions activations into an outlier region and a dense region, applying uniform quantization to each region independently to better balance bit-width allocation. Furthermore, we observe that different network layers exhibit varying sensitivities to quantization, leading to different levels of performance degradation. To address this, we introduce sensitivity-aware finetuning that encourages the model to focus more on highly sensitive layers, further enhancing quantization performance.

Despite their strong ability to learn discriminative and generalizable features crucial for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, their impact on this task remains underexplored. Motivated by this gap, we systematically investigate representative vision foundation models for OOD detection. Our findings reveal that a pre-trained DINOv2 model, even without fine-tuning on in-domain (ID) data, naturally provides a highly discriminative feature space for OOD detection, achieving performance comparable to existing state-of-the-art methods without requiring complex designs. Beyond this, we explore how fine-tuning foundation models on in-domain (ID) data can enhance OOD detection. However, we observe that the performance of vision foundation models remains unsatisfactory in scenarios with a large semantic space. This is due to the increased complexity of decision boundaries as the number of categories grows, which complicates the optimization process. To mitigate this, we propose the Mixture of Feature Experts (MoFE) module, which partitions features into subspaces, effectively capturing complex data distributions and refining decision boundaries. Further, we introduce a Dynamic-b Mixup strategy, which samples interpolation weights from a dynamic beta distribution. This adapts to varying levels of learning difficulty across categories, improving feature learning for more challenging categories.

This leads to computationally less demanding inference as fewer integration steps and less complex numerical solvers can be employed when numerically solving an ordinary differential equation at test time. However, in the conditional setting, minibatch optimal transport falls short. This is because the default optimal transport mapping disregards conditions, resulting in a conditionally skewed prior distribution during training. In contrast, at test time, we have no access to the skewed prior, and instead sample from the full, unbiased prior distribution. This gap between training and testing leads to a subpar performance. To bridge this gap, we propose conditional optimal transport (C2OT) that adds a conditional weighting term in the cost matrix when computing the optimal transport assignment.

To address this, we propose a novel framework, BlinkTrack, which integrates event data with grayscale images for high-frequency feature tracking. Our method extends the traditional Kalman filter into a learning-based framework, utilizing differentiable Kalman filters in both event and image branches. This approach improves single-modality tracking and effectively solves the data association and fusion from asynchronous event and image data. We also introduce new synthetic and augmented datasets to better evaluate our model. Experimental results indicate that BlinkTrack significantly outperforms existing methods, exceeding 80 FPS with multi-modality data and 100 FPS with preprocessed event data.

Specifically, we propose the Masked Sparse Gated Recurrent Unit (MS-GRU) which concentrates on the occupied regions by the proposed mask updating mechanism, and a sparse GRU design is proposed to reduce the computation cost.

Existing methods using maximal clique search in compatibility graphs achieve high recall but suffer from exponential time complexity, limiting their use in time-sensitive applications. To address this challenge, we propose a fast and robust estimator, TurboReg, built upon a novel lightweight clique, TurboClique, and a highly parallelizable Pivot-Guided Search (PGS) algorithm. First, we define the TurboClique as a 3-clique within a highly-constrained compatibility graph. The lightweight nature of the 3-clique allows for efficient parallel searching, and the highly-constrained compatibility graph ensures robust spatial consistency for stable transformation estimation. Next, PGS selects matching pairs with high SC^2 scores as pivots, effectively guiding the search toward TurboCliques with higher inlier ratios. Moreover, the PGS algorithm has linear time complexity and is significantly more efficient than the maximal clique search with exponential time complexity. Extensive experiments show that TurboReg achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple real-world datasets, with substantial speed improvements.

    "abstract": "Visual Robot Manipulation (VRM) aims to enable a robot to follow natural language instructions based on robot states and visual observations, and therefore requires costly multi- modal data. To compensate for the deficiency of robot data, existing approaches have employed vision-language pre- training with large-scale data. However, they either utilize web data that differs from robotic tasks, or train the model in an implicit way (e.g., predicting future frames at the pixel level), thus showing limited generalization ability under in- sufficient robot data. In this paper, we propose to learn from large-scale human action video datasets in an explicit way (i.e., imitating human actions from hand keypoints), introduc- ing Visual Robot Manipulation with Analogical Reasoning (AR-VRM). To acquire action knowledge explicitly from hu- man action videos, we propose a keypoint Vision-Language Model (VLM) pretraining scheme, enabling the VLM to learn human action knowledge and directly predict human hand keypoints. During fine-tuning on robot data, to facilitate the robotic arm in imitating the action patterns of human motions, we first retrieve human action videos that perform similar manipulation tasks and have similar historical obser- vations, and then learn the Analogical Reasoning (AR) map between human hand keypoints and robot components. Tak- ing advantage of focusing on action keypoints instead of irrel- evant visual cues, our method achieves leading performance on the CALVIN benchmark and real-world experiments. In few-shot scenarios, our AR-VRM outperforms previous meth- ods by large margins, underscoring the effectiveness of explicitly imitating human actions under data scarcity.

It involves the training of neural networks on large datasets composed of pairs of noisy and clean images.

Recently, several approaches have been developed to overcome this difficulty by whether artificially generating realistic clean/noisy image pairs, or training exclusively on noisy images. In this paper, we show that, contrary to popular belief, denoising networks specialized in the removal of Gaussian noise can be efficiently leveraged in favor of real-world image denoising, even without additional training. For this to happen, an appropriate variance-stabilizing transform (VST) has to be applied beforehand. We propose an algorithm termed Noise2VST for the learning of such a model-free VST. Our approach requires only the input noisy image and an off-the-shelf Gaussian denoiser.

Our data engine automatically annotates any number of object parts: 1755x more unique part types than existing datasets combined. By training on our annotated data with a simple contrastive objective, we obtain an open-world model that generalizes to any part in any object based on any text query. Even when evaluated zero-shot, we outperform existing methods on the datasets they train on. We achieve 260% improvement in mIoU and boost speed by 6x to 300x.

In this work, we introduce an auto-regressive model inspired by the expertise of Directors of Photography to generate artistic and expressive camera trajectories.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared to existing methods, GenDoP offers better controllability, finer-grained trajectory adjustments, and higher motion stability.

We first investigate spectrum aliasing problem in spectrum-based audio generation caused by existing joint diffusion methods. Through a comparative analysis of the VAE latent representation of spectra and RGB images, we identify that the failure arises from excessive suppression of high-frequency components due to the step-wise averaging operator. To address this issue, we propose Self-Loop Latent Swap, a frame-level bidirectional swap operator, applied to the overlapping region of adjacent views. Leveraging step-wise differentiated trajectories, this swap operator avoids spectrum distortion and adaptively enhances high-frequency components. Furthermore, to improve global cross-view consistency in non-overlapping regions, we introduce Reference-Guided Latent Swap, a unidirectional latent swap operator that provides a centralized reference trajectory to synchronize subview diffusions. By refining swap timing and intervals, we canachieve a balance between cross-view similarity and diversity in a feed-forward manner. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that SaFa significantly outperforms existing joint diffusion methods and even training-based methods in audio generation using both U-Net and DiT models. It also adapts well to panorama generation, achieving comparable performance with a 2 xto 20 xspeedup. The project website is available at https://swapforward.github.io",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The field of multimodal robot navigation in indoor environments has garnered significant attention in recent years. However, as tasks and methods become more advanced, the action decision systems tend to become more complex and operate as black-boxes. For a reliable system, the ability to explain or describe its decisions is crucial; however, there tends to be a trade-off in that explainable systems cannot outperform non-explainable systems in terms of performance. In this paper, we propose incorporating the task of describing actions in language into the reinforcement learning of navigation as an auxiliary task. Existing studies have found it difficult to incorporate describing actions into reinforcement learning due to the absence of ground-truth data. We address this issue by leveraging knowledge distillation from pre-trained description generation models, such as vision-language models. We comprehensively evaluate our approach across various navigation tasks, demonstrating that it can describe actions while attaining high navigation performance. Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art performance in the particularly challenging multimodal navigation task of semantic audio-visual navigation",

To explore this, we adopt visual game cognition as a testbed and select \"Monster Hunter: World\" as the target to construct a multimodal knowledge graph (MH-MMKG), which incorporates multi-modalities and intricate entity relations. We also design a series of challenging queries based on MH-MMKG to evaluate the models' ability for complex knowledge retrieval and reasoning.

For the most informative comparison, we utilize the same model architecture, WALT, across image and video generation objectives. Our results show that video generation pre-training consistently outperforms its image counterpart, though we find a striking range in the extent of this superiority. We further analyze features extracted from different layers and with varying noise levels, as well as the effect of model size and training budget on representation and generation quality.

    "abstract": "Low-quality or scarce data has posed significant challenges for training deep neural networks in practice. While classical data augmentation cannot contribute very different new data, diffusion models opens up a new door to build self-evolving AI by generating high-quality and diverse synthetic data through text-guided prompts. However, text-only guidance cannot control synthetic images' proximity to the original images, resulting in out-of-distribution data detrimental to the model performance. To overcome the limitation, we study image guidance to achieve a spectrum of interpolations between synthetic and real images. With stronger image guidance, the generated images are similar to the training data but hard to learn. While with weaker image guidance, the synthetic images will be easier for model but contribute to a larger distribution gap with the original data. The generated full spectrum of data enables us to build a novel \"Diffusion CurricuLum (DisCL)\". DisCL adjusts the image guidance level of image synthesis for each training stage: It identifies and focuses on hard samples for the model and assesses the most effective guidance level of synthetic images to improve hard data learning. We apply DisCL to two challenging tasks: long-tail (LT) classification and learning from low-quality data. It focuses on lower-guidance images of high-quality to learn prototypical features as a warm-up of learning higher-guidance images that might be weak on diversity or quality. Extensive experiments showcase a gain of 2.7% and 2.1% in OOD and ID macro-accuracy when applying DisCL to iWildCam dataset. On ImageNet-LT, DisCL improves the base model's tail-class accuracy from 4.4% to 23.64% and leads to a 4.02% improvement in all-class accuracy",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in 3D reconstruction techniques and vision-language models have fueled significant progress in 3D semantic understanding, a capability critical to robotics, autonomous driving, and virtual/augmented reality. However, methods that rely on 2D priors are prone to a critical challenge: cross-view semantic inconsistencies induced by occlusion, image blur, and view-dependent variations. These inconsistencies, when propagated via projection supervision, deteriorate the quality of 3D Gaussian semantic fields and introduce artifacts in the rendered outputs. To mitigate this limitation, we propose CCL-LGS, a novel framework that enforces view-consistent semantic supervision by integrating multi-view semantic cues. Specifically, our approach first employs a zero-shot tracker to align a set of SAM-generated 2D masks and reliably identify their corresponding categories. Next, we utilize CLIP to extract robust semantic encodings across views. Finally, our Contrastive Codebook Learning (CCL) module distills discriminative semantic features by enforcing intra-class compactness and inter-class distinctiveness. In contrast to previous methods that directly apply CLIP to imperfect masks, our framework explicitly resolves semantic conflicts while preserving category discriminability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CCL-LGS outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods. Our project page is available at https://epsilontl.github.io/CCL-LGS/",

By leveraging physics-informed losses as soft constraints or integrating simple physics models into neural networks, existing works often fail to learn complex motion physics, or doing so requires additional labels such as object types or masks. In this paper, we propose a new framework named **TRACE** to model the motion physics of complex dynamic 3D scenes. The key novelty of our approach is that, by formulating each 3D point as a rigid particle with size and orientation in space, we choose to directly learn a translation rotation dynamics system for each particle, explicitly estimating a complete set of physical parameters to govern the particle's motion over time. Extensive experiments on three existing dynamic datasets and one newly created challenging synthetic datasets demonstrate the extraordinary performance of our method over baselines in the task of future frame extrapolation.

POS aims to find a descent gradient direction that benefits both learning objectives, thereby facilitating model training. By dynamically assigning weights to the gradients at each iteration based on the model's learning status, POS effectively reconciles the intrinsic tension between the two objectives. Furthermore, we analyze POS from the perspective of gradient descent in random batch sampling and propose the Magnitude Enhancement Operation (MEO) to further unleash its potential by considering both direction and magnitude during gradient integration. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that integrating POS into existing semi-supervised segmentation methods yields consistent improvements across different data splits and architectures (CNN, Transformer), showcasing its effectiveness",

Existing alternatives typically require either per-subject optimization via trainable text embeddings or training specialized encoders for subject feature extraction on large-scale datasets. Such dependencies on training procedures fundamentally constrain their practical applications. More importantly, current methodologies fail to fully leverage the inherent zero-shot potential of modern diffusion transformers (e.g., the Flux series) for authentic subject-driven synthesis. To bridge this gap, we propose FreeCus, a genuinely training-free framework that activates DiT's capabilities through three key innovations: 1) We introduce a pivotal attention sharing mechanism that captures the subject's layout integrity while preserving crucial editing flexibility. 2) Through a straightforward analysis of DiT's dynamic shifting, we propose an upgraded variant that significantly improves fine-grained feature extraction. 3) We further integrate advanced Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to enrich cross-modal semantic representations. Extensive experiments reflect that our method successfully unlocks DiT's zero-shot ability for consistent subject synthesis across diverse contexts, achieving state-of-the-art or comparable results compared to approaches that require additional training.

Existing methods struggle to achieve streaming motion generation, e.g., diffusion models are constrained by pre-defined motion lengths, while GPT-based methods suffer from delayed response and error accumulation problem due to discretized non-causal tokenization. To solve these problems, we propose MotionStreamer, a novel framework that incorporates a continuous causal latent space into a probabilistic autoregressive model. The continuous latents mitigate information loss caused by discretization and effectively reduce error accumulation during long-term autoregressive generation. In addition, by establishing temporal causal dependencies between current and historical motion latents, our model fully utilizes the available information to achieve accurate online motion decoding. Experiments show that our method outperforms existing approaches while offering more applications, including multi-round generation, long-term generation, and dynamic motion composition.

Our approach comprises two stages. In the first stage, we enhance a pre-trained ViT with a nested elastic architecture that enables structural flexibility across MLP expansion ratio, number of attention heads, embedding dimension, and network depth. To preserve pre-trained knowledge and ensure stable adaptation, we adopt a curriculum-based training strategy that progressively increases elasticity. In the second stage, we design a lightweight router to select submodels according to computational budgets and downstream task demands. Initialized with Pareto-optimal configurations derived via a customized NSGA-II algorithm, the router is then jointly optimized with the backbone.

Additionally, this domain lacks a standardized benchmark, making it challenging to evaluate progress. To address these issues, we propose ArtEditor, a two-stage training framework. In the first stage, we train ArtEditor-Base, a general-purpose image editing model, on large-scale datasets to build a strong foundational capability.

To support research in this area, we contribute the DoodleArt dataset, the first benchmark specifically designed for customized image editing. DoodleArt features six high-quality artistic styles created by professional artists and designers, providing a valuable resource for evaluating and advancing future work.

First, we analyze the orthogonality of LoRA features in shallow VDM layers, enabling decoupled low-level controllability. Second, norm consistency is enforced across layers to stabilize fusion during complex camera motion combinations. Third, a controllable token is integrated into the diffusion transformer (DiT) to linearly adjust motion amplitudes for both cameras and objects with a modified self-attention mechanism to ensure decoupled control. Additionally, we extend LiON-LoRA to temporal generation by leveraging static-camera videos, unifying spatial and temporal controllability. Experiments demonstrate that LiON-LoRA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in trajectory control accuracy and motion strength adjustment, achieving superior generalization with minimal training data",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Video diffusion models (VDMs) have advanced significantly in recent years, enabling the generation of highly realistic videos and drawing the attention of the community in their potential as world simulators. However, despite their capabilities, VDMs often fail to produce physically plausible videos due to an inherent lack of understanding of physics, resulting in incorrect dynamics and event sequences. To address this limitation, we propose a novel two-stage image-to-video generation framework that explicitly incorporates physics with vision and language informed physical prior. In the first stage, we employ a Vision Language Model (VLM) as a coarse-grained motion planner, integrating chain-of-thought and physics-aware reasoning to predict a rough motion trajectories/changes that approximate real-world physical dynamics while ensuring the inter-frame consistency. In the second stage, we use the predicted motion trajectories/changes to guide the video generation of a VDM. As the predicted motion trajectories/changes are rough, noise is added during inference to provide freedom to the VDM in generating motion with more fine details. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our framework can produce physically plausible motion, and comparative evaluations highlight the notable superiority of our approach over existing methods.

    "abstract": "Relational video customization refers to the creation of personalized videos that depict user-specified relations between two subjects, a crucial task for comprehending real-world visual content. While existing methods can personalize subject appearances and motions, they still struggle with complex relational video customization, where precise relational modeling and high generalization across subject categories are essential. The primary challenge arises from the intricate spatial arrangements, layout variations, and nuanced temporal dynamics inherent in relations; consequently, current models tend to overemphasize irrelevant visual details rather than capturing meaningful interactions. To address these challenges, we propose DreamRelation, a novel approach that personalizes relations through a small set of exemplar videos, leveraging two key components: Relational Decoupling Learning and Relational Dynamics Enhancement. First, in Relational Decoupling Learning, we disentangle relations from subject appearances using relation LoRA triplet and hybrid mask training strategy, ensuring better generalization across diverse relationships. Furthermore, we determine the optimal design of relation LoRA triplet by analyzing the distinct roles of the query, key, and value features within MM-DiT's attention mechanism, making DreamRelation the first relational video generation framework with explainable components. Second, in Relational Dynamics Enhancement, we introduce space-time relational contrastive loss, which prioritizes relational dynamics while minimizing the reliance on detailed subject appearances. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DreamRelation outperforms state-of-the-art methods in relational video customization. Project page at: https://dreamrelation.github.io/",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Spatio-temporal consistency is a critical topic in video generation. A qualified generated video segment must ensure plot plausibility and coherence while maintaining visual consistency of objects and scenes across varying viewpoints. Prior research, especially in open-source projects, primarily focuses on either temporal or spatial consistency, or their basic combination, such as appending a camera-movement description after a prompt without constraining its outcomes. However, camera movement may introduce new objects to the scene or eliminate existing ones, thereby affecting the preceding narrative. Especially in videos with numerous camera movements, the interplay between multiple plots becomes increasingly complex. This paper introduces and examines integral spatio-temporal consistency, considering the synergy between plot progression and camera techniques, and the long-term impact of prior content on subsequent generation. Our research encompasses dataset construction through to model development. Initially, we constructed DropletVideo-10M, which comprises 10 million videos that feature dynamic camera motion and object actions. With an average length of 206 words, the captions offer detailed accounts of camera movements. Following this, we developed the DropletVideo model, which excels in preserving spatio-temporal coherence during video generation. The work has been open-sourced: https://dropletx.github.io/",

Multiple heads intuitively enable different parallel processes over the same input. Yet, they also obscure the attribution of each input patch to the output of a model. We propose a novel 1-head Transformer Attention Bottleneck (TAB) layer, inserted after the traditional MHSA architecture, to serve as an attention bottleneck for interpretability and intervention. Unlike standard self-attention, TAB constrains the total attention over all patches to \\in [0, 1]. That is, when the total attention is 0, no visual information is propagated further into the network, and the vision-language model (VLM) would default to a generic, image-independent response. To demonstrate the advantages of TAB, we train VLMs with TAB to perform image-difference captioning. Over three datasets, our models perform similarly to baseline VLMs in captioning but the bottleneck is superior in localizing changes and in identifying when no changes occur. TAB is the first architecture to enable users to debug by editing attention, which often produces expected outputs by VLMs",

    "abstract": "Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have emerged as a powerful architecture for image and video generation, offering superior quality and scalability. However, their practical application suffers from inherent dynamic feature instability, leading to error amplification during cached inference. Through systematic analysis, we identify the absence of long-range feature preservation mechanisms as the root cause of unstable feature propagation and perturbation sensitivity. To this end, we propose Skip-DiT, a novel DiT variant enhanced with Long-Skip-Connections (LSCs) - the key efficiency component in U-Nets. Theoretical spectral norm and visualization analysis demonstrate how LSCs stabilize feature dynamics. Skip-DiT architecture and its stabilized dynamic feature enable an efficient statical caching mechanism that reuses deep features across timesteps while updating shallow components. Extensive experiments across image and video generation tasks demonstrate that Skip-DiT achieves: (1) **4.4x** training acceleration and faster convergence, (2) **1.5-2x** inference acceleration without quality loss and high fidelity to original output, outperforming existing DiT caching methods across various quantitative metrics.

It is able to accomplish the pre-training of the model's backbone network through a diffusion process of gradual denoising. We aggregate the potential features extracted from the backbone network, input them as conditions into the subsequent diffusion model, and direct the point-to-point mapping relationship of the noisy point clouds at neighboring time steps, so as to generate high-quality point clouds and at the same time better perform various downstream tasks of the point clouds.We also introduce a bi-directional covariate attention (DXCA-Attention) mechanism for capturing complex feature interactions, fusing local and global features, and improving the detail recovery of point clouds.In addition, we propose a density-adaptive sampling strategy, which can help the model dynamically adjust the sampling strategy between different time steps, and guide the model to pay more attention to the denser regions in the point cloud, thus improving the effectiveness of the model in point cloud recovery.Our PreDifPoint framework achieves more competitive results on various real-world datasets. Specifically, PreDifPoint achieves an overall accuracy of 87.96%, which is 0.35% higher than PointDif, on the classification task on PB-T50-395RS, a variant of ScanObjectNN dataset",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that deep learning models are vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to infer whether a data record was used to train a target model or not. To analyze and study these vulnerabilities, various MIA methods have been proposed. Despite the significance and popularity of MIAs, existing works on MIAs are limited in providing guarantees on the false discovery rate (FDR), which refers to the expected proportion of false discoveries among the identified positive discoveries. However, it is very challenging to ensure the false discovery rate guarantees, because the underlying distribution is usually unknown, and the estimated non-member probabilities often exhibit interdependence. To tackle the above challenges, in this paper, we design a novel membership inference attack method, which can provide the guarantees on the false discovery rate. Additionally, we show that our method can also provide the marginal probability guarantee on labeling true non-member data as member data. Notably, our method can work as a wrapper that can be seamlessly integrated with existing MIA methods in a post-hoc manner, while also providing the FDR control. We perform the theoretical analysis for our method.

In this paper, we introduce EmbodiedSplat, a novel approach that personalizes policy training by efficiently capturing the deployment environment and fine-tuning policies within the reconstructed scenes. Our method leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) and the Habitat-Sim simulator to bridge the gap between realistic scene capture and effective training environments. Using iPhone-captured deployment scenes, we reconstruct meshes via GS, enabling training in settings that closely approximate real-world conditions. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of training strategies, pre-training datasets, and mesh reconstruction techniques, evaluating their impact on sim-to-real predictivity in real-world scenarios.

However, these methods often prioritize clustering common semantics within the dataset, while overlooking the diverse details of individual objects. Consequently, this results in suboptimal reconstruction fidelity, especially at low bitrates. To address this issue, we introduce a Dual-generative Latent Fusion (DLF) paradigm. DLF decomposes the latent into semantic and detail elements, compressing them through two distinct branches. The semantic branch clusters high-level information into compact tokens, while the detail branch encodes perceptually critical details to enhance the overall fidelity. Additionally, we propose a cross-branch interactive design to reduce redundancy between the two branches, thereby minimizing the overall bit cost. Experimental results demonstrate the impressive reconstruction quality of DLF even below 0.01 bits per pixel (bpp). On the CLIC2020 test set, our method achieves bitrate savings of up to 27.93% on LPIPS and 53.55% on DISTS compared to MS-ILLM. Furthermore, DLF surpasses recent diffusion-based codecs in visual fidelity while maintaining a comparable level of generative realism. Project: https://dlfcodec.github.io/",

    "abstract": "Panoramic Image Generation (PIG) aims to create coherent images of arbitrary lengths. Most existing methods fall in the joint diffusion paradigm, but their complex and heuristic crop connection designs often limit their ability to achieve multilevel coherence. By deconstructing this challenge into its core components, we find it naturally aligns with next-token prediction, leading us to adopt an autoregressive (AR) paradigm for PIG modeling. However, existing visual AR (VAR) models are limited to fixed-size generation, lacking the capability to produce panoramic images. In this paper, we propose PanoLlama, a novel framework that achieves endless and coherent panorama generation with the autoregressive paradigm. Our approach develops a training-free strategy that utilizes token redirection to overcome the size limitations of existing VAR models, enabling next-crop prediction in both horizontal and vertical directions. This refreshes the PIG pipeline while achieving SOTA performance in coherence (47.50%), fidelity(28.16%), and aesthetics (15%). Additionally, PanoLlama supports applications other PIG methods cannot achieve, including mask-free layout control, multi-scale and multi-guidance synthesis. To facilitate standardized evaluation, we also establish a dataset with 1,000 prompts spanning 100+ themes, providing a new testing benchmark for PIG research",

Optimizing the field towards satisfying desired properties, such as the input points being on the surface defined by the field, provides a principled way to obtain globally consistent surface normals. However, we show that the existing winding number formulation for point clouds is a poor approximation near the input surface points, diverging as the query point approaches a surface point. This is problematic for methods that rely on the accuracy and stability of this approximation, requiring heuristics to compensate. Instead, we derive a more accurate approximation that is properly bounded and converges to the correct value. We then examine two distinct approaches that optimize for globally consistent normals using point cloud winding numbers. We show how the original unbounded formulation influences key design choices in both methods and demonstrate that substituting our formulation yields substantive improvements with respect to normal estimation and surface reconstruction accuracy",

Recent approaches have framed the task as pixel-based generation either as a whole or part-by-part, neglecting the intrinsic and contextual relationships among individual strokes, such as the shape and spatial positioning of both proximal and distant strokes. To overcome these limitations, we propose treating each stroke within a sketch as an entity and introducing a vector-quantized (VQ) stroke representation for fine-grained sketch generation. Our method follows a two-stage framework - in stage one, we decouple each stroke's shape and location information to ensure the VQ representation prioritizes stroke shape learning. In stage two, we feed the precise and compact representation into an auto-decoding Transformer to incorporate stroke semantics, positions, and shapes into the generation process. By utilizing tokenized stroke representation, our approach generates strokes with high fidelity and facilitates novel applications, such as text or class label conditioned generation and sketch completion.

While recent methods have improved modality alignment between sketches and RGB images, the challenge of subjective style variation, where sketches exhibit diverse and unpredictable appearances, remains largely unresolved.A natural solution is to train on a diverse range of pedestrian sketches, but the high cost of large-scale pedestrian sketch collection makes this impractical.In contrast, sketches of general categories (e.g., animals, objects) exhibit diverse style variations and are accessible at a low cost, making them an intuitive and scalable alternative for enhancing style generalization in sketch re-ID.To this end, we propose Adaptive Incremental Prompt-tuning (AIP), the first approach that explores cross-category subjective style generalization for sketch re-ID. Specifically, AIP incorporates a multi-stage prompt-tuning strategy that learns a broad but shareable spectrum of sketch styles from non-pedestrian data. In addition, an input-sensitive prompt generator enables the model to adapt dynamically to unseen sketch styles.Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the performance gain is not merely attributed to the inclusion of additional data but rather to the effectiveness of AIP in leveraging non-pedestrian data for subjective style generalization.

Traditionally, these models use surface meshes, which pose challenges in efficiently handling interactions with other geometric entities, such as objects and scenes, typically represented as meshes or point clouds. To address this limitation, recent research has explored volumetric neural implicit body models. However, existing works are either insufficiently robust for complex human articulations or impose high computational and memory costs, limiting their widespread use. To this end, we introduce VolumetricSMPL, a neural volumetric body model that leverages Neural Blend Weights (NBW) to generate compact, yet efficient MLP decoders. Unlike prior approaches that rely on large MLPs, NBW dynamically blends a small set of learned weight matrices using predicted shape- and pose-dependent coefficients, significantly improving computational efficiency while preserving expressiveness. VolumetricSMPL outperforms prior volumetric occupancy model COAP with 10x faster inference, 6x lower GPU memory usage, enhanced accuracy, and a Signed Distance Function (SDF) for efficient and differentiable contact modeling. We demonstrate VolumetricSMPL's strengths across four challenging tasks: (1) reconstructing human-object interactions from in-the-wild images, (2) recovering human meshes in 3D scenes from egocentric views, (3) scene-constrained motion synthesis, and (4) resolving self-intersections.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The rapid development of AIGC technology has enabled highly realistic forged images to deceive human perception, posing serious risks across many areas. Current deepfake image detection methods primarily identify forgeries by extracting handcrafted features, deep features, and frequency-domain features. While these features contain forgery traces, they also include a substantial amount of the image's semantic information, which interferes with the precision and generalization of forgery detection models. To tackle these challenges, this paper introduces a novel forgery image identification method based on the Spatial-Temporal Forgery Trace (STFT). Motivated by the fact that forgery images are more easily fitted to a specific distribution than real images, the STFT method approaches the issue from a forged image distribution modeling perspective, employing generative diffusion models to meticulously capture the temporal distribution of images. It further models the relationship between temporal feature variations and spatially corresponding temporal features, treating them as temporal and spatial forgery traces. Moreover, STFT incorporates frequency-domain features as weighting factors to accelerate the localization of spatio-temporal forgery traces. Experiments demonstrate that by integrating spatial, temporal, and frequency perspectives within the latent space, STFT effectively captures subtle spatio-temporal forgery traces, exhibiting strong robustness and generalizability. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods on major benchmark datasets in the field. The source code for STFT is available at \\href https://anonymous.4open.science/r/STFT-B552/",

    "abstract": "Learning with noisy labels is a crucial task for training accurate deep neural networks. To mitigate label noise, prior studies have proposed various robust loss functions, particularly symmetric losses. Nevertheless, symmetric losses usually suffer from the underfitting issue due to the overly strict constraint. To address this problem, the Active Passive Loss (APL) jointly optimizes an active and a passive loss to mutually enhance the overall fitting ability. Within APL, symmetric losses have been successfully extended, yielding advanced robust loss functions. Despite these advancements, emerging theoretical analyses indicate that asymmetric losses, a new class of robust loss functions, possess superior properties compared to symmetric losses. However, existing asymmetric losses are not compatible with advanced optimization frameworks such as APL, limiting their potential and applicability. Motivated by this theoretical gap and the prospect of asymmetric losses, we extend the asymmetric loss to the more complex passive loss scenario and propose the Asymetric Mean Square Error (AMSE), a novel asymmetric loss. We rigorously establish the necessary and sufficient condition under which AMSE satisfies the asymmetric condition. By substituting the traditional symmetric passive loss in APL with our proposed AMSE, we introduce a novel robust loss framework termed Joint Asymmetric Loss (JAL).

To address these challenges, we propose a novel colorization framework that integrates both temporal and structural information. Using multiple reference keyframes, our method effectively captures temporal information across frames, enhancing the accuracy of colorization for transitional frames. In addition, we leverage structural information through a matching-based approach that ensures precise segment alignment across frames.

Common sources of spherical motion are a person capturing a stereo panorama with a phone held in an outstretched hand, or a hemi-spherical camera rig used for multi-view scene capture. However, traditional structure-from-motion pipelines tend to fail on spherical camera motion sequences, especially when the camera is facing outward. Building upon prior work addressing the calibrated case, we explore uncalibrated reconstruction from spherical motion, assuming a fixed but unknown focal length parameter. We show that, although two-view spherical motion is always a critical case, self-calibration is possible from three or more views. Through analysis of the relationship between focal length and spherical relative pose, we devise a global structure-from-motion approach for uncalibrated reconstruction.

Traditional methods use optical flow models to directly estimate long-range motion, but they often suffer from appearance drifting without considering temporal consistency. Recent point tracking algorithms usually depend on sliding windows for indirect information propagation from the first frame to the current one, which is slow and less effective for long-range tracking. To account for temporal consistency and enable efficient information propagation, we present a lightweight and fast model with Streaming memory for dense POint Tracking and online video processing. The SPOT framework features three core components: a customized memory reading module for feature enhancement, a sensory memory for short-term motion dynamics modeling, and a visibility-guided splatting module for accurate information propagation. This combination enables SPOT to perform dense point tracking with state-of-the-art accuracy on the CVO benchmark, as well as comparable or superior performance to offline models on sparse tracking benchmarks such as TAP-Vid and RoboTAP. Notably, SPOT with 10x smaller parameter numbers operates at least 2x faster than previous state-of-the-art models while maintaining the best performance on CVO.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "This paper addresses key limitations in current Semi-Supervised Object Detection (SSOD) frameworks, focusing on issues related to pseudo-label quality, confidence bias, and inefficient query generation. Traditional methods, including CNN-based and DETR-based architectures, often face challenges such as noisy pseudo-labels, overfitting to common object categories, and consequently face difficulty detecting rare objects. Specifically, recent DETR-based SSOD approaches struggle with the one-to-many assignment strategy, which produces noisy pseudo-labels and overlapping predictions, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose STEP-DETR, a transformer-based SSOD framework. STEP-DETR introduces Super Teacher to generate higher-quality pseudo-labels and improve the student's learning process. Furthermore, STEP-DETR proposes Pseudo-Label Text Queries, which incorporate text embeddings from Super Teacher, balancing the student's confidence across common and rare categories, thereby mitigating confidence bias and enhancing generalization. Moreover, Denoising Text Guided Object Queries synthesizes query-label pairs for foreground and background using contrastive learning, enabling the model to better distinguish objects from background noise. To further boost performance and training efficiency, a Query Refinement Module is incorporated to filter out redundant denoising queries. On MS-COCO and Pascal VOC benchmarks, STEP-DETR outperforms state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving semi-supervised object detection. Notably, with just 10% labeled data, it achieves 45.4 mAP, surpassing the baseline Semi-DETR by 1.9 mAP",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Resolving closely-spaced small targets in dense clusters presents a significant challenge in infrared imaging, as the overlapping signals hinder precise determination of their quantity, sub-pixel positions, and radiation intensities. While deep learning has advanced the field of infrared small target detection, its application to closely-spaced infrared small targets has not yet been explored. This gap exists primarily due to the complexity of separating superimposed characteristics and the lack of an open-source infrastructure. In this work, we propose the Dynamic Iterative Shrinkage Thresholding Network (DISTA-Net), which reconceptualizes traditional sparse reconstruction within a dynamic framework. DISTA-Net adaptively generates convolution weights and thresholding parameters to tailor the reconstruction process in real time. To the best of our knowledge, DISTA-Net is the first deep learning model designed specifically for the unmixing of closely-spaced infrared small targets, achieving superior sub-pixel detection accuracy. Moreover, we have established the first open-source ecosystem to foster further research in this field. This ecosystem comprises three key components: (1) CSIST-100K, a publicly available benchmark dataset; (2) CSO-mAP, a custom evaluation metric for sub-pixel detection; and (3) GrokCSO, an open-source toolkit featuring DISTA-Net and other state-of-the-art models, available at https://github.com/GrokCV/GrokCSO",

Recently, great advances are made by the end-to-end methods, thanks to deep learning techniques, but they face limitations of representation inconsistency in multivariable integration and struggle to effectively capture the dependency between variables, which is required in complex weather systems. Treating different variables as distinct modalities and applying a two-stage training approach from multimodal models can partially alleviate this issue, but due to the inconformity in training tasks between the two stages, the results are often suboptimal. To address these challenges, we propose an implicit two-stage training method, configuring separate encoders and decoders for each variable. In detailed, in the first stage, the Translator is frozen while the Encoders and Decoders learn a shared latent space, in the second stage, the Encoders and Decoders are frozen, and the Translator captures inter-variable interactions for prediction. Besides, by introducing a self-attention mechanism for multivariable fusion in the latent space, the performance achieves further improvements. Empirically, extensive experiments shows state-of-the-art performance of our method.

    "abstract": "Creating high-fidelity and editable head avatars is a pivotal challenge in computer vision and graphics, boosting many AR/VR applications. While recent advancements have achieved photorealistic renderings and plausible animation, head editing, especially real-time appearance editing, remains challenging due to the implicit representation and entangled modeling of the geometry and global appearance. To address this, we propose Surface-Volumetric Gaussian Head Avatar (SVG-Head), a novel hybrid representation that explicitly models the geometry with 3D Gaussians bound on a FLAME mesh and leverages disentangled texture images to capture the global appearance. Technically, it contains two types of Gaussians, in which surface Gaussians explicitly model the appearance of head avatars using learnable texture images, facilitating real-time texture editing, while volumetric Gaussians enhance the reconstruction quality of non-Lambertian regions (e.g., lips and hair). To model the correspondence between 3D world and texture space, we provide a mesh-aware Gaussian UV mapping method, which leverages UV coordinates given by the FLAME mesh to obtain sharp texture images and real-time rendering speed. A hierarchical optimization strategy is further designed to pursue the optimal performance in both reconstruction quality and editing flexibility. Experiments on the NeRSemble dataset show that SVG-Head not only generates high-fidelity rendering results, but also is the first method to obtain explicit texture images for Gaussian head avatars and support real-time appearance editing",

    "abstract": "Remote sensing image segmentation faces persistent challenges in distinguishing morphologically similar categories and adapting to diverse scene variations. While existing methods rely on implicit representation learning paradigms, they often fail to dynamically adjust semantic embeddings according to contextual cues, leading to suboptimal performance in fine-grained scenarios such as cloud thickness differentiation. This work introduces a dynamic dictionary learning framework that explicitly models class ID embeddings through iterative refinement. The core contribution lies in a novel dictionary construction mechanism, where class-aware semantic embeddings are progressively updated via multi-stage alternating cross-attention querying between image features and dictionary embeddings. This process enables adaptive representation learning tailored to input-specific characteristics, effectively resolving ambiguities in intra-class heterogeneity and inter-class homogeneity. To further enhance discriminability, a contrastive constraint is applied to the dictionary space, ensuring compact intra-class distributions while maximizing inter-class separability.

Existing methods, primarily designed for unimodal settings, often fall short in addressing this dual requirement. In this work, we present QUestion-only replay with Attention Distillation (QUAD), a novel approach for VQACL that leverages only past task questions for regularization. By eliminating the need to store visual data, QUAD not only reduces memory overhead, but also alleviates privacy concerns. Our method introduces a Question-only Replay mechanism that selectively reuses prior task questions to counteract overfitting to the answer space of the current task, addressing the problem out of answer set. Complementing this, we propose Attention Consistency Distillation to enforce both intra-modal and inter-modal attention consistency across tasks, preserving essential visual-linguistic associations.

However, some internal regions of pathological images may inevitably exhibit various degradation issues, including low resolution, image blurring, and image noising, which will affect disease diagnosis, staging, and risk stratification.Existing pathological image restoration methods were mainly based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) to improve image quality, which are limited by the inherent instability and loss of structural details, often resulting in artifacts in the restored images.Large scale of whole slide images (WSIs) also makes it hard for efficient processing and restoration. To address these limitations, we propose a conditional visual autoregressive model (CVARPath) for next-scale token prediction, guided by the degraded tokens from the current scale. We introduce a novel framework that employs quantified encoders specifically designed for pathological image generation, which learns consistent sparse vocabulary tokens through self-supervised contrastive learning. Furthermore, our method efficiently compresses image patches into compact degraded sparse tokens at smaller scales and reconstructs high-quality large-scale whole slide images (WSIs). This is achieved using only an 8x8 vocabulary index for 256x256 images while maintaining minimal reconstruction loss. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances image quality, achieving an approximately 30% improvement in mean Frechet inception distance (FID) compared to popular conditional GANs and diffusion models across various degradation scenarios in pathological images",

In this paper, we address the unique challenge of channel-heterogeneous deterioration in film negatives and introduce BlueNeg, the first high-quality 35mm negative film dataset specifically designed for restoration in this context. Our work aims to spotlight this underexplored area of image restoration on channel-heterogeneous deterioration. A key challenge in evaluating restoration performance is the absence of ground truth, as many negatives are already contaminated. To overcome this, we utilize printed photographs from the same negatives as proxies for quantitative assessment. These prints, while affected by spatially invariant color fading, are less affected from channel-heterogeneous degradation. We propose a reverse-printing process to estimate pseudo-ground truth from the prints and introduce a dedicated evaluation protocol. Our empirical analysis shows that existing restoration methods struggle with this dataset, highlighting the need for specialized techniques. We hope that BlueNeg and our evaluation framework will inspire further research in legacy photograph restoration, contributing to the digital preservation of historical moments for archival use.

We argue that egocentric systems must additionally detect physiological states to capture a person's attention and situational responses, which are critical for context-aware behavior modeling. In this paper, we propose egoPPG, a novel vision task for egocentric systems to recover a person's cardiac activity to aid downstream vision tasks. We introduce PulseFormer, a method to extract heart rate as a key indicator of physiological state from the eye tracking cameras on unmodified egocentric vision systems. PulseFormer continuously estimates the photoplethysmogram (PPG) from areas around the eyes and fuses motion cues from the headset's inertial measurement unit to track HR values. We demonstrate egoPPG's downstream benefit for a key task on EgoExo4D, an existing egocentric dataset for which we find PulseFormer's estimates of HR to improve proficiency estimation by 14%. To train and validate PulseFormer, we collected a dataset of 13+ hours of eye tracking videos from Project Aria and contact-based PPG signals as well as an electrocardiogram (ECG) for ground-truth HR values. Similar to EgoExo4D, 25 participants performed diverse everyday activities such as office work, cooking, dancing, and exercising, which induced significant natural motion and HR variation (44-164 bpm). Our model robustly estimates HR (MAE=7.67 bpm) and captures patterns (r=0.85). Our results show how egocentric systems may unify environmental and physiological tracking to better understand users and that egoPPG as a complementary task provides meaningful augmentations for existing datasets and tasks.

Most existing methods rely on segmentation models' uncertainty as anomaly scores, often resulting in false positives - especially at ambiguous regions like boundaries, where segmentation models inherently exhibit high uncertainty. Additionally, it is challenging to define a suitable threshold to generate anomaly masks, especially with the inconsistencies in predictions across consecutive frames. We propose DetSeg, a novel paradigm that helps incorporate object-level understanding. DetSeg first detects all objects in the open world and then suppresses in-distribution (ID) bounding boxes, leaving only OoD proposals. These proposals can either help previous methods eliminate false positives (DetSeg-\\mathcal R ), or generate binary anomaly masks without complex threshold search when combined with a box-prompted segmentation module (DetSeg-\\mathcal S ). Additionally, we introduce vanishing point guided Hungarian matching (VPHM) to smooth the prediction results within a video clip, mitigating abrupt variations of predictions between consecutive frames. Comprehensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that DetSeg significantly improves performance, reducing the FPR\\it _ 95 of previous methods by up to 37.45%, offering a more robust and practical solution.

Additionally, modern cameras can capture images in an HDR format but convert them to SDR to ensure maximum compatibility with existing workflows and legacy displays. To support both SDR and HDR, new encoding formats are emerging that store additional metadata in SDR images in the form of a gain map. When applied to the SDR image, the gain map recovers the HDR version of the image as needed. These gain maps, however, are typically down-sampled and encoded using standard image compression, such as JPEG and HEIC, which can result in unwanted artifacts. In this paper, we propose to use a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network to encode the gain map. The MLP is optimized using the SDR image information as input and provides superior performance in terms of HDR reconstruction. Moreover, the MLP-based approach uses a fixed memory footprint (10 KB) and requires no additional adjustments to accommodate different image sizes or encoding parameters.

To this end, we propose a paired-to-paired data synthesis pipeline capable of generating well-calibrated extremely low-light RAW images at three precise illuminance ranges of 0.01-0.1 lux, 0.001-0.01 lux, and 0.0001-0.001 lux, together with high-quality sRGB references to comprise a large-scale paired dataset named See-in-the-Extremely-Dark (SIED) to benchmark low-light RAW image enhancement approaches. Furthermore, we propose a diffusion-based framework that leverages the generative ability and intrinsic denoising property of diffusion models to restore visually pleasing results from extremely low-SNR RAW inputs, in which an Adaptive Illumination Correction Module (AICM) and a color consistency loss are introduced to ensure accurate exposure correction and color restoration.

However, existing methods often lack robustness against various transformations primarily including distortions, image regeneration, and adversarial perturbation, creating real-world challenges. In this work, we introduce SpecGuard, a novel watermarking approach for robust and invisible image watermarking. Unlike prior approaches, we embed the message inside hidden convolution layers by converting from the spatial domain to the frequency domain using spectral projection of a higher frequency band that is decomposed by wavelet projection. Spectral projection employs Fast Fourier Transform approximation to transform spatial data into the frequency domain efficiently. In the encoding phase, a strength factor enhances resilience against diverse attacks, including adversarial, geometric, and regeneration-based distortions, ensuring the preservation of copyrighted information. Meanwhile, the decoder leverages Parseval's theorem to effectively learn and extract the watermark pattern, enabling accurate retrieval under challenging transformations. We evaluate the proposed SpecGuard based on the embedded watermark's invisibility, capacity, and robustness. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the proposed SpecGuard outperforms the state-of-the-art models.

In this work, we revisit the architectural design of native multimodal models (NMMs)--those trained from the ground up on all modalities--and conduct an extensive scaling laws study, spanning 457 trained models with different architectures and training mixtures. Our investigation reveals no inherent advantage to late-fusion architectures over early-fusion ones, which do not rely on image encoders or tokenizers. On the contrary, early fusion exhibits stronger performance at lower parameter counts, is more efficient to train, and is easier to deploy.

To address these issues, we introduce MagicID, a novel framework designed to directly promote the generation of identity-consistent and dynamically rich videos tailored to user preferences. Specifically, we propose constructing pairwise preference video data with explicit identity and dynamic rewards for preference learning, instead of sticking to the traditional self-reconstruction. To address the constraints of customized preference data, we introduce a hybrid sampling strategy. This approach first prioritizes identity preservation by leveraging static videos derived from reference images, then enhances dynamic motion quality in the generated videos using a Frontier-based sampling method. By utilizing these hybrid preference pairs, we optimize the model to align with the reward differences between pairs of customized preferences.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "This paper studies the few-shot segmentation (FSS) task, which aims to segment objects belonging to unseen categories in a query image by learning a model on a small number of well-annotated support samples. Our analysis of two mainstream FSS paradigms reveals that the predictions made by prototype learning methods are usually conservative, while those of affinity learning methods tend to be more aggressive. This observation motivates us to balance the conservative and aggressive information captured by these two types of FSS frameworks so as to improve the segmentation performance. To achieve this, we propose a Prototype-Affinity Hybrid Network (PAHNet), which introduces a Prototype-guided Feature Enhancement (PFE) module and an Attention Score Calibration (ASC) module in each attention block of an affinity learning model (called affinity learner). These two modules utilize the predictions generated by a pre-trained prototype learning model (called prototype predictor) to enhance the foreground information in support and query image representations and suppress the mismatched foreground-background (FG-BG) relationships between them, respectively. In this way, the aggressiveness of the affinity learner can be effectively mitigated, thereby eventually increasing the segmentation accuracy of our PAHNet method. Experimental results show that PAHNet outperforms most recently proposed methods across 1-shot and 5-shot settings on both PASCAL-5^i and COCO-20^i datasets, suggesting its effectiveness.

Traditional 3D generation approaches using single-layer diffusion methods can produce detailed scenes for individual objects but struggle with high-resolution, large-scale outdoor environments due to scalability limitations. Recent hierarchical diffusion models tackle this by progressively scaling up low-resolution scenes. However, they often sample fine details from pure noise rather than from the coarse scene, which limits the efficiency. We propose a novel cube-absorb discrete diffusion (CADD) model, which employs low-resolution scenes as the base state in the diffusion process to generate fine details, eliminating the need to sample entirely from noise. Moreover, we introduce the Sparse Cube Diffusion Transformer (SCDT), a transformer-based model with a sparse cube attention operator, optimized for generating large-scale sparse voxel scenes.

    "abstract": "Text-to-3D generation based on score distillation of pre-trained 2D diffusion models has gained increasing interest, with variational score distillation (VSD) as a remarkable example. VSD proves that vanilla score distillation can be improved by introducing an extra score-based model, which characterizes the distribution of images rendered from 3D models, to correct the distillation gradient. Despite the theoretical foundations, VSD, in practice, is likely to suffer from slow and sometimes ill-posed convergence.In this paper, we perform an in-depth investigation of the interplay between the introduced score model and the 3D model, and find that there exists a mismatching problem between LoRA and 3D distributions in practical implementation. We can simply adjust their optimization order to improve the generation quality. By doing so, the score model looks ahead to the current 3D state and hence yields more reasonable corrections. Nevertheless, naive lookahead VSD may suffer from unstable training in practice due to the potential over-fitting. To address this, we propose to use a linearized variant of the model for score distillation, giving rise to the Linearized Lookahead Variational Score Distillation (L^2-VSD). L^2-VSD can be realized efficiently with forward-mode autodiff functionalities of existing deep learning libraries. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of L^2-VSD, revealing its clear superiority over prior score distillation-based methods.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recently, the generation of dynamic 3D objects from a video has shown impressive results. Existing methods directly optimize Gaussians using whole information in frames. However, when dynamic regions are interwoven with static regions within frames, particularly if the static regions account for a large proportion, existing methods often overlook information in dynamic regions and are prone to overfitting on static regions. This leads to producing results with blurry textures. We consider that decoupling dynamic-static features to enhance dynamic representations can alleviate this issue. Thus, we propose a dynamic-static feature decoupling module (DSFD). Along temporal axes, it regards the regions of current frame features that possess significant differences relative to reference frame features as dynamic features. Conversely, the remaining parts are the static features. Then, we acquire decoupled features driven by dynamic features and current frame features. Moreover, to further enhance the dynamic representation of decoupled features from different viewpoints and ensure accurate motion prediction, we design a temporal-spatial similarity fusion module (TSSF). Along spatial axes, it adaptively selects similar information of dynamic regions. Hinging on the above, we construct a novel approach, DS4D. Experimental results verify our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in video-to-4D.

To explore the possibility of using diffusion representations in handling data heterogeneity, we propose a novel diffusion-inspired Federated paradigm with Diffusion Representation Collaboration, termed FedDifRC, leveraging meaningful guidance of diffusion models to mitigate data heterogeneity. The key idea is to construct text-driven diffusion contrasting and noise-driven diffusion regularization, aiming to provide abundant class-related semantic information and consistent convergence signals. On the one hand, we exploit the conditional feedback from the diffusion model for different text prompts to build a text-driven contrastive learning strategy. On the other hand, we introduce a noise-driven consistency regularization to align local instances with diffusion denoising representations, constraining the optimization region in the feature space. In addition, FedDifRC can be extended to a self-supervised scheme without relying on any labeled data.

    "abstract": "Reconstructing 4D dynamic scenes from casually captured monocular videos is valuable but highly challenging, as each timestamp is observed from a single viewpoint. We introduce Vivid4D, a novel approach that enhances 4D monocular video synthesis by augmenting observation views -- synthesizing multi-view videos from a monocular input. Unlike existing methods that either solely leverage geometric priors for supervision or use generative priors while overlooking geometry, we integrate both. This reformulates view augmentation as a video inpainting task, where observed views are warped into new viewpoints based on monocular depth priors. To achieve this, we train a video inpainting model on unposed web videos with synthetically generated masks that mimic warping occlusions, ensuring spatially and temporally consistent completion of missing regions. To further mitigate inaccuracies in monocular depth priors, we introduce an iterative view augmentation strategy and a robust reconstruction loss. Experiments demonstrate that our method effectively improves monocular 4D scene reconstruction and completion",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recent works on accelerating Vision-Language Models achieve strong performance across a variety of vision-language tasks despite highly compressing visual information. In this work, we examine the popular acceleration approach of early pruning of visual tokens inside the language model. Surprisingly, we find that while strong performance is maintained across many tasks, it exhibits drastically different behavior for a subset of vision-centric tasks such as localization. Upon further investigation, we uncover a core issue with the acceleration approach where most tokens towards the top of the image are pruned away. Yet, on many benchmarks aiming to evaluate vision-centric capabilities, strong performance persists with the flawed pruning strategy, highlighting these benchmarks' limited ability to assess fine-grained visual capabilities. Based on these findings, we propose FEATHER (Fast and Effective Acceleration wiTH Ensemble cRiteria), a straightforward approach that resolves the discovered early-layer pruning issue and further enhances the preservation of relevant tokens via multistage pruning with early uniform sampling to ensure broad image coverage. With comparable computational savings, we find that FEATHER achieves more than 5x performance improvement on the vision-centric localization benchmarks compared to the original acceleration approach",

In this paper, we investigate how monocular depth estimates can be used for relative pose estimation. In particular, we are interested in answering the question whether using MDEs improves results over traditional point-based methods. We propose a novel framework for estimating the relative pose of two cameras from point correspondences with associated monocular depths. Since depth predictions are typically defined up to an unknown scale or even both unknown scale and shift parameters, our solvers jointly estimate the scale or both the scale and shift parameters along with the relative pose. We derive efficient solvers considering different types of depths for three camera configurations: (1) two calibrated cameras, (2) two cameras with an unknown shared focal length, and (3) two cameras with unknown different focal lengths. Our new solvers outperform state-of-the-art depth-aware solvers in terms of speed and accuracy. In extensive real experiments on multiple datasets and with various MDEs, we discuss which depth-aware solvers are preferable in which situation.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) has recently emerged as a promising technique for capturing complex dynamic 3D scenes with high fidelity. It utilizes a 4D Gaussian representation and a GPU-friendly rasterizer, enabling rapid rendering speeds. Despite its advantages, 4DGS faces significant challenges, notably the requirement of millions of 4D Gaussians, each with extensive associated attributes, leading to substantial memory and storage cost. This paper introduces a memory-efficient framework for 4DGS. We streamline the color attribute by decomposing it into a per-Gaussian direct color component with only 3 parameters and a shared lightweight alternating current color predictor. This approach eliminates the need for spherical harmonics coefficients, which typically involve up to 144 parameters in classic 4DGS, thereby creating a memory-efficient 4D Gaussian representation. Furthermore, we introduce an entropy-constrained Gaussian deformation technique that uses a deformation field to expand the action range of each Gaussian and integrates an opacity-based entropy loss to limit the number of Gaussians, thus forcing our model to use as few Gaussians as possible to fit a dynamic scene well. With simple half-precision storage and zip compression, our framework achieves a storage reduction by approximately 190xand 125xon the Technicolor and Neural 3D Video datasets, respectively, compared to the original 4DGS. Meanwhile, it maintains comparable rendering speeds and scene representation quality, setting a new standard in the field. Code is available at https://github.com/Xinjie-Q/MEGA",

    "abstract": "Few-shot action recognition (FSAR) aims to classify human actions in videos with only a small number of labeled samples per category. The scarcity of training data has driven recent efforts to incorporate additional modalities, particularly text. However, the subtle variations in human posture, motion dynamics, and the object interactions that occur during different phases, are critical inherent knowledge of actions that cannot be fully exploited by action labels alone. In this work, we propose Language-Guided Action Anatomy (LGA), a novel framework that goes beyond label semantics by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to dissect the essential representational characteristics hidden beneath action labels. Guided by the prior knowledge encoded in LLM, LGA effectively captures rich spatiotemporal cues in few-shot scenarios. Specifically, for text, we prompt an off-the-shelf LLM to anatomize labels into sequences of atomic action descriptions, focusing on the three core elements of action (subject, motion, object). For videos, a Visual Anatomy Module segments actions into atomic video phases to capture the sequential structure of actions. A fine-grained fusion strategy then integrates textual and visual features at the atomic level, resulting in more generalizable prototypes. Finally, we introduce a Multimodal Matching mechanism, comprising both video-video and video-text matching, to ensure robust few-shot classification. Experimental results demonstrate that LGA achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple FSAR benchmarks",

These approaches lead to constraints that are unwelcome and ill-fitting for videoconferencing applications.We present the first method to predict 3D Gaussian reconstructions in real time from a single 2D webcam feed, where the 3D representation is not only live and realistic, but also authentic to the input video. By conditioning the 3D representation on each video frame independently, our reconstruction faithfully recreates the input video from the captured viewpoint (a property we call authenticity), while generalizing realistically to novel viewpoints. Additionally, we introduce a stability loss to obtain reconstructions that are temporally stable on video sequences.We show that our method delivers state-of-the-art accuracy in visual quality and stability metrics compared to existing methods, and demonstrate our approach in live one-to-one 3D meetings using only a standard 2D camera and display.

Building on this, we introduce an end-to-end dynamic scene optimization algorithm specifically designed for articulated objects, refining the initial analysis results to ensure the system can handle 'rotation', 'translation', and even complex movements ('rotation+translation'), demonstrating high flexibility and versatility. To validate the robustness and wide applicability of our method, we created a comprehensive dataset comprising both simulated and real-world scenarios.

Single-frame 3D hand pose estimation methods have poor temporal smoothness and are easily affected by self-occlusion, which severely impacts their practical applicability.

To address these challenges, we propose a prior-aware dynamic temporal modeling framework for sequential 3D hand pose estimation. We introduce a flexible memory mechanism to model hand prior information, which alleviates the scale and depth ambiguity in single-frame hand pose estimation. Additionally, we propose a dynamic temporal convolution module that adjusts the receptive field size and feature aggregation weights based on the motion information at each moment, effectively capturing rapid motion trends. By decoupling dynamic temporal modeling at the joint and hand levels, our method captures both subtle short-term variations and long-term motion trends, significantly improving the smoothness and accuracy of hand pose estimation.

However, the transferability learned by these methods is limited because the knowledge contained in known categories is often insufficient, especially when few annotated data/categories are available in fine-grained recognition. To mitigate this limitation, we propose a diffusion-based OCD framework, dubbed DiffGRE, which integrates Generation, Refinement, and Encoding in a multi-stage fashion. Specifically, we first design an attribute-composition generation method based on cross-image interpolation in the diffusion latent space to synthesize novel samples. Then, we propose a diversity-driven refinement approach to select the synthesized images that differ from known categories for subsequent OCD model training. Finally, we leverage a semi-supervised leader encoding to inject additional category knowledge contained in synthesized data into the OCD models, which can benefit the discovery of both known and unknown categories during the on-the-fly inference process.

To achieve this, we introduce an interpretable, reward-driven intention reasoner grounded in a novel query-centric Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) scheme. Our method first encodes traffic agents and scene elements into a unified vectorized representation, then aggregates contextual features through a query-centric paradigm. This enables the derivation of a reward distribution, a compact yet informative representation of the target agent's behavior within the given scene context via IRL. Guided by this reward heuristic, we perform policy rollouts to reason about multiple plausible intentions, providing valuable priors for subsequent trajectory generation. Finally, we develop a hierarchical DETR-like decoder integrated with bidirectional selective state space models to produce accurate future trajectories along with their associated probabilities.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks have demonstrated remarkable success across numerous tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to Trojan (backdoor) attacks, raising serious concerns about their safety in real-world mission-critical applications. A common countermeasure is trigger inversion -- reconstructing malicious \"shortcut\" patterns (triggers) inserted by an adversary during training. Current trigger-inversion methods typically search the full pixel space under specific assumptions but offer no assurances that the estimated trigger is more than an adversarial perturbation that flips the model output. Here, we propose a data-free, zero-shot trigger-inversion strategy that restricts the search space while avoiding strong assumptions on trigger appearance. Specifically, we incorporate a diffusion-based generator guided by the target classifier; through iterative generation, we produce candidate triggers that align with the internal representations the model relies on for malicious behavior. Empirical evaluations, both quantitative and qualitative, show that our approach reconstructs triggers that effectively distinguish clean versus Trojaned models. DISTIL surpasses alternative methods by high margins, achieving up to 7.1% higher accuracy on the BackdoorBench dataset and a 9.4% improvement on trojaned object detection model scanning, offering a promising new direction for reliable backdoor defense without reliance on extensive data or strong prior assumptions about triggers.

    "abstract": "Video temporal grounding is a critical video understanding task, which aims to localize moments relevant to a language description. The challenge of this task lies in distinguishing relevant and irrelevant moments. Previous methods focused on learning continuous features exhibit weak differentiation between foreground and background features. In this paper, we propose a novel Moment-Quantization based Video Temporal Grounding method (MQVTG), which quantizes the input video into various discrete vectors to enhance the discrimination between relevant and irrelevant moments. Specifically, MQVTG maintains a learnable moment codebook, where each video moment matches a codeword. Considering the visual diversity, i.e., various visual expressions for the same moment, MQVTG treats moment-codeword matching as a clustering process without using discrete vectors, avoiding the loss of useful information from direct hard quantization. Additionally, we employ effective prior-initialization and joint-projection strategies to enhance the maintained moment codebook. With its simple implementation, the proposed method can be integrated into existing temporal grounding models as a plug-and-play component. Extensive experiments on six popular benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of MQVTG, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Further qualitative analysis shows that our method effectively groups relevant features and separates irrelevant ones, aligning with our goal of enhancing discrimination.

While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been explored as judges, open-source models struggle with alignment, and proprietary models lack transparency and cost efficiency. Additionally, no public training datasets exist to fine-tune open-source VLMs, only small benchmarks with diverse evaluation schemes. To address this, we introduce ADIEE, an automated dataset creation approach which is then used to train a scoring model for instruction-guided image editing evaluation. We generate a large-scale dataset with over 100K samples and use it to fine-tune a LLaVA-NeXT-8B model modified to decode a numeric score from a custom token. The resulting scorer outperforms all open-source VLMs and Gemini-Pro 1.5 across all benchmarks, achieving a 0.0696 (+17.24%) gain in score correlation with human ratings on AURORA-Bench, and improving pair-wise comparison accuracy by 4.03% (+7.21%) on GenAI-Bench and 4.75% (+9.35%) on AURORA-Bench, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art. The scorer can act as a reward model, enabling automated best edit selection and model fine-tuning. Notably, the proposed scorer can boost MagicBrush model's average evaluation score on ImagenHub from 5.90 to 6.43 (+8.98%).

ViTaM-D first reconstructs interactions using a visual network with contact constraint, then refines contact details through force-aware optimization, improving object deformation modeling.

Experiments on DexYCB and HOT datasets show that ViTaM-D outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction accuracy for both rigid and deformable objects.

Meanwhile, Visual Autoregressive Modeling (VAR) has emerged as a promising alternative with a next-scale prediction paradigm, achieving performance comparable to that of diffusion models. In this paper, we explore VAR as a generative framework for CSD, leveraging its scale-wise generation process for improved disentanglement. To this end, we propose CSD-VAR, a novel method that introduces three key innovations: (1) a scale-aware alternating optimization strategy that aligns content and style representation with their respective scales to enhance separation, (2) an SVD-based rectification method to mitigate content leakage into style representations, and (3) an Augmented Key-Value (K-V) memory enhancing content identity preservation.

Mixed-precision quantization is widely favored, as it offers a superior balance between efficiency and accuracy compared to uniform quantization. However, finding the optimal precision for each layer is challenging. Recent studies utilizing bit-level sparsity have shown promise, yet they often introduce substantial training complexity and high GPU memory requirements. In this paper, we propose Memory-Efficient Bit Sparsification Quantization (MSQ), a novel approach that addresses these limitations. MSQ applies a round-clamp quantizer to enable differentiable computation of the least significant bits (LSBs) from model weights. It further employs regularization to induce sparsity in these LSBs, enabling effective precision reduction without explicit bit-level parameter splitting. Additionally, MSQ incorporates Hessian information, allowing the simultaneous pruning of multiple LSBs to further enhance training efficiency. Experimental results show that MSQ achieves up to 8.00x reduction in trainable parameters and up to 86% reduction in training time compared to previous bit-level quantization, while maintaining competitive accuracy and compression rates.

In contrast, we propose a first proactive defense against model merging. Specifically, our defense method modifies the model parameters so that the model is disrupted if the model is merged with any other model, while its functionality is kept unchanged if not merged with others. Our approach consists of two modules, rearranging MLP parameters and scaling attention heads, which push the model out of the shared basin in parameter space, causing the merging performance with other models to degrade significantly. We conduct extensive experiments on image classification, image generation, and text classification to demonstrate that our defense severely disrupts merging while retaining the functionality of the post-protect model.

    "abstract": "Vision transformers have significantly advanced the field of computer vision, offering robust modeling capabilities and global receptive field. However, their high computational demands limit their applicability in processing long sequences. To tackle this issue, State Space Models (SSMs) have gained prominence in vision tasks as they offer linear computational complexity. Recently, State Space Duality (SSD), an improved variant of SSMs, was introduced in Mamba2 to enhance model performance and efficiency. However, the inherent causal nature of SSD/SSMs restricts their applications in non-causal vision tasks. To address this limitation, we introduce Visual State Space Duality (VSSD) model, which has a non-causal format of SSD. Specifically, we propose to discard the magnitude of interactions between the hidden state and tokens while preserving their relative weights, which relieves the dependencies of token contribution on previous tokens. Together with the involvement of multi-scan strategies, we show that the scanning results can be integrated to achieve non-causality, which not only improves the performance of SSD in vision tasks but also enhances its efficiency. We conduct extensive experiments on various benchmarks including image classification, detection, and segmentation, where VSSD surpasses existing state-of-the-art SSM-based models.

    "abstract": "Disparity estimation is an essential step in processing and analyzing Light Field (LF) images. Recent methods construct the cost volume to exploit the correspondence of the LFs over the preset maximum disparity, limiting them to process the large parallax scenes. Different from constructing cost volume, the self-attention mechanism calculates the parallax attention between epipolar lines to find the matching points. However, for LFs that have different views, the related disparity scales are different in parallax attention since the baselines with the central view are different. Moreover, if the matching information is occluded in one view, the disparity information can be explored through other views. Therefore, mapping these attentions to the same scale and selecting effective matching information are key points for disparity estimation from parallax attention. In this paper, we explore parallax attention for LF and design an unsupervised method, named Epipolar Consistent Attention Aggregation Network (ECAAN). We first introduce an epipolar consistent scale unification block by considering the consistency relationships to standardize disparity scales of the parallax attention maps. Based on the intra-properties and inter-relationships of parallax attention, we further propose a consistent occlusion-free aggregation block to integrate the information from the occlusion-free areas. Besides, we design an improved photometric loss to constrain the model. ECAAN achieves state-of-the-art performance in LF depth estimation. Notably, ECAAN attains a mean square error (MSE) of 0.2 on large-disparity LF datasets, achieving a 68% error reduction compared to the second-best method",

However, typically multimodal 3D models are only capable of handling point clouds. Compared to the emerging 3D representation technique, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), the spatially sparse point cloud cannot depict the texture information of 3D objects, resulting in inferior reconstruction capabilities. This limitation constrains the potential of point cloud-based 3D multimodal representation learning. In this paper, we present CLIP-GS, a novel multimodal representation learning framework grounded in 3DGS. We introduce the GS Tokenizer to generate serialized gaussian tokens, which are then processed through a series of transformer layers pre-initialized with weights from point cloud models, resulting in the 3DGS embeddings. CLIP-GS leverages contrastive loss between 3DGS and the visual-text embeddings of CLIP, and we introduce an image voting loss to guide the directionality and convergence of gradient optimization. Furthermore, we develop an efficient way to generate triplets of 3DGS, images, and text, facilitating CLIP-GS in learning unified multimodal representations. Leveraging the well-aligned multimodal representations, CLIP-GS demonstrates versatility and outperforms point cloud-based models on various 3D tasks, including multimodal retrieval, zero-shot, and few-shot classification",

However, existing methods overlook the valuable references hidden within the training dataset itself. In this work, we propose a novel LLIE strategy that simultaneously learns image-specific features by neural networks while formulating effective common features from the training data as the reference. These common features are correlated with the samples that are not fully fitted by the LLIE network itself, and they are represented as a set of Learnable Feature Patches and Vectors (LFPVs) in the hidden feature space. LFPVs are updated through two mechanisms: the sample-updater, which extracts useful features from training samples to refine LFPVs, and the mutual-updater, which propagates information across LFPVs to mutually update them. LFPVs can be adaptively aligned with image-specific features via our designed query-and-fusion procedure, boosting the LLIE performance.

    "abstract": "Given a natural language query, temporal video grounding aims to localize the described temporal moment in an untrimmed video. A major challenge of this task is its heavy dependence on labor-intensive annotations for training. Unlike existing works that directly train models on manually curated data, we propose a novel paradigm to reduce annotation costs: pretraining the model on unlabeled, real-world videos. To support this, we introduce Temporal Video Grounding Pretraining (Vid-Group), a large-scale dataset collected in a scalable manner with minimal human intervention, consisting of over 50K videos captured in the wild and 200K pseudo annotations. Direct pretraining on these imperfect pseudo annotations, however, presents significant challenges, including mismatched sentence-video pairs and imprecise temporal boundaries. To address these issues, we propose the ReCorrect algorithm, which comprises two main phases: semantics-guided refinement and memory-consensus correction. The semantics-guided refinement enhances the pseudo labels by leveraging semantic similarity with video frames to clean out unpaired data and make initial adjustments to temporal boundaries. In the following memory-consensus correction phase, a memory bank tracks the model predictions, progressively correcting the temporal boundaries based on consensus within the memory. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate ReCorrect's strong generalization abilities across multiple downstream settings.

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the challenge of high-fidelity view synthesis of humans with sparse-view videos as input. Previous methods solve the issue of insufficient observation by leveraging 4D diffusion models to generate videos at novel viewpoints. However, the generated videos from these models often lack spatio-temporal consistency, thus degrading view synthesis quality. In this paper, we propose a novel sliding iterative denoising process to enhance the spatio-temporal consistency of the 4D diffusion model. Specifically, we define a latent grid in which each latent encodes the image, camera pose, and human pose for a certain viewpoint and timestamp, then alternately denoise the latent grid along spatial and temporal dimensions with a sliding window, and finally decode the videos at target viewpoints from the corresponding denoised latents. Through the iterative sliding, information flows sufficiently across the latent grid, allowing the diffusion model to obtain a large receptive field and thus enhance the 4D consistency of the output, while making the GPU memory consumption affordable. The experiments on the DNA-Rendering and ActorsHQ datasets demonstrate that our method is able to synthesize high-quality and consistent novel-view videos and significantly outperforms the existing approaches.

    "abstract": "Manual annotation of 3D bounding boxes in large-scale 3D scenes is expensive and time-consuming. This motivates the exploration of annotation-free 3D object detection using unlabeled point cloud data. Existing unsupervised 3D detection frameworks predominantly identify moving objects via scene flow, which has significant limitations: (1) limited detection classes (<=3), (2) difficulty in detecting stationary objects, and (3) reliance on high frame rates. To address these limitations, we propose AnnofreeOD, a novel Annotation-free Object Detection framework based on 2D-to-3D knowledge distillation. First, we explore an effective strategy to generate high-quality pseudo boxes using single-frame 2D knowledge. Second, we observe the noise from the previous step and introduce Noise-Resistant Regression (NRR) based on Box Augmentation (BA). AnnofreeOD achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple experiments. On the nuScenes dataset, we established the first annotation-free 10-class object detection baseline, achieving 40% of fully supervised performance. Furthermore, in 3-class and class-agnostic object detection tasks, our approach surpasses prior state-of-the-art methods by +9.3% mAP (+12.2% NDS) and +6.0% AP (+4.2% NDS), significantly improving precision",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have enabled the creation of multi-modal LLMs that exhibit strong comprehension of visual data such as images and videos. However, these models usually rely on extensive visual tokens from visual encoders, leading to high computational demands, which limits their applicability in resource-constrained environments and for long-context tasks. In this work, we propose a training-free adaptive inference method for multi-modal LLMs that can accommodate a broad range of efficiency requirements with a minimum performance drop. Our method consists of a) iterative token merging based on embedding similarity before LLMs, and b) progressive token pruning within LLM layers based on multi-modal importance. With a minimalist design, our method can be applied to both video and image LLMs. Extensive experiments on diverse video and image benchmarks demonstrate that our method substantially reduces computation load (e.g., a 7-fold reduction in FLOPs) while preserving the performance of video and image LLMs. Further, at a similar computational cost, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in long video understanding (e.g., +4.6 on MLVU). Additionally, our in-depth analysis provides insights into token redundancy and LLM layer behaviors, offering guidance for future research in designing efficient multi-modal LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/LaVi-Lab/AIM",

Our approach harnesses the 3D representations of MUSt3R, a recent scalable multi-view version of DUSt3R, and 2D representations of DINOv2, then performs joint multi-view panoptic prediction via a mask transformer architecture. We additionally revisit the standard post-processing mask merging procedure and introduce a more principled approach for multi-view segmentation. We also introduce a simple method for generating novel-view predictions based on the predictions of PanSt3R and vanilla 3DGS.

While single-modality approaches using either 3D point clouds or 2D RGB images suffer from information incompleteness, multimodal anomaly detection offers promise through the complementary fusion of crossmodal data. However, existing methods face challenges in effectively integrating unimodal results and improving discriminative power. To address these limitations, we first reinterpret memory bank-based anomaly scores in single modalities as isotropic Euclidean distances in local feature spaces. Dynamically evolving from Euclidean metrics, we propose a novel \\underline G eometry-\\underline G uided \\underline S core \\underline F usion (G^ 2 SF) framework that progressively learns an anisotropic local distance metric as a unified score for the fusion task. Through a geometric encoding operator, a novel Local Scale Prediction Network (LSPN) is proposed to predict direction-aware scaling factors that characterize first-order local feature distributions, thereby enhancing discrimination between normal and anomalous patterns. Additionally, we develop specialized loss functions and score aggregation strategy from geometric priors to ensure both metric generalization and efficacy. Comprehensive evaluations on the MVTec-3D AD and Eyecandies datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art detection performance of our method, and detailed ablation analysis validates each component's contribution.

Existing AVS methods are primarily designed to enhance interaction efficiency but pay limited attention to modality representation discrepancies and imbalances. To overcome this, we propose the implicit counterfactual framework (ICF) to achieve unbiased cross-modal understanding. Due to the lack of semantics, heterogeneous representations may lead to erroneous matches, especially in complex scenes with ambiguous visual content or interference from multiple audio sources. We introduce the multi-granularity implicit text (MIT) involving video-, segment- and frame-level as the bridge to establish the modality-shared space, reducing modality gaps and providing prior guidance. Visual content carries more information and typically dominates, thereby marginalizing audio features in the decision-making. To mitigate knowledge preference, we propose the semantic counterfactual (SC) to learn orthogonal representations in the latent space, generating diverse counterfactual samples, thus avoiding biases introduced by complex functional designs and explicit modifications of text structures or attributes. We further formulate the collaborative distribution-aware contrastive learning (CDCL), incorporating factual-counterfactual and inter-modality contrasts to align representations, promoting cohesion and decoupling.

In parallel, many existing spatial context models lack explicit modeling the ordering of spatial dependencies, which may limit the availability of relevant context during decoding. To address these issues, we propose the Context Guided Transformer (CGT) entropy model, which estimates probability mass functions of the current frame conditioned on resampled temporal context and dependency-weighted spatial context. A temporal context resampler learns predefined latent queries to extract critical temporal information using transformer encoders, reducing downstream computational overhead. Meanwhile, a teacher-student network is designed as dependency-weighted spatial context assigner to explicitly model the dependency of spatial context order. The teacher generates an attention map to represent token importance and an entropy map to reflect prediction certainty from randomly masked inputs, guiding the student to select the weighted top-k tokens with the highest spatial dependency. During inference, only the student is used to predict undecoded tokens based on high-dependency context.

Extensive experiments show the superior of CMT in both conditional and unconditional CAD generation tasks.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Query-based methods with dense features have demonstrated remarkable success in 3D object detection tasks. However, the computational demands of these models, particularly with large image sizes and multiple transformer layers, pose significant challenges for efficient running on edge devices. Existing pruning and distillation methods either need retraining or are designed for ViT models, which are hard to migrate to 3D detectors. To address this issue, we propose a zero-shot runtime pruning method for transformer decoders in 3D object detection models. The method, termed tgGBC (trim keys gradually Guided By Classification scores), systematically trims keys in transformer modules based on their importance. We expand the classification score to multiply it with the attention map to get the importance score of each key and then prune certain keys after each transformer layer according to their importance scores. Our method achieves a 1.99x speedup in the transformer decoder of the latest ToC3D model, with only a minimal performance loss of less than 1%. Interestingly, for certain models, our method even enhances their performance. Moreover, we deploy 3D detectors with tgGBC on an edge device, further validating the effectiveness of our method.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Existing semi-supervised learning methods typically mitigate the impact of unreliable predictions by suppressing low-confidence regions. However, these methods fail to explore which regions hold higher learning value and how to design adaptive learning strategies for these regions. To address these issues, we propose a novel adaptive learning of high-value regions (ALHVR) framework. By exploiting the diversity of predictions from dual-branch networks, the prediction regions are classified into three groups: reliable stable region, reliable unstable region, and unreliable stable region. For high-value regions (reliable unstable region and unreliable stable region), different training strategies are designed. Specifically, for reliable unstable region, we propose a confidence-guided cross-prototype consistency learning (CG-CPCL) module, which enforces prototype consistency constraints in the feature space. By leveraging confidence information, the high-confidence predictions from one network selectively supervise the low-confidence predictions from the other, thus helping the model learn inter-class discrimination more stably. Additionally, for unreliable stable region, we design a dynamic teacher competition teaching (DTCT) module, which dynamically selects the most reliable pixels as teachers by evaluating the unperturbed predictions from both networks. These selected pixels are then used to supervise perturbed predictions, thereby enhancing the model's learning capability in unreliable region.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We present X-Dancer, a novel zero-shot music-driven image animation pipeline that creates diverse and long-range lifelike human dance videos from a single static image. As its core, we introduce a unified transformer-diffusion framework, featuring an autoregressive transformer model that synthesize extended and music-synchronized token sequences for 2D body, head and hands poses, which then guide a diffusion model to produce coherent and realistic dance video frames. Unlike traditional methods that primarily generate human motion in 3D, X-Dancer addresses data limitations and enhances scalability by modeling a wide spectrum of 2D dance motions, capturing their nuanced alignment with musical beats through readily available monocular videos. To achieve this, we first build a spatially compositional token representation from 2D human pose labels associated with keypoint confidences, encoding both large articulated body movements (e.g., upper and lower body) and fine-grained motions (e.g., head and hands). We then design a music-to-motion transformer model that autoregressively generates music-aligned dance pose token sequences, incorporating global attention to both musical style and prior motion context. Finally we leverage a diffusion backbone to animate the reference image with these synthesized pose tokens through AdaIN, forming a fully differentiable end-to-end framework. Experimental results demonstrate that X-Dancer is able to produce both diverse and characterized dance videos, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art methods in term of diversity, expressiveness and realism.

While deep learning-based methods have shown remarkable success, their reliance on specific noise distributions limits generalization to unseen noise types and levels. Existing approaches attempt to address this with extensive training data and high computational resources but they still suffer from overfitting. To address these issues, we conduct image denoising by utilizing dynamically generated kernels via efficient operations. This approach helps prevent overfitting and improves resilience to unseen noise. Specifically, our method leverages a Feature Extraction Module for robust noise-invariant features, Global Statistics and Local Correlation Modules to capture comprehensive noise characteristics and structural correlations. The Kernel Prediction Module then employs these cues to produce pixel-wise varying kernels adapted to local structures, which are then applied iteratively for denoising. This ensures both efficiency and superior restoration quality. Despite being trained on single-level Gaussian noise, our compact model ( 0.04 M) excels across diverse noise types and levels, demonstrating the promise of iterative dynamic filtering for practical image denoising",

We then show that this observation can be exploited to accelerate standard MAE by progressively freezing the model according to an explicit schedule, throughout training. Furthermore, this same schedule can be used in a simple and scalable approach to latent prediction that does not suffer from \"representation collapse\".

In this paper, we propose a zero-external-dependency Augmented Moment Retrieval framework, AMR, designed to overcome local optima caused by insufficient data annotations and the lack of robust boundary and semantic discrimination capabilities. AMR is built upon two key insights: (1) it resolves ambiguous boundary information and semantic confusion in existing annotations without additional data (avoiding costly manual labeling), and (2) it preserves boundary and semantic discriminative capabilities enhanced by training while generalizing to real-world scenarios, significantly improving performance. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage training framework with cold-start and distillation adaptation. The cold-start stage employs curriculum learning on augmented data to build foundational boundary/semantic awareness. The distillation stage introduces dual query sets: Original Queries maintain DETR-based localization using frozen Base Queries from the cold-start model, while Active Queries dynamically adapt to real-data distributions. A cross-stage distillation loss enforces consistency between Original and Base Queries, preventing knowledge forgetting while enabling real-world generalization. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that AMR achieves improved performance over prior state-of-the-art approaches",

However, progress in dermatology has lagged behind other medical domains due to the lack of standard image-text pairs. Existing dermatological datasets are limited in both scale and depth, offering only single-label annotations across a narrow range of diseases instead of rich textual descriptions, and lacking the crucial clinical context needed for real-world applications. To address these limitations, we present Derm1M, the first large-scale vision-language dataset for dermatology, comprising 1,029,761 image-text pairs. Built from diverse educational resources and structured around a standard ontology collaboratively developed by experts, Derm1M provides comprehensive coverage for over 390 skin conditions across four hierarchical levels and 130 clinical concepts with rich contextual information such as medical history, symptoms, and skin tone. To demonstrate Derm1M's potential in advancing both AI research and clinical application, we pretrained a series of CLIP-like models, collectively called DermLIP, on this dataset. The DermLIP family significantly outperforms state-of-the-art foundation models on eight diverse datasets across multiple tasks, including zero-shot skin disease classification, clinical and artifacts concept identification, few-shot/full-shot learning, and cross-modal retrieval.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "With the availability of diverse sensor modalities (i.e., RGB, Depth, Infrared) and the success of multi-modal learning, multi-modal face anti-spoofing (FAS) has emerged as a prominent research focus. The intuition behind it is that leveraging multiple modalities can uncover more intrinsic spoofing traces. However, this approach presents more risk of misalignment. We identify two main types of misalignment: (1) Intra-domain modality misalignment, where the importance of each modality varies across different attacks. For instance, certain modalities (e.g., Depth) may be non-defensive against specific attacks (e.g., 3D mask), indicating that each modality has unique strengths and weaknesses in countering particular attacks. Consequently, simple fusion strategies may fall short. (2) Inter-domain modality misalignment, where the introduction of additional modalities exacerbates domain shifts, potentially overshadowing the benefits of complementary fusion. To tackle (1), we propose an alignment module between modalities based on mutual information, which adaptively enhances favorable modalities while suppressing unfavorable ones. To address (2), we employ a dual alignment optimization method that aligns both sub-domain hyperplanes and modality angle margins, thereby mitigating domain gaps. Our method, dubbed Dual Alignment of Domain and Modality (DADM), achieves state-of-the-art performance in extensive experiments across four challenging protocols, demonstrating its robustness in multi-modal domain generalization scenarios.

    "abstract": "Since acquiring large amounts of realistic blurry-sharp image pairs is difficult and expensive, learning blind image deblurring from unpaired data is a more practical and promising solution. Unfortunately, most existing approaches only use adversarial learning to bridge the gap from blurry domains to sharp domains, ignoring the complex and unpredictable nature of real-world blurry patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion model (DM)-based framework, dubbed TP-Diff, for image deblurring by learning spatially varying texture prior from unpaired sharp data. In particular, TP-Diff performs DM to generate the prior knowledge used to recover the texture of blurry images. To implement it, we propose a Texture Prior Encoder (TPE) that introduces a memory mechanism to encode the texture prior and thereby provide supervision for the DM training. To fully exploit the generated texture priors, we further present the Texture Transfer Transformer layer (TTformer), in which a novel Filter-Modulated Multi-head Self-Attention (FM-MSA) efficiently removes spatially varying blurring through adaptive filtering. In addition, a wavelet-based adversarial loss is used to preserve high-frequency texture details. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that TP-Diff provides a promising unsupervised deblurring solution and outperforms SOTA methods in six widely-used benchmarks",

They emit modulated infrared signals to illuminate the scene and process the received signals to generate amplitude and phase images. The depth is calculated from the phase using the modulation frequency. However, the obtained depth often suffers from noise caused by multi-path interference, low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and depth wrapping. Building on recent advancements in neural scene representations, which have shown great potential in 3D modeling from multi-view RGB images, we propose leveraging this approach to reconstruct 3D representations from noisy iToF data. Our method utilizes the multi-view consistency of amplitude and phase maps, fusing information from all input views to generate an accurate scene representation. Considering the impact of infrared illumination, we propose a new rendering scheme for amplitude maps based on signed distance function (SDF) and introduce a neural lighting function to model the appearance variations caused by active illumination. We also incorporate a phase-guided sampling strategy and a wrapping-aware phase-to-depth loss to utilize raw phase information and mitigate depth wrapping.

In this work, we address this critical gap by developing a novel 3DGS-based framework for monocular VLN agents, focusing on the intrinsic information incompleteness challenge. Our approach incorporates two key innovations: (1) implicit partial completion module for inferring representations of missing regions in incompletely rendered panoramic feature maps, and (2) an uncertainty-aware active perception strategy that enables the agent to actively acquire visual observation when uncertain about its decision. Extensive experiments on R2R-CE and RxR-CE datasets demonstrate that our monoVLN outperforms all existing monocular methods, significantly improve 8% success rate on R2R-CE compared to previous monocular methods.

While fMRI methods have successfully reconstructed static images, fMRI-tovideo reconstruction faces challenges due to the need for capturing spatiotemporal dynamics like motion and scene transitions. Recent approaches have improved semantic and perceptual alignment but struggle to integrate coarse fMRI data with detailed visual features. Inspired by the hierarchical organization of the visual system, we propose NEURONS, a novel framework that decouples learning into four correlated sub-tasks: key object segmentation, concept recognition, scene description, and blurry video reconstruction. This approach simulates the visual cortex's functional specialization, allowing the model to capture diverse video content. In the inference stage, NEURONS generates robust conditioning signals for a pre-trained textto-video diffusion model to reconstruct the videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NEURONS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving solid improvements in video consistency (26.6%) and semantic-level accuracy (19.1%). Notably, NEURONS shows a strong functional correlation with the visual cortex, highlighting its potential for brain-computer interfaces and clinical applications.

To refine this coarse motion, we introduce Segment Score Distillation (SSD)---an optimization-based approach that leverages a pre-trained motion diffusion model trained solely on short clips.

Existing methods on debiasing DMs usually requires model re-training with a human-crafted reference dataset or additional classifiers, which suffer from two major limitations: (1) collecting reference datasets causes expensive annotation cost; (2) the debiasing performance is heavily constrained by the quality of the reference dataset or the additional classifier. To address the above limitations, we propose FairGen, a plug-and-play method that learns attribute latent directions in a self-discovering manner, thus eliminating the reliance on such reference dataset. Specifically, FairGen consists of two parts: a set of attribute adapters and a distribution indicator. Each adapter in the set aims to learn an attribute latent direction, and is optimized via noise composition through a self-discovering process.Then, the distribution indicator is multiplied by the set of adapters to guide the generation process towards the prescribed distribution. Our method enables debiasing multiple attributes in DMs simultaneously, while remaining lightweight and easily integrable with other DMs, eliminating the need for re-training. Extensive experiments on debiasing gender, racial, and their intersectional biases show that our method outperforms previous SOTA by a large margin",

In this work, we present the Gaze-Language Alignment Model (GLAM), a vision-language model that can generalize gaze target predictions to novel categories of search targets lacking gaze annotation. To do so, GLAM uses a novel gaze encoder to encode foveal and peripheral information of a gaze scanpath. The resultant gaze embeddings are aligned with language embeddings of large language model-generated search descriptions for associated target categories using a novel contrastive learning strategy called Gaze-Language Alignment Decomposition (GLAD). When used to train GLAM in a zero-shot setup, GLAD surpassed naive contrastive learning strategies by nearly one-third in target prediction accuracy, even outperforming a fully supervised baseline. Moreover, in a fully supervised setup, GLAM outperformed previous methods in target prediction accuracy, regardless of the training strategy used",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have greatly improved their ability to understand both visual and text information. However, a common problem in LVLMs is confirmation bias, where models tend to repeat previous assumptions and follow earlier viewpoints instead of reflecting and correcting themselves. This problem is more common in smaller-scale LVLMs, as they are usually fine-tuned with training data that is mostly positive, focusing on generating coherent dialogue. To address this issue, we introduce ReCoT, a method designed to mitigate confirmation bias in smaller-scale LVLMs through Reflective Self-Correction Training.The method follows a two-stage SFT-DPO paradigm: the first SFT stage aims to cultivate the model's reflective correction abilities, while the DPO stage focuses on enhancing the consistency between answers and reflections. Specifically, we construct dialogue-based reflective samples, which serve as adversarial samples during SFT. In this process, the model is initially presented with a potentially incorrect answer, followed by a reflection and correction phase to generate the final answer. To enhance answer-reflection consistency, we propose the consistency direct preference optimization. To comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of our ReCoT, we introduce a set of novel metrics to measure the accuracy of the reflection and correction process. Extensive experiments show that ReCoT enables LVLM to engage in robust self-reflection and error correction and reduce confirmation bias",

    "title": "Bridging Continuous and Discrete Tokens for Autoregressive Visual Generation",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Autoregressive visual generation models typically rely on tokenizers to compress images into tokens that can be predicted sequentially. A fundamental dilemma exists in token representation: discrete tokens enable straightforward modeling with standard cross-entropy loss, but suffer from information loss and tokenizer training instability; continuous tokens better preserve visual details, but require complex distribution modeling, complicating the generation pipeline. In this paper, we propose TokenBridge, which bridges this gap by maintaining the strong representation capacity of continuous tokens while preserving the modeling simplicity of discrete tokens. To achieve this, we decouple discretization from the tokenizer training process through post-training quantization that directly obtains discrete tokens from continuous representations. Specifically, we introduce a dimension-wise quantization strategy that independently discretizes each feature dimension, paired with a lightweight autoregressive prediction mechanism that efficiently model the resulting large token space. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves reconstruction and generation quality on par with continuous methods while using standard categorical prediction. This work demonstrates that bridging discrete and continuous paradigms can effectively harness the strengths of both approaches, providing a promising direction for high-quality visual generation with simple autoregressive modeling.

However, models' complex trade-offs among these dimensions have been rarely explored due to (1) the lack of datasets that allow fine-grained quantification of these trade-offs, and (2) using a single metric for multiple dimensions. To address this gap, we introduce TRIG-Bench (Trade-offs in Image Generation), which spans 10 dimensions (Realism, Originality, Aesthetics, Content, Relation, Style, Knowledge, Ambiguity, Toxicity and Bias), contains over 40,200 samples, and covers 132 Pairwise Dimensional Subsets. Furthermore, we develop TRIGScore,a VLM-as-judge metric that automatically adapts to various dimensions. Based on this, we evaluate 14 cutting-edge models across T2I and I2I tasks. In addition, we propose the Relation Recognition System and generate the Dimension Trade-off Map (DTM), which visualizes model-specific capability trade-offs. Our experiments demonstrate that DTM consistently provides a comprehensive understanding of the trade-offs between dimensions for each type of generation models.

However, this workflow demands considerable expertise. With the rise of GenAI methods, an endless supply of high-quality graphic designs in pixel format has become more accessible, though these designs often lack editability. Despite this, non-layered designs still inspire human designers, influencing their choices in layouts and text styles, ultimately guiding the creation of layered designs. Motivated by this observation, we propose Accordion, a graphic design generation framework taking the first attempt to convert AI-generated designs into editable layered designs, meanwhile refining nonsensical AI-generated text with meaningful alternatives guided by user prompts. It is built around a vision language model (VLM) playing distinct roles in three curated stages: (1) reference creation, (2) design planning, and (3) layer generation. For each stage, we design prompts to guide the VLM in executing different tasks. Distinct from existing bottom-up methods (e.g., COLE and Open-COLE) that gradually generate elements to create layered designs, our approach works in a top-down manner by using the visually harmonious reference image as global guidance to decompose each layer. Additionally, it leverages multiple vision experts such as SAM and element removal models to facilitate the creation of graphic layers. We train our method using the in-house graphic design dataset Design39K, augmented with AI-generated design images coupled with refined ground truth created by a customized inpainting model. Experimental results and user studies by designers show that Accordion generates favorable results on the DesignIntention benchmark, including tasks such as text-to-template, adding text to background, and text de-rendering, and also excels in creating design variations",

Accurate organ segmentation from PET images is essential for comprehensive multi-systemic analysis of interactions between different organs and pathologies.Existing segmentation methods are limited by insufficient annotation data and varying levels of annotation, resulting in weak generalization ability and difficulty in clinical application. Recent developments in segmentation foundation models have shown superior versatility across diverse segmentation tasks. Despite the efforts of medical adaptations, these works primarily focus on structural medical images with detailed physiological structural information and exhibit limited generalization performance on molecular PET imaging. In this paper, we collect and construct PETS-5k, the largest PET segmentation dataset to date, comprising 5,731 three-dimensional whole-body PET images and encompassing over 1.3M 2D images. Based on the established dataset, we develop SegAnyPET, a modality-specific 3D foundation model for universal promptable segmentation from PET images. To issue the challenge of discrepant annotation quality, we adopt a cross prompting confident learning (CPCL) strategy with an uncertainty-guided self-rectification process to robustly learn segmentation from high-quality labeled data and low-quality noisy labeled data for promptable segmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that SegAnyPET can segment seen and unseen target organs using only one or a few prompt points, outperforming state-of-the-art foundation models and task-specific fully supervised models with higher accuracy and strong generalization ability for universal segmentation.

StolenLoRA leverages a Large Language Model to craft effective prompts for data generation, and it incorporates a Disagreement-based Semi-supervised Learning (DSL) strategy to maximize information gain from limited queries.Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of StolenLoRA, achieving up to a 96.60% attack success rate with only 10k queries, even in cross-backbone scenarios where the attacker and victim models utilize different pre-trained backbones. These findings reveal the specific vulnerability of LoRA-adapted models to this type of extraction and underscore the urgent need for robust defense mechanisms tailored to PEFT methods.We also explore a preliminary defense strategy based on diversified LoRA deployments, highlighting its potential to mitigate such attacks",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recent advancements in text-to-video (T2V) generation have been driven by two competing paradigms: autoregressive language models and diffusion models. However, each paradigm has intrinsic limitations: language models struggle with visual quality and error accumulation, while diffusion models lack semantic understanding and causal modeling. In this work, we propose LanDiff, a hybrid framework that synergizes the strengths of both paradigms through coarse-to-fine generation. Our architecture introduces three key innovations: (1) a semantic tokenizer that compresses 3D visual features into compact 1D discrete representations through efficient semantic compression, achieving a ~14,000xcompression ratio; (2) a language model that generates semantic tokens with high-level semantic relationships; (3) a streaming diffusion model that refines coarse semantics into high-fidelity videos. Experiments show that LanDiff, a 5B model, achieves a score of 85.43 on the VBench T2V benchmark, surpassing the state-of-the-art open-source models Hunyuan Video (13B) and other commercial models such as Sora, Kling, and Hailuo. Furthermore, our model also achieves state-of-the-art performance in long video generation, surpassing other open-source models in this field. Our demo can be viewed at https://landiff.github.io/",

    "abstract": "Reflective flares are common artifacts in photography that degrade image quality, introducing in-focus flares, which appear as bright, regular spot patterns, and out-of-focus flares, which are diffuse and semi-transparent, obscuring the underlying scene. While previous methods have achieved some success in removing in-focus flares, they struggle with the diffuse nature of out-of-focus flares. The lack of an out-of-focus flare dataset has further hindered the development of effective flare removal models. In this work, we construct a large-scale out-of-focus flare dataset generated with Blender. We propose to use a color alignment approach on diffusion models to address the challenges of out-of-focus reflective flare removal. Rather than fully reconstructing flare-affected regions, our method adjusts the color distribution to reduce artifact visibility while preserving image content. Specifically, we apply a differentiable histogram loss on the diffusion model, which is derived from the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD), to effectively align color distributions. The proposed approach, trained exclusively on synthetic data, outperforms existing methods on both synthetic and real-world data, demonstrating improved performance in flare removal",

This approach reduces the dataset size to just 15M for pretraining -- over four times fewer than what is typically needed -- while achieving competitive or even superior performance with existing unified MLLMs, such as Janus.

This scheme supervises the MLLM to self-assess the consistency between text descriptions and self-generated images, facilitating the model to interpret images more accurately and avoid unrealistic and incorrect predictions caused by misalignment in image generation.

Alongside the rendering loss based on estimated novel-view poses, a reprojection loss is integrated to enforce the learning of pixel-aligned Gaussian primitives for enhanced geometric constraints. This pose-free training paradigm and efficient one-step feed-forward design make SPFSplat well-suited for practical applications.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach for unsupervised skeleton-based temporal action segmentation.

Latent skeleton sequences are then divided into non-overlapping patches and quantized to obtain distinctive skeleton motion words, driving the discovery of semantically meaningful action clusters.

    "abstract": "Diffusion models like Stable Diffusion have become prominent in visual synthesis tasks due to their powerful customization capabilities, which also introduce significant security risks, including deepfakes and copyright infringement. In response, a class of methods known as protective perturbation emerged, which mitigates image misuse by injecting imperceptible adversarial noise. However, purification can remove protective perturbations, thereby exposing images again to the risk of malicious forgery. In this work, we formalize the anti-purification task, highlighting challenges that hinder existing approaches, and propose a simple diagnostic protective perturbation named AntiPure. AntiPure exposes vulnerabilities of purification within the \"purification-customization\" workflow, owing to two guidance mechanisms: 1) Patch-wise Frequency Guidance, which reduces the model's influence over high-frequency components in the purified image, and 2) Erroneous Timestep Guidance, which disrupts the model's denoising strategy across different timesteps. With additional guidance, AntiPure embeds imperceptible perturbations that persist under representative purification settings, achieving effective post-customization distortion. Experiments show that, as a stress test for purification, AntiPure achieves minimal perceptual discrepancy and maximal distortion, outperforming other protective perturbation methods within the purification-customization workflow",

    "abstract": "3D occupancy prediction provides a comprehensive description of the surrounding scenes and has become an essential task for 3D perception. Most existing methods focus on offline perception from one or a few views and cannot be applied to embodied agents that demand to gradually perceive the scene through progressive embodied exploration. In this paper, we formulate an embodied 3D occupancy prediction task to target this practical scenario and propose a Gaussian-based EmbodiedOcc framework to accomplish it. We initialize the global scene with uniform 3D semantic Gaussians and progressively update local regions observed by the embodied agent. For each update, we extract semantic and structural features from the observed image and efficiently incorporate them via deformable cross-attention to refine the regional Gaussians. Finally, we employ Gaussian-to-voxel splatting to obtain the global 3D occupancy from the updated 3D Gaussians. Our EmbodiedOcc assumes an unknown (i.e., uniformly distributed) environment and maintains an explicit global memory of it with 3D Gaussians. It gradually gains knowledge through the local refinement of regional Gaussians, which is consistent with how humans understand new scenes through embodied exploration. We reorganize an EmbodiedOcc-ScanNet benchmark based on local annotations to facilitate the evaluation of the embodied 3D occupancy prediction task. Our EmbodiedOcc outperforms existing methods by a large margin and accomplishes the embodied occupancy prediction with high accuracy and efficiency. Code: https://github.com/YkiWu/EmbodiedOcc",

In evaluations on two TTI benchmarks, HPSv2 and MJBench, MMB outperforms existing baselines in alignment with human annotations and calibration across varied image content.

Existing methods propose separation through generative or discriminative objectives, but they still face the inherent ambiguity of disentangling intertwined concepts.

We propose SCFlow, a flow-matching framework that learns bidirectional mappings between entangled and disentangled representations. Our approach is built upon three key insights: 1) Training solely to merge style and content, a well-defined task, enables invertible disentanglement without explicit supervision; 2) flow matching bridges on arbitrary distributions, avoiding the restrictive Gaussian priors of diffusion models and normalizing flows; and 3) a synthetic dataset of 510,000 samples was curated to simulate disentanglement through systematic style-content pairing. Beyond controllable generation tasks, we demonstrate that SCFlow generalizes to ImageNet-1k and WikiArt in zero-shot settings and achieves competitive performance, highlighting that disentanglement naturally emerges from the invertible merging process.

    "abstract": "Current generative models struggle to synthesize dynamic 4D driving scenes that simultaneously support temporal extrapolation and spatial novel view synthesis (NVS) without per-scene optimization. A key challenge lies in finding an efficient and generalizable geometric representation that seamlessly connects temporal and spatial synthesis. To address this, we propose DiST-4D, the first disentangled spatiotemporal diffusion framework for 4D driving scene generation, which leverages metric depth as the core geometric representation. DiST-4D decomposes the problem into two diffusion processes: DiST-T, which predicts future metric depth and multi-view RGB sequences directly from past observations, and DiST-S, which enables spatial NVS by training only on existing viewpoints while enforcing cycle consistency. This cycle consistency mechanism introduces a forward-backward rendering constraint, reducing the generalization gap between observed and unseen viewpoints. Metric depth is essential for both accurate reliable forecasting and accurate spatial NVS, as it provides a view-consistent geometric representation that generalizes well to unseen perspectives. Experiments demonstrate that DiST-4D achieves state-of-the-art performance in both temporal prediction and NVS tasks, while also delivering competitive performance in planning-related evaluations.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging, recovering the hidden volume from indirect reflections, has attracted increasing attention due to its potential applications. Despite promising results, existing NLOS reconstruction approaches are constrained by the reliance on empirical physical priors, e.g., single fixed path compensation. Moreover, these approaches still possess limited generalization ability, particularly when dealing with scenes at a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To overcome the above problems, we introduce a novel learning-based approach, comprising two key designs: Learnable Path Compensation (LPC) and Adaptive Phasor Field (APF). The LPC applies tailored path compensation coefficients to adapt to different objects in the scene, effectively reducing light wave attenuation, especially in distant regions. Meanwhile, the APF learns the precise Gaussian window of the illumination function for the phasor field, dynamically selecting the relevant spectrum band of the transient measurement. Experimental validations demonstrate that our proposed approach, only trained on synthetic data, exhibits the capability to seamlessly generalize across various real-world datasets captured by different imaging systems and characterized by low SNRs.

    "abstract": "Unconditional flow matching trains diffusion models to transport samples from a source distribution to a target distribution by enforcing that the flows between sample pairs are unique. However, in conditional settings (e.g., class-conditioned models), this uniqueness is no longer guaranteed--flows from different conditions may overlap, leading to more ambiguous generations. We introduce Contrastive Flow Matching, an extension to the flow matching objective that explicitly enforces uniqueness across all conditional flows, enhancing condition separation. Our approach adds a contrastive objective that maximizes dissimilarities between predicted flows from arbitrary sample pairs. We validate Contrastive Flow Matching by conducting extensive experiments across varying model architectures on both class-conditioned (ImageNet-1k) and text-to-image (CC3M) benchmarks. Notably, we find that training models with Contrastive Flow Matching (1) improves training speed by a factor of up to 9x, (2) requires up to 5x fewer de-noising steps and (3) lowers FID by up to 8.9 compared to training the same models with flow matching.

To further enhance the generalization of overlapping text segmentation models, we propose a hierarchical training data synthesis strategy that simulates diverse overlapping patterns across different scenarios. Furthermore, we found that depth maps can provide clear relative position relationships in three-dimensional space, assisting the model in capturing complex overlapping relationships between text instances. Building on this insight, we present a depth-guided decoder that seamlessly integrates image and depth features to capture overlapping interactions.

    "abstract": "Deep learning models rely on large-scale labeled datasets, but collecting such data is expensive and time-consuming. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) mitigates this issue by learning from a small set of labeled samples along with a large pool of unlabeled data. However, existing SSL methods struggle with fine-grained classification when dealing with visually similar classes, as they rely solely on visual features and ignore the semantic information within label names. This paper introduces SemiVisBooster, an SSL enhancement approach that utilizes semantic information from label names to guide visual feature learning, addressing the challenges of fine-grained classification. By aligning text embeddings from label names with visual features, our method helps the model capture subtle visual distinctions that purely visual representations may overlook. To enhance robustness, we propose two key components: (1) text embedding de-similarity (TEDS) to reduce confusion caused by similar text embeddings across different class names, and (2) class-aware visual-text alignment loss to accurately define positive and negative pairs during visual-text alignment. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the latest SSL benchmarks. Additionally, on the challenging Food-101 dataset, which contains many visually similar classes and uses only 404 labeled images, our approach improves performance by approximately 13.6% over the second-best method.

    "abstract": "Self-supervised contrastive learning (CL) effectively learns transferable representations from unlabeled data containing images or image-text pairs but suffers vulnerability to data poisoning backdoor attacks (DPCLs). An adversary can inject poisoned images into pretraining datasets, causing compromised CL encoders to exhibit targeted misbehavior in downstream tasks. Existing DPCLs, however, achieve limited efficacy due to their dependence on fragile implicit co-occurrence between backdoor and target object and inadequate suppression of discriminative features in backdoored images. We propose Noisy Alignment (NA), a DPCL method that explicitly suppresses noise components in poisoned images. Inspired by powerful training-controllable CL attacks, we identify and extract the critical objective of noisy alignment, adapting it effectively into data-poisoning scenarios. Our method implements noisy alignment by strategically manipulating contrastive learning's random cropping mechanism, formulating this process as an image layout optimization problem with theoretically derived optimal parameters. The resulting method is simple yet effective, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to existing DPCLs, while maintaining clean-data accuracy.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly advanced image generation; however, existing models remain task-specific, limiting their efficiency and generalizability. While universal models attempt to address these limitations, they face critical challenges, including generalizable instruction design, appropriate task distributions, and unified architectural design. In this work, we propose VisualCloze, a universal image generation framework, to tackle these challenges. Unlike existing methods that rely on language-based task descriptions, leading to task ambiguity and weak generalization, we integrate visual in-context learning, allowing models to identify tasks from demonstrations. Meanwhile, the inherent sparsity of visual task distributions hampers the learning of transferable knowledge across tasks. To this end, we introduce Graph200K, a graph-structured dataset that establishes various interrelated tasks, enhancing task density and knowledge transfer. Furthermore, we uncover an intrinsic alignment between image infilling and in-context learning, enabling us to leverage the strong generative priors of pre-trained infilling models without modifying their architectures. Experiments demonstrate that VisualCloze achieves strong performance across more than 100 in-domain tasks while generalizing to unseen tasks in few-shot and zero-shot settings.

Industrial Visual Anomaly Detection (IVAD) has emerged as a promising solution, with methods such as zero-shot, few-shot, and reconstruction-based techniques. However, zero-shot methods struggle with subtle anomalies, and reconstruction-based methods fail to capture fine-grained details. Few-shot methods, which use limited samples and prompts, offer a more efficient approach.

The task necessitates a range of sophisticated capabilities, including efficient spatial navigation, precise and accurate object interaction, sensitive scene change detection, and meticulous restoration techniques. The inherent complexity of this endeavor stems from the diverse nature of potential object changes, encompassing movements within the space, alterations in appearance, and changes in existence--where objects may be introduced or removed from the scene. Previous methods, either end-to-end reinforcement learning or modular approaches, struggle with handling these changes in a unified manner due to the heterogeneous nature of the inference spaces. To address this, this paper proposes a Trial-Oriented Visual Rearrangement (TOR) framework, which leverages the principles of stronger embodiment to prune the joint reasoning space and identify a smaller shared space for processing various object changes. TOR maintains a differential point cloud representation to capture environmental changes and uses two core mechanisms, assessment and refinement, to iteratively restore the scene to the goal state. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of TOR in restoring both object movement and appearance changes and show its generalization to complex multi-room environments",

For multi-object sketch animation, we propose MoSketch based on iterative optimization through Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) and thus animating a multi-object sketch in a training-data free manner.

These limitations have motivated the exploration of alternative sensing modalities, such as near-infrared sensors and radar systems, which offer complementary physiological information through distinct sensing principles. While these modalities provide valuable information, existing methods fail to holistically integrate these heterogeneous data. Our key insight is that while visible light, near-infrared, and radar operate on distinct physical principles, they all capture temporally dynamic physiological signatures that can be represented as time-varying signals reflecting underlying physiological processes. Based on this insight, we propose FusionPhys, a novel framework that implements an adaptive integration mechanism to refine physiological information across complementary modalities. We further introduce a sub-modality decomposition technique that extends fusion principles to single-modality videos.

We observe that task vectors exhibit a narrow weight range, enabling low-precision quantization (<= 4 bit) within existing task vector merging frameworks. To further mitigate quantization errors within ultra-low bit precision (e.g., 2 bit), we introduce Residual Task Vector Quantization, which decomposes the task vector into a base vector and offset component. We allocate bits based on quantization sensitivity, ensuring precision while minimizing error within a memory budget.

Consistency Models have made significant progress in accelerating diffusion models. However, directly applying them to video diffusion models often results in severe degradation of temporal consistency and appearance details. In this paper, by analyzing the training dynamics of Consistency Models, we identify a key conflicting learning dynamics during the distillation process: there is a significant discrepancy in the optimization gradients and loss contributions across different timesteps. This discrepancy prevents the distilled student model from achieving an optimal state, leading to compromised temporal consistency and degraded appearance details.To address this issue, we propose a parameter-efficient Dual-Expert Consistency Model (DCM), where a semantic expert focuses on learning semantic layout and motion, while a detail expert specializes in fine detail refinement. Furthermore, we introduce Temporal Coherence Loss to improve motion consistency for the semantic expert and apply GAN and Feature Matching Loss to enhance the synthesis quality of the detail expert. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art visual quality with significantly reduced sampling steps, demonstrating the effectiveness of expert specialization in video diffusion model distillation.

    "abstract": "Lidar-based 3D detection is one of the most popular research fields in autonomous driving. 3D detectors typically detect specific targets in a scene according to the pattern formed by the spatial distribution of point clouds. However, existing voxel-based methods usually adopt MLP and global pooling (e.g., PointNet, CenterPoint) as voxel feature encoder, which makes it less effective to extract detailed spatial structure information from raw points, leading to information loss and inferior performance. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based transformer to encode voxel features by condensing the full and detailed point's geometry, termed as GeoFormer. We first represent points within a voxel as a graph, based on relative distances to capture its spatial geometry. Then, We introduce a geometry-guided transformer architecture to encode voxel features, where the adjacent geometric clues are used to re-weight point feature similarities, enabling more effective extraction of geometric relationships between point pairs at varying distances. We highlight that GeoFormer is a plug-and-play module which can be seamlessly integrated to enhance the performance of existing voxel-based detectors. Extensive experiments conducted on three popular outdoor datasets demonstrate that our GeoFormer achieves the start-of-the-art performance on both effectiveness and robustness comparisons",

Despite this, WSIs contain explicit local redundancy (similar patches) and irrelevant regions (uninformative instances), posing significant challenges for Mamba-based multi-instance learning (MIL) methods in capturing global representations. Furthermore, bag-level approaches struggle to extract critical features from all instances, while group-level methods fail to adequately account for tumor dispersion and intrinsic correlations across groups, leading to suboptimal global representations. To address these issues, we propose group masking Mamba (GMMamba), a novel framework that combines two elaborate modules: (1) intra-group masking Mamba (IMM) for selective instance exploration within groups, and (2) cross-group super-feature sampling (CSS) to ameliorate long-range relation learning. Specifically, IMM adaptively predicts sparse masks to filter out features with low attention scores (i.e., uninformative patterns) during bidirectional Mamba modeling, facilitating the removal of instance redundancies for compact local representation. For improved bag prediction, the CSS module further aggregates sparse group representations into discriminative features, effectively grasping comprehensive dependencies among dispersed and sparse tumor regions inherent in large-scale WSIs. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that GMMamba outperforms the state-of-the-art ACMIL by 2.2% and 6.4% in accuracy on the TCGA-BRCA and TCGA-ESCA datasets, respectively",

However, when applied to large-scale street scenes, existing methods suffer from rapidly escalating per-viewpoint reconstruction costs as scene size increases, leading to significant computational overhead.After revisiting the conventional pipeline, we identify three key factors accounting for this issue: unnecessary local-to-global transformations, excessive 3D-to-2D projections, and inefficient rendering of distant content. To address these challenges, we propose S3R-GS, a 3DGS framework that Streamlines the pipeline for large-scale Street Scene Reconstruction, effectively mitigating these limitations. Moreover, most existing street 3DGS methods rely on ground-truth 3D bounding boxes to separate dynamic and static components, but 3D bounding boxes are difficult to obtain, limiting real-world applicability. To address this, we propose an alternative solution with 2D boxes, which are easier to annotate or can be predicted by off-the-shelf vision foundation models. Such designs together make S3R-GS readily adapt to large, in-the-wild scenarios.Extensive experiments demonstrate that S3R-GS enhances rendering quality and significantly accelerates reconstruction. Remarkably, when applied to videos from the challenging Argoverse2 dataset, it achieves state-of-the-art PSNR and SSIM, reducing reconstruction time to below 50%--and even 20%--of competing methods.

To handle this task, we propose LIRA: Language Instructed Reconstruction Assistant. It leverages a multimodal large language model to actively reason about the implicit instruction and obtain instruction-relevant 2D candidate instances and their attributes.

However, training VLMs typically demands substantial computational resources, and they often struggle to adapt efficiently to new domains or tasks. Additionally, dynamically estimating the test distribution from streaming data at test time remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a novel test-time retrieval-augmented adaptation (TT-RAA) method that enables VLMs to maintain high performance across diverse visual recognition tasks without the need for task-specific training or large computational overhead. During inference, TT-RAA employs a streaming mixture of Gaussian database (SMGD) to continuously estimate test distributions, requiring minimal storage. Then, TT-RAA retrieves the most relevant information from the SMGD, enhancing the original VLM outputs. A key limitation of CLIP-based VLMs is their inter-modal vision-language optimization, which does not optimize vision-space similarity, leading to larger intra-modal variance. To address this, we propose a multimodal retrieval augmentation module that transforms the SMGD into a unified multimodal space, enabling retrieval that aligns both vision and language modalities. Extensive experiments across both cross-domain and out-of-distribution benchmarks comprising fourteen datasets demonstrate TT-RAA's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

    "title": "Causal Disentanglement and Cross-Modal Alignment for Enhanced Few-Shot Learning",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Few-shot learning (FSL) often requires effective adaptation of models using limited labeled data. However, most existing FSL methods rely on entangled representations, requiring the model to implicitly recover the unmixing process to obtain disentangled representations using only limited supervision, which hinders effective adaptation. Recent theoretical studies show that multimodal contrastive learning methods, such as CLIP, can disentangle latent representations up to linear transformations. In light of this, we propose the Causal CLIP Adapter (CCA), a novel framework that explicitly disentangles visual features extracted from CLIP using unsupervised Independent Component Analysis (ICA). This removes the need to learn the unmixing process from the labeled data, thereby reducing the number of trainable parameters and mitigating overfitting. Taking a step further, while ICA can obtain visual disentangled representations, it may also disrupt CLIP's intra- and inter-modal alignment. To counteract this, CCA further leverages CLIP's inherent cross-modal alignment by enhancing it in two ways: unidirectionally, through fine-tuning a CLIP-based text classifier, and bidirectionally, via a cross-attention mechanism that enriches visual and textual representations through mutual interaction. Both unimodal and cross-modal classification outputs can be effectively combined linearly to improve classification accuracy. Extensive experiments on 11 benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of few-shot performance and robustness to distributional shifts, while maintaining computational efficiency.

Our real-world benchmark consists of 1,500 images from diverse scenes, and evaluating state-of-the-art depth estimation methods on it reveals that they struggle with transparent objects. The synthetic data generator is fully procedural and capable of providing training data for this task with an unlimited variety of objects and scene compositions. Using this generator, we create a synthetic dataset with 15,300 images. Baseline models training solely on this synthetic dataset produce good cross-domain multi-layer depth estimation. Fine-tuning state-of-the-art single-layer depth models on it substantially improves their performance on transparent objects, with quadruplet accuracy on our benchmark increased from 55.59% to 75.16%",

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have been applied to 3D LiDAR scene completion due to their strong training stability and high completion quality. However, the slow sampling speed limits the practical application of diffusion-based scene completion models since autonomous vehicles require an efficient perception of surrounding environments. This paper proposes a novel distillation method tailored for 3D Li- DAR scene completion models, dubbed ScoreLiDAR, which achieves efficient yet high-quality scene completion. Score- LiDAR enables the distilled model to sample in significantly fewer steps after distillation. To improve completion quality, we also introduce a novel Structural Loss, which encourages the distilled model to capture the geometric structure of the 3D LiDAR scene. The loss contains a scene-wise term constraining the holistic structure and a point-wise term constraining the key landmark points and their relative configuration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ScoreLiDAR significantly accelerates the completion time from 30.55 to 5.37 seconds per frame (>5x) on SemanticKITTI and achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art 3D LiDAR scene completion models.

Structured geometric decomposition enhances scene interpretability and facilitates downstream tasks requiring component-level manipulation.

We introduce a novel architecture called the Anatomy-Informed Cascaded Segmentation Network (AIC-Net).

The deformed prior later guides decoder layers towards more anatomy-informed predictions. We repeat this process at a local patch level to enhance the representation of intricate objects, resulting in a cascaded network structure. AIC-Net is a general method that enhances any existing segmentation models to be more anatomy-aware.

To address this issue, we propose a novel prompt-evolving mechanism to adaptively aggregate base prompts (i.e., task-specific prompts) into a unified prompt while ensuring diversity. By transforming and aligning base prompts, both previously learned and newly introduced, our approach continuously evolves accumulated knowledge to facilitate learning new tasks. We further introduce a learnable probabilistic gate that adaptively determines which layers to activate during the evolution process.

However, existing methods still struggle to scale up as large general video generation models, limiting their potential in real applications. In this paper, we propose OmniHuman, a Diffusion Transformer-based framework that scales up data by mixing motion-related conditions into the training phase. To this end, we introduce two training principles for these mixed conditions, along with the corresponding model architecture and inference strategy. These designs enable OmniHuman to fully leverage data-driven motion generation, ultimately achieving highly realistic human video generation. More importantly, OmniHuman supports various portrait contents (face close-up, portrait, half-body, full-body), supports both talking and singing, handles human-object interactions and challenging body poses, and accommodates different image styles. Compared to existing end-to-end audio-driven methods, OmniHuman not only produces more realistic videos, but also offers greater flexibility in inputs. It also supports multiple driving modalities (audio-driven, video-driven and combined driving signals)",

This structural constraint ensures the tokenizer extracts the most salient visual features first, with each subsequent token adding diminishing yet complementary information.

However, its fixed low-rank structure restricts its adaptability in scenarios with substantial domain gaps, where higher ranks are often required to capture domain-specific complexities. Current adaptive LoRA methods attempt to overcome this limitation by dynamically expanding or selectively allocating ranks, but these approaches frequently depend on computationally intensive techniques such as iterative pruning, rank searches, or additional regularization. To address these challenges, we introduce Stable Rank-Guided Low-Rank Adaptation (SR-LoRA), a novel framework that utilizes the stable rank of pre-trained weight matrices as a natural prior for layer-wise rank allocation. By leveraging the stable rank, which reflects the intrinsic dimensionality of the weights, SR-LoRA enables a principled and efficient redistribution of ranks across layers, enhancing adaptability without incurring additional search costs. Empirical evaluations on few-shot tasks with significant domain gaps show that SR-LoRA consistently outperforms recent adaptive LoRA variants, achieving a superior trade-off between performance and efficiency.

In SR-specific tasks, diffusion methods rely solely on low-resolution (LR) inputs, limiting their ability to leverage reference information. Prior reference-based diffusion SR methods have shown that incorporating appropriate references can significantly enhance reconstruction quality; however, identifying suitable references in real-world scenarios remains a critical challenge. Recently, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as an effective framework that integrates retrieval-based and generation-based information from databases to enhance the accuracy and relevance of responses. Inspired by RAG, we propose an image-based RAG framework (iRAG) for realistic super-resolution, which employs a trainable hashing function to retrieve either real-world or generated references given an LR query. Retrieved patches are passed to a restoration module that generates high-fidelity super-resolved features, and a hallucination filtering mechanism is used to refine generated references from pre-trained diffusion models.

We begin by analyzing the underlying issues of vanilla fine-tuning and observe that it is often trapped in regions with low loss for both clean and poisoned samples. Motivated by such observations, we propose Distance-Driven Detoxification (D3), an innovative approach that reformulates backdoor defense as a constrained optimization problem.

For each institution, however, pre-training RSFMs with limited data in a standalone manner may lead to suboptimal performance, while aggregating remote sensing data from multiple institutions for centralized pre-training raises privacy concerns. Seeking for collaboration is a promising solution to resolve this dilemma, where multiple institutions can collaboratively train RSFMs without sharing private data. In this paper, we propose a novel privacy-preserved pre-training framework (FedSense), which enables multiple institutions to collaboratively train RSFMs without sharing private data. However, it is a non-trivial task hindered by a vicious cycle, which results from model drift by remote sensing data heterogeneity and high communication overhead. To break this vicious cycle, we introduce federated mutual-guidance learning. Specifically, we propose a Server-to-Clients Guidance (SCG) mechanism to guide clients' updates towards global-flatness optimal solutions. Additionally, we propose a Clients-to-Server Guidance (CSG) mechanism to inject local knowledge into the server by low-bit communication.

Due to the complexity of geometric distortions, finding universally geometric-invariant features is challenging, and it is not clear whether such an invariant representation exists. Therefore, instead of seeking invariant representations, we embed a sensitive template feature alongside the watermarking features. This template evolves with geometric distortions, allowing us to reconstruct the distortion trajectory for correction before extraction. Focusing on latent diffusion models, we fine-tune the VAE decoder to inject the invisible SynTag feature, pairing it with a prediction network for extraction and correction. Additionally, we introduce a dither compensation mechanism to further improve correction accuracy. SynTag is highly compatible with existing inversion-based methods.

This time-of-flight data encodes rich scene information and thus enables recovery of simple scenes from sparse measurements. We investigate the feasibility of using a distributed set of few measurements (e.g., as few as 15 pixels) to recover the geometry of simple parametric scenes with a strong prior, such as estimating the 6D pose of a known object. To achieve this, we design a method that utilizes both feed-forward prediction to infer scene parameters, and differentiable rendering within an analysis-by-synthesis framework to refine the scene parameter estimate.

To address this gap, we introduce the Does-it/Can-it framework, DIM-CIM, a reference-free measurement of default-mode diversity (\"Does\" the model generate images with expected attributes?) and generalization capacity (\"Can\" the model generate diverse attributes for a particular concept?). We construct the COCO-DIMCIM benchmark, which is seeded with COCO concepts and captions and augmented by a large language model. With COCO-DIMCIM, we find that widely-used models improve in generalization at the cost of default-mode diversity when scaling from 1.5B to 8.1B parameters. DIMCIM also identifies fine-grained failure cases, such as attributes that are generated with generic prompts but are rarely generated when explicitly requested. Finally, we use DIMCIM to evaluate the training data of a T2I model and observe a correlation of 0.85 between diversity in training images and default-mode diversity.

It then identifies the features most relevant to the target concept for unlearning. During inference, it selectively modifies these features to suppress specific concepts while preserving unrelated information. We evaluate SAUCE on two distinct VLMs, LLaVA-v1.5-7B and LLaMA-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct, across two types of tasks: concrete concept unlearning (objects and sports scenes) and abstract concept unlearning (emotions, colors, and materials), encompassing a total of 60 concepts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAUCE outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 18.04% in unlearning quality while maintaining comparable model utility. Furthermore, we investigate SAUCE's robustness against widely used adversarial attacks, its transferability across models, and its scalability in handling multiple simultaneous unlearning requests.

Further, we show that this critical dependence on skip connections is a relatively new phenomenon, with previous deep architectures (e.g., CNNs) exhibiting good performance in their absence. In this paper, we theoretically characterize that the self-attention mechanism is fundamentally ill-conditioned and is, therefore, uniquely dependent on skip connections for regularization. Additionally, we propose Token Graying (TG), a simple yet effective complement (to skip connections) that further improves the condition of in- put tokens. We validate our approach in both supervised and self-supervised training methods",

Existing methods do this by describing objects at a single level of detail, which often does not capture fine-grained details such as varying textures, materials, and shapes of the parts of objects.We propose the task of expressive 3D captioning: given an input 3D scene, describe objects at multiple levels of detail: a high-level object description, and a low-level description of the properties of its parts.To produce such captions, we present ExCap3D, an expressive 3D captioning model which takes as input a 3D scan, and for each detected object in the scan, generates a fine-grained collective description of the parts of the object, along with an object-level description conditioned on the part-level description.We design ExCap3D to encourage semantic consistency between the generated text descriptions, as well as textual similarity in the latent space, to further increase the quality of the generated captions.To enable this task, we generated the ExCap3D Dataset by leveraging a visual-language model (VLM) for multi-view captioning. ExCap3D Dataset contains captions on the ScanNet++ dataset with varying levels of detail,comprising 190k text descriptions of 34k 3D objects in 947 indoor scenes.Our experiments show that the object- and part-level of detail captions generated by ExCap3D are of higher quality than those produced by state-of-the-art methods, with a Cider score improvement of 17% and 126% for object- and part-level details respectively.

The core idea is to re-frame `instruction-based image editing' as `reference-image-based text-to-image generation', which preserves the generative power of well-trained Text-to-Image models without architectural modifications or inversion. Specifically, taking the reference image and a prompt as input, we introduce a Cross-Attentive UNet, which newly adds attention bridges to inject reference image features into the prompt-to-edit-image generation process.

Through detailed exploration, we offer a suite of ready-to-use solutions, ranging from linear attention design to optimization strategies. Our core contributions include 5 practical guidelines: 1) Applying depth-wise convolution within simple linear attention is sufficient for image generation. 2) Using fewer heads in linear attention provides a free-lunch performance boost without increasing latency. 3) Inheriting weights from a fully converged, pre-trained DiT. 4) Loading all parameters except those related to linear attention. 5) Hybrid knowledge distillation: using a pre-trained teacher DiT to help the training of the student linear DiT, supervising not only the predicted noise but also the variance of the reverse diffusion process. These guidelines lead to our proposed Linear Diffusion Transformer (LiT), which serves as a safe and efficient alternative baseline for DiT with pure linear attention. In class-conditional 256x256 and 512x512 ImageNet generation, LiT can be quickly adapted from DiT using only 20% and 33% of DiT's training steps, respectively, while achieving comparable performance. LiT also rivals methods based on Mamba or Gated Linear Attention. Moreover, the same guidelines generalize to text-to-image generation: LiT can be swiftly converted from PixArt-S to generate high-quality images, maintaining comparable GenEval scores",

Our efficient model architecture based on a Gaussian Transformer significantly reduces computational and memory requirements by eliminating the need for expensive 3D convolutions used with inefficient voxel-based representations that predominantly represent empty 3D spaces. GaussianFlowOcc effectively captures scene dynamics by estimating temporal flow for each Gaussian during the overall network training process, offering a straightforward solution to a complex problem that is often neglected by existing methods. Moreover, GaussianFlowOcc is designed for scalability, as it employs weak supervision and does not require costly dense 3D voxel annotations based on additional data (e.g., LiDAR). Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that GaussianFlowOcc significantly outperforms all previous methods for weakly supervised occupancy estimation on the nuScenes dataset while featuring an inference speed that is 50 times faster than current SOTA",

To enable more flexible image manipulation and editing, recent research has expanded from single image generation to transparent layer generation and multi-layer compositions. However, existing approaches often fail to provide a thorough exploration of multi-layer structures, leading to inconsistent inter-layer interactions, such as occlusion relationships, spatial layout, and shadowing. In this paper, we introduce DreamLayer, a novel framework that enables coherent text-driven generation of multiple image layers, by explicitly modeling the relationship between transparent foreground and background layers. DreamLayer incorporates three key components, i.e., Context-Aware Cross-Attention (CACA) for global-local information exchange, Layer-Shared Self-Attention (LSSA) for establishing robust inter-layer connections, and Information Retained Harmonization (IRH) for refining fusion details at the latent level.By leveraging a coherent full-image context, DreamLayer builds inter-layer connections through attention mechanisms and applies a harmonization step to achieve seamless layer fusion. To facilitate research in multi-layer generation, we construct a high-quality, diverse multi-layer dataset including 400k samples. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate that DreamLayer generates more coherent and well-aligned layers, with broad applicability, including latent-space image editing and image-to-layer decomposition",

Since existing road infrastructures are designed for human drivers, safety improvements are typically introduced only after accidents occur. This reactive approach poses a significant challenge for autonomous systems, which require proactive risk mitigation. To address this issue, we propose OD-RASE, a framework for enhancing the safety of autonomous driving systems by detecting road structures that cause traffic accidents and connecting these findings to infrastructure development. First, we formalize an ontology based on specialized domain knowledge of road traffic systems. In parallel, we generate infrastructure improvement proposals using a large-scale visual language model (LVLM) and use ontology-driven data filtering to enhance their reliability. This process automatically annotates improvement proposals on pre-accident road images, leading to the construction of a new dataset. Furthermore, we introduce the Baseline approach (OD-RASE model), which leverages LVLM and a diffusion model to produce both infrastructure improvement proposals and generated images of the improved road environment. Our experiments demonstrate that ontology-driven data filtering enables highly accurate prediction of accident-causing road structures and the corresponding improvement plans. We believe that this work contributes to the overall safety of traffic environments and marks an important step toward the broader adoption of autonomous driving systems",

However, single fine-tuned models often fall short of meeting the diverse needs of users. Model merging has thus emerged as an efficient method to integrate the capabilities of existing models into a unified model. Nevertheless, existing model merging methods face challenging trade-offs between performance and deployment costs, primarily due to task interference. For the first time, we reveal that task interference is evident in the frequency domain of model parameters, yet current efforts only focus on spatial domain solutions, which are largely ineffective in addressing frequency domain interference. To mitigate the impact of frequency domain interference, we propose **FR-Merging**, an innovative method that effectively filters harmful frequency domain interference on the backbone with minimal computational overhead. Since performance loss is inevitable with cost-free methods, we propose a lightweight task-specific expert module that dynamically compensates for information loss during merging. This proposed framework, **FREE-Merging** (FR-Merging with experts), strikes a balanced trade-off between training cost, inference latency, storage requirements, and performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of both FR-Merging and FREE-Merging on multiple tasks across CV, NLP, and Multi-Modal domains and show that they can be flexibly adapted to specific needs",

This mismatch between rich visual details and sparse textual cues can lead to the misidentification of similar objects. To address this, we propose a novel visual grounding framework that leverages multiple latent expressions generated from a single textual input by incorporating complementary visual details absent from the original description. Specifically, we introduce subject distributor and visual concept injector modules to embed both shared-subject and distinct-attributes concepts into the latent representations, thereby capturing unique and target-specific visual cues.

In this paper, we propose the ***NoiseController***, consisting of **Multi-Level Noise Decomposition**, **Multi-Frame Noise Collaboration**, and **Joint Denoising**, to enhance spatiotemporal consistencies in video generation. In multi-level noise decomposition, we first decompose initial noises into scene-level foreground/background noises, capturing distinct motion properties to model multi-view foreground/background variations. Furthermore, each scene-level noise is further decomposed into individual-level shared and residual components. The shared noise preserves consistency, while the residual component maintains diversity. In multi-frame noise collaboration, we introduce an inter-view spatiotemporal collaboration matrix and an intra-view impact collaboration matrix, which captures mutual cross-view effects and historical cross-frame impacts to enhance video quality.

    "abstract": "Multimodal Diffusion Transformers (MM-DiTs) have achieved remarkable progress in text-driven visual generation. However, even state-of-the-art MM-DiT models like FLUX struggle with achieving precise alignment between text prompts and generated content. We identify two key issues in the attention mechanism of MM-DiT, namely 1) the suppression of cross-modal attention due to token imbalance between visual and textual modalities and 2) the lack of timestep-aware attention weighting, which hinder the alignment. To address these issues, we propose Temperature-Adjusted Cross-modal Attention (TACA), a parameter-efficient method that dynamically rebalances multimodal interactions through temperature scaling and timestep-dependent adjustment. When combined with LoRA fine-tuning, TACA significantly enhances text-image alignment on the T2I-CompBench benchmark with minimal computational overhead. We tested TACA on state-of-the-art models like FLUX and SD3.5, demonstrating its ability to improve text-image alignment in terms of object appearance, attribute binding, and spatial relationships.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Automatic colorization of line drawings has been widely studied to reduce the labor cost of hand-drawn anime production. Deep learning approaches, including image/video generation and feature-based correspondence, have improved accuracy but struggle with occlusions, pose variations, and viewpoint changes. To address these challenges, we propose DACoN, a framework that leverages foundation models to capture part-level semantics, even in line drawings. Our method fuses low-resolution semantic features from foundation models with high-resolution spatial features from CNNs for fine-grained yet robust feature extraction.In contrast to previous methods that rely on the Multiplex Transformer and support only one or two reference images, DACoN removes this constraint, allowing any number of references. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the benefits of using multiple reference images, achieving superior colorization performance.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "At the core of Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) lies segmenting objects from their highly similar surroundings. Previous efforts navigate this challenge primarily through image-level modeling or annotation-based optimization. Despite advancing considerably, this commonplace practice hardly taps valuable dataset-level contextual information or relies on laborious annotations. In this paper, we propose RISE, a RetrIeval SElf-augmented paradigm that exploits the entire training dataset to generate pseudo-labels for single images, which could be used to train COD models. RISE begins by constructing prototype libraries for environments and camouflaged objects using training images (without ground truth), followed by K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) retrieval to generate pseudo-masks for each image based on these libraries. It is important to recognize that using only training images without annotations exerts a pronounced challenge in crafting high-quality prototype libraries. In this light, we introduce a Clustering-then-Retrieval (CR) strategy, where coarse masks are first generated through clustering, facilitating subsequent histogram-based image filtering and cross-category retrieval to produce high-confidence prototypes. In the KNN retrieval stage, to alleviate the effect of artifacts in feature maps, we propose Multi-View KNN Retrieval (MVKR), which integrates retrieval results from diverse views to produce more robust and precise pseudo-masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RISE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised and prompt-based methods. Code is available at https://github.com/xiaohainku/RISE",

Existing methods, while effective for single-human cases, often fail to handle the intricacies of multi-identity interactions because they struggle to associate the correct pairs of human appearance and pose condition and model the distribution of 3D-aware dynamics. To address these limitations, we present Structural Video Diffusion, a novel framework designed for generating realistic multi-human videos. Our approach introduces two core innovations: identity-specific embeddings to maintain consistent appearances across individuals and a structural learning mechanism that incorporates depth and surface-normal cues to model human-object interactions. Additionally, we expand existing human video dataset with 25K new videos featuring diverse multi-human and object interaction scenarios, providing a robust foundation for training. Experimental results demonstrate that Structural Video Diffusion achieves superior performance in generating lifelike, coherent videos for multiple subjects with dynamic and rich interactions, advancing the state of human-centric video generation.

Building on this, various methods further fine-tune the pre-trained T2I model for specific tasks.

In this paper, we introduce UniVG, a generalist diffusion model capable of supporting a diverse range of image generation tasks with a single set of weights. UniVG treats multi-modal inputs as unified conditions to enable various downstream applications, ranging from T2I generation, inpainting, instruction-based editing, identity-preserving generation, and layout-guided generation, to depth estimation and referring segmentation. Through comprehensive empirical studies on data mixing and multi-task training, we provide detailed insights into the training processes and decisions that inform our final designs. For example, we show that T2I generation and other tasks, such as instruction-based editing, can coexist without performance trade-offs, while auxiliary tasks like depth estimation and referring segmentation enhance image editing. Notably, our model can even outperform some task-specific models on their respective benchmarks, marking a significant step towards a unified image generation model",

Unlike other OT-based approaches, ASOT makes no assumptions about action ordering and can decode a temporally consistent segmentation from a noisy cost matrix between video frames and action labels. However, the resulting segmentation lacks segment-level supervision, limiting the effectiveness of feedback between frames and action representations. To address this limitation, we propose Closed Loop Optimal Transport (CLOT), a novel OT-based framework with a multi-level cyclic feature learning mechanism. Leveraging its encoder-decoder architecture, CLOT learns pseudo-labels alongside frame and segment embeddings by solving two separate OT problems. It then refines both frame embeddings and pseudo-labels through cross-attention between the learned frame and segment embeddings, by integrating a third OT problem.

    "abstract": "Recent 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representations have demonstrated remarkable performance in novel view synthesis; further, material-lighting disentanglement on 3DGS warrants relighting capabilities and its adaptability to broader applications. While the general approach to the latter operation lies in integrating differentiable physically-based rendering (PBR) techniques to jointly recover BRDF materials and environment lighting, achieving a precise disentanglement remains an inherently difficult task due to the challenge of accurately modeling light transport. Existing approaches typically approximate Gaussian points' normals, which constitute an implicit geometric constraint. However, they usually suffer from inaccuracies in normal estimation that subsequently degrade light transport, resulting in noisy material decomposition and flawed relighting results. To address this, we propose GeoSplatting, a novel approach that augments 3DGS with explicit geometry guidance for precise light transport modeling. By differentiably constructing a surface-grounded 3DGS from an optimizable mesh, our approach leverages well-defined mesh normals and the opaque mesh surface, and additionally facilitates the use of mesh-based ray tracing techniques for efficient, occlusion-aware light transport calculations. This enhancement ensures precise material decomposition while preserving the efficiency and high-quality rendering capabilities of 3DGS. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GeoSplatting, highlighting its superior efficiency and state-of-the-art inverse rendering performance",

    "abstract": "With the rise of applications such as embodied intelligence, developing high real-time online video instance segmentation (VIS) has become increasingly important. However, through time profiling of the components in advanced online VIS architecture (i.e., transformer-based architecture), we find that the transformer decoder significantly hampers the inference speed. Further analysis of the similarities between the outputs from adjacent frames at each transformer decoder layer reveals significant redundant computations within the transformer decoder. To address this issue, we introduce Temporal-Aware query Routing (TAR) mechanism. We embed it before each transformer decoder layer. By fusing the optimal queries from the previous frame, the queries output by the preceding decoder layer, and their differential information, TAR predicts a binary classification score and then uses an argmax operation to determine whether the current layer should be skipped. Experimental results demonstrate that integrating TAR into the baselines achieves significant efficiency gains (24.7 - 34.6 FPS for MinVIS, 22.4 - 32.8 FPS for DVIS++) while also improving performance (e.g., on YoutubeVIS 2019, 47.4 - 48.4 AP for MinVIS, 55.5 - 55.7 AP for DVIS++). Furthermore, our analysis of the TAR mechanism shows that the number of skipped layers increases as the differences between adjacent video frames decrease, which suggests that our method effectively utilizes inter-frame differences to reduce redundant computations in the transformer decoder",

    "abstract": "Text-based diffusion models have made significant breakthroughs in generating high-quality images and videos from textual descriptions. However, the lengthy sampling time of the denoising process remains a significant bottleneck in practical applications. Previous methods either ignore the statistical relationships between adjacent steps or rely on attention or feature similarity between them, which often only works with specific network structures. To address this issue, we discover a new statistical relationship in the transition operator between adjacent steps, focusing on the relationship of the outputs from the network. This relationship does not impose any requirements on the network structure. Based on this observation, we propose a novel training-free acceleration method called LTC-Accel, which uses the identified relationship to estimate the current transition operator based on adjacent steps. Due to no specific assumptions regarding the network structure, LTC-Accel is applicable to almost all diffusion-based methods and orthogonal to almost all existing acceleration techniques, making it easy to combine with them. Experimental results demonstrate that LTC-Accel significantly speeds up sampling in text-to-image and text-to-video synthesis while maintaining competitive sample quality. Specifically, LTC-Accel achieves a speedup of 1.67 times in Stable Diffusion v2 and a speedup of 1.55 times in video generation models. When combined with distillation models, LTC-Accel achieves a remarkable 10 times speedup in video generation, allowing real-time generation of more than 16 FPS.

Monocular camera calibration is essential for many 3D vision tasks. However, most existing methods depend on handcrafted assumptions or are constrained by limited training data, resulting in poor generalization across diverse real-world images. Recent advancements in stable diffusion models, trained on massive data, have shown the ability to generate high-quality images with varied characteristics. Emerging evidence indicates that these models implicitly capture the relationship between camera focal length and image content. Building on this insight, we explore how to leverage the powerful priors of diffusion models for monocular pinhole camera calibration. Specifically, we introduce a new image-based representation, termed Camera Image, which losslessly encodes the numerical camera intrinsics and integrates seamlessly with the diffusion framework. Using this representation, we reformulate the problem of estimating camera intrinsics as the generation of a dense Camera Image conditioned on an input image. By fine-tuning a stable diffusion model to generate a Camera Image from a single RGB input, we can extract camera intrinsics via a RANSAC operation. We further demonstrate that our monocular calibration method enhances performance across various 3D tasks, including zero-shot metric depth estimation, 3D metrology, pose estimation and sparse-view reconstruction.

Yet, its efficacy in training vision-language model (VLM) agents for goal-directed action reasoning in visual environments is less established. This work investigates this problem through extensive experiments on complex card games, such as 24 points, and embodied tasks from ALFWorld. We find that when rewards are based solely on action outcomes, RL fails to incentivize CoT reasoning in VLMs, instead leading to a phenomenon we termed thought collapse, characterized by a rapid loss of diversity in the agent's thoughts, state-irrelevant and incomplete reasoning, and subsequent invalid actions, resulting in negative rewards. To counteract thought collapse, we highlight the necessity of process guidance and propose an automated corrector that evaluates and refines the agent's reasoning at each RL step. This simple and scalable GTR (Guided Thought Reinforcement) framework trains reasoning and action simultaneously without the need for dense, per-step human labeling.

Recent research indicates that the learned semantic concepts of pre-trained models are critical for identifying fake images. However, the misalignment between the forgery and semantic concept spaces hinders the model's forgery detection performance. To address this problem, we propose a novel Semantic Discrepancy-aware Detector (SDD) that leverages reconstruction learning to align the two spaces at a fine-grained visual level. By exploiting the conceptual knowledge embedded in the pre-trained vision-language model, we specifically design a semantic token sampling module to mitigate the space shifts caused by features irrelevant to both forgery traces and semantic concepts. A concept-level forgery discrepancy learning module, built upon a visual reconstruction paradigm, is proposed to strengthen the interaction between visual semantic concepts and forgery traces, effectively capturing discrepancies under the concepts' guidance. Finally, the low-level forgery feature enhancemer integrates the learned concept-level forgery discrepancies to minimize redundant forgery information. Experiments conducted on two standard image forgery datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed SDD, which achieves superior results compared to existing methods.

However, existing approaches often remain constrained by their reliance on support queries, their failure to fully utilize the rich priors embedded in pre-trained large language models, and the limitations imposed by their parametric distribution assumptions. To address these challenges, we introduce CapeLLM, the first multimodal large language model (MLLM) designed for CAPE. Our method only employs query image and detailed text descriptions as an input to estimate category-agnostic keypoints. Our method encompasses effective training strategies and carefully designed instructions for applying the MLLM to CAPE. Moreover, we propose an inference mechanism that further enhances the reasoning process for unseen keypoints. while flexibly modeling their underlying spatial distribution and uncertainty, allowing for adaptive refinement based on contextual cues. We conducted extensive experiments to apply the MLLM to CAPE effectively, focusing not only on the model architecture and prompt design but also on ensuring robustness across input variations. Our approach sets a new state-of-the-art on the MP-100 benchmark in the 1-shot and even 5-shot setting, marking a significant advancement in the field of category-agnostic pose estimation.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces VisHall3D, a novel two-stage framework for monocular semantic scene completion that aims to address the issues of feature entanglement and geometric inconsistency prevalent in existing methods. VisHall3D decomposes the scene completion task into two stages: reconstructing the visible regions (vision) and inferring the invisible regions (hallucination). In the first stage, VisFrontierNet, a visibility-aware projection module, is introduced to accurately trace the visual frontier while preserving fine-grained details. In the second stage, OcclusionMAE, a hallucination network, is employed to generate plausible geometries for the invisible regions using a noise injection mechanism. By decoupling scene completion into these two distinct stages, VisHall3D effectively mitigates feature entanglement and geometric inconsistency, leading to significantly improved reconstruction quality.The effectiveness of VisHall3D is validated through extensive experiments on two challenging benchmarks: SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360. VisHall3D achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming previous methods by a significant margin and paves the way for more accurate and reliable scene understanding in autonomous driving and other applications",

    "abstract": "Bridging different modalities lies at the heart of cross-modality generation. While conventional approaches treat the text modality as a conditioning signal that gradually guides the denoising process from Gaussian noise to the target image modality, we explore a much simpler paradigm--directly evolving between text and image modalities through flow matching. This requires projecting both modalities into a shared latent space, which poses a significant challenge due to their inherently different representations: text is highly semantic and encoded as 1D tokens, whereas images are spatially redundant and represented as 2D latent embeddings. To address this, we introduce FlowTok, a minimal framework that seamlessly flows across text and images by encoding images into a compact 1D token representation. Compared to prior methods, this design reduces the latent space size by 3.3x at an image resolution of 256, eliminating the need for complex conditioning mechanisms or noise scheduling. Moreover, FlowTok naturally extends to image-to-text generation under the same formulation. With its streamlined architecture centered around compact 1D tokens, FlowTok is highly memory-efficient, requires significantly fewer training resources, and achieves much faster sampling speeds--all while delivering performance comparable to state-of-the-art models.

Traditional discriminative methods, which learn a deterministic mapping from a 2D image to a single 3D mesh, often struggle with the inherent ambiguities in 2D-to-3D mapping. To address this challenge, we propose MaskHand, a novel generative masked model for hand mesh recovery that synthesizes plausible 3D hand meshes by learning and sampling from the probabilistic distribution of the ambiguous 2D-to-3D mapping process. MaskHand consists of two key components: (1) a VQ-MANO, which encodes 3D hand articulations as discrete pose tokens in a latent space, and (2) a Context-Guided Masked Transformer that randomly masks out pose tokens and learns their joint distribution, conditioned on corrupted token sequence, image context, and 2D pose cues. This learned distribution facilitates confidence-guided sampling during inference, producing mesh reconstructions with low uncertainty and high precision. Extensive evaluations on benchmark and real-world datasets demonstrate that MaskHand achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, robustness, and realism in 3D hand mesh reconstruction.

    "abstract": "Shape-from-Template (SfT) refers to the class of methods that reconstruct the 3D shape of a deforming object from images/videos using a 3D template. Traditional SfT methods require point correspondences between images and the texture of the 3D template in order to reconstruct 3D shapes from images/videos in real time. Their performance severely degrades when encountered with severe occlusions in the images because of the unavailability of correspondences. In contrast, modern SfT methods use a correspondence-free approach by incorporating deep neural networks to reconstruct 3D objects, thus requiring huge amounts of data for supervision. Recent advances use a fully unsupervised or self-supervised approach by combining differentiable physics and graphics to deform 3D template to match input images. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised SfT which uses only image observations: color features, gradients and silhouettes along with a mesh inextensibility constraint to reconstruct at a 400xfaster pace than (best-performing) unsupervised SfT.

    "abstract": "Adversarially robust knowledge distillation transfers the robustness of a large-scale teacher model to a lightweight student while preserving natural performance. However, foundation Vision-Language Models (VLMs) also demand the transfer of zero-shot inference capabilities. We find that standard robust distillation using untargeted adversarial examples fails to transfer out-of-distribution (zero-shot) robustness, as these adversaries primarily push inputs away from their original distribution, exploring a limited portion of the teacher's decision space and missing more diverse failure modes. A natural solution is to generate multiple targeted adversaries that traverse diverse paths across decision boundaries. Thus, these adversaries probe a broader region of the teacher's decision surface. However, naive targeted adversary optimization often converges to local optima within a single category's decision region, limiting the diversity. To address this, we propose a Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO)-based adversarial distillation framework that transfers robustness from large VLMs to lightweight ones by exploiting adversaries with two main objectives: misclassification and category-level adversarial diversity. Theoretically, we show that optimizing for diversity mitigates adversarial collapse into local optima, ensuring adversaries span multiple decision regions and capture the teacher's generalizable robust features.

This paper proposes U-ViLAR, a novel uncertainty-aware visual localization framework designed to address these challenges while enabling adaptive localization using high-definition (HD) maps or navigation maps. Specifically, our method first extracts features from the input visual data and maps them into Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) space to enhance spatial consistency with the map input. Subsequently, we introduce: a) Perceptual Uncertainty-guided Association, which mitigates errors caused by perception uncertainty, and b) Localization Uncertainty-guided Registration, which reduces errors introduced by localization uncertainty. By effectively balancing the coarse-grained large-scale localization capability of association with the fine-grained precise localization capability of registration, our approach achieves robust and accurate localization. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple localization tasks. Furthermore, our model has undergone rigorous testing on large-scale autonomous driving fleets and has demonstrated stable performance in various challenging urban scenarios",

This approach enables training a per-Gaussian autoencoder directly on the lifted features, instead of training autoencoders in the 2D domain. As a result, the autoencoder better aligns with the inference-time feature distribution, achieving high compression fidelity and storage efficiency. Finally, we introduce an adaptive sparsification method that prunes and merges Gaussians, constructing an efficient representation while maintaining details.

Extensive evaluations on several video alignment and action segmentation datasets demonstrate that our multi-task method achieves comparable video alignment yet superior action segmentation results over previous methods in video alignment and action segmentation respectively.

    "abstract": "Compared to image-text pair data, interleaved corpora enable Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to understand the world more naturally like humans. However, such existing datasets are crawled from webpage, facing challenges like low knowledge density, loose image-text relations, and poor logical coherence between images. On the other hand, the internet hosts vast instructional videos (e.g., online geometry courses) that are widely used by humans to learn foundational subjects, yet these valuable resources remain underexplored in VLM training. In this paper, we introduce a high-quality multimodal textbook corpus with richer foundational knowledge for VLM pretraining. It collects over 2.5 years of instructional videos, totaling 22,000 class hours. We first use an LLM-proposed taxonomy to systematically gather instructional videos. Then we progressively extract and refine visual (keyframes), audio (ASR), and textual knowledge (OCR) from the videos, and organize as an image-text interleaved corpus based on temporal order. Compared to its counterparts, our video-centric textbook offers more coherent context, richer knowledge, and better image-text alignment. Experiments demonstrate its superb pretraining performance, particularly in knowledge- and reasoning-intensive tasks like ScienceQA and MathVista. Moreover, VLMs pre-trained on our textbook exhibit outstanding interleaved context awareness, leveraging visual and textual cues in their few-shot context for task solving.

    "abstract": "Understanding scene contexts is crucial for machines to perform tasks and adapt prior knowledge in unseen or noisy 3D environments. As data-driven learning is intractable to comprehensively encapsulate diverse ranges of layouts and open spaces, we propose teaching machines to identify relational commonalities in 3D spaces. Instead of focusing on point-wise or object-wise representations, we introduce 3D scene analogies, which are smooth maps between 3D scene regions that align spatial relationships. Unlike well-studied single instance-level maps, these scene-level maps smoothly link large scene regions, potentially enabling unique applications in trajectory transfer in AR/VR, long demonstration transfer for imitation learning, and context-aware object rearrangement. To find 3D scene analogies, we propose neural contextual scene maps, which extract descriptor fields summarizing semantic and geometric contexts, and holistically align them in a coarse-to-fine manner for map estimation. This approach reduces reliance on individual feature points, making it robust to input noise or shape variations. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in identifying scene analogies and transferring trajectories or object placements in diverse indoor scenes, indicating its potential for robotics and AR/VR applications.

However, the visual matching ability of MLLMs is rarely studied, despite finding the visual correspondence of objects is essential in computer vision. Our research reveals that the matching capabilities in recent MLLMs still exhibit systematic shortcomings, even with current strong MLLMs models, GPT-4o. In particular, we construct a Multimodal Visual Matching (MMVM) benchmark to fairly benchmark over 30 different MLLMs. The MMVM benchmark is built from 15 open-source datasets and Internet videos with manual annotation. In addition, we have designed an automatic annotation pipeline to generate the MMVM SFT dataset, including 220K visual matching data with reasoning annotation. To our knowledge, this is the first MLLMs dataset and benchmark for the MLLM community. Finally, we present CoLVA, a novel contrastive MLLM with two novel technical designs: fine-grained vision expert with object-level contrastive learning and instruction augmentation strategy. The former learns instance discriminative tokens, while the latter further improves instruction following ability. CoLVA-InternVL2-4B achieves an overall accuracy (OA) of 49.80% on the MMVM benchmark, surpassing GPT-4o and the best open-source MLLM, Qwen2VL-72B, by 7.15% and 11.72% OA, respectively.

Our approach introduces three key innovations: an augmented null space formulation that directly relates each event to joint constraints on surface normals and lighting, naturally handling ambient illumination; a continuous parameterization of time-varying illumination that connects asynchronous events to synchronized lighting estimation; and a lighting fixture with known relative geometry that reduces ambiguity to a convex-concave uncertainty.

Tokenizer training typically follows a standard recipe in which images are compressed and reconstructed subject to a combination of MSE, perceptual, and adversarial losses. Diffusion autoencoders have been proposed in prior work as a way to learn end-to-end perceptually-oriented image compression, but have not yet shown state-of-the-art performance on the competitive task of ImageNet-1K reconstruction. In this work, we propose FlowMo, a transformer-based diffusion autoencoder. FlowMo achieves a new state-of-the-art for image tokenization at multiple bitrates. We achieve this without using convolutions, adversarial losses, spatially-aligned 2D latent codes, or distilling from other tokenizers. Our key insight is that FlowMo training should be broken into a mode-matching pre-training stage and a mode-seeking post-training stage. We conduct extensive analysis and ablations, and we additionally train generative models atop the FlowMo tokenizer and verify the performance.

    "abstract": "Panoptic Scene Graph Generation (PSG) integrates instance segmentation with relation understanding to capture pixel-level structural relationships in complex scenes. Although recent approaches leveraging pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) have significantly improved performance in the open-vocabulary setting, they commonly ignore the inherent limitations of VLMs in spatial relation reasoning, such as difficulty in distinguishing object relative positions, which results in suboptimal relation prediction.Motivated by the denoising diffusion model's inversion process in preserving the spatial structure of input images, we propose SPADE (SPatial-Aware Denoising-nEtwork) framework---a novel approach for open-vocabulary PSG. SPADE consists of two key steps: (1) inversion-guided calibration for the UNet adaption, and (2) spatial-aware context reasoning. In the first step, we calibrate a general pre-trained teacher diffusion model into a PSG-specific denoising network with cross-attention maps derived during inversion through a lightweight LoRA-based fine-tuning strategy. In the second step, we develop a spatial-aware relation graph transformer that captures both local and long-range contextual information, facilitating the generation of high-quality relation queries. Extensive experiments on benchmark PSG and Visual Genome datasets demonstrate that SPADE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both closed-set and open-set scenarios, particularly excelling in spatial relationship prediction.

While SLAM is widely used for estimating camera trajectory and point cloud, monocular SLAM does so only up to an unknown scale factor. Previous works estimate the scale factor through optimization, but this is unreliable and time-consuming. This paper presents an optimization-free scale calibration framework, Human as Checkerboard (HAC). HAC explicitly leverages the human body predicted by human mesh recovery model as a calibration reference. Specifically, it innovatively uses the absolute depth of human-scene contact joints as references to calibrate the corresponding relative scene depth from SLAM. HAC benefits from geometric priors encoded in human mesh recovery models to estimate the SLAM scale and achieves precise global human motion estimation. Simple yet powerful, our method sets a new state-of-the-art performance for global human mesh estimation tasks. It reduces motion errors by 50% over prior local-to-global methods while using 100x less post-SLAM inference time than optimization-based methods.

    "abstract": "Ground-to-aerial image synthesis focuses on generating realistic aerial images from corresponding ground street view images while maintaining consistent content layout, simulating a top-down view. The significant viewpoint difference leads to domain gaps between views, and dense urban scenes limit the visible range of street views, making this cross-view generation task particularly challenging. In this paper, we introduce SkyDiffusion, a novel cross-view generation method for synthesizing aerial images from street view images, utilizing a diffusion model and the Bird's-Eye View (BEV) paradigm. The Curved-BEV method in SkyDiffusion converts street-view images into a BEV perspective, effectively bridging the domain gap, and employs a \"multi-to-one\" mapping strategy to address occlusion issues in dense urban scenes. Next, SkyDiffusion designed a BEV-guided diffusion model to generate content-consistent and realistic aerial images. Additionally, we introduce a novel dataset, Ground2Aerial-3, designed for diverse ground-to-aerial image synthesis applications, including disaster scene aerial synthesis, low-altitude UAV image synthesis, and historical high-resolution satellite image synthesis tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that SkyDiffusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods on cross-view datasets across natural (CVUSA), suburban (CVACT), urban (VIGOR-Chicago), and various application scenarios (G2A-3), achieving realistic and content-consistent aerial image generation.

Loss, perplexity, and in-context evaluation results are commonly used pre-training metrics for Large Language Models (LLMs), while we observed that these metrics are less indicative when quantifying the pre-trained LVLMs. Due to the lack of proper metrics, the research of LVLMs in the multi-modal fusion stage is hindered greatly, including the training data choice, efficient module design, etc.In this paper, we first present Modality Integration Rate (MIR), an effective, robust, and generalized metric to indicate the multi-modal alignment quality of LVLMs without SFT. This metric evaluates LVLM pre-training from the inter-modal distribution distance perspective, which is 1) Effective to represent the fusion quality and show a positive relation with the benchmark performance after SFT, 2) Robust toward different training/evaluation data, and 3) Generalize across training configurations and architecture choices. Complementing MIR, we further propose learnable Modality Calibration (MoCa), a lightweight module to narrow the modality gap at each language model layer during training. A series of experiments are conducted to explore the effectiveness of MIR and MoCa, demonstrating that MIR is highly indicative about training data selection, training strategy schedule, and model architecture design to get better pre-training results.

    "abstract": "Facial attractiveness prediction (FAP) has long been an important computer vision task, which could be widely applied in live videos with facial retouching. However, previous FAP datasets are either small or closed-source. Moreover, the corresponding FAP models exhibit limited generalization and adaptation ability.To overcome these limitations, we introduce the first large-scale FAP dataset LiveBeauty specifically designed for live video scenarios wherein face images may be real-time processed for aesthetics purposes.10,000 face images are collected directly from a live streaming platform, with 200,000 corresponding attractiveness annotations obtained from a well-devised subjective experiment, making LiveBeauty the largest open-access FAP dataset. Based on the built dataset, a novel FAP method named Facial Prior Enhanced Multi-modal model (FPEM) is proposed to measure the attractiveness of facial images.Extensive experiments conducted on both LiveBeauty and other open-source FAP datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

    "abstract": "Medical researchers and clinicians often need to perform novel segmentation tasks on a set of related images. Existing methods for segmenting a new dataset are either interactive, requiring substantial human effort for each image, or require an existing set of previously labeled images. We introduce a system, MultiverSeg, that enables practitioners to rapidly segment an entire new dataset without requiring access to any existing labeled data from that task or domain. Along with the image to segment, the model takes user interactions such as clicks, bounding boxes or scribbles as input, and predicts a segmentation. As the user segments more images, those images and segmentations become additional inputs to the model, providing context. As the context set of labeled images grows, the number of interactions required to segment each new image decreases. We demonstrate that MultiverSeg enables users to interactively segment new datasets efficiently, by amortizing the number of interactions per image to achieve an accurate segmentation. Compared to using a state-of-the-art interactive segmentation method, MultiverSeg reduced the total number of clicks by 36% and scribble steps by 25% to achieve 90% Dice on sets of images from unseen tasks.

Through both theoretical analysis and experimental validation, we establish that meta-learning has a tighter generalization bound compared to whole-class training. We unravel that meta-learning is more efficient with limited entropy and is more robust to label noise and heterogeneous tasks, making it well-suited for unsupervised tasks. Based on these insights, We propose MINO, a meta-learning framework designed to enhance unsupervised performance.

    "abstract": "Large-scale multi-modal models have demonstrated remarkable performance across various visual recognition tasks by leveraging extensive paired multi-modal training data. However, in real-world applications, the presence of missing or incomplete modality inputs often leads to significant performance degradation. Recent research has focused on prompt-based strategies to tackle this issue; however, existing methods are hindered by two major limitations: (1) static prompts lack the flexibility to adapt to varying missing-data conditions, and (2) basic prompt-tuning methods struggle to ensure reliable performance when critical modalities are missing. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Synergistic Prompting (SyP) framework for robust visual recognition with missing modalities. The proposed SyP introduces two key innovations: (I) a Dynamic Adapter, which computes adaptive scaling factors to dynamically generate prompts, replacing static parameters for flexible multi-modal adaptation, and (II) a Synergistic Prompting Strategy, which combines static and dynamic prompts to balance information across modalities, ensuring robust reasoning even when key modalities are missing. The proposed SyP achieves significant performance improvements over existing approaches across three widely-used visual recognition datasets, demonstrating robustness under diverse missing rates and conditions. Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate its effectiveness in handling missing modalities, highlighting its superior adaptability and reliability. The source code will be released",

    "abstract": "High-definition (HD) map is an important component to support navigation and planning for autonomous driving vehicles. Predicting map elements with high quality (high classification and localization scores) is crucial to the safety of autonomous driving vehicles. However, current methods perform poorly in high quality predictions due to inherent task misalignment. Two main factors are responsible for misalignment: 1) inappropriate task labels due to one-to-many matching queries sharing the same labels, and 2) sub-optimal task features due to task-shared sampling mechanism. In this paper, we reveal two inherent defects in current methods and develop a novel HD map construction method named DAMap to address these problems. Specifically, DAMap consists of three components: Distance-aware Focal Loss (DAFL), Hybrid Loss Scheme (HLS), and Task Modulated Deformable Attention (TMDA). The DAFL is introduced to assign appropriate classification labels for one-to-many matching samples. The TMDA is proposed to obtain discriminative task-specific features. Furthermore, the HLS is proposed to better utilize the advantages of the DAFL.

Gait analysis is fundamental for optimizing prosthesis design and alignment, directly impacting the mobility and life quality of individuals with lower-limb amputations. Vision-based machine learning (ML) methods offer a scalable and non-invasive solution to gait analysis, but face challenges in correctly detecting and analyzing prosthesis, due to their unique appearances and new movement patterns. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by introducing a multi-purpose dataset, namely ProGait, to support multiple vision tasks including Video Object Segmentation, 2D Human Pose Estimation, and Gait Analysis (GA). ProGait provides 412 video clips from four above-knee amputees when testing multiple newly-fitted prosthetic legs through walking trials, and depicts the presence, contours, poses, and gait patterns of human subjects with transfemoral prosthetic legs. Alongside the dataset itself, we also present benchmark tasks and fine-tuned baseline models to illustrate the practical application and performance of the ProGait dataset. We compared our baseline models against pre-trained vision models, demonstrating improved generalizability when applying the ProGait dataset for prosthesis-specific tasks.

To address these challenges, exploiting the representation and generalization capabilities of Vison Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose VA-GPT, a novel MLLM designed for summarizing and localizing abnormal events in various videos. Our approach efficiently aligns effective tokens between visual encoders and LLMs through two key proposed modules: Spatial Effective Token Selection (SETS) and Temporal Effective Token Generation (TETG). These modules enable our model to effectively capture and analyze both spatial and temporal information associated with abnormal events, resulting in more accurate responses and interactions.

Inspired by the self-reflection capabilities emergent in large language models, we propose ReflectionFlow, an inference-time framework enabling diffusion models to iteratively reflect upon and refine their outputs. ReflectionFlow introduces three complementary inference-time scaling axes: (1) noise-level scaling to optimize latent initialization; (2) prompt-level scaling for precise semantic guidance; and most notably, (3) reflection-level scaling, which explicitly provides actionable reflections to iteratively assess and correct previous generations. To facilitate reflection-level scaling, we construct GenRef, a large-scale dataset comprising 1 million triplets, each containing a reflection, a flawed image, and an enhanced image. Leveraging this dataset, we efficiently perform reflection tuning on state-of-the-art diffusion transformer, FLUX.1-dev, by jointly modeling multimodal inputs within a unified framework.

    "abstract": "Generating harmonic and diverse human motions from music signals, especially for a group of dancers, is a practical yet challenging task in virtual avatar creation. Existing methods merely model a fixed number of dancers, lacking the flexibility for arbitrary individuals. To fulfill this goal, we propose a novel unified framework, FreeDance. Considering the plausibility of generating arbitrary dancers while preserving the diverse dynamics of multiple individuals, we build the framework upon collaborative masked token modeling in a 2D discrete space. In particular, we devise a Cross-modality Residual Alignment Module (CRAM) to diversify the movement of each individual and intensify its alignment with music. CRAM captures the spatial motion deformation of each dancer using residual learning and integrates it with rhythmic representation to reinforce the intrinsic connection. Moreover, recognizing the requirement of interactive coordination, we design a Temporal Interaction Module (TIM). Benefiting from masked 2D motion tokens, TIM effectively models the temporal correlation between current individuals w.r.t. neighboring dancers as interaction guidance to foster stronger inter-dancer dependencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach generates harmonic group dance with any number of individuals, outperforming state-of-the-art methods adapting number-fixed counterparts.

    "abstract": "360deg videos have emerged as a promising medium to represent our dynamic visual world. Compared to the \"tunnel vision\" of standard cameras, their borderless field of view offers a more complete perspective of our surroundings. While existing video models excel at producing standard videos, their ability to generate full panoramic videos remains elusive. In this paper, we investigate the task of video-to-360deg generation: given a perspective video as input, our goal is to generate a full panoramic video that is consistent with the original video. Unlike conventional video generation tasks, the output's field of view is significantly larger, and the model is required to have a deep understanding of both the spatial layout of the scene and the dynamics of objects to maintain spatio-temporal consistency. To address these challenges, we first leverage the abundant 360deg videos available online and develop a high-quality data filtering pipeline to curate pairwise training data. We then carefully design a series of geometry- and motion-aware operations to facilitate the learning process and improve the quality of 360deg video generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our model can generate realistic and coherent 360deg videos from in-the-wild perspective video.

However, existing image editing methods primarily focus on achieving the desired modifications in a single step, which often struggles with ambiguous user intent, complex transformations, or the need for progressive refinements. As a result, these methods frequently produce inconsistent outcomes or fail to meet user expectations. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-turn image editing framework that enables users to iteratively refine their edits, progressively achieving more satisfactory results. Our approach leverages flow matching for accurate image inversion and a dual-objective Linear Quadratic Regulators (LQR) for stable sampling, effectively mitigating error accumulation. Additionally, by analyzing the layer-wise roles of transformers, we introduce a adaptive attention highlighting method that enhances editability while preserving multi-turn coherence.

Featuring 735 sequences (7,875 seconds at 30 fps), HUMOTO captures interactions with 63 precisely modeled objects and 72 articulated parts. Our innovations include a scene-driven LLM scripting pipeline creating complete, purposeful tasks with natural progression, and a mocap-and-camera recording setup to effectively handle occlusions. Spanning diverse activities from cooking to outdoor picnics, HUMOTO preserves both physical accuracy and logical task flow. Professional artists rigorously clean and verify each sequence, minimizing foot sliding and object penetrations. We also provide benchmarks compared to other datasets. HUMOTO's comprehensive full-body motion and simultaneous multi-object interactions address key data-capturing challenges and provide opportunities to advance realistic human-object interaction modeling across research domains with practical applications in animation, robotics, and embodied AI systems.

However, most prevalent image understanding models focus on visual similarity, and learning visual hierarchies is relatively unexplored. In this work, for the first time, we introduce a learning paradigm that can encode user-defined multi-level complex visual hierarchies in hyperbolic space without requiring explicit hierarchical labels. As a concrete example, first, we define a part-based image hierarchy using object-level annotations within and across images. Then, we introduce an approach to enforce the hierarchy using contrastive loss with pairwise entailment metrics. Finally, we discuss new evaluation metrics to effectively measure hierarchical image retrieval. Encoding these complex relationships ensures that the learned representations capture semantic and structural information that transcends mere visual similarity. Experiments in part-based image retrieval show significant improvements in hierarchical retrieval tasks, demonstrating the capability of our model in capturing visual hierarchies",

Current red-teaming methods for proactively assessing such vulnerabilities usually require white-box access to T2I models, and rely on inefficient per-prompt optimization, as well as inevitably generate semantically meaningless prompts easily blocked by filters. In this paper, we propose APT (AutoPrompT), a black-box framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate human-readable adversarial suffixes for benign prompts. We first introduce an alternating optimization-finetuning pipeline between adversarial suffix optimization and fine-tuning the LLM utilizing the optimized suffix. Furthermore, we integrate a dual-evasion strategy in the optimization phase, enabling the bypass of both perplexity-based filter and blacklist word filter: (1) we constrain the LLM generating human-readable prompts through an auxiliary LLM perplexity scoring, which starkly contrasts with prior token-level gibberish, and (2) we also introduce banned-token penalties to suppress the explicit generation of banned-tokens in the blacklist. Extensive experiments demonstrate the excellent red-teaming performance of our human-readable, filter-resistant adversarial prompts, as well as superior zero-shot transferability which enables instant adaptation to unseen prompts and exposes critical vulnerabilities even in commercial APIs (e.g., Leonardo.Ai.)",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised Fine-grained Visual Represent Learning (FVRL) aims to learn discriminative features to distinguish subtle differences among visually similar categories without using labeled fine-grained data. Existing works, which typically learn representation from target data, often struggle to capture subtle inter-class variations due to the limited prior fine-grained knowledge. To alleviate it, this paper proposes LLM-assisted Entropy-based Adaptive Distillation (LEAD), a novel unsupervised FVRL framework that selectively distills fine-grained knowledge from a powerful teacher model built upon pre-trained models. Specifically, we first harness the powerful reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate contextual knowledge of fine-grained category-aware descriptions, enriching semantic priors in the teacher model. These descriptions are then used to form a prototype-driven fine-grained classifier, which acts as an assistant to generate rich knowledge with a frozen vision-language model. Besides, to achieve effective knowledge transfer, we further introduce an entropy-based adaptive mechanism, which dynamically adjusts the distillation strength based on the information entropy to identify and prioritize valuable knowledge. Extensive experimental results on three fine-grained datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed LEAD for unsupervised FVRL.

Jailbreak attacks are red teaming methods that aim to bypass safety mechanisms and discover MLLMs' potential risks. Existing MLLMs' jailbreak methods often bypass the model's safety mechanism through complex optimization methods or carefully designed image and text prompts. Despite achieving some progress, they have a low attack success rate on commercial closed-source MLLMs. Unlike previous research, we empirically find that there exists a Shuffle Inconsistency between MLLMs' comprehension ability and safety ability for the shuffled harmful instruction. That is, from the perspective of comprehension ability, MLLMs can understand the shuffled harmful text-image instructions well. However, they can be easily bypassed by the shuffled harmful instructions from the perspective of safety ability, leading to harmful responses. Then we innovatively propose a text-image jailbreak attack named SI-Attack. Specifically, to fully utilize the Shuffle Inconsistency and overcome the shuffle randomness, we apply a query-based black-box optimization method to select the most harmful shuffled inputs based on the feedback of the toxic judge model. A series of experiments show that SI-Attack can effectively improve the attack's performance on three benchmarks for both open-source and closed-source MLLMs",

Most of the existing approaches focus on learning target representation in well-conditioned daytime data, while for the unconstrained real-world scenarios with adverse weather conditions, e.g. nighttime or foggy environment, the tremendous domain shift leads to significant performance degradation. In this paper, we propose UMDATrack, which is capable of maintaining high-quality target state prediction under various adverse weather conditions within a unified domain adaptation framework. Specifically, we first use a controllable scenario generator to synthesize a small amount of unlabeled videos (less than 2% frames in source daytime datasets) in multiple weather conditions under the guidance of different text prompts. Afterwards, we design a simple yet effective domain-customized adapter (DCA), allowing the target objects' representation to rapidly adapt to various weather conditions without redundant model updating. Furthermore, to enhance the localization consistency between source and target domains, we propose a target-aware confidence alignment module (TCA) following optimal transport theorem.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "MLLM reasoning has drawn widespread research for its excellent problem-solving capability. Current reasoning methods fall into two types: PRM, which supervises the intermediate reasoning steps, and ORM, which supervises the final results. Recently, DeepSeek-R1 has challenged the traditional view that PRM outperforms ORM, which demonstrates strong generalization performance using an ORM method (i.e., GRPO). However, current MLLM's GRPO algorithms still struggle to handle challenging and complex multimodal reasoning tasks (e.g., mathematical reasoning). In this work, we reveal two problems that impede the performance of GRPO on the MLLM: Low data utilization and Text-bias. Low data utilization refers to that GRPO cannot acquire positive rewards to update the MLLM on difficult samples, and text-bias is a phenomenon that the MLLM bypasses image condition and solely relies on text condition for generation after GRPO training. To tackle these problems, this work proposes Hint-GRPO that improves data utilization by adaptively providing hints for samples of varying difficulty, and text-bias calibration that mitigates text-bias by calibrating the token prediction logits with image condition in test-time. Experiment results on three base MLLMs across eleven datasets demonstrate that our proposed methods advance the reasoning capability of original MLLM by a large margin, exhibiting superior performance to existing MLLM reasoning methods.

We propose learning a central conditional distribution as a prior that approximates the specific distributions of diverse environments. To retain environment-specific information during navigation, we allow each environment-specific distribution to approximate this central distribution rather than relying on it directly. To implement this, we introduce a meta-learning mechanism that integrates with traditional navigation methods, offering tailored solutions for various types of navigation approaches. Our approach, Learning on the Go (LOG), enables agents to learn on the go, allowing for flexible, adaptive, real-time learning during navigation. Our theoretical analysis highlights the benefits of learning a central distribution for effective generalization across environments, and empirical results confirm the proposed method's effectiveness, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing approaches",

Consequently, HarDiff consists of two key components. The low-frequency training process extracts structural priors from the source domain, to enhance understanding of task-related content. The high-frequency sampling process utilizes detail-oriented guidance from the unseen target domain, to infer precise dense predictions with target-related details.

Recently, event cameras have attracted significant research interest for its ability to model motion cues over the exposure duration. However, these methods directly fuse event features with image, overlooking the intrinsic heterogeneity of events. In this paper, we identify that the event modality contains two conflicting types of information: edge features and motion cues. Events accumulated over a short exposure period capture sharp edge details but lose motion information, while those accumulated over a long exposure period blur edge details due to motion. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective approach to disentangle these two cues from event features and employ an edge-aware sharpening module along with motion-driven scale-adaptive deblurring module to fully leverage both. Specifically, the first module aids in restoring sharp edges by leveraging the clear edge features provided by events, while the second module leverages motion cues to learn diverse blur kernels, adaptively adjusting the receptive field for optimal deblurring.

Among various colorization methods, scribble-based methods have a unique advantage that allows users to accurately resolve ambiguities and modify the colors of any objects to suit their specific tastes. However, due to the time-consuming scribble drawing process, users tend to draw sparse scribbles instead of dense and detailed scribbles, which makes it challenging for existing methods, especially for regions with no immediate scribbles. Facing the above problems, this paper proposes a novel colorization algorithm named Local and Global Affinity Net (LGA-Net) that formulates the scribble-based colorization task as an affinity propagation process at both local and global levels. Instead of predicting color values directly, our neural network learns to predict local and global affinity relationships between pixels for a given grayscale input, describing how colors should be propagated, which are independent of the scribbles. Given reliable affinity relationships, the color propagation process is formulated as a maximum a posteriori problem. Both local and global affinities are represented using a weighted graph and enabled by a graph Laplacian regularizer to ensure accurate color propagation.

In this work, we propose Discretized Gaussian Representation (DGR), a novel framework that reconstructs the 3D volume directly using a set of discretized Gaussian functions in an end-to-end manner. To further enhance efficiency, we introduce Fast Volume Reconstruction, a highly parallelized technique that aggregates Gaussian contributions into the voxel grid with minimal overhead. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that DGR achieves superior reconstruction quality and runtime performance across various CT reconstruction scenarios.

In this paper, we introduce ScoreHOI, an effective diffusion-based optimizer that introduces diffusion priors for the precise recovery of human-object interactions. By harnessing the controllability within score-guided sampling, the diffusion model can reconstruct a conditional distribution of human and object pose given the image observation and object feature. During inference, the ScoreHOI effectively improves the reconstruction results by guiding the denoising process with specific physical constraints. Furthermore, we propose a contact-driven iterative refinement approach to enhance the contact plausibility and improve the reconstruction accuracy.

To address this limitation, we introduce DeepFlow, a novel framework that enhances velocity representation through inter-layer communication. DeepFlow partitions transformer layers into balanced branches with deep supervision and inserts a lightweight Velocity Refiner with Acceleration (VeRA) block between adjacent branches, which aligns the intermediate velocity features within transformer blocks.

While this formulation is elegant and powerful, it is limited to static scenes. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the concept of Dynamic Point Maps (DPM), which extends standard point maps to support 4D tasks such as motion segmentation, scene flow estimation, 3D object tracking, and 2D correspondence. Our key insight is that, when time is introduced, several possible spatial and temporal references can be used to define the point maps. We identify a minimal subset of these combinations that can be regressed by a network to solve the aforementioned tasks. We train a DPM predictor on a mixture of synthetic and real data and evaluate it across diverse benchmarks, including video depth prediction, dynamic point cloud reconstruction, 3D scene flow, and object pose tracking, achieving state-of-the-art performance",

However, extreme downscaling factors pose significant challenges to the upscaling process due to its highly ill-posed nature, causing existing image rescaling methods to struggle in generating semantically correct structures and perceptual friendly textures. In this work, we propose a novel framework called Timestep-Aware Diffusion Model (TADM) for extreme image rescaling, which performs rescaling operations in the latent space of a pre-trained autoencoder and effectively leverages powerful natural image priors learned by a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model. Specifically, TADM adopts a pseudo-invertible module to establish the bidirectional mapping between the latent features of the HR image and the target-sized LR image. Then, the rescaled latent features are enhanced by a pre-trained diffusion model to generate more faithful details. Considering the spatially non-uniform degradation caused by the rescaling operation, we propose a novel time-step alignment strategy, which can adaptively allocate the generative capacity of the diffusion model based on the quality of the reconstructed latent features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of TADM over previous methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. The code will be available at: https://github.com/wwangcece/TADM",

To address these limitations, we propose RoMaP, a novel local 3D Gaussian editing framework that enables precise and drastic part-level modifications. First, we introduce a robust 3D mask generation module with our 3D-Geometry Aware Label Prediction (3D-GALP), which uses spherical harmonics (SH) coefficients to model view-dependent label variations and soft-label property, yielding accurate and consistent part segmentations across viewpoints. Second, we propose a regularized SDS loss that combines the standard SDS loss with additional regularizers. In particular, an L1 anchor loss is introduced via our Scheduled Latent Mixing and Part (SLaMP) editing method, which generates high-quality part-edited 2D images and confines modifications only to the target region while preserving contextual coherence. Additional regularizers, such as Gaussian prior removal, further improve flexibility by allowing changes beyond the existing context, and robust 3D masking prevents unintended edits. Experimental results demonstrate that our RoMaP achieves state-of-the-art local 3D editing on both reconstructed and generated Gaussian scenes and objects qualitatively and quantitatively, making it possible for more robust and flexible part-level 3D Gaussian editing.

However, existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs), especially open-source ones, are still falling behind with a typical success rate of 30%-50% on challenging benchmarks. Previous studies on fine-tuning MLLMs with synthetic charts are often restricted by their inadequate similarity to the real charts, which could compromise model training and performance on complex real-world charts. In this study, we show that modularizing chart generation and diversifying visual details improves chart understanding capabilities. In particular, we design a five-step data synthesis pipeline, where we separate data and function creation for single plot generation, condition the generation of later subplots on earlier ones for multi-subplot figures, visually diversify the generated figures, filter out low quality data, and finally generate the question-answer (QA) pairs with GPT-4o. This approach allows us to streamline the generation of fine-tuning datasets and introduce the effective chart dataset (ECD), which contains 10k+ chart images and 300k+ QA pairs, covering 25 topics and featuring 250+ chart type combinations with high visual complexity. We show that ECD consistently improves the performance of various MLLMs on a range of real-world and synthetic test sets.

While most existing NAS approaches for PFL perform architecture search on the server side, client-side NAS--where architectures are optimized locally on clients--offers stronger privacy protection by eliminating the need to transmit sensitive model information. However, this paradigm remains underexplored and often suffers from suboptimal average client performance, primarily due to two limitations: (1) Inefficient client-side search strategies caused by data isolation and restricted access to local architectures across clients, and (2) slow supernet convergence arising from server aggregation and local supernet training. To address these challenges, we propose a Personalized Federated Stochastic Differential Equation-based NAS (PerFedSDE-NAS). To achieve effective local search, each client employs a guided diffusion model to generate promising personalized architectures tailored to local data characteristics, while a performance predictor based on radial basis functions is used to select only the most promising subset of architectures for evaluation. To accelerate supernet convergence, each client maintains a supernet with an archive-driven training mechanism, and a novel model aggregation strategy is proposed to further enhance weight convergence during FL rounds. We validate PerFedSDE-NAS across three NAS search spaces, including convolutional neural networks and transformers, demonstrating its broad applicability.

    "abstract": "Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) is a billion-dollar problem in machine learning, which significantly impacts the training efficiency and model performance. However, achieving efficient and robust HPO in deep reinforcement learning (RL) is consistently challenging due to its high non-stationarity and computational cost. To tackle this problem, existing approaches attempt to adapt common HPO techniques (e.g., population-based training or Bayesian optimization) to the RL scenario. However, they remain sample-inefficient and computationally expensive, which cannot facilitate a wide range of applications. In this paper, we propose ULTHO, an ultra-lightweight yet powerful framework for fast HPO in deep RL within single runs. Specifically, we formulate the HPO process as a multi-armed bandit with clustered arms (MABC) and link it directly to long-term return optimization. ULTHO also provides a quantified and statistical perspective to filter the HPs efficiently. We test ULTHO on benchmarks including ALE, Procgen, MiniGrid, and PyBullet. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the ULTHO can achieve superior performance with a simple architecture, contributing to the development of advanced and automated RL systems",

While these models can excel at retrieving the correct identity within the top-K predictions, they often struggle when hard negatives are among the top shortlist, leading to relatively low performance at the highest ranks (e.g., Rank-1). In this paper, we introduce CarGait, a Re-ranking (re-ordering the top-K list) method for gait recognition, leveraging the fine-grained correlations between pairs of gait sequences, through cross-attention between gait strips. This re-ranking scheme can be adapted to existing single-stage models to enhance their final results.

To address this fundamental challenge, we present DiffVSR, featuring a Progressive Learning Strategy (PLS) that systematically decomposes this learning burden through staged training, enabling superior performance on complex degradations. Our framework additionally incorporates an Interweaved Latent Transition (ILT) technique that maintains competitive temporal consistency without additional training overhead. Experiments demonstrate that our approach excels in scenarios where competing methods struggle, particularly on severely degraded videos.

    "abstract": "Physical adversarial attack methods expose the vulnerabilities of deep neural networks and pose a significant threat to safety-critical scenarios such as autonomous driving. Camouflage-based physical attack is a more promising approach compared to the patch-based attack, offering stronger adversarial effectiveness in complex physical environments. However, most prior work relies on mesh priors of the target object and virtual environments constructed by simulators, which are time-consuming to obtain and inevitably differ from the real world. Moreover, due to the limitations of the backgrounds in training images, previous methods often fail to produce multi-view robust adversarial camouflage and tend to fall into sub-optimal solutions. Due to these reasons, prior work lacks adversarial effectiveness and robustness across diverse viewpoints and physical environments. We propose a physical attack framework based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), named PGA, which provides rapid and precise reconstruction with few images, along with photo-realistic rendering capabilities. Our framework further enhances cross-view robustness and adversarial effectiveness by preventing mutual and self-occlusion among Gaussians and employing a min-max optimization approach that adjusts the imaging background of each viewpoint, helping the algorithm filter out non-robust adversarial features. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and superiority of PGA. Our code is available at: https://github.com/TRLou/PGA",

To address these issues, we systematically analyze methods to maintain pure language capabilities during the training of MLLMs, focusing on both training data and model architecture aspects. Based on these analyses, we propose GenieBlue, an efficient MLLM structural design that integrates both linguistic and multimodal capabilities for LLMs on mobile devices. GenieBlue freezes the original LLM parameters during MLLM training to maintain pure language capabilities. It acquires multimodal capabilities by duplicating specific transformer blocks for full fine-tuning and integrating lightweight LoRA modules.

Besides, validating pan-sharpening performance in high-level semantic tasks is intractable for the absence of datasets. To tackle these issues, we propose a deep adaptive unfolded network via spatial morphology stripping and spectral filtration for pan-sharpening, which is conceptualized as a linear inverse problem regularized by spatial and spectral priors. Specifically, we incorporate phase-oriented constraints into the spatial prior to facilitate the extraction of modal-invariant spatial morphology by intrinsic decomposition and leverage a physics-driven spectral filtration attention mechanism aligned with the spectral prior to mine the inherent spectral correlation. After transparently unfolding the model into a multi-stage network, an adaptive stage-exiting mechanism is designed to capitalize on fusion diversity by aggregating optimal image patches across candidate stages. To systematically complete the assessment, we construct the first panoptic segmentation dataset as a semantic-level benchmark for pan-sharpening performance validation.

While recent methods based on 3D/4D Gaussian Splatting (GS) have demonstrated promising results, they still encounter challenges in complex street scenes due to the unpredictable motion of dynamic objects. Current methods typically decompose street scenes into static and dynamic objects, learning the Gaussians in either a supervised manner (e.g., w/ 3D bounding-box) or a self-supervised manner (e.g., w/o 3D bounding-box). However, these approaches do not effectively model the motions of dynamic objects (e.g., the motion speed of pedestrians is clearly different from that of vehicles), resulting in suboptimal scene decomposition. To address this, we propose Explicit Motion Decomposition (EMD), which models the motions of dynamic objects by introducing learnable motion embeddings to the Gaussians, enhancing the decomposition in street scenes. The proposed plug-and-play EMD module compensates for the lack of motion modeling in self-supervised street Gaussian splatting methods. We also introduce tailored training strategies to extend EMD to supervised approaches.

    "abstract": "Reconstructing atmospheric surface \\text CO _2 is crucial for understanding climate dynamics and informing global mitigation strategies. Traditional inversion models achieve precise global \\text CO _2 reconstruction but rely heavily on uncertain prior estimates of fluxes and emissions. Inspired by recent advances in data-driven weather forecasting, we explore whether data-driven models can reduce reliance on these priors. However, \\text CO _2 reconstruction presents unique challenges, including complex spatio-temporal dynamics, periodic patterns and sparse observations. We propose \\text CO _2-Net, a data-driven model that addresses these challenges without requiring extensive prior data. We formulate \\text CO _2 reconstruction as solving a constrained advection-diffusion equation and derive three key components: physics-informed spatio-temporal factorization for capturing complex transport dynamics, wind-based embeddings for modeling periodic variations and a semi-supervised loss for integrating sparse \\text CO _2 observations with dense meteorological data. \\text CO _2-Net is designed in three sizes---small (S), base (B) and large (L)---to balance performance and efficiency. On CMIP6 reanalysis data, \\text CO _2-Net (S) and (L) reduce RMSE by 11% and 71% , respectively, when compared to the best data-driven baseline. On real observations, \\text CO _2-Net (L) achieves RMSE comparable to inversion models. The ablation study shows that the effectiveness of wind-based embedding and semi-supervised loss stems from their compatibility with our spatio-temporal factorization.

While concurrent LLM-based approaches like VLM2VEC, MM-Embed, NV-Embed, and MM-GEM have demonstrated impressive capabilities in multi-modal and multi-task scenarios, our work introduces novel mechanisms for task-adaptive learning and embedding extraction that further enhance the potential of LLM-based retrieval systems. Our key technical contribution lies in the development of a task-aware contrastive learning framework with an automated Bayesian weighing mechanism. This approach provides a principled way to balance multiple tasks during training, departing from conventional contrastive learning strategies. We further enhance the framework through a multiple-token summarization strategy and an auxiliary language modeling objective, which together significantly improve retrieval performance.Comprehensive experiments on M-BEIR and ICinW benchmarks demonstrate M3T-UEM's effectiveness, showing competitive or superior performance compared to both traditional encoder-based methods and recent LLM-based approaches.

    "abstract": "This paper presents Randomized AutoRegressive modeling (RAR) for visual generation, which sets a new state-of-the-art performance on the image generation task while maintaining full compatibility with language modeling frameworks. The proposed RAR is simple: during a standard autoregressive training process with a next-token prediction objective, the input sequence-typically ordered in raster form-is randomly permuted into different factorization orders with a probability r, where r starts at 1 and linearly decays to 0 over the course of training. This annealing training strategy enables the model to learn to maximize the expected likelihood over all factorization orders and thus effectively improve the model's capability of modeling bidirectional contexts. Importantly, RAR preserves the integrity of the autoregressive modeling framework, ensuring full compatibility with language modeling while significantly improving performance in image generation. On the ImageNet-256 benchmark, RAR achieves an FID score of 1.48, not only surpassing prior state-of-the-art autoregressive image generators but also outperforming leading diffusion-based and masked transformer-based methods.

    "title": "Towards More Diverse and Challenging Pre-training for Point Cloud Learning: Self-Supervised Cross Reconstruction with Decoupled Views",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Point cloud learning, especially in a self-supervised way without manual labels, has gained growing attention in both vision and learning communities due to its potential utility in a wide range of applications. Most existing generative approaches for point cloud self-supervised learning focus on recovering masked points from visible ones within a single view. Recognizing that a two-view pre-training paradigm inherently introduces greater diversity and variance, it may thus enable more challenging and informative pre-training. Inspired by this, we explore the potential of two-view learning in this domain. In this paper, we propose Point-PQAE, a cross-reconstruction generative paradigm that first generates two decoupled point clouds/views and then reconstructs one from the other. To achieve this goal, we develop a crop mechanism for point cloud view generation for the first time and further propose a novel positional encoding to represent the 3D relative position between the two decoupled views. The cross-reconstruction significantly increases the difficulty of pre-training compared to self-reconstruction, which enables our method to surpass previous single-modal self-reconstruction methods in 3D self-supervised learning. Specifically, it outperforms the self-reconstruction baseline (Point-MAE) by 6.5%, 7.0%, and 6.7% in three variants of ScanObjectNN with the Mlp-Linear evaluation protocol.

These methods easily collapse when changing the prompt view direction and mainly handle object-centric cases. In this paper, we propose a novel single-stage 3D diffusion model, DiffusionGS, for object generation and scene reconstruction from a single view. DiffusionGS directly outputs 3D Gaussian point clouds at each timestep to enforce view consistency and allow the model to generate robustly given prompt views of any directions, beyond object-centric inputs. Plus, to improve the capability and generality of DiffusionGS, we scale up 3D training data by developing a scene-object mixed training strategy. Experiments show that DiffusionGS yields improvements of 2.20 dB/23.25 and 1.34 dB/19.16 in PSNR/FID for objects and scenes than the state-of-the-art methods, without using 2D diffusion prior and depth estimator.

However, their latency, high computational costs and memory demands pose significant challenges for deployment, especially on resource-constrained hardware. While structured pruning methods can reduce these factors, they often require costly retraining, sometimes for up to hundreds of epochs, or even training from scratch to recover the lost accuracy resulting from the structural modifications. Maintaining the provided performance of trained models after structured pruning and thereby avoiding extensive retraining remains a challenge. To solve this, we introduce Variance-Based Pruning, a simple and structured one-shot pruning technique for efficiently compressing networks, with minimal finetuning. Our approach first gathers activation statistics, which are then used to select neurons for pruning. Simultaneously the mean activations are integrated back into the model to preserve a high degree of performance. On ImageNet-1k recognition tasks, we demonstrate that directly after pruning DeiT-Base retains over 70% of its original performance and requires only 10 epochs of fine-tuning to regain 99% of the original accuracy while simultaneously reducing MACs by 35% and model size by 36%, thus speeding up the model by 1.44 times",

    "title": "Learning Normal Flow Directly From Events",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Event-based motion field estimation is an important task. However, current optical flow methods face challenges: learning-based approaches, often frame-based and relying on CNNs, lack cross-domain transferability, while model-based methods, though more robust, are less accurate. To address the limitations of optical flow estimation, recent works have focused on normal flow, which can be more reliably measured in regions with limited texture or strong edges. However, existing normal flow estimators are predominantly model-based and suffer from high errors. In this paper, we propose a novel supervised point-based method for normal flow estimation that overcomes the limitations of existing event learning-based approaches. Using a local point cloud encoder, our method directly estimates per-event normal flow from raw events, offering multiple unique advantages: 1) It produces temporally and spatially sharp predictions. 2) It supports more diverse data augmentation, such as random rotation, to improve robustness across various domains. 3) It naturally supports uncertainty quantification via ensemble inference, which benefits downstream tasks. 4) It enables training and inference on undistorted data in normalized camera coordinates, improving transferability across cameras. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method achieves better and more consistent performance than state-of-the-art methods when transferred across different datasets. Leveraging this transferability, we train our model on the union of datasets and release it for public use. Finally, we introduce an egomotion solver based on a maximum-margin problem that uses normal flow and IMU to achieve strong performance in challenging scenarios.

A key challenge in this setting arises from the lack of semantic alignment between prompt instructions that encode similar distributional patterns of missing data across different clients. To address this, our framework introduces specialized client-tuning and server-aggregation designs that simultaneously optimize, align, and aggregate prompt-tuning instructions across clients and data modalities. This allows prompt instructions to complement one another and be combined effectively.

To overcome this, we introduce Gaussian Instance Tracing (GIT), which augments the standard Gaussian representation with an instance weight matrix across input views. Leveraging the inherent consistency of Gaussians in 3D, we use this matrix to identify and correct 2D segmentation inconsistencies. Furthermore, since each Gaussian ideally corresponds to a single object, we propose a GIT-guided adaptive density control mechanism to split and prune ambiguous Gaussians during training, resulting in sharper and more coherent 2D and 3D segmentation boundaries.

While LMMs have demonstrated promising results in tackling multimodal tasks like image captioning, visual question answering, and visual grounding, the object detection capabilities of LMMs exhibit a significant gap compared to specialist detectors. To bridge the gap, we depart from the conventional methods of integrating heavy detectors with LMMs and propose LMM-Det, a simple yet effective approach that leverages a large multimodal model for vanilla object detection without relying on specialized detection modules. Specifically, we conduct a comprehensive exploratory analysis when a large multimodal model meets with object detection, revealing that the recall rate degrades significantly compared with specialist detection models. To mitigate this, we propose to increase the recall rate by introducing data distribution adjustment and inference optimization tailored for object detection. We re-organize the instruction conversations to enhance the object detection capabilities of large multimodal models. We claim that a large multimodal model possesses detection capability without any extra detection modules. Extensive experiments support our claim and show the effectiveness of the versatile LMM-Det.

While widely used, they often assume full knowledge of the forward model -- an unrealistic expectation -- while collecting ground truth and measurement pairs is time-consuming and labor-intensive.Without paired supervision or an invertible forward model, solving inverse problems becomes significantly more challenging and error-prone. To address this, strong priors have traditionally been introduced to regularize the problem, enabling solutions from single images alone.In this work, however, we demonstrate that with minimal assumptions on the forward model and by leveraging small, unpaired clean and degraded datasets, we can achieve good estimates of the true degradation. We employ conditional flow matching to efficiently model the degraded data distribution and explicitly learn the forward model using a tailored distribution-matching loss.Through experiments on uniform and non-uniform deblurring tasks, we show that our method outperforms both single-image blind and unsupervised approaches, narrowing the gap to non-blind methods.

This spurious correlation bias leads to overfitting irrelevant background features during adversarial training, thereby degrading the model's robust performance and generalization capabilities.

To address this, we introduce the concept of epsilon-sample cover, which quantifies sample redundancy based on inter-sample relationships, capturing the intrinsic structure of the dataset.

    "abstract": "We present OuroMamba, the first data-free post-training quantization (DFQ) method for vision Mamba-based models (VMMs). We identify two key challenges in enabling DFQ for VMMs, (1) VMM's recurrent state transitions restricts the capturing of long-range interactions and leads to semantically weak synthetic data, (2) VMM activations exhibit dynamic outlier variations across time-steps, rendering existing static PTQ techniques ineffective. To address these challenges, OuroMamba presents a two-stage framework: (1) OuroMamba-Gen to generate semantically rich and meaningful synthetic data. It applies contrastive learning on patch level VMM features generated through neighborhood interactions in the latent state space, (2) OuroMamba-Quant to employ mixed-precision quantization with lightweight dynamic outlier detection during inference. In specific, we present a thresholding based outlier channel selection strategy for activations that gets updated every time-step. Extensive experiments across vision and generative tasks show that our data-free OuroMamba surpasses existing data-driven PTQ techniques, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse quantization settings. Additionally, we implement efficient GPU kernels to achieve practical latency speedup of up to 2.36x.

    "abstract": "Autofocus (AF) is essential for imaging systems, particularly in industrial applications such as automated optical inspection (AOI), where achieving precise focus is critical. Conventional AF methods rely on peak-searching algorithms that require dense focal sampling, making them inefficient in small depth-of-field (DoF) scenarios. Deep learning (DL)-based AF methods, while effective in general imaging, have a limited working range in small DoF conditions due to defocus uncertainty. In this work, we propose a novel AF framework that integrates an optical model-based sharpness indicator with a deep learning approach to predict sharpness from defocused images. We leverage sharpness estimation as a reliable focus measure and apply an adaptive adjustment algorithm to adjust the focus position based on the sharpness-to-distance mapping. This method effectively addresses defocus uncertainty and enables robust autofocus across a 35x DoF range.Experimental results on an AOI system demonstrate that our approach achieves reliable autofocus even from highly defocused starting points and remains robust across different textures and illumination conditions. Compared to conventional and existing DL-based approaches, our method offers improved precision, efficiency, and adaptability, making it suitable for industrial applications and small DoF scenarios",

State-of-the-art methods alleviate such overhead in parallel diffusion inference through computation-communication overlapping, termed displaced parallelism. However, we identify that these techniques induce severe staleness --- the usage of outdated activations from previous timesteps that significantly degrades quality, especially in expert-parallel scenarios. We tackle this fundamental tension and propose DICE, a staleness-centric optimization framework with a three-fold approach: (1) Interweaved Parallelism introduces staggered pipelines, effectively halving step-level staleness for free; (2) Selective Synchronization operates at layer-level and protects layers vulnerable to staled activations; and (3) Conditional Communication, a token-level, training-free method that dynamically adjusts communication frequency based on token importance. Together, these strategies effectively reduce staleness, achieving 1.26x speedup with minimal quality degradation. Empirical results establish DICE as an effective and scalable solution.

In this work, we identify that missing noise-augmented training causes critical security gaps: many VLMs are susceptible to even simple perturbations such as Gaussian noise.

To improve on this, we propose SHeaP (Self-supervised Head Geometry Predictor Learned via 2D Gaussians).Given a source image, we predict a 3DMM mesh and a set of Gaussians that are rigged to this mesh. We then reanimate this rigged head avatar to match a target frame, and backpropagate photometric losses to both the 3DMM and Gaussian prediction networks. We find that using Gaussians for rendering substantially improves the effectiveness of this self-supervised approach.Training solely on 2D data, our method surpasses existing self-supervised approaches in geometric evaluations on the NoW benchmark for neutral faces and a new benchmark for non-neutral expressions.

As a result, interference occurs among different attributes, preventing precise control of multiple attributes together. To address this challenge, we aim to disentangle multiple attributes in slider-based generation to enbale more reliable and independent attribute manipulation. Our approach, CompSlider, can generate a conditional prior for the T2I foundation model to control multiple attributes simultaneously. Furthermore, we introduce novel disentanglement and structure losses to compose multiple attribute changes while maintaining structural consistency within the image. Since CompSlider operates in the latent space of the conditional prior and does not require retraining the foundation model, it reduces the computational burden for both training and inference.

    "abstract": "Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) seeks to retrieve a target image by using a reference image and conditioning text specifying desired modifications. While recent approaches have shown steady performance improvements on existing CIR benchmarks, we argue that it remains unclear whether these gains genuinely reflect an enhanced compositional understanding of both visual and textual information. For example, current benchmarks do not explicitly consider negation cases and offer limited semantic diversity, with insufficient hard negatives to thoroughly evaluate the CIR task. To bridge this gap, we introduce Multimodal Arithmetic Benchmark for CIR (MA-CIR), a challenging CIR benchmark that integrates arithmetic types (negation, replacement, and addition) across seven complex semantic categories (e.g., spatial reasoning, object reasoning, etc). Moreover, carefully constructed hard negatives are incorporated to assess models in a controlled setting. In MA-CIR, we observe that current CIR models struggle with negation (or replacement) arithmetic types and semantic types that require complex reasoning, indicating a potential reliance on object or concept information. To tackle this, we propose leveraging strong text encoders, particularly those based on large language models (LLMs), and fine-tuning them using carefully constructed text triplets that include hard negatives, thereby enhancing their compositional understanding. As a result, MA-CIR achieves a 16% gain on MA-CIR, along with 6% and 9% improvements on CIRR and CIRCO, respectively. Our code and dataset are available in https://github.com/jaeseokbyun/MACIR",

In this paper, we propose an extended adversarial purification framework named NAPPure, which can further handle non-additive perturbations.

A key innovation of SimMLM is the proposed More vs. Fewer (MoFe) ranking loss, which ensures that task accuracy improves or remains stable as more modalities are made available. This aligns the model with an intuitive principle: removing one or more modalities should not increase accuracy.

However, human labeling is costly, making it increasingly unsustainable as model scales increase. (ii) Existing models often learn the two tasks in parallel. The strong reciprocity between them has not been fully explored. In response, this work proposes Dual Reciprocal Learning (DRL) for language-based human motion understanding and generation. DRL establishes a symmetric learning framework where both tasks collaboratively evolve in a closed-loop, bootstrapping manner, effectively leveraging the reciprocity between them. In DRL, the tasks serve as evaluators for each other, enabling the generation of informative feedback signals even with easily acquired unidirectional motion or language data.

In this paper, we propose the first lossless point cloud geometry compression method called Lossless Implicit Neural Representations for Point Cloud Geometry Compression (LINR-PCGC). To accelerate encoding speed, we design a group of point clouds level coding framework with an effective network initialization strategy, which can reduce around 60% encoding time. A lightweight coding network based on multiscale SparseConv, consisting of scale context extraction, child node prediction, and model compression modules, is proposed to realize fast inference and compact decoder size. Experimental results show that our method consistently outperforms traditional and AI-based methods: for example, with the convergence time in the MVUB dataset, our method reduces the bitstream by approximately 21.21% compared to G-PCC TMC13v23 and 21.95% compared to SparsePCGC",

RoCo-Sim significantly improves roadside 3D object detection, outperforming SOTA methods by 83.74% on Rcooper-Intersection and 83.12% on TUMTraf-V2X for AP70.

In this work, we present the UK Biobank Organs and Bones (UKBOB), the largest labeled dataset of body organs of 51,761 MRI 3D samples (17.9 M 2D images) and a total of more than 1.37 billion 2D segmentation masks of 72 organs based on the UK Biobank MRI dataset. We utilize automatic labeling, filter the labels with organ-specific filters, and manually annotate a subset of 300 MRIs with 11 abdominal classes to validate the quality (UKBOB-manual). This approach allows for scaling up the dataset collection while maintaining confidence in the labels. We further confirm the validity of the labels by the zero-shot generalization of trained models on the filtered UKBOB to other small labeled datasets from a similar domain ( _E.g._ abdominal MRI). To further elevate the effect of the noisy labels, we propose a novel Entropy Test-time Adaptation (ETTA) to refine the segmentation output. We use UKBOB to train a foundation model (_Swin-BOB_) for 3D medical image segmentation based on Swin-UNetr, achieving state-of-the-art results in several benchmarks in 3D medical imaging, including BRATS brain MRI tumour challenge (+0.4% improvement), and BTCV abdominal CT scan benchmark (+1.3% improvement).

    "abstract": "Active learning (AL) seeks to reduce annotation costs by selecting the most informative samples for labeling, making it particularly valuable in resource-constrained settings. However, traditional evaluation methods, which focus solely on final accuracy, fail to capture the full dynamics of the learning process. To address this gap, we propose PALM (Performance Analysis of Active Learning Models), a unified and interpretable mathematical model that characterizes AL trajectories through four key parameters: achievable accuracy, coverage efficiency, early-stage performance, and scalability. PALM provides a predictive description of AL behavior from partial observations, enabling the estimation of future performance and facilitating principled comparisons across different strategies. We validate PALM through extensive experiments on CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet-50/100/200, covering a wide range of AL methods and self-supervised embeddings. Our results demonstrate that PALM generalizes effectively across datasets, budgets, and strategies, accurately predicting full learning curves from limited labeled data. Importantly, PALM reveals crucial insights into learning efficiency, data space coverage, and the scalability of AL methods. By enabling the selection of cost-effective strategies and predicting performance under tight budget constraints, PALM lays the basis for more systematic, reproducible, and data-efficient evaluation of AL in both research and real-world applications.

    "abstract": "Video Multimodal Large Language Models (Video-MLLM) have achieved remarkable advancements in video understanding tasks. However, constrained by the context length limitation in the underlying LLMs, existing Video-MLLMs typically exhibit suboptimal performance on long video scenarios. To understand extended input frames, common solutions span token compression and streaming inference techniques, which sacrifice feature granularity or inference efficiency. Differently, to efficiently achieve comprehensive understanding of longer frame inputs, we draw ideas from MoE and propose a training-free approach Free-MoRef, which instantly multiplexes the context perception capabilities of Video-MLLMs within one inference pass. Specifically, Free-MoRef reconstructs the vision tokens into several short sequences as multi-references. Subsequently, we introduce MoRef-attention, which gathers clues from the multi-reference chunks in parallel to summarize unified query activations. After the shadow layers in LLMs, a reference fusion step is derived to compose a final mixed reasoning sequence with key tokens from parallel chunks, which compensates the cross-reference vision interactions that are neglected in MoRef-attention. By splitting and fusing the long vision token sequences, Free-MoRef achieves improved performance under much lower computing costs in reasoning multiplexed context length, demonstrating strong efficiency and effectiveness. Experiments on VideoMME, MLVU, LongVideoBench show that Free-MoRef achieves full perception of 2xto 8xlonger input frames without compression on a single A100 GPU while keeping instant responses, thereby bringing significant performance gains, even surpassing dedicatedly trained long-video-MLLMs. Codes are available at https://github.com/wkfdb/Free-MoRef",

This enables users to mix these individual conditions with greater flexibility, leading to more efficient and accurate image generation control. Previous ControlNet-based models rely solely on global conditions, which affect the entire image and lack the ability of element- or region-specific control. This limitation reduces flexibility and can cause condition misunderstandings in multi-conditional image generation. To address these challenges, we propose both intra-element and inter-element Controllers in DC-ControlNet. The Intra-Element Controller handles different types of control signals within individual elements, accurately describing the content and layout characteristics of the object. For interactions between elements, we introduce the Inter-Element Controller, which accurately handles multi-element interactions and occlusion based on user-defined relationships.

Existing motion transfer approaches explored the motion representations of reference videos to guide generation. Nevertheless, these methods typically rely on sample-specific optimization frameworks, resulting in high computational burdens. In this paper, we propose EfficientMT, a novel and efficient end-to-end framework for video motion transfer. By leveraging a small set of synthetic paired motion transfer samples, EfficientMT effectively adapts a pretrained T2V model into a general motion transfer framework that can accurately capture and reproduce diverse motion patterns. Specifically, we repurpose the backbone of the T2V model to extract temporal information from reference videos, and further propose a scaler module to distill motion-related information. Subsequently, we introduce a temporal integration mechanism that seamlessly incorporates reference motion features into the video generation process. After training on our self-collected synthetic paired samples, EfficientMT enables general video motion transfer without requiring test-time optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our EfficientMT outperforms existing methods in efficiency while maintaining flexible motion controllability.

However, previous works focus on learning prototypes only in the textual modality while overlooking the ambiguous semantics in class names. These ambiguities lead to textual prototypes that are insufficient to capture visual concepts, resulting in limited performance. To address this issue, we introduce **ProtoMM**, a training-free framework that constructs multimodal prototypes to adapt VLMs during the test time. By viewing the prototype as a discrete distribution over the textual descriptions and visual particles, ProtoMM has the ability to combine the multimodal features for comprehensive prototype learning. More importantly, the visual particles are dynamically updated as the testing stream flows. This allows our multimodal prototypes to continually learn from the data, enhancing their generalizability in unseen scenarios. In addition, we quantify the importance of the prototypes and test images by formulating their semantic distance as an optimal transport problem.

However, many existing methods struggle to fully capture spatial and spectral interactions, limiting their effectiveness. To address this, we propose a novel quaternion-based spatial-spectral interaction network that enhances pansharpening by leveraging the compact representation capabilities of quaternions for high-dimensional data. Our method consists of three key components: the quaternion global spectral interaction branch, the quaternion local spatial structure awareness branch, and the quaternion spatial-spectral interaction branch. The first applies the quaternion Fourier transform to convert multi-channel features into the frequency domain as a whole, enabling global information interaction while preserving inter-channel dependencies, which aids spectral fidelity. The second uses a customized spatial quaternion representation, combined with a window-shifting strategy, to maintain local spatial dependencies while promoting spatial interactions, which helps inject spatial details. The last integrates the two pathways within the quaternion framework to enrich spatial-spectral interactions for richer representations. By utilizing quaternion's multi-dimensional representation and parameter-sharing properties, our method achieves a more compact and efficient cross-resolution, multi-band information integration, significantly improving the quality of the fused image.

However, due to the static bias of CLIP, such video learners tend to overfit on shortcut static features, thereby compromising their generalizability, especially to novel out-of-context actions. To address this issue, we introduce Open-MeDe, a novel Meta-optimization framework with static Debiasing for Open-vocabulary action recognition. From a fresh perspective of generalization, Open-MeDe adopts a meta-learning approach to improve known-to-open generalizing and image-to-video debiasing in a cost-effective manner. Specifically, Open-MeDe introduces a cross-batch meta-optimization scheme that explicitly encourages video learners to quickly generalize to arbitrary subsequent data via virtual evaluation, steering a smoother optimization landscape. In effect, the free of CLIP regularization during optimization implicitly mitigates the inherent static bias of the video meta-learner. We further apply self-ensemble over the optimization trajectory to obtain generic optimal parameters that can achieve robust generalization to both in-context and out-of-context novel data.

With this new perspective, we also propose metric convolutions, a novel approach that samples unit balls from explicit signal-dependent metrics, providing interpretable operators with geometric regularisation.

    "abstract": "Despite significant advancements in vision-language models (VLMs), there lacks effective approaches to enhance response quality by scaling inference-time computation. This capability is known to be a core step towards the self-improving models in recent large language model studies. In this paper, we present Vision Value Model (VisVM) that can guide VLM inference-time search to generate responses with better visual comprehension. Specifically, VisVM not only evaluates the generated sentence quality in the current search step, but also anticipates the quality of subsequent sentences that may result from the current step, thus providing a long-term value. In this way, VisVM steers VLMs away from generating sentences prone to hallucinations or insufficient detail, thereby producing higher quality responses. Experimental results demonstrate that VisVM-guided search significantly enhances VLMs' ability to generate descriptive captions with richer visual details and fewer hallucinations, compared with greedy decoding and search methods with other visual reward signals. Furthermore, we find that self-training the model with the VisVM-guided captions improve VLM's performance across a wide range of multimodal benchmarks, indicating the potential for developing self-improving VLMs",

Previous UFL works have predominantly focused on representation learning and clustering tasks. Recently, vision language models (e.g., CLIP) have gained significant attention for their attractive zero-shot prediction capabilities. Leveraging this advancement, classification problems that were previously infeasible under the UFL paradigm now present new opportunities but remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we extend UFL to the classification problem with CLIP for the first time and propose a novel method, **Fed**erated **Co**operative **P**seudo **L**abeling (**FedCoPL**). Specifically, clients estimate and upload their pseudo label distribution, and the server adjusts and redistributes them to avoid global imbalance among categories. Moreover, we introduce a partial prompt aggregation protocol for effective collaboration and personalization. In particular, visual prompts containing general image features are aggregated at the server, while text prompts encoding personalized knowledge are retained locally.

    "abstract": "Domain Adaptation (DA) for dense prediction tasks is an important topic, which enhances the dense prediction model's performance when tested on its unseen domain. Recently, with the development of Diffusion-based Dense Prediction (DDP) models, the exploration of DA designs tailored to this framework is worth exploring, since the diffusion model is effective in modeling the distribution transformation that comprises domain information. In this work, we propose a training-free mechanism for DDP frameworks, endowing them with DA capabilities. Our motivation arises from the observation that the exposure bias (e.g., noise statistics bias) in diffusion brings domain shift, and different domains in conditions of DDP models can also be effectively captured by the noise prediction statistics. Based on this, we propose a training-free Domain Noise Alignment (DNA) approach, which alleviates the variations of noise statistics to domain changes during the diffusion sampling process, thereby achieving domain adaptation. Specifically, when the source domain is available, we directly adopt the DNA method to achieve domain adaptation by aligning the noise statistics of the target domain with those of the source domain. For the more challenging source-free DA, inspired by the observation that regions closer to the source domain exhibit higher confidence meeting variations of sampling noise, we utilize the statistics from the high-confidence regions progressively to guide the noise statistic adjustment during the sampling process. Notably, our method demonstrates the effectiveness of enhancing the DA capability of DDP models across four common dense prediction tasks.

    "abstract": "Data-free quantization (DFQ) enables model quantization without accessing real data, addressing concerns regarding data security and privacy. With the growing adoption of Vision Transformers (ViTs), DFQ for ViTs has garnered significant attention. However, existing DFQ methods exhibit two limitations: (1) semantic distortion, where the semantics of synthetic images deviate substantially from those of real images, and (2) semantic inadequacy, where synthetic images contain extensive regions with limited content and oversimplified textures, leading to suboptimal quantization performance. To address these limitations, we propose SARDFQ, a novel Semantics Alignment and Reinforcement Data-Free Quantization method for ViTs. To address semantic distortion, SARDFQ incorporates Attention Priors Alignment (APA), which optimizes synthetic images to follow randomly generated structure attention priors. To mitigate semantic inadequacy, SARDFQ introduces Multi-Semantic Reinforcement (MSR), leveraging localized patch optimization to enhance semantic richness across synthetic images. Furthermore, SARDFQ employs Soft-Label Learning (SL), wherein multiple semantic targets are adapted to facilitate the learning of multi-semantic images augmented by MSR. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SARDFQ, significantly surpassing existing methods. For example, SARDFQ improves top-1 accuracy on ImageNet by 15.52% for W4A4 ViT-B",

Then, by leveraging the strong multilingual modeling capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose converting the predicted Roman text into language-specific graphemes, forming the proposed Cascaded Zero-AVSR. Taking it a step further, we explore a unified Zero-AVSR approach by directly integrating the audio-visual speech representations encoded by the AV-Romanizer into the LLM. This is achieved through finetuning the adapter and the LLM using our proposed multi-task learning scheme. To capture the wide spectrum of phonetic and linguistic diversity, we also introduce a Multilingual Audio-Visual Romanized Corpus (MARC) consisting of 2,916 hours of audio-visual speech data across 82 languages, along with transcriptions in both language-specific graphemes and Roman text.

This paper proposes a simple yet effective Supervised Exploratory Learning (SEL) framework to achieve these goals simultaneously from space exploration perspectives. SEL employs the adaptive Optimal Foraging Algorithm (OFA) to generate diverse exploratory examples, integrating Class-biased Complement (CbC) for balanced class distribution and Fitness-weighted Sampling (FwS) for space exploration. Both theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate that SEL enhances class balance, sharpens decision boundaries, and strengthens decision regions.

Event cameras have the advantages of low latency and high dynamic range, thus providing a reliable solution to this challenge. However, since events are sparse, this makes it an ill-posed problem to obtain dense disparity using only events. In this work, we propose a novel framework for event-based dense stereo via cross-sensor knowledge distillation. Specifically, a multi-level intensity-to-event distillation strategy is designed to maximize the potential of long-range information, local texture details, and task-related knowledge of the intensity images. Simultaneously, to enforce the cross-view consistency, an intensity-event joint left-right consistency module is proposed. With our framework, extensive dense and structural information contained in intensity images is distilled to the event branch. Therefore, retaining only the events can predict dense disparities during inference, preserving the low latency characteristics of the events. Adequate experiments conducted on the MVSEC and DSEC datasets demonstrate that our method exhibits superior stereo matching performance than baselines, both quantitatively and qualitatively",

This paper, in contrast, tries to learn and understand underlying semantic variations from distracting videos via offline-to-online latent distillation and flexible disentanglement constraints. To enable effective cross-domain semantic knowledge transfer, we introduce an interpretable model-based RL framework, dubbed Disentangled World Models (DisWM). Specifically, we pretrain the action-free video prediction model offline with disentanglement regularization to extract semantic knowledge from distracting videos. The disentanglement capability of the pretrained model is then transferred to the world model through latent distillation. For finetuning in the online environment, we exploit the knowledge from the pretrained model and introduce a disentanglement constraint to the world model. During the adaptation phase, the incorporation of actions and rewards from online environment interactions enriches the diversity of the data, which in turn strengthens the disentangled representation learning.

    "abstract": "We introduce StreamDiffusion, a real-time diffusion pipeline designed for streaming image generation. Existing diffusion models are adept at creating images from text or image prompts, yet they often fall short in real-time interaction. This limitation becomes particularly evident in scenarios involving continuous input, such as augmented/virtual reality, video game graphics rendering, live video streaming, and broadcasting, where high throughput is imperative. StreamDiffusion tackles this challenge through a novel pipeline-level system design. It employs unique strategies like batching the denoising process (Stream Batch), residual classifier-free guidance (R-CFG), and stochastic similarity filtering (SSF). Additionally, it seamlessly integrates advanced acceleration technologies for maximum efficiency. Specifically, Stream Batch reformulates the denoising process by eliminating the traditional wait-and-execute approach and utilizing a batching denoising approach, facilitating fluid and high-throughput streams. This results in 1.5x higher throughput compared to the conventional sequential denoising approach. R-CFG significantly addresses inefficiencies caused by repetitive computations during denoising. It optimizes the process to require minimal or no additional computations, leading to speed improvements of up to 2.05x compared to previous classifier-free methods. Besides, our stochastic similarity filtering dramatically lowers GPU activation frequency by halting computations for static image flows, achieving a remarkable reduction in computational consumption--2.39 times on an RTX 3060 GPU and 1.99 times on an RTX 4090 GPU, respectively. The synergy of our proposed strategies with established acceleration technologies enables image generation to reach speeds of up to 91.07 fps on a single RTX 4090 GPU, outperforming the throughput of AutoPipeline, developed by Diffusers, by more than 59.56x",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "With its extensive applications, Foreground Conditioned Out-painting (FCO) has attracted considerable attention in the research field. Through the utilization of text-driven FCO, users are enabled to generate diverse backgrounds for a given foreground by adjusting the text prompt, which considerably enhances the efficiency in fields like e-commerce. Since the foreground is fixed in FCO, a key concern is whether the generated background can match the foreground well to achieve a coherent composition. However, most existing methods are lacking in this regard. Artifacts and incorrect interactions are common defects in synthesized images. This issue is linked to the influence of the initial noise in the sampling process. As the initial noise is sampled independently, it's highly likely that the implied image composition will conflict with the given foreground. In this paper, a novel Initialization Policy Model (IPM) is proposed to address this problem. Its function is to replace the early denoising steps and directly predict the intermediate state that is conducive to the reasonable image composition. Since the IPM is designed to take only the foreground image and the text prompt as inputs, it isolates the impact of the initial noise. The subsequently proposed training paradigm that combines inversion-derived label supervision and diffusion reward supervision further ensures the efficient training of the IPM. The evaluation is conducted using the task-specific OpenImage-FCO dataset developed by us. The results verify that the introduction of the IPM can significantly improve the composition of the synthesized images and achieve advanced performance in the FCO task",

To preserve image details while reducing computational complexity, we propose a text-guided token pruning method with Dynamic Image Pyramid (DIP) integration.

Additionally, existing benchmarks for evaluating LVLMs' perception ability on large RSI suffer from limited question diversity and constrained image sizes. We construct a new benchmark named LRS-VQA, which contains 7,333 QA pairs across 8 categories, with image length up to 27,328 pixels.

We identify this phenomenon as 'anomaly leakage' (AL): the decoder optimized by reconstruction loss tends to directly copy the encoded input, regardless of whether the input is a normal or abnormal feature. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework that explicitly decouples encoded features into normal and abnormal components through a special invertible mapping in a prior latent space. Next, we remove abnormal components and leverage normal remainders for feature reconstruction. Compared to previous methods, the invertible structure can eliminate anomalous information point-to-point without damaging the information of neighboring patches, improving reconstruction. In this process, effective synthetic abnormal features are essential for training the decoupling process. Therefore, we propose applying adversarial training to find suitable perturbations to simulate feature-level anomalies.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We present a novel large-scale dataset for defect detection in a logistics setting. Recent work on industrial anomaly detection has primarily focused on manufacturing scenarios with highly controlled poses and a limited number of object categories. Existing benchmarks like MVTec-AD (Bergmann et al., 2021) and VisA (Zou et al., 2022) have reached saturation, with state-of-the-art methods achieving up to 99.9% AUROC scores. In contrast to manufacturing, anomaly detection in retail logistics faces new challenges, particularly in the diversity and variability of object pose and appearance. Leading anomaly detection methods fall short when applied to this new setting. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new benchmark that overcomes the current limitations of existing datasets. With over 230,000 images (and more than 29,000 defective instances), it is 40 times larger than MVTec and contains more than 48,000 distinct objects. To validate the difficulty of the problem, we conduct an extensive evaluation of multiple state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods, demonstrating that they do not surpass 56.96% AUROC on our dataset. Further qualitative analysis confirms that existing methods struggle to leverage normal samples under heavy pose and appearance variation. With our large-scale dataset, we set a new benchmark and encourage future research towards solving this challenging problem in retail logistics anomaly detection.

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in novel view synthesis (NVS). However, 3DGS tends to overfit when trained with sparse views, limiting its generalization to novel viewpoints. In this paper, we address this overfitting issue by introducing Self-Ensembling Gaussian Splatting (SE-GS). We achieve self-ensembling by incorporating an uncertainty-aware perturbation strategy during training. A \\Delta-model and a \\Sigma-model are jointly trained on the available images. The \\Delta-model is dynamically perturbed based on rendering uncertainty across training steps, generating diverse perturbed models with negligible computational overhead. Discrepancies between the \\Sigma-model and these perturbed models are minimized throughout training, forming a robust ensemble of 3DGS models. This ensemble, represented by the \\Sigma-model, is then used to generate novel-view images during inference. Experimental results on the LLFF, Mip-NeRF360, DTU, and MVImgNet datasets demonstrate that our approach enhances NVS quality under few-shot training conditions, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

Our tokenizer brings several advantages: 1) it leverages that natural images are more compressible at high frequencies, 2) it can take and reconstruct images of different resolutions without retraining, 3) it improves the conditioning for next-token prediction -- instead of conditioning on a partial line-by-line reconstruction of the image, it takes a coarse reconstruction of the full image, 4) it enables partial decoding where the first few generated tokens can reconstruct a coarse version of the image, 5) it enables autoregressive models to be used for image upsampling.

We further extend to support autoregressive generation for unlimited-length interactive videos.More importantly, GameFactory tackles the critical challenge of scene-generalizable action control, which most existing methods fail to address. To enable the creation of entirely new and diverse games beyond fixed styles and scenes, we leverage the open-domain generative priors from pre-trained video diffusion models. To bridge the domain gap between open-domain priors and small-scale game datasets, we propose a multi-phase training strategy with a domain adapter that decouples game style learning from action control. This decoupling ensures that action control learning is no longer bound to specific game styles, thereby achieving scene-generalizable action control.

However, it remains challenging to efficiently aggregate 3D occupancy over time across multiple input frames due to the high processing cost and the uncertainty and dynamics of voxels. To address this issue, we propose ST-Occ, a scene-level occupancy representation learning framework that effectively learns the spatiotemporal feature with temporal consistency. ST-Occ consists of two core designs: a spatiotemporal memory that captures comprehensive historical information and stores it efficiently through a scene-level representation, and a memory attention that conditions the current occupancy representation on the spatiotemporal memory with a model of uncertainty and dynamic awareness. Our method significantly enhances the spatiotemporal representation learned for 3D occupancy prediction tasks by exploiting the temporal dependency between multi-frame inputs.

The problem of 3D CAD reverse engineering consists of reconstructing the sketch and CAD operation sequences from 3D representations such as point clouds.

In particular, we represent CAD sketch-extrude sequences as Python code. The proposed CAD-Recode translates a point cloud into Python code that, when executed, reconstructs the CAD model. Taking advantage of the exposure of pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to Python code, we leverage a relatively small LLM as a decoder for CAD-Recode and combine it with a lightweight point cloud projector. CAD-Recode is trained on a procedurally generated dataset of one million CAD sequences.

    "abstract": "Bridging the gap between ego-centric and exo-centric views has been a long-standing question in computer vision. In this paper, we focus on the emerging Ego-Exo object correspondence task, which aims to understand object relations across ego-exo perspectives through segmentation. While numerous segmentation models have been proposed, most operate on a single image (view), making them impractical for cross-view scenarios. PSALM, a recently proposed segmentation method, stands out as a notable exception with its demonstrated zero-shot ability on this task. However, due to the drastic viewpoint change between ego and exo, PSALM fails to accurately locate and segment objects, especially in complex backgrounds or when object appearances change significantly. To address these issues, we propose ObjectRelator, a novel approach featuring two key modules: Multimodal Condition Fusion (MCFuse) and SSL-based Cross-View Object Alignment (XObjAlign). MCFuse introduces language as an additional cue, integrating both visual masks and textual descriptions to improve object localization and prevent incorrect associations. XObjAlign enforces cross-view consistency through self-supervised alignment, enhancing robustness to object appearance variations. Extensive experiments demonstrate ObjectRelator's effectiveness on the large-scale Ego-Exo4D benchmark and HANDAL-X (an adapted dataset for cross-view segmentation) with state-of-the-art performance.

    "abstract": "3D style transfer refers to the artistic stylization of 3D assets based on reference style images. Recently, 3DGS-based stylization methods have drawn considerable attention, primarily due to their markedly enhanced training and rendering speeds. However, a vital challenge for 3D style transfer is to strike a balance between the content and the patterns and colors of the style. Although the existing methods strive to achieve relatively balanced outcomes, the fixed-output paradigm struggles to adapt to the diverse content-style balance requirements from different users. In this work, we introduce a creative intensity-tunable 3D style transfer paradigm, dubbed Tune-Your-Style, which allows users to flexibly adjust the style intensity injected into the scene to match their desired content-style balance, thus enhancing the customizability of 3D style transfer. To achieve this goal, we first introduce Gaussian neurons to explicitly model the style intensity and parameterize a learnable style tuner to achieve intensity-tunable style injection. To facilitate the learning of tunable stylization, we further propose the tunable stylization guidance, which obtains multi-view consistent stylized views from diffusion models through cross-view style alignment, and then employs a two-stage optimization strategy to provide stable and efficient guidance by modulating the balance between full-style guidance from the stylized views and zero-style guidance from the initial rendering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only delivers visually appealing results, but also exhibits flexible customizability for 3D style transfer.

This emerging field plays a vital role in the governance of generative image, serving the primary objective: Recognize the ID information of stylized faces to detect potential infringements of portrait rights. Despite its importance, progress in stylized face recognition has been hindered by the lack of large-scale, stylistically diverse datasets. To address this gap, we introduce the Stylized-Face dataset, which is the first dataset specifically designed for stylized face recognition. Stylized-Face dataset includes 4.6 million images across 62k IDs, specifically curated to enhance model performance in stylized face recognition tasks. To ensure data quality (i.e., ID preservation) at this massive scale, we implement a semi-automated pipeline for large-scale data cleaning. Based on the Stylized-Face dataset, we establish three benchmarks to evaluate the robustness and generalization of recognition models across various scenarios, including within-distribution performance, cross-prompt generalization, and cross-method generalization, which target key challenges in stylized face recognition. Experimental results demonstrate that models trained on Stylized-Face achieve remarkable improvements in both stylized face recognition performance (a 15.9% improvement in TAR at FAR=1e-4) and generalization (a 13.3% improvement in TAR at FAR=1e-3 in cross-method generalization)",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Egocentric 3D human pose estimation has been actively studied using cameras installed in front of a head-mounted device (HMD). While frontal placement is the optimal and the only option for some tasks, such as hand tracking, it remains unclear if the same holds for full-body tracking due to self-occlusion and limited field-of-view coverage. Notably, even the state-of-the-art methods often fail to estimate accurate 3D poses in many scenarios, such as when HMD users tilt their heads upward---a common motion in human activities. A key limitation of existing HMD designs is their neglect of the back of the body, despite its potential to provide crucial 3D reconstruction cues. Hence, this paper investigates the usefulness of rear cameras for full-body tracking. We also show that simply adding rear views to the frontal inputs is not optimal for existing methods due to their dependence on individual 2D joint detectors without effective multi-view integration. To address this issue, we propose a new transformer-based method that refines 2D joint heatmap estimation with multi-view information and heatmap uncertainty, thereby improving 3D pose tracking. Also, we introduce two new large-scale datasets, Ego4View-Syn and Ego4View-RW, for a rear-view evaluation. Our experiments show that the new camera configurations with back views provide superior support for 3D pose tracking compared to only frontal placements.

    "abstract": "Current video training methods rely on fixed spatiotemporal sampling grids to extract a predetermined number of tokens, limiting adaptability to diverse computational budgets and resulting in suboptimal accuracy-computation trade-offs. This rigidity constrains high-performance models trained in resource-rich environments from being efficiently deployed on resource-constrained devices. We hence introduce a novel paradigm for lossless adaptation across scenarios, enabling models to maintain optimal performance under high-resource conditions while seamlessly transferring to low-resource environments. Central to this is Token Optimization (TO), an adaptive inference framework that dynamically samples and selects input token set to optimize input information under varied computational constraints. To support this, we propose Flux, an augmentation tool that enables flexible sampling grids and token selection. It integrates seamlessly into popular video training frameworks, significantly enhancing model robustness and adaptability with negligible additional cost. Applied to large-scale video pretraining, our method produces FluxViT, which achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks under standard costs. Remarkably, with only 1/4 of the tokens, FluxViT matches prior state-of-the-art models under TO across tasks, achieving nearly 90% computational savings.

    "title": "HUST: High-Fidelity Unbiased Skin Tone Estimation via Texture Quantization",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recent 3D facial reconstruction methods have made significant progress in shape estimation, but high-fidelity unbiased facial albedo estimation remains challenging. Existing methods rely on expensive light-stage captured data, and while they have made progress in either high-fidelity reconstruction or unbiased skin tone estimation, no work has yet achieved optimal results in both aspects simultaneously. In this paper, we present a novel high-fidelity unbiased facial diffuse albedo reconstruction method, HUST, which recovers the diffuse albedo map directly from a single image without the need for captured data. Our key insight is that the albedo map is the illumination-invariant texture map, which enables us to use inexpensive texture data for diffuse albedo estimation by eliminating illumination. To achieve this, we collect large-scale high-resolution facial images and train a VQGAN model in the image space. To adapt the pre-trained VQGAN model for UV texture generation, we fine-tune the encoder by using limited UV textures and our high-resolution faces under adversarial supervision in both image and latent space. Finally, we train a cross-attention module and utilize group identity loss for the domain adaptation from texture to albedo. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HUST can predict high-fidelity facial albedos for in-the-wild images. On the FAIR benchmark, HUST achieves the lowest average ITA error (11.20) and bias score (1.58), demonstrating superior accuracy and robust fairness across the entire spectrum of human skin tones. Our code, models, and training data will be made publicly available to facilitate future research",

    "abstract": "Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based generation models have achieved remarkable success in video generation. However, their inherent computational demands pose significant efficiency challenges. In this paper, we exploit the inherent temporal non-uniformity of real-world videos, and observe that videos exhibit dynamic information density, with high-motion segments demanding greater detail preservation than static scenes. Inspired by this temporal non-uniformity, we propose DLFR-Gen, a training-free approach for Diffusion-based Video Generation with Dynamic Latent Frame Rate. DLFR-Gen adaptively adjusts the number of elements in latent space based on the motion frequency of the latent space content, using fewer tokens for low-frequency segments while preserving detail in high-frequency segments. Specifically, our key contributions are: (1) A dynamic frame rate scheduler for DiT video generation that adaptively assigns frame rates for video segments. (2) A novel latent-space frame merging method to align latent representations with their denoised counterparts before merging those redundant in low-resolution space. (3) A preference analysis of Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) across DiT layers, informing a tailored RoPE strategy optimized for semantic and local information capture. Experiments show that DLFR-Gen can achieve a speedup up to 3x for video generation with minimal quality degradation",

    "abstract": "Domain Generalization aims to develop models that can generalize to novel and unseen data distributions. In this work, we study how model architectures and pre-training objectives impact feature richness and propose a method to effectively leverage them for domain generalization. Specifically, given a pre-trained feature space, we first discover latent domain structures, referred to as pseudo-domains, that capture domain-specific variations in an unsupervised manner. Next, we augment existing classifiers with these complementary pseudo-domain representations making them more amenable to diverse unseen test domains. We analyze how different pre-training feature spaces differ in the domain-specific variances they capture. Our empirical studies reveal that features from diffusion models excel at separating domains in the absence of explicit domain labels and capture nuanced domain-specific information. On 5 datasets, we show that our very simple framework improves generalization to unseen domains by a maximum test accuracy improvement of over 4% compared to the standard baseline Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM). Crucially, our method outperforms most algorithms that access domain labels during training. Code is available at: https://xthomasbu.github.io/GUIDE/",

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have fundamentally transformed the field of generative models, making the assessment of similarity between customized model outputs and reference inputs critically important. However, traditional perceptual similarity metrics operate primarily at the pixel and patch levels, comparing low-level colors and textures but failing to capture mid-level similarities and differences in image layout, object pose, and semantic content. Contrastive learning-based CLIP and self-supervised learning-based DINO are often used to measure semantic similarity, but they highly compress image features, inadequately assessing appearance details. This paper is the first to discover that pretrained diffusion models can be utilized for measuring visual similarity and introduces the DiffSim method, addressing the limitations of traditional metrics in capturing perceptual consistency in custom generation tasks. By aligning features in the attention layers of the denoising U-Net, DiffSim evaluates both appearance and style similarity, showing superior alignment with human visual preferences. Additionally, we introduce the Sref and IP benchmarks to evaluate visual similarity at the level of style and instance, respectively. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DiffSim achieves state-of-the-art performance, providing a robust tool for measuring visual coherence in generative models",

However, recent studies have shown that deep neural networks are susceptible to learn spurious correlations present in datasets. To improve the reliability, we propose a simple yet effective framework called controllable feature whitening. We quantify the linear correlation between the target and bias features by the covariance matrix, and eliminate it through the whitening module. Our results systemically demonstrate that removing the linear correlations between features fed into the last linear classifier significantly mitigates the bias, while avoiding the need to model intractable higher-order dependencies. A particular advantage of the proposed method is that it does not require regularization terms or adversarial learning, which often leads to unstable optimization in practice. Furthermore, we show that two fairness criteria, demographic parity and equalized odds, can be effectively handled by whitening with the re-weighted covariance matrix. Consequently, our method controls the trade-off between the utility and fairness of algorithms by adjusting the weighting coefficient.

    "abstract": "High-fidelity 3D scene reconstruction plays a crucial role in autonomous driving by enabling novel data generation from existing datasets. This allows simulating safety-critical scenarios and augmenting training datasets without incurring further data collection costs. While recent advances in radiance fields have demonstrated promising results in 3D reconstruction and sensor data synthesis using cameras and LiDAR, their potential for radar remains largely unexplored. Radar is crucial for autonomous driving due to its robustness in adverse weather conditions like rain, fog, and snow, where optical sensors often struggle. Although the state-of-the-art radar-based neural representation shows promise for 3D driving scene reconstruction, it performs poorly in scenarios with significant radar noise, including receiver saturation and multipath reflection. Moreover, it is limited to synthesizing preprocessed, noise-excluded radar images, failing to address realistic radar data synthesis. To address these limitations, this paper proposes RadarSplat, which integrates Gaussian Splatting with novel radar noise modeling to enable realistic radar data synthesis and enhanced 3D reconstruction. Compared to the state-of-the-art, RadarSplat achieves superior radar image synthesis (+3.4 PSNR / 2.6x SSIM) and improved geometric reconstruction (-40% RMSE / 1.5x Accuracy), demonstrating its effectiveness in generating high-fidelity radar data and scene reconstruction",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Modern retrieval systems often struggle with upgrading to new and more powerful models due to the incompatibility of embeddings between the old and new models. This necessitates a costly process known as backfilling, which involves re-computing the embeddings for a large number of data samples. In vision, Backward-compatible Training (BT) has been proposed to ensure that the new model aligns with the old model's embeddings. This paper extends the concept of vision-only BT to the field of cross-modal retrieval, marking the first attempt to address Cross-modal BT (XBT). Our goal is to achieve backward-compatibility between Vision-Language Pretraining (VLP) models, such as CLIP, for the cross-modal retrieval task. To address XBT challenges, we propose an efficient solution: a projection module that maps the new model's embeddings to those of the old model. This module, pretrained solely with text data, significantly reduces the number of image-text pairs required for XBT learning, and, once it is pretrained, it avoids using the old model during training. Furthermore, we utilize parameter-efficient training strategies that improve efficiency and preserve the off-the-shelf new model's knowledge by avoiding any modifications. Experimental results on cross-modal retrieval datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of XBT and its potential to enable backfill-free upgrades when a new VLP model emerges",

    "abstract": "Most knowledge distillation (KD) methods focus on teacher-student pairs with similar architectures, such as both being CNN models. The potential and flexibility of KD can be greatly improved by expanding it to Cross-Architecture KD (CAKD), where the knowledge of homogeneous and heterogeneous teachers can be distilled selectively. However, substantial feature gaps between heterogeneous models (e.g., ViT teacher v.s. CNN student) make CAKD extremely challenging, caused by the distinction of inherent inductive biases and module functions. To this end, we fuse heterogeneous knowledge before transferring it from teacher to student. This fusion combines the advantages of both cross-architecture inductive biases and module functions by merging different combinations of convolution, attention, and MLP modules derived directly from student and teacher module functions. Furthermore, heterogeneous features exhibit diverse spatial distributions, hindering the effectiveness of conventional pixel-wise MSE loss. Therefore, we replace it with a spatial-agnostic InfoNCE loss. Our method is evaluated across various homogeneous models and arbitrary heterogeneous combinations of CNNs, ViTs, and MLPs, yielding promising performance for distilled models with a maximum gain of 11.47% on CIFAR-100 and 3.67% on ImageNet-1K.

To address these limitations, we propose CoLMDriver, the first full-pipeline LLM-based cooperative driving system, enabling effective language-based negotiation and real-time driving control. CoLMDriver features a parallel driving pipeline with two key components: (i) an LLM-based negotiation module under an critic-feedback paradigm, which continuously refines cooperation policies through feedback from previous decisions of all vehicles; and (ii) an intention-guided waypoint generator, which translates negotiation outcomes into executable waypoints. Additionally, we introduce InterDrive, a CARLA-based simulation benchmark comprising 10 challenging interactive driving scenarios for evaluating V2V cooperation.

To address these challenges, we propose the Dual Domain Control via Active Learning (Active-DDC) method, which integrates active learning strategies to handle data distribution and model feature shifts.

One promising paradigm is to design transparent structures, e.g., geometric invariance, for fundamental representations. However, such invariants exhibit limited discriminability, limiting their applications in larger-scale tasks. For this open problem, we conduct a systematic investigation of hierarchical invariance, exploring this topic from theoretical, practical, and application perspectives. At the theoretical level, we show how to construct discriminative invariants with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-like hierarchical architecture, yet in a fully transparent manner. The general blueprint, specific definitions, invariant properties, and numerical implementations are provided. At the practical level, we discuss how to customize this transparent framework into a given task. With the over-completeness, discriminative features w.r.t. the task can be adaptively formed in a Neural Architecture Search (NAS)-like manner. We demonstrate the above arguments with accuracy, invariance, and efficiency results on laboratory-style classification experiments. Furthermore, at the application level, our representations are explored in real-world forensic tasks on adversarial perturbations and generated content. Such applications reveal that our invariants exhibit competitive discriminability even in the era of deep learning. For robust and interpretable vision tasks at larger scales, hierarchical invariant representations can be considered as an effective alternative to traditional CNNs and invariants",

    "abstract": "We introduce the first data-driven multi-view 3D point tracker, designed to track arbitrary points in dynamic scenes using multiple camera views. Unlike existing monocular trackers, which struggle with depth ambiguities and occlusion, or prior multi-camera methods that require over 20 cameras and tedious per-sequence optimization, our feed-forward model directly predicts 3D correspondences using a practical number of cameras (e.g., four), enabling robust and accurate online tracking. Given known camera poses and either sensor-based or estimated multi-view depth, our tracker fuses multi-view features into a unified point cloud and applies k-nearest-neighbors correlation alongside a transformer-based update to reliably estimate long-range 3D correspondences, even under occlusion. We train on 5K synthetic multi-view Kubric sequences and evaluate on two real-world benchmarks--Panoptic Studio and DexYCB--achieving median trajectory errors of 3.1 cm and 2.0cm, respectively. Our method generalizes well to diverse camera setups of 1-8 views with varying vantage points and video lengths of 24-150 frames. By releasing our tracker alongside training and evaluation datasets, we aim to set a new standard for multi-view 3D tracking research and provide a practical tool for real-world applications.

Our investigation of these failures reveals significant variations in gradient magnitude and spatial distribution, making hyperparameter tuning highly input-specific or unsuccessful.

Therefore, we introduce ChartCap, a large-scale dataset of 565K real-world chart images paired with type-specific, dense captions that exclude extraneous information and highlight both structural elements and key insights in detail. To build ChartCap, we design a four-stage pipeline that generates captions using only the discernible data from the chart and employ a cycle consistency-based human verification, which accelerates quality control without sacrificing accuracy. Additionally, we propose a novel metric, the Visual Consistency Score, which evaluates caption quality by measuring the similarity between the chart regenerated from a caption and the original chart, independent of reference captions. Extensive experiments confirms that models fine-tuned on ChartCap consistently generate more accurate and informative captions with reduced hallucinations, surpassing both open-source and proprietary models and even human-annotated captions",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Deep learning algorithms for object classification and 3D object pose estimation lack robustness to out-of-distribution factors such as synthetic stimuli, changes in weather conditions, and partial occlusion. Recently, a class of Neural Mesh Models have been developed where objects are represented in terms of 3D meshes with learned features at the vertices. These models have shown robustness in small-scale settings, involving 10 objects, but it is unclear that they can be scaled up to 100s of object classes. The main problem is that their training involves contrastive learning among the vertices of all object classes, which scales quadratically with the number of classes. We present a strategy which exploits the compositionality of the objects, i.e. the independence of the feature vectors of the vertices, which greatly reduces the training time while also improving the performance of the algorithms. We first restructure the per-vertex contrastive learning into contrasting within class and between classes. Then we propose a process that dynamically decouples the contrast between classes which are rarely confused, and enhances the contrast between the vertices of classes that are most confused. Our large-scale 3D compositional model not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on the task of predicting classification and pose estimation simultaneously, surpassing the Neural Mesh Models and standard DNNs, but is also more robust to out-of-distribution testing including occlusion, weather conditions, synthetic data, and generalization to unknown classes",

In this work, we introduce MultiVerse, a novel multi-turn conversation benchmark featuring 647 dialogues--each averaging four turns--derived from a diverse set of 12 popular VLM evaluation benchmarks. With 484 tasks and 484 interaction goals, MultiVerse covers a wide range of topics, from factual knowledge and perception to advanced reasoning tasks such as mathematics and coding. To facilitate robust assessment, we propose a checklist-based evaluation method that leverages GPT-4o as the automated evaluator, measuring performance across 37 key aspects, including perceptual accuracy, linguistic clarity, and factual correctness. We evaluate 18 VLMs on MultiVerse, revealing that even the strongest models (e.g., GPT-4o) achieve only a 50% success rate in complex multi-turn conversations, highlighting the dataset's challenging nature. Notably, we find that providing full dialogue context significantly enhances performance for smaller or weaker models, emphasizing the importance of in-context learning.

While video-based estimation approaches have become increasingly accurate, they often fail in common scenarios involving self-contact, such as a hand touching the face. In contrast, wearable bioimpedance sensing can cheaply and unobtrusively measure ground-truth skin-to-skin contact. Consequently, we propose a novel framework that combines visual pose estimators with bioimpedance sensing to capture the 3D pose of people by taking self-contact into account. Our method, BioTUCH, initializes the pose using an off-the-shelf estimator and introduces contact-aware pose optimization during measured self-contact: reprojection error and deviations from the input estimate are minimized while enforcing vertex proximity constraints. We validate our approach using a new dataset of synchronized RGB video, bioimpedance measurements, and 3D motion capture. Testing with three input pose estimators, we demonstrate an average of 11.7% improvement in reconstruction accuracy. We also present a miniature wearable bioimpedance sensor that enables efficient large-scale collection of contact-aware training data for improving pose estimation and generation using BioTUCH.

Our CuRe benchmark dataset has a novel categorical hierarchy built from the crowdsourced Wikimedia knowledge graph, with 300 cultural artifacts across 32 cultural subcategories grouped into six broad cultural axes (food, art, fashion, architecture, celebrations, and people). Our dataset's categorical hierarchy enables CuRe scorers to evaluate T2I systems by analyzing their response to increasing the informativeness of text conditioning, enabling fine-grained cultural comparisons.

To fill this gap, we present a new task named Online Video Grounding with Hybrid-modal Queries (OVG-HQ), which enables online segment localization using text, images, video segments, and their combinations. This task poses two new challenges: limited context in online settings and modality imbalance during training, where dominant modalities overshadow weaker ones. To address these, we propose OVG-HQ-Unify, a unified framework featuring a Parametric Memory Block (PMB) that uses neural network parameters to dynamically retain past context and a cross-modal distillation strategy that guides the learning of non-dominant modalities. This design enables a single model to effectively handle hybrid-modal queries. Due to the lack of suitable datasets, we construct QVHighlights-Unify, an expanded dataset with multi-modal queries. Besides, since offline metrics overlook prediction timeliness, we adapt them to the online setting, introducing oR@n, IoU=m, and online mean Average Precision (omAP) to evaluate both accuracy and efficiency. Experiments show that our OVG-HQ-Unify outperforms existing models, offering a robust solution for online, hybrid-modal video grounding. We will release our source code and dataset",

    "abstract": "Pixel-level vision tasks, such as semantic segmentation, require extensive and high-quality annotated data, which is costly to obtain. Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS) has emerged as a solution to alleviate the labeling burden by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data through self-training techniques. Meanwhile, the advent of foundational segmentation models pre-trained on massive data, has shown the potential to generalize across domains effectively. This work explores whether a foundational segmentation model can address label scarcity in the pixel-level vision task as an annotator for unlabeled images. Specifically, we investigate the efficacy of using SEEM, a Segment Anything Model (SAM) variant fine-tuned for textual input, to generate predictive masks for unlabeled data. To address the shortcomings of using SEEM-generated masks as supervision, we propose ConformalSAM, a novel SSSS framework which first calibrates the foundation model using the target domain's labeled data and then filters out unreliable pixel labels of unlabeled data so that only high-confidence labels are used as supervision. By leveraging conformal prediction (CP) to adapt foundation models to target data through uncertainty calibration, ConformalSAM exploits the strong capability of the foundational segmentation model reliably which benefits the early-stage learning, while a subsequent self-reliance training strategy mitigates overfitting to SEEM-generated masks in the later training stage. Our experiment demonstrates that, on three standard benchmarks of SSSS, ConformalSAM achieves superior performance compared to recent SSSS methods and helps boost the performance of those methods as a plug-in",

In our work, we first conduct an empirical analysis of VLMs' long-context capabilities using our augmented long-context multimodal datasets. Our findings reveal that directly applying the positional encoding mechanism used for textual tokens to visual tokens is suboptimal, and VLM performance degrades sharply when the position encoding exceeds the model's context window. To address this, we propose Variable Visual Position Encoding (V2PE), a novel positional encoding approach that employs variable and smaller increments for visual tokens, enabling more efficient management of long multimodal sequences. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of V2PE in enhancing VLMs' ability to effectively understand and reason over long multimodal contexts. We further integrate V2PE with our augmented long-context multimodal datasets to fine-tune the open-source VLMs. The fine-tuned model achieves strong performance on both standard and long-context multimodal tasks. Notably, when the sequence length of the training dataset is increased to 256K tokens, the model is capable of processing multimodal sequences up to 1M tokens, highlighting its potential for real-world long-context applications.

    "title": "PRO-VPT: Distribution-Adaptive Visual Prompt Tuning via Prompt Relocation",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Visual prompt tuning (VPT), i.e., fine-tuning some lightweight prompt tokens, provides an efficient and effective approach for adapting pre-trained models to various downstream tasks. However, most prior art indiscriminately uses a fixed prompt distribution across different tasks, neglecting the importance of each block varying depending on the task. In this paper, we introduce adaptive distribution optimization (ADO) by tackling two key questions: (1) How to appropriately and formally define ADO, and (2) How to design an adaptive distribution strategy guided by this definition? Through empirical analysis, we first confirm that properly adjusting the distribution significantly improves VPT performance, and further uncover a key insight that a nested relationship exists between ADO and VPT. Based on these findings, we propose a new VPT framework, termed PRO-VPT (iterative Prompt RelOcation-based VPT), which adaptively adjusts the distribution built upon a nested optimization formulation. Specifically, we develop a prompt relocation strategy derived from this formulation, comprising two steps: pruning idle prompts from prompt-saturated blocks, followed by allocating these prompts to the most prompt-needed blocks. By iteratively performing prompt relocation and VPT, our proposal can adaptively learn the optimal prompt distribution in a nested optimization-based manner, thereby unlocking the full potential of VPT. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposal significantly outperforms advanced VPT methods, e.g., PRO-VPT surpasses VPT by 1.6 pp and 2.0 pp average accuracy, leading prompt-based methods to state-of-the-art performance on VTAB-1k and FGVC benchmarks.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models excel at generating photorealistic images, but commonly struggle to render accurate spatial relationships described in text prompts. We identify two core issues underlying this common failure: 1) the ambiguous nature of spatial-related data in existing datasets, and 2) the inability of current text encoders to accurately interpret the spatial semantics of input descriptions. We address these issues with CoMPaSS, a versatile training framework that enhances spatial understanding of any T2I diffusion model. CoMPaSS solves the ambiguity of spatial-related data with the Spatial Constraints-Oriented Pairing (SCOP) data engine, which curates spatially accurate training data through a set of principled spatial constraints. To better exploit the curated high-quality spatial priors, CoMPaSS further introduces a Token ENcoding ORdering (TENOR) module to allow better exploitation of high-quality spatial priors, effectively compensating for the shortcoming of text encoders. Extensive experiments on four popular open-weight T2I diffusion models covering both UNet- and MMDiT-based architectures demonstrate the effectiveness of CoMPaSS by setting new state-of-the-arts with substantial relative gains across well-known benchmarks on spatial relationships generation, including VISOR (+98%), T2I-CompBench Spatial (+67%), and GenEval Position (+131%)",

Existing approaches either activate LLMs too frequently, causing excessive computational overhead, or use fixed schedules, failing to adapt to dynamic driving conditions. To address these challenges, we propose AdaDrive, an adaptively collaborative slow-fast framework that optimally determines when and how LLMs contribute to decision-making. (1) When to activate the LLM: AdaDrive employs a novel adaptive activation loss that dynamically determines LLM invocation based on a comparative learning mechanism, ensuring activation only in complex or critical scenarios. (2) How to integrate LLM assistance: Instead of rigid binary activation, AdaDrive introduces an adaptive fusion strategy that modulates a continuous, scaled LLM influence based on scene complexity and prediction confidence, ensuring seamless collaboration with conventional planners. Through these strategies, AdaDrive provides a flexible, context-aware framework that maximizes decision accuracy without compromising real-time performance. Extensive experiments on language-grounded autonomous driving benchmarks demonstrate that AdaDrive state-of-the-art performance in terms of both driving accuracy and computational efficiency.

    "abstract": "Camouflaged scenes, where objects blend seamlessly into their environments, pose significant challenges to both human observers and computer vision systems. These objects match the background in color, texture, and shape, making them difficult to detect. To this end, we propose leveraging the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to tackle this challenging task effectively. Specifically, we propose how to exploit SAM without requiring any manual prompts by proposing several ideas. At the core of our method lies the rich information extracted through multi-modal prompts. At first, we generate an image caption using the BLIP model and obtain its text embedding through the use of a text encoder. We then generate a visual embedding through the vision encoder of the BLIP model and use both as inputs to SAM to provide additional semantic information about the image. Finally, we propose a couple of architectural novelties, a) we effectively integrate the multi-modal information in SAM through a multi-level adapter and b) we replace the dense embedding of SAM with the image embedding of its image encoder. Our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance in 11 out of 12 metrics in three benchmark datasets for camouflaged detection. Additionally, our method can be successfully adapted to other tasks such as medical image segmentation performing on par or even outperforming the state-of-the-art methods.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown significant visual reasoning capabilities by connecting a visual encoder and a large language model. LMMs typically take in a fixed and large amount of visual tokens, such as the penultimate layer features in the CLIP visual encoder, as the prefix content. Recent LMMs incorporate more complex visual inputs, such as high-resolution images and videos, which further increases the number of visual tokens significantly. However, due to the inherent design of the Transformer architecture, the computational costs of these models tend to increase quadratically with the number of input tokens. To tackle this problem, we explore a token reduction mechanism that identifies significant spatial redundancy among visual tokens. In response, we propose PruMerge, a novel adaptive visual token reduction strategy that significantly reduces the number of visual tokens without compromising the performance of LMMs. Specifically, to metric the importance of each token, we exploit the sparsity observed in the visual encoder, characterized by the sparse distribution of attention scores between the class token and visual tokens. This sparsity enables us to dynamically select the most crucial visual tokens to retain. Subsequently, we cluster the selected (unpruned) tokens based on their key similarity and merge them with the unpruned tokens, effectively supplementing and enhancing their informational content. Empirically, when applied to LLaVA-1.5 and Video-LLaVA, our approach can reduce the number of visual tokens by 4 times, and achieve comparable or better performance across diverse visual question-answering and reasoning tasks",

We observe that threshold modeling for events plays a crucial role in achieving high-quality reconstruction. Therefore, we propose a GS-Threshold Joint Modeling strategy, creating a mutually reinforcing process that greatly improves both 3D reconstruction and threshold modeling. Moreover, we introduce a Dynamic-Static Decomposition strategy that first identifies dynamic areas by exploiting the inability of static Gaussians to represent motions, then applies a buffer-based soft decomposition to separate dynamic and static areas. This strategy accelerates rendering by avoiding unnecessary deformation in static areas, and focuses on dynamic areas to enhance fidelity.

Yet, in the case of rolling shutter cameras, or more recently, event cameras, this synchronization breaks down. In this work, we present a unified approach for structure and linear motion estimation from 2D point correspondences with arbitrary timestamps, from an arbitrary set of views. By formulating the problem in terms of first-order dynamics and leveraging a constant velocity motion model, we derive a novel, linear point incidence relation allowing for the efficient recovery of both linear velocity and 3D points with predictable degeneracies and solution multiplicities. Owing to its general formulation, it can handle correspondences from a wide range of sensing modalities such as global shutter, rolling shutter, and event cameras, and can even combine correspondences from different collocated sensors.

Stage 1 extracts constraint representation from BRep data or point cloud based on local features. It enables better generalization ability to unseen dataset after pre-training. Stage 2 employs attention layers to adaptively adjust the weights of three constraints' components. It facilitates the effective utilization of constraints.

While recent advancements have shown promising results in generating high-resolution 3D shapes, VDM still struggles at high-speed generation. Challenges exist because of not only difficulties in accelerating diffusion sampling but also VAE decoding in VDM -- areas under-explored in previous works. To address these challenges, we present FlashVDM, a systematic framework for accelerating both VAE and DiT in VDM. For DiT, FlashVDM enables flexible diffusion sampling with as few as 5 inference steps, while maintaining comparable quality, which is made possible by stabilizing consistency distillation with our newly introduced Progressive Flow Distillation technique. For VAE, we introduce a lightning vectset decoder equipped with Adaptive KV Selection, Hierarchical Volume Decoding,, and Efficient Network Design. By exploiting the locality of vectset and the sparsity of shape surface in the volume, the proposed decoder drastically lowers FLOPs, minimizing the overall decoding overhead. We apply FlashVDM to the current state-of-the-art open-source shape generation model Hunyuan3D-2, resulting in Hunyuan3D-2 Turbo. Through systematic evaluation for both generation and reconstruction, we demonstrate that our model outperforms existing fast 3D generation methods by a significant margin, achieving comparable performance to the state-of-the-art models while reducing inference time by over 45x for reconstruction and 32x for generation.

This presents acute challenges for the vital task of point cloud completion. Using tools from Algebraic Topology and Persistent Homology (PH), we demonstrate that current benchmark object point clouds lack rich topological features that are integral part of point clouds captured in realistic environments. To facilitate research in this direction, we contribute the first real-world industrial dataset for point cloud completion, RealPC - a diverse, rich and varied set of point clouds. It consists of 40,000 pairs across 21 categories of industrial structures in railway establishments. Benchmark results on several strong baselines reveal that existing methods fail in real-world scenarios. We discover a striking observation - unlike current datasets, RealPC consists of multiple 0- and 1-dimensional PH-based topological features. We prove that integrating these topological priors into existing works helps improve completion. We present how 0-dimensional PH priors extract the global topology of a complete shape in the form of a 3D skeleton and assist a model in generating topologically consistent complete shapes. Since computing Homology is expensive, we present a simple, yet effective Homology Sampler guided network, BOSHNet that bypasses the Homology computation by sampling proxy backbones akin to 0-dim PH. These backbones provide similar benefits of 0-dim PH right from the start of the training, unlike similar methods where accurate backbones are obtained only during later phases of the training",

Concretely, RayZer takes unposed and uncalibrated images as input, recovers camera parameters, reconstructs a scene representation, and synthesizes novel views. During training, RayZer relies solely on its self-predicted camera poses to render target views, eliminating the need for any ground-truth camera annotations and allowing RayZer to be trained with 2D image supervision. The emerging 3D awareness of RayZer is attributed to two key factors. First, we design a self-supervised framework, which achieves 3D-aware auto-encoding of input images by disentangling camera and scene representations. Second, we design a transformer-based model in which the only 3D prior is the ray structure, connecting camera, pixel, and scene simultaneously. RayZer demonstrates comparable or even superior novel view synthesis performance than \"oracle\" methods that rely on pose annotations in both training and testing",

Recent works have made progress in controlling camera or object motion via various motion representations, while they still struggle to support collaborative camera and object motion control with adaptive control granularity. To this end, we introduce 3D-aware motion representation and propose an image animation framework, called Perception-as-Control, to achieve fine-grained collaborative motion control. Specifically, we construct 3D-aware motion representation from a reference image, manipulate it based on interpreted user instructions, and perceive it from different viewpoints. In this way, camera and object motions are transformed into intuitive and consistent visual changes.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "3D medical image self-supervised learning (mSSL) holds great promise for medical analysis. Effectively supporting broader applications requires considering anatomical structure variations in location, scale, and morphology, which are crucial for capturing meaningful distinctions. However, previous mSSL methods partition images with fixed-size patches, often ignoring the structure variations. In this work, we introduce a novel perspective on 3D medical images with the goal of learning structure-aware representations. We assume that patches within the same structure share the same semantics (semantic consistency) while those from different structures exhibit distinct semantics (semantic discrepancy). Based on this assumption, we propose an mSSL framework named S2DC, achieving Structure-aware Semantic Discrepancy and Consistency in two steps. First, S2DC enforces distinct representations for different patches to increase semantic discrepancy by leveraging an optimal transport strategy. Second, S2DC advances semantic consistency at the structural level based on neighborhood similarity distribution. By bridging patch-level and structure-level representations, S2DC achieves structure-aware representations. Thoroughly evaluated across 10 datasets, 4 tasks, and 3 modalities, our proposed method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in mSSL.

To bridge this gap, we propose Spatial Adaptive 4D Look-Up Table (SA-LUT), combining LUT efficiency with neural network adaptability. SA-LUT features: (1) a Style-guided 4D LUT Generator that extracts multi-scale features from the style image to predict a 4D LUT, and (2) a Context Generator using content-style cross-attention to produce a context map. This context map enables spatially-adaptive adjustments, allowing our 4D LUT to apply precise color transformations while preserving structural integrity. To establish a rigorous evaluation framework for photorealistic style transfer, we introduce PST50, the first benchmark specifically designed for PST assessment. Experiments demonstrate that SA-LUT substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 66.7% reduction in LPIPS score compared to 3D LUT approaches, while maintaining real-time performance at 16 FPS for video stylization.

Existing approaches, Class Incremental Object Detection (CIOD) and Domain Incremental Object Detection (DIOD)--only address one aspect of this challenge. CIOD struggles in unseen domains, while DIOD suffers from catastrophic forgetting when learning new classes, limiting their real-world applicability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Dual Incremental Object Detection (DuIOD), a more practical setting that simultaneously handles class and domain shifts in an exemplar-free manner. We propose DuET, a Task Arithmetic-based model merging framework that enables stable incremental learning while mitigating sign conflicts through a novel Directional Consistency Loss. Unlike prior methods, DuET is detector-agnostic, allowing models like YOLO11 and RT-DETR to function as real-time incremental object detectors. To comprehensively evaluate both retention and adaptation, we introduce the Retention-Adaptability Index (RAI), which combines the Average Retention Index (Avg RI) for catastrophic forgetting and the Average Generalization Index for domain adaptability into a common ground. Extensive experiments on the Pascal Series and Diverse Weather Series demonstrate DuET's effectiveness, achieving a +13.12% RAI improvement while preserving 89.3% Avg RI on the Pascal Series (4 tasks), as well as a +11.39% RAI improvement with 88.57% Avg RI on the Diverse Weather Series (3 tasks), outperforming existing methods",

Through extensive experiments, we show that zero-shot CLIP lacks robustness to common image corruptions during test-time, necessitating the adaptation of CLIP to unlabeled corrupted images using test-time adaptation (TTA). However, we found that existing TTA methods have severe limitations in adapting CLIP due to their unimodal nature. To address these limitations, we propose \\texttt BATCLIP , a bimodal online TTA method designed to improve CLIP's robustness to common image corruptions. The key insight of our approach is not only to adapt the visual encoders for improving image features but also to strengthen the alignment between image and text features by promoting a stronger association between the image class prototype, computed using pseudo-labels, and the corresponding text feature. We evaluate our approach on benchmark image corruption datasets and achieve state-of-the-art results in online TTA for CLIP.

Existing class activation map (CAM) generation methods have been able to locate rough objects. However, due to the limited information provided by image level labels, the bias activation problem, including over-activation, becomes another key obstacle in WSSS. To rectify such bias activation, we attempt to mine pixel level class feature distribution information from the entire dataset. Specifically, we propose to use normalizing flow to model the class feature distribution of all pixels across the entire dataset and design a Bias-Resilient WSSS framework based on Normalizing Flow (BRNF). Normalizing flow has the ability to map complex distributions to normal distributions. Building upon it, we designed an additional Gaussian mixture classifier which classifies pixels from the perspective of feature distributions, providing supplementary information to the conventional MLP based classifier. In addition, we use this distribution to sample low bias features as positive anchors for contrastive learning, thereby encouraging feature optimization toward the correct low-bias direction. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance on WSSS benchmarks.

One such constraint is that a 3D object should be self-supporting, i.e., remain balanced under gravity. Previous approaches to generating stable 3D objects relied on differentiable physics simulators to optimize geometry at test time, which is slow, unstable, and prone to local optima. Inspired by the literature on aligning generative models with external feedback, we propose Direct Simulation Optimization (DSO). This framework leverages feedback from a (non-differentiable) simulator to increase the likelihood that the 3D generator directly outputs stable 3D objects. We construct a dataset of 3D objects labeled with stability scores obtained from the physics simulator. This dataset enables fine-tuning of the 3D generator using the stability score as an alignment metric, via direct preference optimization (DPO) or direct reward optimization (DRO)---a novel objective we introduce to align diffusion models without requiring pairwise preferences. Our experiments demonstrate that the fine-tuned feed-forward generator, using either the DPO or DRO objective, is significantly faster and more likely to produce stable objects than test-time optimization. Notably, the DSO framework functions even without any ground-truth 3D objects for training, allowing the 3D generator to self-improve by automatically collecting simulation feedback on its own outputs",

    "abstract": "X-ray imaging, based on penetration, enables detailed visualization of internal structures. Building on this capability, existing implicit 3D reconstruction methods have adapted the NeRF model and its variants for internal CT reconstruction. However, these approaches often neglect the significance of objects' anatomical priors for implicit learning, limiting both reconstruction precision and learning efficiency, particularly in ultra-sparse view scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel 3D CT reconstruction framework that employs a 'target prior' derived from the object's projection data to enhance implicit learning. Our approach integrates positional and structural encoding to facilitate voxel-wise implicit reconstruction, utilizing the target prior to guide voxel sampling and enrich structural encoding. This dual strategy significantly boosts both learning efficiency and reconstruction quality. Additionally, we introduce a CUDA-based algorithm for rapid estimation of high-quality 3D target priors from sparse-view projections. Experiments utilizing projection data from a complex abdominal dataset demonstrate that the proposed model substantially enhances learning efficiency, outperforming the current leading model, NAF, by a factor of ten. In terms of reconstruction quality, it also exceeds the most accurate model, NeRP, achieving PSNR improvements of 3.57 dB, 5.42 dB, and 5.70 dB with 10, 20, and 30 projections, respectively.

(2) Spectral Debiasing is introduced to harmonize the feature space between the source and target domains, as well as balance the feature space of positive and negative samples.

Once trained, the tokenizer can be seamlessly adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks in a zero-shot manner, from short-horizon reactive behaviors to long-horizon planning. A key finding of our work is that the domain gap between synthetic and real action trajectories is marginal, allowing us to effectively utilize a vast amount of synthetic data during training without compromising real-world performance. To validate our approach, we conducted extensive experiments in both simulated environments and on real robotic platforms. The results demonstrate that as the volume of synthetic trajectory data increases, the performance of our tokenizer on downstream tasks improves significantly-most notably, achieving up to a 30% higher success rate on two real-world tasks in long-horizon scenarios.

This innovation ensures that density weights adapt intrinsically to the primitive curvature, preserving consistency during shape changes (e.g., from planar disks to curved paraboloids). By solving geodesic distances in closed form on quadric surfaces, QGS enables surface-aware splatting, where a single primitive can represent complex curvature that previously required dozens of planar surfels, potentially reducing memory usage while maintaining efficient rendering via fast ray-quadric intersection. Experiments on DTU, Tanks and Temples, and MipNeRF360 datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art surface reconstruction, with QGS reducing geometric error (chamfer distance) by 33% over 2DGS and 27% over GOF on the DTU dataset.

Tackling such issues is challenging because of the complex degradation of UDCs, including diverse flare patterns. However, no dataset contains videos of real-world UDC degradation. In this paper, we propose a real-world UDC video dataset called UDC-VIT. Unlike existing datasets, UDC-VIT exclusively includes human motions for facial recognition. We propose a video-capturing system to acquire clean and UDC-degraded videos of the same scene simultaneously. Then, we align a pair of captured videos frame by frame, using discrete Fourier transform (DFT). We compare UDC-VIT with six representative UDC still image datasets and two existing UDC video datasets. Using six deep-learning models, we compare UDC-VIT and an existing synthetic UDC video dataset. The results indicate the ineffectiveness of models trained on earlier synthetic UDC video datasets, as they do not reflect the actual characteristics of UDC-degraded videos. We also demonstrate the importance of effective UDC restoration by evaluating face recognition accuracy concerning PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS scores.

    "abstract": "The task of Human-Object conTact (HOT) detection involves identifying the specific areas of the human body that are touching objects. Nevertheless, current models are restricted to just one type of image, often leading to too much segmentation in areas with little interaction, and struggling to maintain category consistency within specific regions. To tackle this issue, a HOT framework, termed P3HOT, is proposed, which blends Prompt guidance and human Proximal Perception. To begin with, we utilize a semantic-driven prompt mechanism to direct the network's attention towards the relevant regions based on the correlation between image and text. Then a human proximal perception mechanism is employed to dynamically perceive key depth range around the human, using learnable parameters to effectively eliminate regions where interactions are not expected. Calculating depth resolves the uncertainty of the overlap between humans and objects in a 2D perspective, providing a quasi-3D viewpoint. Moreover, a Regional Joint Loss (RJLoss) has been created as a new loss to inhibit abnormal categories in the same area. A new evaluation metric called AD-Acc. is introduced to address the shortcomings of existing methods in addressing negative samples. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in four metrics across two benchmark datasets. Specifically, our model achieves an improvement of 0.7, 2.0, 1.6, and 11.0 in SC-Acc., mIoU, wIoU, and AD-Acc. metrics, respectively, on the HOT-Annotated dataset.

They seek to retain the strengths of silhouette while extracting more semantic or structural information through upstream estimation for better recognition. We agree with this principle but argue that these upstream estimations are usually unstable and the resulted modalities rely on pre-defined design. Moreover, the crucial aspect of modality generalization remains underexplored. To address this, we propose Gait-X to explore how to flexibly and stably develop a gait-specific generalized X modality from a frequency perspective. Specifically, 1) We replace upstream estimation with stable frequency decomposition and conduct a comprehensive analysis of how different frequencies impact modality and within-/cross-domain performance; 2) To enable flexible modality customization and mitigate the influence of noise and domain variations, we propose to remove irrelevant low-frequency noise and suppress high-frequency domain-specific information to form our X modality; 3) To further improve model generalization, we expand the representation across multiple frequencies to guide the model in balancing whole frequencies for enhanced generalization.

    "abstract": "Learning fine-grained representations from coarse labels for fine-grained visual recognition (FGVR) is a challenging yet valuable task, as it alleviates the reliance on labor-intensive fine-grained annotations. Early approaches focused primarily on minimizing intra-fine-grained-class variation but overlooked inter-fine-grained-class separability, resulting in limited FGVR performance. Subsequent studies employed a top-down paradigm to enhance separability via deep clustering, yet these methods require predefining the number of fine-grained classes, which is often impractical to obtain. Here, we introduce a bottom-up learning paradigm that constructs a hierarchical dendrogram by iteratively merging similar instances/clusters, inferring higher-level semantics from lowest-level instances without predefining class numbers. Leveraging this, we propose BuCSFR, a novel method that integrates a Bottom-up Construction (BuC) module to build the dendrogram based on a minimal information loss criterion, and a Separable Fine-grained Representation (SFR) module that treats dendrogram nodes as pseudo-labels to ensure representation separability. The synergistic interaction between these modules enables iterative enhancement, grounded theoretically in the Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach, showcasing its effectiveness in learning separable representations for FGVR.

    "abstract": "In dynamic scenes, achieving accurate camera localization and reconstructing a long-term consistent map containing only the static background are two major challenges faced by Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM). In current traditional dynamic VSLAM systems, the methods used to handle dynamic objects are primarily designed for localization; if applied to reconstruction, they are prone to introducing motion artifacts. Meanwhile, mask compensation strategies in NeRF- or 3DGS-based dynamic VSLAM systems also face challenges, such as the inability to completely eliminate dynamic object artifacts and low real-time performance. To address these issues, we leverage object detection to extract semantic information and propose a dynamic feature detection algorithm based on both geometry and appearance. This algorithm accurately identifies known and unknown moving objects and determines their actual motion states. To mitigate the issue of insufficient detection box coverage, we design a dynamic object box correction algorithm based on clustering and Gaussian mixture models to comprehensively identify moving object regions. Furthermore, to overcome the limitations of sparse features in texture-scarce environments, we introduce a feature densification strategy based on image texture complexity, enhancing reconstruction quality while maintaining real-time performance. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our system achieves state-of-the-art localization and reconstruction performance in dynamic scenes and can run in real time on resource-constrained devices",

    "abstract": "The emergence of visual autoregressive (AR) models has revolutionized image generation while presenting new challenges for synthetic image detection. Unlike previous GAN or diffusion-based methods, AR models generate images through discrete token prediction, exhibiting both marked improvements in image synthesis quality and unique characteristics in their vector-quantized representations. In this paper, we propose to leverage Discrete Distribution Discrepancy-aware Quantization Error (D^3QE) for autoregressive-generated image detection that exploits the distinctive patterns and the frequency distribution bias of the codebook existing in real and fake images. We introduce a discrete distribution discrepancy-aware transformer that integrates dynamic codebook frequency statistics into its attention mechanism, fusing semantic features and quantization error latent. To evaluate our method, we construct a comprehensive dataset termed ARForensics covering 7 mainstream visual AR models. Experiments demonstrate superior detection accuracy and strong generalization of D^3QE across different AR models, with robustness to real-world perturbations.

We propose StrandHead, a novel text-driven method capable of generating 3D hair strands and disentangled head avatars with strand-level attributes. Instead of using large-scale hair-text paired data for supervision, we demonstrate that realistic hair strands can be generated from prompts by distilling 2D generative models pre-trained on human mesh data. To this end, we propose a meshing approach guided by strand geometry to guarantee the gradient flow from the distillation objective to the neural strand representation. The optimization is then regularized by statistically significant haircut features, leading to stable updating of strands against unreasonable drifting. These employed 2D/3D human-centric priors contribute to text-aligned and realistic 3D strand generation. Extensive experiments show that StrandHead achieves the state-of-the-art performance on text to strand generation and disentangled 3D head avatar modeling.

To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel Multimodal Causal Analysis Model (MCAM) that constructs latent causal structures between visual and language modalities. Firstly, we design a multi-level feature extractor to capture long-range dependencies. Secondly, we design a causal analysis module that dynamically models driving scenarios using a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of driving states. Thirdly, we utilize a vision-language transformer to align critical visual features with their corresponding linguistic expressions. Extensive experiments on the BDD-X, and CoVLA datasets demonstrate that MCAM achieves SOTA performance in visual-language causal relationship learning.

Current solutions have to balance between the frame rate and image quality. High frame rates, for example, can be achieved by reducing either per-point scanning time or scanning density, but at the cost of lowering the information density at individual frames. Fast scanning process further reduces the signal-to-noise ratio and different scanning systems exhibit different distortion characteristics. In this work, we design and employ a new Transient Transformer architecture called TransiT to achieve real-time NLOS recovery under fast scans. TransiT directly compresses the temporal dimension of input transients to extract features, reducing computation costs and meeting high frame rate requirements. It further adopts a feature fusion mechanism as well as employs a spatial-temporal Transformer to help capture features of NLOS transient videos. Moreover, TransiT applies transfer learning to bridge the gap between synthetic and real-measured data. In real experiments, TransiT manages to reconstruct from sparse transients of 16 x16 measured at an exposure time of 0.4 ms per point to NLOS videos at a 64 x64 resolution at 10 frames per second.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation but come with significant computational costs, posing challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Recent post-training quantization (PTQ) methods have attempted to mitigate this issue by focusing on the iterative nature of diffusion models. However, these approaches often overlook outliers, leading to degraded performance at low bit-widths. In this paper, we propose a DMQ which combines Learned Equivalent Scaling (LES) and channel-wise Power-of-Two Scaling (PTS) to effectively address these challenges. Learned Equivalent Scaling optimizes channel-wise scaling factors to redistribute quantization difficulty between weights and activations, reducing overall quantization error. Recognizing that early denoising steps, despite having small quantization errors, crucially impact the final output due to error accumulation, we incorporate an adaptive timestep weighting scheme to prioritize these critical steps during learning. Furthermore, identifying that layers such as skip connections exhibit high inter-channel variance, we introduce channel-wise Power-of-Two Scaling for activations. To ensure robust selection of PTS factors even with small calibration set, we introduce a voting algorithm that enhances reliability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing works, especially at low bit-widths such as W4A6 (4-bit weight, 6-bit activation) and W4A8, maintaining high image generation quality and model stability.

Motivated by this observation, we propose an inference-stage technique to short-circuit those feature coordinates that spurious gradients exploit to inflate OOD confidence, while leaving ID classification largely intact. To circumvent the expense of recomputing the logits after this gradient short-circuit, we further introduce a local first-order approximation that accurately captures the post-modification outputs without a second forward pass.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The fundamental requirement for text-to-image generation is aligning the generated images with the provided text. With large-scale data, pre-trained Stable Diffusion (SD) models have achieved remarkable performance in this task. These models process an input prompt as text control, guiding a vision model to perform denoising operations that recover a clean image from pure noise. However, we observe that when there is correlation among text tokens, SD's generated images fail to accurately represent the semantics of the input prompt: simple yet crucial objects may be omitted, thereby disrupting text-image alignment. We refer to this problem as \"object omission\". Without additional external knowledge, previous methods have been ineffective at addressing this issue. To investigate this problem, we analyze the attention maps in SD and find that biased text representations mislead the visual denoising process when handling correlated tokens, impeding object generation. Moreover, we observe that even when two prompts share the same semantics, slight variations in token sequence significantly alter attention scores, consequently affecting the final generated images. Based on these findings, we propose a simple yet effective fine-tuning method that applies decorrelation to the self-attention maps in the text module, thus reducing dependencies between tokens. Our approach requires no external prior knowledge, is straightforward to implement, and operates solely on the text module of the SD model. Extensive experiments confirm that our method effectively alleviates the object omission problem under text correlations, thereby enhancing text-image alignment",

While recent cross-modal training approaches have significantly improved navigation performance in both indoor and outdoor scenarios, aerial navigation over real-world cities remains underexplored primarily due to limited datasets and the difficulty of integrating visual and geographic information. To fill this gap, we introduce CityNav, the first large-scale real-world dataset for aerial VLN. Our dataset consists of 32,637 human demonstration trajectories, each paired with a natural language description, covering 4.65 km2 across two real cities: Cambridge and Birmingham. In contrast to existing datasets composed of synthetic scenes such as AerialVLN, our dataset presents a unique challenge because agents must interpret spatial relationships between real-world landmarks and the navigation destination, making CityNav an essential benchmark for advancing aerial VLN. Furthermore, as an initial step toward addressing this challenge, we provide a methodology of creating geographic semantic maps that can be used as an auxiliary modality input during navigation. In our experiments, we compare performance of three representative aerial VLN agents (Seq2seq, CMA and AerialVLN models) and demonstrate that the semantic map representation significantly improves their navigation performance",

    "abstract": "Traditional deep networks struggle to acquire shape-fair representations due to their high expressivity. Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) are promising candidates as they learn nonlinearities directly, a property that makes them more adaptive. However, KANs perform suboptimally in terms of shape-fairness because of unconstrained nonlinearities, a limitation we demonstrate for the first time. On the other hand, shape-fair networks reside on a neuromanifold of low-degree. Motivated by this, we investigate neuromanifold regularization of KANs to enable learning of shape-fair feature representations. The proposed method, NeuroManifold Regularized-KANs, is a novel regularization that addresses failure modes during the acquisition of local and global shape cues, separately. This is done by constraining the degree of the neuromanifolds of two jointly trained feature extractors. Additionally, we propose a novel Style Decorrelation Loss that promotes decorrelation of intermediate representations. Our experiments demonstrate that NMR-KAN improves shape bias over baseline convolutional KANs by 14.8% while also providing robustness under image corruptions and adversarial attacks.

In practice, WSIs usually come from different hospitals (or domains) and may have significant differences. These differences generally result in large gaps in distribution between different WSI domains and thus, the survival analysis models trained on one domain may fail to transfer to another. To address this issue, we propose a Dual-branch Encoder and Two-level Alignment (DETA) framework to explore both feature and category-level alignment between different WSI domains. Specifically, we first formulate the concerned problem as graph domain adaptation (GDA) using the graph representation of WSIs. Then, we construct a dual-branch graph encoder, including the message passing (MP) and the shortest path (SP) branches, to explicitly and implicitly extract semantic information from the graph-represented WSIs. To realize GDA, we propose a two-level alignment approach: at the category level, we develop a coupling technique by virtue of the dual-branch structure, leading to reduced divergence between the category distributions of the two domains; at the feature level, we introduce an adversarial perturbation strategy to better augment source domain feature, resulting in improved alignment in feature distribution.

    "abstract": "To promote the deployment of scenario understanding in the real world, Open-Vocabulary Scene Graph Generation (OV-SGG) has attracted much attention recently, aiming to generalize beyond the limited number of relation categories labeled during training and detect those unseen relations during inference. Towards OV-SGG, one feasible solution is to leverage the large-scale pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) containing plentiful category-level content to capture accurate correspondences between images and text. However, due to the lack of quadratic relation-aware knowledge in VLMs, directly using the category-level correspondence in the base dataset could not sufficiently represent generalized relations involved in open world. Therefore, designing an effective open-vocabulary relation mining framework is challenging and meaningful. To this end, we propose a novel Vision-Language Interactive Relation Mining model (VL-IRM) for OV-SGG, which explores learning generalized relation-aware knowledge through multi-modal interaction. Specifically, first, to enhance the generalization of the relation text to visual content, we present a generative relation model to make the text modality explore possible open-ended relations based on visual content.

Recent approaches attempt to mitigate these issues through gradient correction. However, they often overlook the combined impact of gradient magnitude and direction, leading to unsatisfactory gradient solutions. To address these issues, we propose a novel federated continual learning method (called FedAGC) with asymmetric gradient correction, which performs memory rehearsal using representative samples selected via a centroid-based approach from historical tasks. By formulating the problem as a multi-objective optimization problem, FedAGC derives more effective gradients while incorporating group-level personalization to facilitate useful knowledge integration and irrelevant knowledge isolation, effectively mitigating both temporal and spatial catastrophic forgetting.

Existing Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) methods rely predominantly on frame-based approaches, which are prone to aliasing and inaccuracies due to limited temporal resolution and motion blur.

Prior state-of-the-art methods rely on computationally intensive optimization across a fixed number of poses at high frame rates, which becomes prohibitively expensive as we increase the temporal resolution. In comparison, our model leverages a recurrent feed-forward neural network to predict human motion in the latent space of possible human motions. We present the first work that replaces traditional event volume-based discrete-time pre-dictions with a continuous human motion field represented as a time-implicit function, enabling parallel pose queries at arbitrary temporal resolutions. To advance the evaluation of continuous-time human pose estimation, we introduce the Beam-splitter Event Agile Human Motion Dataset--a hardware-synchronized high-speed human dataset tailored for this purpose.

To overcome these dual challenges, we propose a Bilateral Grid-based Pixel-Adaptive Multi-layer Perceptron (BPAM) framework. Our approach synergizes the spatial modeling of bilateral grids with the non-linear capabilities of MLPs. Specifically, we generate bilateral grids containing MLP parameters, where each pixel dynamically retrieves its unique transformation parameters and obtain a distinct MLP for color mapping based on spatial coordinates and intensity values. In addition, we propose a novel grid decomposition strategy that categorizes MLP parameters into distinct types stored in separate subgrids. Multi-channel guidance maps are used to extract category-specific parameters from corresponding subgrids, ensuring effective utilization of color information during slicing while guiding precise parameter generation.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Scene coordinate regression (SCR) has established itself as a promising learning-based approach to visual relocalization. After mere minutes of scene-specific training, SCR models estimate camera poses of query images with high accuracy. Still, SCR methods fall short of the generalization capabilities of more classical feature-matching approaches. When imaging conditions of query images, such as lighting or viewpoint, are too different from the training views, SCR models fail. Failing to generalize is an inherent limitation of previous SCR frameworks, since their training objective is to encode the training views in the weights of the coordinate regressor itself. The regressor essentially overfits to the training views, by design. We propose to separate the coordinate regressor and the map representation into a generic transformer and a scene-specific map code.

More importantly, it allows us to train the transformer to generalize from mapping images to unseen query images during pre-training.

Traditional approaches rely on modality-specific encoders and late fusion techniques, which can hinder flexibility when adapting to new tasks or modalities. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel framework that extends the concept of task reformulation beyond natural language processing (NLP) to multimodal learning. We propose to reformulate diverse multimodal tasks into a unified next-frame prediction problem, allowing a single model to handle different modalities without modality-specific components. This method treats all inputs and outputs as sequential frames in a video, enabling seamless integration of modalities and effective knowledge transfer across tasks. Our approach is evaluated on a range of tasks, including text-to-text, image-to-text, video-to-text, and audio-to-text, demonstrating the model's ability to generalize across modalities with minimal adaptation. We show that task reformulation can significantly simplify multimodal model design across various tasks, laying the groundwork for more generalized multimodal foundation models",

    "abstract": "Ensemble-based attacks have been proven to be effective in enhancing adversarial transferability by aggregating the output of models with various architectures. However, existing research primarily focuses on refining ensemble weights or optimizing the ensemble path, overlooking the exploration of ensemble models to enhance the transferability of adversarial attacks. To address this gap, we propose applying adversarial augmentation to the surrogate models, aiming to boost overall generalization of ensemble models and reduce the risk of adversarial overfitting. Meanwhile, observing that ensemble Vision Transformers (ViTs) gain less attention, we propose ViT-EnsembleAttack based on the idea of model adversarial augmentation, the first ensemble-based attack method tailored for ViTs to the best of our knowledge. Our approach generates augmented models for each surrogate ViT using three strategies: Multi-head dropping, Attention score scaling, and MLP feature mixing, with the associated parameters optimized by Bayesian optimization. These adversarially augmented models are ensembled to generate adversarial examples. Furthermore, we introduce Automatic Reweighting and Step Size Enlargement modules to boost transferability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViT-EnsembleAttack significantly enhances the adversarial transferability of ensemble-based attacks on ViTs, outperforming existing methods by a substantial margin.

To address these challenges, we propose Topology-enhanced Test-Time Adaptation (TopoTTA), the first test-time adaptation framework designed specifically for TSS. TopoTTA consists of two stages: Stage 1 adapts models to cross-domain topological discrepancies using the proposed Topological Meta Difference Convolutions (TopoMDCs), which enhance topological representation without altering pre-trained parameters; Stage 2 improves topological continuity by a novel Topology Hard sample Generation (TopoHG) strategy and prediction alignment on hard samples with pseudo-labels in the generated pseudo-break regions. Extensive experiments across four scenarios and ten datasets demonstrate TopoTTA's effectiveness in handling topological distribution shifts, achieving an average improvement of 31.81% in clDice.

    "abstract": "Human pose and shape (HPS) estimation methods have been extensively studied, with many demonstrating high zero-shot performance on in-the-wild images and videos. However, these methods often struggle in challenging scenarios involving complex human poses or significant occlusions. Although some studies address 3D human pose estimation under occlusion, they typically evaluate performance on datasets that lack realistic or substantial occlusions, e.g., most existing datasets introduce occlusions with random patches over the human or clipart-style overlays, which may not reflect real-world challenges. To bridge this gap in realistic occlusion datasets, we introduce a novel benchmark dataset, VOccl3D, a Video-based human Occlusion dataset with 3D body pose and shape annotations. Inspired by works such as AGORA and BEDLAM, we constructed this dataset using advanced computer graphics rendering techniques, incorporating diverse real-world occlusion scenarios, clothing textures, and human motions. Additionally, we fine-tuned recent HPS methods, CLIFF and BEDLAM-CLIFF, on our dataset, demonstrating significant qualitative and quantitative improvements across multiple public datasets, as well as on the test split of our dataset, while comparing its performance with other state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we leveraged our dataset to enhance human detection performance under occlusion by fine-tuning an existing object detector, YOLO11, thus leading to a robust end-to-end HPS estimation system under occlusions. Overall, this dataset serves as a valuable resource for future research aimed at benchmarking methods designed to handle occlusions, offering a more realistic alternative to existing occlusion datasets",

Moreover, incorporating root position into these models often leads to performance degradation. To address these limitations, we introduce PoseAnchor, a unified framework that seamlessly integrates root position estimation while improving overall pose accuracy. PoseAnchor leverages Iterative Hard Thresholding Robust Least Squares Regression (ITRR), a novel robust regression approach introduced to 3D HPE for the first time. ITRR effectively mitigates the impact of noisy 2D detections, enabling more accurate root position estimation. With ITRR, PoseAnchor enables zero-shot root localization, allowing existing models to estimate absolute root positions without retraining or architectural modifications. ITRR identifies a support set of reliable joints based on their spatial relationships to achieve robust root estimation, effectively filtering out unreliable joints. Beyond zero-shot localization, PoseAnchor incorporates ITRR into a Data-Driven Training framework that selectively utilizes the support set to optimize pose learning. By dynamically filtering high-confidence joint data, PoseAnchor mitigates noise while improving robustness",

However, existing approaches are focused on text CoT, limiting their ability to leverage visual cues. Visual CoT remains underexplored, and the only work is based on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) that relies on extensive labeled bounding-box data and is hard to generalize to unseen cases. In this paper, we introduce Unsupervised Visual CoT (UV-CoT), a novel framework for image-level CoT reasoning via preference optimization. UV-CoT performs preference comparisons between model-generated bounding boxes (one is preferred and the other is dis-preferred), eliminating the need for bounding-box annotations. We get such preference data by introducing an automatic data generation pipeline. Given an image, our target MLLM (e.g., LLaVA-1.5-7B) generates seed bounding boxes using a template prompt and then answers the question using each bounded region as input. An evaluator MLLM (e.g., OmniLLM-12B) ranks the responses, and these rankings serve as supervision to train the target MLLM with UV-CoT by minimizing negative log-likelihood losses. By emulating human perception--identifying key regions and reasoning based on them--UV-CoT can improve visual comprehension, particularly in spatial reasoning tasks where textual descriptions alone fall short. Our experiments on six datasets demonstrate the superiority of UV-CoT, compared to the state-of-the-art textual and visual CoT methods. Our zero-shot testing on three unseen datasets shows the strong generalization of UV-CoT. The implementation code is available in the Appendix",

    "abstract": "Accurate monocular 3D object detection (M3OD) is pivotal for safety-critical applications like autonomous driving, yet its reliability deteriorates significantly under real-world domain shifts caused by environmental or sensor variations. To address these shifts, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods have emerged, enabling models to adapt to target distributions during inference. While prior TTA approaches recognize the positive correlation between low uncertainty and high generalization ability, they fail to address the dual uncertainty inherent to M3OD: semantic uncertainty (ambiguous class predictions) and geometric uncertainty (unstable spatial localization). To bridge this gap, we propose Dual Uncertainty Optimization (DUO), the first TTA framework designed to jointly minimize both uncertainties for robust M3OD. Through a convex optimization lens, we introduce an innovative convex structure of the focal loss and further derive a novel conjugate loss, enabling label-agnostic uncertainty weighting and balanced learning for high-uncertainty objects. In parallel, we design a semantic-aware normal field constraint that preserves geometric coherence in regions with clear semantic cues, reducing uncertainty from the unstable 3D representation. This dual-branch mechanism forms a complementary loop: enhanced spatial perception improves semantic classification, and robust semantic predictions further refine spatial understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DUO over existing methods across various datasets and domain shift types. The source code is available at https://github.com/hzcar/DUO",

Subsequently, a Motion-Adaptive Normalization module is incorporated to effectively inject global scene motion, paving the way for comprehensive character art animation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of MikuDance across various character art and motion guidance, consistently producing high-quality animations with remarkable motion dynamics",

Recent advances in 3D occupancy prediction have improved scene representation but often suffer from spatial inconsistencies, leading to floating artifacts and poor surface localization. Existing voxel-wise losses (e.g., cross-entropy) fail to enforce geometric coherence. In this paper, we propose GaussRender, a module that improves 3D occupancy learning by enforcing projective consistency. Our key idea is to project both predicted and ground-truth 3D occupancy into 2D camera views, where we apply supervision. Our method penalizes 3D configurations that produce inconsistent 2D projections, thereby enforcing a more coherent and geometrically plausible 3D structure. To achieve this efficiently, we leverage differentiable rendering with Gaussian splatting. GaussRender seamlessly integrates with existing architectures while maintaining efficiency and requiring no inference-time modifications. Extensive evaluations on multiple benchmarks (SurroundOcc-nuScenes, Occ3D nuScenes, SSCBench-KITTI360) demonstrate that GaussRender significantly improves geometric fidelity across various 3D occupancy models (TPVFormer, SurroundOcc, Symphonies), achieving state-of-the-art results, particularly on surface-sensitive metrics.

Our core insight is deriving a unified discrete representation from heterogeneous data to mitigate distribution shifts, inspired by vector quantization. Specifically, we propose a differentiable, cluster-based soft quantization mechanism (CSQM) that maps heterogeneous data (spanning modalities and domains) into a shared discrete latent space. Then, we introduce latent space regularization (LSR), leveraging joint prototypes that satisfy semantic relation consistency as learnable anchors to enhance the compactness and semantic discriminability of the discrete latent space.

Despite the success, the potential misuse of T2I models poses significant risks of generating Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW) content.

Most previous methods rely on word substitution to search adversarial prompts. Due to limited search space, this leads to suboptimal performance compared to gradient-based training. However, black-box settings present unique challenges to training gradient-driven attack methods, since there is no access to the internal architecture and parameters of T2I models. To facilitate the learning of adversarial prompts in black-box settings, we propose a novel prompt learning attack framework (PLA), where insightful gradient-based training tailored to black-box T2I models is designed by utilizing multimodal similarities.

Hybrid representations that integrate implicit and explicit features offer a way to mitigate these limitations. However, when applied in parallelized block-wise training, two critical issues arise since reconstruction accuracy deteriorates due to reduced data diversity when training each block independently, and parallel training restricts the number of divided blocks to the available number of GPUs. To address these issues, we propose Momentum-GS, a novel approach that leverages momentum-based self-distillation to promote consistency and accuracy across the blocks while decoupling the number of blocks from the physical GPU count. Our method maintains a teacher Gaussian decoder updated with momentum, ensuring a stable reference during training. This teacher provides each block with global guidance in a self-distillation manner, promoting spatial consistency in reconstruction. To further ensure consistency across the blocks, we incorporate block weighting, dynamically adjusting each block's weight according to its reconstruction accuracy. Extensive experiments on large-scale scenes show that our method consistently outperforms existing techniques, achieving a 18.7% improvement in LPIPS over CityGaussian with much fewer divided blocks and establishing a new state of the art",

    "abstract": "This paper presents SeHDR, a novel high dynamic range 3D Gaussian Splatting (HDR-3DGS) approach for generating HDR novel views given multi-view LDR images. Unlike existing methods that typically require the multi-view LDR input images to be captured from different exposures, which are tedious to capture and more likely to suffer from errors (e.g., object motion blurs and calibration/alignment inaccuracies), our approach learns the HDR scene representation from multi-view LDR images of a single exposure. Our key insight to this ill-posed problem is that by first estimating **Bracketed 3D Gaussians** (i.e., with different exposures) from single-exposure multi-view LDR images, we may then be able to merge these bracketed 3D Gaussians into an HDR scene representation. Specifically, SeHDR first learns base 3D Gaussians from single-exposure LDR inputs, where the spherical harmonics parameterize colors in a linear color space. We then estimate multiple 3D Gaussians with identical geometry but varying linear colors conditioned on exposure manipulations. Finally, we propose the Differentiable Neural Exposure Fusion (NeEF) to integrate the base and estimated 3D Gaussians into HDR Gaussians for novel view rendering.

Instead, we provide the first unified model - TriDi which works in any direction. Concretely, we generate Human, Object, and Interaction modalities simultaneously with a new three-way diffusion process, allowing to model seven distributions with one network. We implement TriDi as a transformer attending to the various modalities' tokens, thereby discovering conditional relations between them. The user can control the interaction either as a text description of HOI or a contact map. We embed these two representations onto a shared latent space, combining the practicality of text descriptions with the expressiveness of contact maps. Using a single network, TriDi unifies all the special cases of prior work and extends to new ones modeling a family of seven distributions. Remarkably, despite using a single model, TriDi generated samples surpass one-way specialized baselines on GRAB and BEHAVE in terms of both qualitative and quantitative metrics, and demonstrating better diversity.

To this end, existing methods focus on enhancing point cloud quality by developing dedicated denoising and completion models. However, due to the isolation between the point cloud enhancement and downstream tasks, these methods fail to work in various real-world domains. In addition, the conflicting objectives between denoising and completing tasks further limit the ensemble paradigm to preserve critical geometric features. To tackle the above challenges, we propose a unified point-level prompting method that reformulates point cloud denoising and completion as a prompting mechanism, enabling robust analysis in a parameter-efficient manner. We start by introducing a Rectification Prompter to adapt to noisy points through the predicted rectification vector prompts, effectively filtering noise while preserving intricate geometric features essential for accurate analysis. Sequentially, we further incorporate a Completion Prompter to generate auxiliary point prompts based on the rectified point clouds, facilitating their robustness and adaptability. Finally, a Shape-Aware Unit module is exploited to efficiently unify and capture the filtered geometric features for the downstream point cloud analysis.

    "abstract": "Modeling high-resolution spatiotemporal representations, including both global dynamic contexts (e.g., holistic human motion tendencies) and local motion details (e.g., high-frequency changes of keypoints), is essential for video-based human pose estimation (VHPE). Current state-of-the-art methods typically unify spatiotemporal learning within a single type of modeling structure (convolution or attention-based blocks), which inherently have difficulties in balancing global and local dynamic modeling and may bias the network to one of them, leading to suboptimal performance. Moreover, existing VHPE models suffer from quadratic complexity when capturing global dependencies, limiting their applicability especially for high-resolution sequences. Recently, the state space models (known as Mamba) have demonstrated significant potential in modeling long-range contexts with linear complexity; however, they are restricted to 1D sequential data. In this paper, we present a novel framework that extends Mamba from two aspects to separately learn global and local high-resolution spatiotemporal representations for VHPE. Specifically, we first propose a Global Spatiotemporal Mamba, which performs 6D selective space-time scan and spatial- and temporal-modulated scan merging to efficiently extract global representations from high-resolution sequences. We further introduce a windowed space-time scan-based Local Refinement Mamba to enhance the high-frequency details of localized keypoint motions.

    "abstract": "In this paper we tackle a fundamental question: \"Can we train latent diffusion models together with the variational auto-encoder (VAE) tokenizer in an end-to-end manner?\" Traditional deep-learning wisdom dictates that end-to-end training is often preferable when possible. However, for latent diffusion transformers, it is observed that end-to-end training both VAE and diffusion-model using standard diffusion-loss is ineffective, even causing a degradation in final performance. We show that while diffusion loss is ineffective, end-to-end training can be unlocked through the representation-alignment (REPA) loss -- allowing both VAE and diffusion model to be jointly tuned during the training process. Despite its simplicity, the proposed training recipe (REPA-E) shows remarkable performance; speeding up diffusion model training by over 17x and 45x over REPA and vanilla training recipes, respectively. Interestingly, we observe that end-to-end tuning with REPA-E also improves the VAE itself; leading to improved latent space structure and downstream generation performance. In terms of final performance, our approach sets a new state-of-the-art; achieving FID of 1.26 and 1.83 with and without classifier-free guidance on ImageNet 256x256.

    "abstract": "Operating robots in open-ended scenarios with diverse tasks is a crucial research and application direction in robotics. While recent progress in natural language processing and large multimodal models has enhanced robots' ability to understand complex instructions, robot manipulation still faces the procedural skill dilemma and the declarative skill dilemma in open environments. Existing methods often compromise cognitive and executive capabilities. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose RoBridge, a hierarchical intelligent architecture for general robotic manipulation. It consists of a high-level cognitive planner (HCP) based on a large-scale pre-trained vision-language model (VLM), an invariant operable representation (IOR) serving as a symbolic bridge, and a generalist embodied agent (GEA). RoBridge maintains the declarative skill of VLM and unleashes the procedural skill of reinforcement learning, effectively bridging the gap between cognition and execution. RoBridge demonstrates significant performance improvements over existing baselines, achieving a 75% success rate on new tasks and an 83% average success rate in sim-to-real generalization using only five real-world data samples per task. This work represents a significant step towards integrating cognitive reasoning with physical execution in robotic systems, offering a new paradigm for general robotic manipulation",

Current methods struggle with occlusion-heavy scenarios and complete body personalization, as 2D pose conditioning lacks 3D geometry, often leading to ambiguous occlusions and anatomical distortions, and many approaches focus solely on facial identity. In contrast, our PersonaCraft integrates diffusion models with 3D human modeling, employing SMPLx-ControlNet, to utilize 3D geometry like depth and normal maps for robust 3D-aware pose conditioning and enhanced anatomical coherence. To handle fine-grained occlusions, we propose Occlusion Boundary Enhancer Network that exploits depth edge signals with occlusion-focused training, and Occlusion-Aware Classifier-Free Guidance strategy that selectively reinforces conditioning in occluded regions without affecting unoccluded areas. PersonaCraft can seamlessly be combined with Face Identity ControlNet, achieving full-body multi-human personalization and thus marking a significant advancement beyond prior approaches that concentrate only on facial identity. Our dual-pathway body shape representation with SMPLx-based shape parameters and textual refinement, enables precise full-body personalization and flexible user-defined body shape adjustments.

Existing face-swapping methods mainly focus on localized facial replacement neglecting holistic head morphology, while head-swapping approaches struggling with hairstyle diversity and complex backgrounds, and none of these methods allow users to modify the transplanted head's expressions after swapping. To tackle these challenges, our method incorporates several innovative strategies through a unified latent diffusion paradigm. 1) Identity-preserving context fusion: We propose a shape-agnostic mask strategy to explicitly disentangle foreground head identity features from background/body contexts, combining hair enhancement strategy to achieve robust holistic head identity preservation across diverse hair types and complex backgrounds. 2) Expression-aware landmark retargeting and editing: We propose a disentangled 3DMM-driven retargeting module that decouples identity, expression, and head poses, minimizing the impact of original expressions in input images and supporting expression editing. While a scale-aware retargeting strategy is further employed to minimize cross-identity expression distortion for higher transfer precision.

Moreover, prevalent pre-training methods typically apply self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques from natural images without adequately accommodating the characteristics of remote sensing (RS) images, such as the complicated semantic distribution within a single RS image. In this work, we present SkySense V2, a unified MM-RSFM that employs a single transformer backbone to handle multiple modalities. This backbone is pre-trained with a novel SSL strategy tailored to the distinct traits of RS data. In particular, SkySense V2 incorporates an innovative adaptive patch merging module and learnable modality prompt tokens to address challenges related to varying resolutions and limited feature diversity across modalities.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we address the problem of novel class discovery (NCD), which aims to cluster novel classes by leveraging knowledge from disjoint known classes. While recent advances have made significant progress in this area, existing NCD methods face two major limitations. First, they primarily focus on single-view data (e.g., images), overlooking the increasingly common multi-view data, such as multi-omics datasets used in disease diagnosis. Second, their reliance on pseudo-labels to supervise novel class clustering often results in unstable performance, as pseudo-label quality is highly sensitive to factors such as data noise and feature dimensionality. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework named Intra-view and Inter-view Correlation Guided Multi-view Novel Class Discovery (IICMVNCD), which is the first attempt to explore NCD in multi-view setting so far. Specifically, at the intra-view level, leveraging the distributional similarity between known and novel classes, we employ matrix factorization to decompose features into view-specific shared base matrices and factor matrices. The base matrices capture distributional consistency among the two datasets, while the factor matrices model pairwise relationships between samples. At the inter-view level, we utilize view relationships among known classes to guide the clustering of novel classes. This includes generating predicted labels through the weighted fusion of factor matrices and dynamically adjusting view weights of known classes based on the supervision loss, which are then transferred to novel class learning.

    "abstract": "Controllable scene generation could reduce the cost of diverse data collection substantially for autonomous driving. Prior works formulate the traffic layout generation as a predictive progress, either by denoising entire sequences at once or by iteratively predicting the next frame. However, full sequence denoising hinders online reaction, while the latter's short-sighted next-frame prediction lacks precise goal-state guidance. Further, the learned model struggles to generate complex or challenging scenarios due to a large number of safe and ordinary driving behaviors from open datasets. To overcome these, we introduce Nexus, a decoupled scene generation framework that improves reactivity and goal conditioning by simulating both ordinal and challenging scenarios from fine-grained tokens with independent noise states. At the core of the decoupled pipeline is the integration of a partial noise-masking training strategy and a noise-aware schedule that ensures timely environmental updates throughout the denoising process. To complement challenging scenario generation, we collect a dataset consisting of complex corner cases. It covers 540 hours of simulated data, including high-risk interactions such as cut-in, sudden braking, and collision. Nexus achieves superior generation realism while preserving reactivity and goal orientation, with a 40% reduction in displacement error. We further demonstrate that Nexus improves closed-loop planning by 20% through data augmentation and showcase its capability in safety-critical data generation",

This means that appearance and motion are inherently linked: either both are present and recorded in the event data, or neither is captured. Previous works treat the recovery of these two visual quantities as separate tasks, which does not fit with the above-mentioned nature of event cameras and overlooks the inherent relations between them. We propose an unsupervised learning framework that jointly estimates optical flow (motion) and image intensity (appearance) using a single network. From the data generation model, we newly derive the event-based photometric error as a function of optical flow and image intensity. This error is further combined with the contrast maximization framework to form a comprehensive loss function that provides proper constraints for both flow and intensity estimation. Exhaustive experiments show our method's state-of-the-art performance: in optical flow estimation, it reduces EPE by 20% and AE by 25% compared to unsupervised approaches, while delivering competitive intensity estimation results, particularly in high dynamic range scenarios. Our method also achieves shorter inference time than all other optical flow methods and many of the image reconstruction methods, while they output only one quantity.

Recently, class-agnostic motion prediction on bird's-eye view (BEV) cell grids derived from LiDAR point clouds has gained significant attention. However, existing frameworks typically perform cell classification and motion prediction on a per-pixel basis, neglecting important motion field priors such as rigidity constraints, temporal consistency, and future interactions between agents. These limitations lead to degraded performance, particularly in sparse and distant regions. To address these challenges, we introduce PriorMotion, an innovative generative framework designed for class-agnostic motion prediction that integrates essential motion priors by modeling them as distributions within a structured latent space. Specifically, our method captures structured motion priors using raster-vector representations and employs a variational autoencoder with distinct dynamic and static components to learn future motion distributions in the latent space. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that PriorMotion outperforms state-of-the-art methods across both traditional metrics and our newly proposed evaluation criteria. Notably, we achieve improvements of approximately 15.24% in accuracy for fast-moving objects, an 3.59% increase in generalization, a reduction of 0.0163 in motion stability, and a 31.52% reduction in prediction errors in distant regions.

With synthetic data, we reached the same performance using only 500 real scans. This finding suggests that synthetic data can steepen data scaling laws, enabling more efficient model training than real data alone. Motivated by these lessons, we created AbdomenAtlas 2.0---a dataset of 10,134 CT scans with a total of 13,223 tumor instances per-voxel manually annotated in six organs (pancreas, liver, kidney, colon, esophagus, and uterus) and 6,511 control scans.

In particular, our MobileViCLIP-Small obtains similar zero-shot retrieval performance as InternVideo2-L14 on text-to-video dataset MSR-VTT while being 46.7x faster when deployed on the mobile device. Furthermore, MobileViCLIP-Small can generalize to zero-shot action recognition task and obtains 1.0% better Top-1 accuracy than InternVideo2-S14 while being 5.6x faster on the mobile device.

Existing methods often rely either on models pre-trained on general visual tasks, that lack sign-specific features, or use complex multimodal and multi-branch architectures. To bridge this gap, we introduce a scalable, self-supervised framework for sign representation learning. We leverage important inductive (sign) priors during the training of our RGB model. To do this, we leverage simple but important cues based on skeletons while pretraining a masked autoencoder. These sign specific priors alongside feature regularization and an adversarial style agnostic loss provide a powerful backbone. Notably, our model does not require skeletal keypoints during inference, avoiding the limitations of keypoint-based models during downstream tasks. When finetuned, we achieve state-of-the-art performance for sign recognition on the WLASL, ASL-Citizen and NMFs-CSL datasets, using a simpler architecture and with only a single-modality. Beyond recognition, our frozen model excels in sign dictionary retrieval and sign translation, surpassing standard MAE pretraining and skeletal-based representations in retrieval. It also reduces computational costs for training existing sign translation models while maintaining strong performance on Phoenix2014T, CSL-Daily and How2Sign",

Lecture slides, a fundamental component of online education, contain a wealth of information, playing a crucial role in learning.However, previous works have not yet paid sufficient attention to understanding lecture slides, including the absence of the large-scale dataset and comprehensive understanding tasks. To facilitate the research about lecture slides understanding, we establish the LecSlides-370K, which consists of 25,542 lectures with 370,078 slides across 15 areas. We also introduce two comprehensive tasks, Lecture Summary and Lecture Question Answering (QA), for providing different perspectives of slides understanding. Furthermore, complex and flexible text relations can hinder the understanding of the internal logic of slides. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method, named SlideParser, which includes an auxiliary branch to predict text relations within slides and enhance attention between related texts, thereby improving slides understanding. With extensive experiments, we show the superiority of our proposed method on both LecSlides-370k and SlideVQA. Dataset and code will be released soon",

Specifically, we encode interaction-aware condition representations that capture both spatial responsiveness and contextual semantics of human-object pairs, conditioning the diffusion process purely on visual features rather than text-based inputs. Furthermore, we refine these relation representations through generative feedback from the diffusion model, enhancing HOI detection without requiring image synthesis.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel inertial localization framework named Egocentric Action-aware Inertial Localization (EAIL), which leverages egocentric action cues from head-mounted IMU signals to localize the target individual within a 3D point cloud. Human inertial localization is challenging due to IMU sensor noise that causes trajectory drift over time. The diversity of human actions further complicates IMU signal processing by introducing various motion patterns. Nevertheless, we observe that some actions captured by the head-mounted IMU correlate with spatial environmental structures (e.g., bending down to look inside an oven, washing dishes next to a sink), thereby serving as spatial anchors to compensate for the localization drift. The proposed EAIL framework learns such correlations via hierarchical multi-modal alignment with vision-language guidance. By assuming that the 3D point cloud of the environment is available, it contrastively learns modality encoders that align short-term egocentric action cues in IMU signals with local environmental features in the point cloud. The learning process is enhanced using concurrently collected vision and language signals to improve multimodal alignment. The learned encoders are then used in reasoning the IMU data and the point cloud over time and space to perform inertial localization. Interestingly, these encoders can further be utilized to recognize the corresponding sequence of actions as a by-product. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework over state-of-the-art inertial localization and inertial action recognition baselines",

Subsequently, a cross-modal future encoder integrates the task-agnostic Q-feature with navigation instructions to produce a set of action scores reflecting future prospects.

Our model is trained by distilling 2D and 3D part proposals from a mix of labeled datasets and image segmentations on large unsupervised datasets, via a contrastive learning formulation. It produces a continuous feature field which can be clustered to yield a hierarchical part decomposition. Comparisons show that PartField is up to 20% more accurate and often orders of magnitude faster than other recent class-agnostic part-segmentation methods. Beyond single-shape part decomposition, consistency in the learned field emerges across shapes, enabling tasks such as co-segmentation and correspondence, which we demonstrate in several applications of these general-purpose, hierarchical, and consistent 3D feature fields.

To address these concerns, protection perturbation algorithms have been developed to disrupt forgery generation. However, the protection algorithms would become ineffective when forgery attackers apply purification techniques to bypass the protection. To address this issue, we present a novel approach, Anti-Tamper Perturbation (ATP). ATP introduces a tamper-proof mechanism within the perturbation. It consists of protection and authorization perturbations, where the protection perturbation defends against forgery attacks, while the authorization perturbation detects purification-based tampering. Both protection and authorization perturbations are applied in the frequency domain under the guidance of a mask, ensuring that the protection perturbation does not disrupt the authorization perturbation. This design also enables the authorization perturbation to be distributed across all image pixels, preserving its sensitivity to purification-based tampering. ATP demonstrates its effectiveness in defending forgery attacks across various attack settings through extensive experiments, providing a robust solution for protecting individuals' portrait rights and privacy.

To address these challenges, we propose Efficient View Transformation (EVT), a novel 3D object detection framework that constructs a well-structured BEV representation, improving both accuracy and efficiency. Our approach focuses on two key aspects. First, Adaptive Sampling and Adaptive Projection (ASAP), which utilizes LiDAR guidance to generate 3D sampling points and adaptive kernels, enables more effective transformation of image features into BEV space and a refined BEV representation. Second, an improved query-based detection framework, incorporating group-wise mixed query selection and geometry-aware cross-attention, effectively captures both the common properties and the geometric structure of objects in the transformer decoder.

Existing hallucination mitigation methods either incur prohibitive computational costs or introduce distribution mismatches between training data and model outputs. We identify a critical insight: hallucinations predominantly emerge at the early stages of text generation and propagate through subsequent outputs. To address this, we propose SENTINEL (Sentence-level Early iNtervention Through IN-domain prEference Learning), a framework that eliminates dependency on human annotations. Specifically, we first bootstrap high-quality in-domain preference pairs by iteratively sampling model outputs, validating object existence through cross-checking with two open-vocabulary detectors, and classifying sentences into hallucinated/non-hallucinated categories. Subsequently, we use context-coherent positive samples and hallucinated negative samples to iteratively build context-aware preference data. Finally, we train models using a context-aware preference loss (C-DPO) that emphasizes discriminative learning at the sentence level where hallucinations initially manifest. Experimental results show that SENTINEL can reduce hallucinations by 90% over the original model and outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method on both the hallucination benchmarks and general capabilities benchmarks, manifesting its superiority and generalization ability.

However, the lack of large-scale and diverse datasets significantly hinders progress in video-based robotic arm action understanding, highlighting the need for collecting a new large-scale dataset.

Distinguished to existing action recognition benchmarks, RobAVA includes instances of both normal and anomalous executions for each action category. Our further analysis reveals that the primary challenge in robotic arm action recognition lies in the fact that a complete action consists of a sequence of fundamental, atomic behaviors, requiring models to learn the inter-relationships among them. To this end, we propose a novel baseline approach, AGPT-Net, which re-defines the problem of understanding robotic arm actions as a task of aligning video sequences with atomic attributes.To enhance AGPT-Net's ability to distinguish normal and anomalous action instances, we introduce a joint semantic space constraint between category and attribute semantics, thereby amplifying the separation between normal and anomalous attribute representations for each action.

The heterogeneous morphology of lesions poses a significant challenge in developing robust diagnostic systems. Supervised approaches rely on large labeled datasets and often struggle with generalization. To address these limitations, we propose an unsupervised vision-language neural graph featurization method. This method first segments fundus images into a set of superpixels via Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC). The superpixels are then decomposed into an undirected graph where each superpixel serves as a node, and spatially adjacent nodes are connected by edges. A Hamiltonian path systematically traverses the graph and iteratively updates and propagates node and edge latent space embeddings throughout the graph until convergence is achieved. Then, a normalized cut separates the converged embeddings into two clusters within a latent space that represent the lesion and healthy superpixels of the input scans. The lesion superpixels are further classified into lesion categories using a prompt-based zero-shot vision-language model.

The Material Property Distribution Prediction model (MPDP) then estimates physical property distributions via geometry-conditioned probabilistic sampling of MLLM-P3 outputs, reformulating the problem as probability distribution estimation to reduce computational costs. Finally, we simulate objects in 3D scenes with particles sampled via the Physical-Geometric Adaptive Sampling (PGAS) strategy, efficiently capturing complex deformations and significantly reducing computational costs.

Layered representations offer fine-grained control by decomposing an image into separate editable layers. However, existing methods simplistically represent a scene via a set of background and transparent foreground layers while ignoring the scene geometry - limiting their effectiveness for depth-aware editing. We propose Depth-Guided Layer Decomposition - a layering method that decomposes an image into foreground and background layers based on a user-specified depth value, enabling precise depth-aware edits. We further propose Feature Guided Layer Compositing - a zero-shot approach for realistic layer compositing by leveraging generative priors from pretrained diffusion models. Specifically, we guide the internal U-Net features to progressively fuse individual layers into a composite latent at each denoising step. This preserves the structure of individual layers while generating realistic outputs with appropriate color and lighting adjustments without a need for post-hoc harmonization models. We demonstrate our method on two key depth-aware editing tasks: 1) scene compositing by blending the foreground of one scene with the background of another at a specified depth, and; 2) object insertion at a user-defined depth. Our zero-shot approach achieves precise depth ordering and high-quality edits, surpassing specialized scene compositing and object placement baselines, as validated across benchmarks and user studies",

    "abstract": "Despite the remarkable progress of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), they continue to face challenges in achieving competitive performance on ordinal regression (OR; a.k.a. ordinal classification). To address this issue, this paper presents OrderChain, a novel and general prompting paradigm that improves the ordinal understanding ability of MLLMs by specificity and commonality modeling. Specifically, our OrderChain consists of a set of task-aware prompts to facilitate the specificity modeling of diverse OR tasks and a new range optimization Chain-of-Thought (RO-CoT), which learns a commonality way of thinking about OR tasks by uniformly decomposing them into multiple small-range optimization subtasks. Further, we propose a category recursive division (CRD) method to generate instruction candidate category prompts to support RO-CoT automatic optimization. Comprehensive experiments show that LLaVA model with our OrderChain improves baseline LLaVA significantly on diverse OR datasets, e.g., from 47.5% to 93.2% accuracy on the Adience dataset for age estimation, and from 30.0% to 85.7% accuracy on the Diabetic Retinopathy dataset. Notably, LLaVA with our OrderChain also remarkably outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 27% on accuracy and 0.24 on MAE on the Adience dataset. To our best knowledge, our OrderChain is the first work that augments MLLMs for OR tasks, and the effectiveness is witnessed across a spectrum of OR datasets.

Our framework employs a unified Transformer-based architecture to effectively model complex spatio-temporal relationships across multiple agents, frames, and high-definition maps.

Existing text-to-video alignment metrics like CLIPScore only generate coarse-grained scores without fine-grained alignment details, failing to align with human preference. To address this limitation, we propose ETVA, a novel Evaluation method of Text-to-Video Alignment via fine-grained question generation and answering. First, a multi-agent system parses prompts into semantic scene graphs to generate atomic questions. Then we design a knowledge-augmented multi-stage reasoning framework for question answering, where an auxiliary LLM first retrieves relevant common-sense knowledge (e.g., physical laws), and then video LLM answers the generated questions through a multi-stage reasoning mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ETVA achieves a Spearman's correlation coefficient of 58.47, showing a much higher correlation with human judgment than existing metrics, which attain only 31.0. We also construct a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for text-to-video alignment evaluation, featuring 2k diverse prompts and 12k atomic questions spanning 10 categories. Through a systematic evaluation of 15 existing text-to-video models, we identify their key capabilities and limitations, paving the way for next-generation T2V generation.

Conversely, light-weight models can be deployed on edge devices at lower cost but often with inferior generation quality for complex user prompts. To strike a balance between performance and cost, we propose a routing framework, called RouteT2I, which dynamically selects either the large cloud model or the light-weight edge model for each user prompt. Since generated image quality is challenging to measure and compare directly, RouteT2I establishes multi-dimensional quality metrics, particularly, by evaluating the similarity between the generated images and both positive and negative texts that describe each specific quality metric. RouteT2I then predicts the expected quality of the generated images by identifying key tokens in the prompt and comparing their impact on the quality. RouteT2I further introduces the Pareto relative superiority to compare the multi-metric quality of the generated images. Based on this comparison and predefined cost constraints, RouteT2I allocates prompts to either the edge or the cloud.

Other approaches introduce separate tracking modules, but they accumulate errors with significant camera movement, leading to scale drift. To address these challenges, we propose a robust RGB-only outdoor 3DGS SLAM method: S3PO-GS. Technically, we establish a self-consistent tracking module anchored in the 3DGS pointmap, which avoids cumulative scale drift and achieves more precise and robust tracking with fewer iterations. Additionally, we design a patch-based pointmap dynamic mapping module, which introduces geometric priors while avoiding scale ambiguity. This significantly enhances tracking accuracy and the quality of scene reconstruction, making it particularly suitable for complex outdoor environments.

Recently, compositional visual reasoning approaches, which leverage the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) with integrated tools to solve problems, have shown promise as more effective strategies than end-to-end VR methods. However, these approaches face limitations, as frozen LLMs lack tool awareness in VR, leading to performance bottlenecks. While leveraging LLMs for reasoning is widely used in other domains, they are not directly applicable to VR due to limited training data, imperfect tools that introduce errors and reduce data collection efficiency in VR, and challenging in fine-tuning on noisy workflows. To address these challenges, we propose DWIM: i) Discrepancy-aware training Workflow generation, which assesses tool usage and extracts more viable workflows for training; and ii) Instruct-Masking fine-tuning, which guides the model to only clone effective actions, enabling the generation of more practical solutions.

While text-based agents built on Large Language Models (LLMs) often require frequent updates due to platform-specific APIs, visual agents leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer enhanced adaptability by interacting directly with Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). However, these agents face significant challenges in visual perception, particularly when handling high-resolution, visually complex digital environments. This paper introduces Iris, a foundational visual agent that addresses these challenges through two key innovations: Information-Sensitive Cropping (ISC) and Self-Refining Dual Learning (SRDL). ISC dynamically identifies and prioritizes visually dense regions using an edge detection algorithm, enabling efficient processing by allocating more computational resources to areas with higher information density. SRDL enhances the agent's ability to handle complex tasks by leveraging a dual-learning loop, where improvements in referring (describing UI elements) reinforce grounding (locating elements) and vice versa, all without requiring additional annotated data. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Iris achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks with only 850K GUI annotations, outperforming methods using 10x more training data.

    "title": "Rethink Sparse Signals for Pose-guided Text-to-image Generation",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recent works favored dense signals (e.g., depth, DensePose), as an alternative to sparse signals (e.g., OpenPose), to provide detailed spatial guidance for pose-guided text-to-image generation. However, dense representations raised new challenges including editing difficulties and potential inconsistencies with textual prompts. This fact motivates us to revisit sparse signals for pose guidance, owing to their simplicity and shape-agnostic nature, which remains underexplored. This paper proposes a novel Spatial-Pose ControlNet (SP-Ctrl), equipping sparse signals with robust controllability for pose-guided image generation. Specifically, we extend OpenPose to a learnable spatial representation, making keypoint embeddings discriminative and expressive. Additionally, we introduce keypoint concept learning, which encourages keypoint tokens to attend to the spatial positions of each keypoint, thus improving pose alignment. Experiments on animal- and human-centric image generation tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms recent spatially controllable text-to-image generation approaches under the sparse-pose guidance and even matches the performance of dense signal-based methods. Moreover, SP-Ctrl shows promising capabilities in diverse and cross-species generation through sparse signals. Code is available at https://github.com/DREAMXFAR/SP-Ctrl",

    "title": "PatchScaler: An Efficient Patch-Independent Diffusion Model for Image Super-Resolution",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "While diffusion models significantly improve the perceptual quality of super-resolved images, they usually require a large number of sampling steps, resulting in high computational costs and long inference times. Recent efforts have explored reasonable acceleration schemes by reducing the number of sampling steps. However, these approaches treat all regions of the image equally, overlooking the fact that regions with varying levels of reconstruction difficulty require different sampling steps. To address this limitation, we propose PatchScaler, an efficient patch-independent diffusion pipeline for single image super-resolution. Specifically, PatchScaler introduces a Patch-adaptive Group Sampling (PGS) strategy that groups feature patches by quantifying their reconstruction difficulty and establishes shortcut paths with different sampling configurations for each group. To further optimize the patch-level reconstruction process of PGS, we propose a texture prompt that provides rich texture conditional information to the diffusion model. The texture prompt adaptively retrieves texture priors for the target patch from a common reference texture memory. Extensive experiments show that our PatchScaler achieves favorable performance in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, while significantly speeding up inference.

    "abstract": "We propose a method of adapting pretrained depth completion models to test time data in an unsupervised manner. Depth completion models are (pre)trained to produce dense depth maps from pairs of RGB image and sparse depth maps in ideal capture conditions (source domain), e.g., well-illuminated, high signal-to-noise. When models are transferred to capture conditions out of ideal case (target domain), they produce erroneous output dense depth maps due to the covariate shift. To identify cases of out-of-distribution errors, we propose an learn an energy model in the source domain that assigns scalars that represent the likelihood of the output dense depth maps. This energy model is further used to adapt the pretrained depth completion models at test time, leading to our method: Energy-based Test-time Adaptation (ETA). ETA can localize regions of errors as high energy; test-time adaptation involves updating the model weights to minimize the energy, which in turn mitigates the covariate shift. We evaluate ETA across 3 indoor and 3 outdoor datasets, where ETA improves over the previous state of the art by an average of 6.94% on outdoor and 10.23% on indoor settings",

While promising, these models are often domain-specific and are only assessed within the particular applications for which they are designed. Given that many tasks can be represented as video modeling problems, video foundation models (ViFMs) hold considerable promise as general-purpose domain-agnostic approaches. However, it is not known whether the knowledge acquired on large-scale but potentially out-of-domain data can be effectively transferred across diverse scientific disciplines, and if a single, pretrained ViFM can be competitive with domain-specific baselines. To address this, we introduce SciVid, a comprehensive benchmark comprising five *Sci*entific *Vid*eo tasks, across medical computer vision, animal behavior, and weather forecasting. We adapt six leading ViFMs to SciVid using simple trainable readout modules, establishing strong baselines and demonstrating the potential for effective transfer learning. Specifically, we show that state-of-the-art results can be obtained in several applications by leveraging the general-purpose representations from ViFM backbones. Furthermore, our results reveal the limitations of existing ViFMs, and highlight opportunities for the development of generalizable models for high-impact scientific applications.

Furthermore, RoboPearls employs a vision-language model (VLM) to analyze robotic learning issues to close the simulation loop for performance enhancement.

Despite its efficiency and potential, tuning-free methods still face challenges in maintaining high-quality image morphing due to the non-linear nature of the multi-step denoising process and bias inherited from the pre-trained diffusion model.

Domain Generalization (DG) aims to address this by focusing on domain-invariant features or augmenting data for greater diversity. However, these methods often struggle with limited training domains or significant gaps between seen (training) and unseen (test) domains. To enhance DG robustness, we hypothesize that it is essential for the model to be trained on data from domains that closely resemble unseen test domains--an inherently difficult task due to the absence of prior knowledge about the unseen domains. Accordingly, we propose ConstStyle, a novel approach that leverages a unified domain to capture domain-invariant features and bridge the domain gap with theoretical analysis. During training, all samples are mapped onto this unified domain, optimized for seen domains. During testing, unseen domain samples are projected similarly before predictions. By aligning both training and testing data within this unified domain, ConstStyle effectively reduces the impact of domain shifts, even with large domain gaps or few seen domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConstStyle consistently outperforms existing methods across diverse scenarios. Notably, when only a limited number of seen domains are available, ConstStyle can boost accuracy up to 19.82% compared to the next best approach",

Prior KD techniques typically assume homogeneity between the teacher and student models. However, as technology advances, a wide variety of architectures have emerged, ranging from initial Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to Vision Transformers (ViTs), and Multi-Level Perceptrons (MLPs). Consequently, developing a universal KD framework compatible with any architecture has become an important research topic. In this paper, we introduce a perspective-aware teaching (PAT) KD framework to enable feature distillation across diverse architectures. Our framework comprises two key components. First, we design prompt tuning blocks that incorporate student feedback, allowing teacher features to adapt to the student model's learning process. Second, we propose region-aware attention to mitigate the view mismatch problem between heterogeneous architectures. By leveraging these two modules, effective distillation of intermediate features can be achieved across heterogeneous architectures.

While 3DGS has been extensively examined in head avatars, it faces challenges with accurate gaze control and generalization across different subjects.

    "abstract": "Unified image fusion aims to integrate complementary information from multi-source images, enhancing image quality through a unified framework applicable to diverse fusion tasks. While treating all fusion tasks as a unified problem facilitates task-invariant knowledge sharing, it often overlooks task-specific characteristics, thereby limiting the overall performance. Existing general image fusion methods incorporate explicit task identification to enable adaptation to different fusion tasks. However, this dependence during inference restricts the model's generalization to unseen fusion tasks. To address these issues, we propose a novel unified image fusion framework named \"TITA\", which dynamically balances both Task-invariant Interaction and Task-specific Adaptation. For task-invariant interaction, we introduce the Interaction-enhanced Pixel Attention (IPA) module to enhance pixel-wise interactions for better multi-source complementary information extraction.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Fast Adversarial Training (FAT) employs the single-step Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) to generate adversarial examples, reducing the computational costs of traditional adversarial training. However, FAT suffers from Catastrophic Overfitting (CO), where models' robust accuracy against multi-step attacks plummets to zero during training. Recent studies indicate that CO occurs because single-step adversarial perturbations contain label information that models exploit for prediction, leading to overfitting and diminished robustness against more complex attacks. In this paper, we discover that after CO occurs, the label information of certain samples can transfer across different samples, significantly increasing the likelihood of modified images being classified as the intended label. This discovery offers a new perspective on why various adversarial initialization strategies are effective. To address this issue, we introduce an innovative FAT strategy that leverages special samples to capture transferable label information and proactively removes potential label information during training, complemented by a non-uniform label smoothing technique to further eliminate label information. Experimental results across three datasets demonstrate that our method maintains competitive robustness against several attacks compared to other FAT approaches, with ablation studies confirming the effectiveness of our methodology.

    "abstract": "Open-set counting is garnering increasing attention due to its capability to enumerate objects of arbitrary category. It can be generally categorized into two methodologies: text-guided zero-shot counting methods and exemplar-guided few-shot counting methods. Previous text-guided zero-shot methods only provide limited object information through text, resulting in poor performance. Besides, though exemplar-guided few-shot approaches gain better results, they rely heavily on manually annotated visual exemplars, resulting in low efficiency and high labor intensity. Therefore, we propose CountSE, which simultaneously achieves high efficiency and high performance. CountSE is a new text-guided zero-shot object counting algorithm that generates multiple precise soft exemplars at different scales to enhance counting models driven solely by semantics. Specifically, to obtain richer object information and address the diversity in object scales, we introduce Semantic-guided Exemplar Selection, a module that generates candidate soft exemplars at various scales and selects those with high similarity scores. Then, to ensure accuracy and representativeness, Clustering-based Exemplar Filtering is introduced to refine the candidate exemplars by effectively eliminating inaccurate exemplars through clustering analysis. In the text-guided zero-shot setting, CountSE outperforms all state-of-the-art methods on the FSC-147 benchmark by at least 15%. Additionally, experiments on two other widely used datasets demonstrate that CountSE significantly outperforms all previous text-guided zero-shot counting methods and is competitive with the most advanced exemplar-guided few-shot methods.

    "abstract": "Existing handwritten text generation methods primarily focus on isolated words. However, realistic handwritten text demands attention not only to individual words but also to the relationships between them, such as vertical alignment and horizontal spacing. Therefore, generating entire text line emerges as a more promising and comprehensive task. However, this task poses significant challenges, including the accurate modeling of complex style patterns--encompassing both intra- and inter-word relationships--and maintaining content accuracy across numerous characters. To address these challenges, we propose DiffBrush, a novel diffusion-based model for handwritten text-line generation. Unlike existing methods, DiffBrush excels in both style imitation and content accuracy through two key strategies: (1) content-decoupled style learning, which disentangles style from content to better capture intra-word and inter-word style patterns by using column- and row-wise masking; and (2) multi-scale content learning, which employs line and word discriminators to ensure global coherence and local accuracy of textual content. Extensive experiments show that DiffBrush excels in generating high-quality text-lines, particularly in style reproduction and content preservation.

Recent studies introduce style information by empirically replacing specific features in attention blocks with style features. However, the relationship between features and style remains unclear.

By quantifying the distribution discrepancy induced by style variations using the Wasserstein distance, we find that features in self-attention blocks exhibit high sensitivity to style compared to features in cross-attention blocks. Our analysis provides valuable insights into the contribution of different features to style. Based on our findings, we propose a novel Wasserstein Style Distribution Transform (WSDT) method, which generates stylized images by transforming the distribution of style-sensitive features to align with that of style features. WSDT applies channel adaptive distribution transform to ensure that information not related to the style is not introduced. Our approach is simple yet efficient, optimization-free, and can be seamlessly integrated into attention-based text-to-image diffusion models.

In previous methods, potential future trajectories are often absent in the scene encoding stage, which may lead to suboptimal outcomes.

In this work, we propose an interaction-based method, named Future-Aware Interaction Network, that introduces potential future trajectories into scene encoding for a comprehensive traffic representation. Furthermore, a State Space Model (SSM), specifically Mamba, is introduced for both spatial and temporal modeling. To adapt Mamba for spatial interaction modeling, we propose an adaptive reordering strategy that transforms unordered data into a structured sequence. Additionally, Mamba is employed to refine generated future trajectories temporally, ensuring more consistent predictions. These enhancements not only improve model efficiency but also enhance the accuracy and diversity of predictions.

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of text-to-image diffusion models has raised concerns about their potential misuse in generat- ing harmful or unauthorized contents. To address these issues, several Concept Erasure methods have been pro- posed. However, most of them fail to achieve both robust- ness, i.e., the ability to robustly remove the target concept., and effectiveness, i.e., maintaining image quality. While few recent techniques successfully achieve these goals for NSFW concepts, none could handle narrow concepts such as copyrighted characters or celebrities. Erasing these nar- row concepts is critical in addressing copyright and legal concerns. However, erasing them is challenging due to their close distances to non-target neighboring concepts, requir- ing finer-grained manipulation. In this paper, we introduce Subspace Mapping (SuMa), a novel method specifically de- signed to achieve both robustness and effectiveness in eas- ing these narrow concepts. SuMa first derives a target sub- space representing the concept to be erased and then neu- tralizes it by mapping it to a reference subspace that mini- mizes the distance between the two. This mapping ensures the target concept is robustly erased while preserving im- age quality. We conduct extensive experiments with SuMa across four tasks: subclass erasure, celebrity erasure, artis- tic style erasure, and instance erasure and compare the results with current state-of-the-art methods. Our method achieves image quality comparable to approaches focused on effectiveness, while also yielding results that are on par with methods targeting completeness",

Additionally, we design a cross-granularity feature interaction mechanism that leverages complementary information between coarse-grained and fine-grained features. We further enhance the learning process through hierarchical prototype contrastive learning, which utilizes the parent class hierarchy to guide the learning of coarse-grained features while ensuring the distinguishability of fine-grained features within child classes.

The key to effectively learning MeshMamba is the serialization technique of mesh vertices into orderings that are easily processed by Mamba. This is achieved by sorting the vertices based on body part annotations or the 3D vertex locations of a template mesh, such that the ordering respects the structure of articulated shapes.

Recent temporal context mining approaches to conditional video coding offer superior coding performance. However, the need to store and access a large amount of implicit contextual information extracted from past decoded frames in decoding a video frame poses a challenge due to excessive memory access. Our MH-LVC overcomes this issue by storing multiple long- and short-term reference frames but limiting the number of reference frames used at a time for temporal prediction to two. Our decoded frame buffer management allows the encoder to flexibly utilize the long-term key frames to mitigate temporal cascading errors and the short-term reference frames to minimize prediction errors. Moreover, our buffering scheme enables the temporal prediction structure to be adapted to individual input videos. While this flexibility is common in traditional video codecs, it has not been fully explored for learned video codecs. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method outperforms VTM-17.0 under the low-delay B configuration in terms of PSNR-RGB across commonly used test datasets, and performs comparably to the state-of-the-art learned codecs (e.g. DCVC-FM) while requiring less decoded frame buffer and similar decoding time",

    "abstract": "Image Quality Assessment (IQA) measures and predicts perceived image quality by human observers. Although recent studies have highlighted the critical influence that variations in the scale of an image have on its perceived quality, this relationship has not been systematically quantified.To bridge this gap, we introduce the Image Intrinsic Scale (IIS), defined as the largest scale where an image exhibits its highest perceived quality. We also present the Image Intrinsic Scale Assessment (IISA) task, which involves subjectively measuring and predicting the IIS based on human judgments. We develop a subjective annotation methodology and create the IISA-DB dataset, comprising 785 image-IIS pairs annotated by experts in a rigorously controlled crowdsourcing study with verified reliability. Furthermore, we propose WIISA (Weak-labeling for Image Intrinsic Scale Assessment), a strategy that leverages how the IIS of an image varies with downscaling to generate weak labels. Experiments show that applying WIISA during the training of several IQA methods adapted for IISA consistently improves the performance compared to using only ground-truth labels. We will release the code, dataset, and pre-trained models upon acceptance",

    "abstract": "Human Motion Segmentation (HMS), which aims to partition videos into non-overlapping human motions, has attracted increasing research attention recently. Existing approaches for HMS are mainly dominated by subspace clustering methods, which are grounded on the assumption that high-dimensional temporal data align with a Union-of-Subspaces (UoS) distribution. However, the frames in video capturing complex human motions with cluttered backgrounds may not align well with the UoS distribution. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for HMS, named Temporal Rate Reduction Clustering (\\text TR ^2\\text C ), which jointly learns structured representations and affinity to segment the sequences of frames in video. Specifically, the structured representations learned by \\text TR ^2\\text C enjoy temporally consistency and are aligned well with a UoS structure, which is favorable for addressing the HMS task. We conduct extensive experiments on five benchmark HMS datasets and achieve state-of-the-art performances with different feature extractors.

In this work, we introduce SparseVILA, a novel method of query-aware token retrieval to dynamically accelerate the underlying LLM by pruning tokens in the prefill stage while attending to a sparse subset of visual tokens during the decoding phase. By decoupling the context and generation compression, we can migrate the majority of sparsity into the generation stage, enabling query-aware support for multi-turn conversation while achieving a 1.4x speedup on image benchmarks. This approach leads to +5.9% average accuracy improvements on image-centric benchmarks over previous works. Finally, SparseVILA enables efficient long-context/long-generation tasks by achieving a 3.6x and 1.7x speedup in prefill and decoding, respectively",

    "abstract": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) frequently hallucinate responses to visual queries, undermining their reliability for critical applications. However, quantifying the effect of such hallucinations in free-form responses to open-ended queries requires visually verifying each claim within the response, which is highly challenging. We propose Programmatic VLM Evaluation (PROVE), a new benchmarking paradigm for evaluating VLM responses to open-ended queries. To construct PROVE, we provide a large language model with a high-fidelity scene-graph representation constructed from a detailed image caption, and prompt it to generate i) diverse and challenging question-answer (QA) pairs that test a range of image understanding capabilities, and ii) programs that can be executed over the scene graph object to verify each QA pair. We thus construct a benchmark of 10.6k challenging but grounded visual QA pairs. Next, we propose a scene graph-based evaluation framework to programmatically measure both the helpfulness and truthfulness of a free-form model response without relying on subjective LLM judgments. We extensively benchmark a range of VLMs on PROVE, and uncover a concerning tradeoff where models that provide more helpful responses often hallucinate more, whereas truthful models tend to be less informative. PROVE serves as a foundation for developing next-generation VLMs that balance helpfulness with truthfulness. A snapshot of our dataset is available at https://prove-explorer-anon.netlify.app/",

In this study, we provide a unified perspective in modeling them through the lens of representation learning. We first observe that their intermediate representations spontaneously align. Inspired by mirror neurons, we further introduce an approach that explicitly aligns the representations of observed and executed actions. Specifically, we employ two linear layers to map the representations to a shared latent space, where contrastive learning enforces the alignment of corresponding representations, effectively maximizing their mutual information.

To address these challenges, we propose Wave-MambaAD, a wavelet-driven state space model for unified subtle and large-scale anomaly detection. Firstly, to capture subtle anomalies, we design a high-frequency state space model that employs horizontal, vertical, and diagonal scanning mechanisms for processing directionally aligned high-frequency components, enabling precise anomaly detection through multidimensional feature extraction. Secondly, for comprehensive localization of large-scale anomalies, we propose a low-frequency state space model implementing channel-adaptive dynamic scanning mechanisms to maintain structural coherence in global contexts, which facilitates large-scale anomaly detection via adaptive feature integration. Finally, we develop a dynamic spatial enhancement block to improve anomalous feature representation by enhancing feature diversity through coordinated inter-channel communication and adaptive gating mechanisms.

    "abstract": "Due to the arbitrary orientation of objects in aerial images, rotation equivariance is a critical property for aerial object detectors. However, recent studies on rotation-equivariant aerial object detection remain scarce. Most detectors rely on data augmentation to enable models to learn approximately rotation-equivariant features. A few detectors have constructed rotation-equivariant networks, but due to the breaking of strict rotation equivariance by typical downsampling processes, these networks only achieve approximately rotation-equivariant backbones. Whether strict rotation equivariance is necessary for aerial image object detection remains an open question. In this paper, we implement a strictly rotation-equivariant backbone and neck network with a more advanced network structure and compare it with approximately rotation-equivariant networks to quantitatively measure the impact of rotation equivariance on the performance of aerial image detectors. Additionally, leveraging the inherently grouped nature of rotation-equivariant features, we propose a multi-branch head network that reduces the parameter count while improving detection accuracy. Based on the aforementioned improvements, this study proposes the Multi-branch head rotation-equivariant single-stage Detector (MessDet), which achieves state-of-the-art performance on the challenging aerial image datasets DOTA-v1.0, DOTA-v1.5 and DIOR-R with an exceptionally low parameter count",

Current approaches face a critical trade-off: dense-token methods achieve superior accuracy and detail preservation but suffer from prohibitively slow processing on CPU devices, while the Segment Anything Model (SAM) advances the field with sparse prompt tokens for fast inference but compromises segmentation quality. In this paper, we propose Inter2Former to address this challenge by optimizing computation allocation in dense-token processing, which introduces four key enhancements. First, we propose Dynamic Prompt Embedding (DPE) that adaptively processes only regions of interest while avoiding additional overhead from background tokens. Second, we introduce Dynamic Hybrid Attention (DHA), which leverages previous segmentation masks to route tokens through either full attention (O(N^2)) for boundary regions or our proposed efficient BSQ attention (O(N)) for non-boundary regions. Third, we develop Hybrid Mixture of Experts (HMoE), which applies similar adaptive computation strategies in FFN modules with CPU-optimized parallel processing. Finally, we present Dynamic Local Upsampling (DLU), a reverse operation of DPE, which localizes objects with a lightweight MLP and performs fine-grained upsampling only in detected regions.

While offering powerful tools that enhance convenience, they also pose significant social concerns. As defenders, current synthetic image detection methods often lack artifact-level textual interpretability and are overly focused on image manipulation detection, and current datasets usually suffer from outdated generators and a lack of fine-grained annotations. In this paper, we introduce SynthScars, a high-quality and diverse dataset consisting of 12,236 fully synthetic images with human-expert annotations. It features 4 distinct image content types, 3 categories of artifacts, and fine-grained annotations covering pixel-level segmentation, detailed textual explanations, and artifact category labels.

Building upon this capability, we further explore LEGION as a controller, integrating it into image refinement pipelines to guide the generation of higher-quality and more realistic images. Extensive experiments show that LEGION outperforms existing methods across multiple benchmarks, particularly surpassing the second-best traditional expert on SynthScars by 3.31% in mIoU and 7.75% in F1 score. Moreover, the refined images generated under its guidance exhibit stronger alignment with human preferences. More information about LEGION can be found at https://opendatalab.github.io/LEGION",

    "abstract": "Extracting tubular structures from images is a widespread and challenging task in computer vision. To explore these continuous structures, iterative tracing methods offer a promising direction. However, in scenes with dense and blurred branches, existing tracing methods tend to jump to adjacent branches during tracing process, leading a significant topological mistake. The reason of this shortcoming is that the tracing model only focuses on the estimation of discrete nodes and ignores their connection attribution. To solve this problem, we introduce NETracer, a topology-aware iterative tracing method to improve the continuity and topological accuracy. In our approach, a node-edge estimation network with local connectivity loss is trained to produce the future nodes and their connective edges. Then, a geodesic distance-based search strategy is employed with the help of predicted edge cues to trace the future branches more accurately. Additionally, to comprehensively assess the effect of the tracing model, an new tracing metric is proposed to evaluate the local accuracy, continuity, and topological correctness of the traced branches. We demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing segmentation and tracing methods on five 2D road, vessel and 3D neuron datasets",

    "abstract": "Quantization-aware training (QAT) simulates a quantization process during training to lower bit-precision of weights/activations. It learns quantized weights indirectly by updating latent weights, i.e., full-precision inputs to a quantizer, using gradient-based optimizers. We claim that coupling a user-defined learning rate (LR) with these optimizers is sub-optimal for QAT. Quantized weights transit discrete levels of a quantizer, only if corresponding latent weights pass transition points, where the quantizer changes discrete states. This suggests that the changes of quantized weights are affected by both the LR for latent weights and their distributions. It is thus difficult to control the degree of changes for quantized weights by scheduling the LR manually. We conjecture that the degree of parameter changes in QAT is related to the number of quantized weights transiting discrete levels. Based on this, we introduce a transition rate (TR) scheduling technique that controls the number of transitions of quantized weights explicitly. Instead of scheduling a LR for latent weights, we schedule a target TR of quantized weights, and update the latent weights with a novel transition-adaptive LR (TALR), enabling considering the degree of changes for the quantized weights during QAT.

    "abstract": "Learned image compression aims to reduce redundancy by accurately modeling the complex signal distribution inherent in images with network parameters. However, existing practices that train models on entire dataset offline face a limitation, as the estimated distribution only approximates the general image signal distribution and fails to capture image-specific characteristics. To address this issue, we propose a cross-granularity online optimization strategy to mitigate information loss from two key aspects: statistical distribution gaps and local structural gaps. This strategy introduces additional fitted bitstream to push the estimated signal distribution closer to the real one at both coarse-grained and fine-grained levels. For coarse-grained optimization, we relax the common bitrate constraints during gradient descent and reduce bitrate cost via adaptive QP (Quantization Parameter) selection, preventing information collapse and narrowing the statistical distribution gaps. For fine-grained optimization, a Mask-based Selective Compensation Module is designed to sparsely encode structural characteristics at low bitrates, enhancing local distribution alignment. By jointly optimizing global and local distributions, our method achieves closer alignment to real image statistics and significantly enhances the performance. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our method as well as the design of our module. Our project is publicly available at: https://ellisonkuang.github.io/CGOO.github.io/",

In this work, we propose Spiking Point Mamba (SPM), the first Mamba-based SNN in the 3D domain. Naively adapting Mamba to 3D SNNs, though, is hindered by temporal dynamics mismatch and spike-induced information loss. Thus, we first introduce Hierarchical Dynamic Encoding (HDE), an improved direct encoding method that effectively introduces dynamic temporal mechanism. Then, we propose Spiking Mamba Block (SMB), which builds upon Mamba while learning inter-time-step features and minimizing information loss caused by spikes. Finally, to further boost performance, we adopt an asymmetric SNN-ANN architecture for spike-based pre-training and finetune.

    "abstract": "In low-light environments, longer exposure times are commonly used to enhance image visibility; however, this inevitably leads to motion blur. Even with a long exposure time, videos captured in low-light environments still suffer from issues such as low visibility, low contrast, and color distortion. Additionally, the long exposure time results in videos with a low frame rate. Therefore, videos captured in low-light exhibit low visibility and motion blur, as well as low frame rates. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel problem aimed at transforming motion-blurred, low-frame-rate videos with poor visibility in low-light environments into high-frame-rate videos while simultaneously enhancing their visibility. To tackle this challenge, we leverage the unique advantages of event cameras, which capture scene changes asynchronously, providing superior temporal resolution and a wider dynamic range compared to conventional frame-based cameras. These properties make event cameras particularly effective in reducing motion blur, compensating for low frame rates, and enhancing visibility in low-light conditions. To this end, we developed a hybrid camera system that integrates two RGB cameras and an event camera, capturing a dedicated dataset for this task and proposing novel network architectures to effectively address this problem.

It is challenging since the models need to generalize to anomalies across different domains. Recently, CLIP-based anomaly detection methods, such as WinCLIP and AnomalyCLIP, have demonstrated superior performance in the ZSAD task, due to the strong zero-shot recognition of the CLIP model. However, they overlook the utilization of frequency information of images. In this paper, we find that frequency information could benefit the ZSAD task, since some properties of the anomaly area, such as appearance defects, can also be reflected based on its frequency information. To this end, We propose Frequency Enhanced CLIP (FE-CLIP), taking advantage of two different but complementary frequency-aware clues, (1) Frequency-aware Feature Extraction adapter, and (2) Local Frequency Statistics adapter, in the visual encoder of CLIP, to deeply mine frequency information for the ZSAD task. We apply DCT as the frequency-domain transformation. Through comprehensive experiments, we show that the proposed FE-CLIP has good generalization across different domains and achieves superior zero-shot performance of detecting and segmenting anomalies in 10 datasets of highly diverse class semantics from various defect inspections and medical domains.

These methods struggle to handle complex rotation and stretching motions and ensure multi-view consistency, often necessitating resource-intensive retraining. To address these challenges, we propose a training-free zero-shot diffusion method that leverages optical flow for complex multi-view motion editing.

    "abstract": "Medical language-guided segmentation, integrating textual clinical reports as auxiliary guidance to enhance image segmentation, has demonstrated significant improvements over unimodal approaches. However, its inherent reliance on paired image-text input, which we refer to as \"textual reliance\", presents two fundamental limitations: 1) many medical segmentation datasets lack paired reports, leaving a substantial portion of image-only data underutilized for training; and 2) inference is limited to retrospective analysis of cases with paired reports, limiting its applicability in most clinical scenarios where segmentation typically precedes reporting. To address these limitations, we propose ProLearn, the first Prototype-driven Learning framework for language-guided segmentation that fundamentally alleviates textual reliance. At its core, we introduce a novel Prototype-driven Semantic Approximation (PSA) module to enable approximation of semantic guidance from textual input. PSA initializes a discrete and compact prototype space by distilling segmentation-relevant semantics from textual reports. Once initialized, it supports a query-and-respond mechanism which approximates semantic guidance for images without textual input, thereby alleviating textual reliance. Extensive experiments on QaTa-COV19, MosMedData+ and Kvasir-SEG demonstrate that ProLearn outperforms state-of-the-art language-guided methods when limited text is available",

In this work, we propose CoTMR, a training-free framework with novel Chain-of-thought (CoT) and Multi-scale Reasoning. Instead of relying on caption models for modality transformation, CoTMR directly employs the Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) to achieve unified understanding and reasoning of composed queries. To enhance reasoning reliability, we devise CIRCoT, which guides the LVLM to perform step-by-step reasoning by following predefined subtasks. Additionally, while most existing approaches focus solely on global-level reasoning, CoTMR introduces fine-grained predictions about the presence or absence of key elements at the object scale for more comprehensive reasoning. Furthermore, we design a Multi-Grained Scoring (MGS) mechanism, which integrates CLIP similarity scores of the above reasoning outputs with candidate images to realize precise retrieval.

The key idea is to use text embeddings from a vision-language model to enrich the semantic representation of sketches. Specifically, these text-derived priors specify the part components of the object, compensating for missing visual cues from ambiguous sketches. In addition, we introduce ISG-Net which employs two types of graph convolutional networks: IndivGCN, which processes fine-grained details, and PartGCN, which aggregates these details into parts and refines the structure of objects.

The inherent gap between visual and textual modalities makes the embeddings from the vision projector critical for visual comprehension. However, current alignment approaches treat visual embeddings as contextual cues and merely apply auto-regressive supervision to textual outputs, neglecting the necessity of introducing equivalent direct visual supervision, which hinders the potential finer alignment of visual embeddings. In this paper, based on our analysis of the refinement process of visual embeddings in the LLM's shallow layers, we propose BASIC, a method that utilizes refined visual embeddings within the LLM as supervision to directly guide the projector in generating initial visual embeddings. Specifically, the guidance is conducted from two perspectives: (i) optimizing embedding directions by reducing angles between initial and supervisory embeddings in semantic space; (ii) improving semantic matching by minimizing disparities between the logit distributions of both visual embeddings. Without additional supervisory models or artificial annotations, BASIC significantly improves the performance of MLLMs across a wide range of benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our introduced direct visual supervision",

This necessitates the creation of modular and scalable ways to teach VLMs about physical reasoning. To that end, we introduce Physics Context Builders (PCBs), a modular framework where specialized smaller VLMs are fine-tuned to generate detailed physical scene descriptions. These can be used as physical contexts to enhance the reasoning capabilities of larger VLMs. PCBs enable the separation of visual perception from reasoning, allowing us to analyze their relative contributions to physical understanding. We perform experiments on CLEVRER and on Falling Tower, a stability detection dataset with both simulated and real-world scenes, to demonstrate that PCBs provide substantial performance improvements, increasing average accuracy by up to 13.8% on complex physical reasoning tasks.

    "abstract": "Remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) enables non-contact extraction of physiological signals, providing significant advantages in medical monitoring, emotion recognition, and face anti-spoofing. However, the extraction of reliable rPPG signals is hindered by motion variations in real-world environments, leading to entanglement issue. To address the challenge, we employ the Generalizable Gaussian Model (GGM) to disentangle geometry and chroma components with 4D Gaussian representations. Employing the GGM for robust rPPG estimation is non-trivial. Firstly, there are no camera parameters in the dataset, resulting in the inability to render video from 4D Gaussian. The \"4D virtual camera\" is proposed to construct extra Gaussian parameters to describe view and motion changes, giving the ability to render video with the fixed virtual camera parameters. Further, the chroma component is still not explicitly decoupled in 4D Gaussian representation. Explicit motion modeling (EMM) is designed to decouple the motion variation in an unsupervised manner. Explicit chroma modeling (ECM) is tailored to decouple specular, physiological, and noise signals, respectively. To validate our approach, we expand existing rPPG datasets to include various motion and illumination interference scenarios, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in real-world settings.

Existing person Re-Identification (Re-ID) methods are primarily designed for homogeneous camera settings, such as ground-to-ground or aerial-to-aerial matching. Therefore, these conventional Re-ID approaches underperform due to the significant viewpoint discrepancies introduced by cross-platform cameras in the AG-ReID task. To address this limitation, we propose a novel and efficient approach, termed View-Invariant Feature Learning for Aerial-Ground Person Re-Identification (VIF-AGReID), which explores view-invariant features without leveraging any auxiliary information. Our approach introduces two key components: (1) Patch-Level RotateMix (PLRM), an augmentation strategy that enhances rotational diversity within local regions of training samples, enabling the model to capture fine-grained view-invariant features, and (2) View-Invariant Angular Loss (VIAL), which mitigates the impact of perspective variations by imposing angular constraints that exponentially penalize large angular deviations, optimizing the similarity of positive pairs while enhancing dissimilarity for hard negatives. These components interact synergistically to drive view-invariant feature learning, enhancing robustness across diverse viewpoints.

Motivated by this, we propose EvolvingGrasp, an evolutionary grasp generation method that continuously enhances grasping performance through efficient preference alignment. Specifically, we introduce Handpose-wise Preference Optimization (HPO), which allows the model to continuously align with preferences from both positive and negative feedback while progressively refining its grasping strategies. To further enhance efficiency and reliability during online adjustments, we incorporate a Physics-aware Consistency Model within HPO, which accelerates inference, reduces the number of timesteps needed for preference fine-tuning, and ensures physical plausibility throughout the process.

    "abstract": "Most frame-based learned video codecs can be interpreted as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) propagating reference information along the temporal dimension. This work revisits the limitations of the current approaches from an RNN perspective. The output-recurrence methods, which propagate decoded frames, are intuitive but impose dual constraints on the output decoded frames, leading to suboptimal rate-distortion performance. In contrast, the hidden-to-hidden connection approaches, which propagate latent features within the RNN, offer greater flexibility but require large buffer sizes. To address these issues, we propose HyTIP, a learned video coding framework that combines both mechanisms. Our hybrid buffering strategy uses explicit decoded frames and a small number of implicit latent features to achieve competitive coding performance. Experimental results show that our HyTIP outperforms the sole use of either output-recurrence or hidden-to-hidden approaches. Furthermore, it achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods but with a much smaller buffer size, and outperforms VTM 17.0 (Low-delay B) in terms of PSNR-RGB and MS-SSIM-RGB.

Recent advances in this field have shifted towards parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, with many approaches building upon the framework that maintains a pool of learnable prompts.

In this work, we present a novel prompt-based approach that addresses this limitation. Our method trains a single set of shared prompts across all tasks and, rather than concatenating prompts to the input, directly modifies the CLS token's attention computation by adding the prompts to it. This simple and lightweight design not only significantly reduces computational complexity--both in terms of inference costs and the number of trainable parameters--but also eliminates the need to optimize prompt lengths for different downstream tasks, offering a more efficient yet powerful solution for rehearsal-free class-incremental learning. Extensive experiments across a diverse range of CIL benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, highlighting its potential to establish a new prompt-based CIL paradigm.

This paper tackles a text-editable virtual try-on task that modifies the clothing based on the provided clothing image while editing the wearing style (e.g., tucking style, fit) according to the text descriptions. In the text-editable virtual try-on, three key aspects exist: (i) designing rich text descriptions for paired person-clothing data to train the model, (ii) addressing the conflicts where textual information of the existing person's clothing interferes the generation of the new clothing, and (iii) adaptively adjust the inpainting mask aligned with the text descriptions, ensuring proper editing areas while preserving the original person's appearance irrelevant to the new clothing. To address these aspects, we propose PromptDresser, a text-editable virtual try-on model that leverages large multimodal model (LMM) assistance to enable high-quality and versatile manipulation based on generative text prompts. Our approach utilizes LMMs via in-context learning to generate detailed text descriptions for person and clothing images independently, including pose details and editing attributes using minimal human cost. Moreover, to ensure the editing areas, we adjust the inpainting mask depending on the text prompts adaptively. Our approach enhances text editability while effectively conveying clothing details that are difficult to capture through images alone, leading to improved image quality.

    "abstract": "Although large visual-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in multimodal tasks, errors may occasionally arise due to biases during the reasoning process. Recently, reward models (RMs) have become increasingly pivotal in the reasoning process. Specifically, process RMs evaluate each reasoning step, outcome RMs focus on the assessment of reasoning results, and critique RMs perform error analysis on the entire reasoning process, followed by corrections. However, existing benchmarks for vision-language RMs (VLRMs) typically assess only a single aspect of their capabilities (e.g., distinguishing between two answers), thus limiting the all-round evaluation and restricting the development of RMs in the visual-language domain. To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive and challenging benchmark, dubbed as VLRMBench, encompassing 12,634 questions. VLRMBench is constructed based on three distinct types of datasets, covering mathematical reasoning, hallucination understanding, and multi-image understanding. We design 12 tasks across three major categories, focusing on evaluating VLRMs in the aspects of process understanding, outcome judgment, and critique generation. Extensive experiments are conducted on 21 open-source models and 5 advanced closed-source models, highlighting the challenges posed by VLRMBench.

    "abstract": "Vision-language models (VLMs) are prone to object hal- lucinations, where they erroneously indicate the presence of certain objects in an image. Existing benchmarks quantify hallucinations using relatively small, labeled datasets. However, this approach is i) insufficient to assess hallucinations that arise in open-world settings, where VLMs are widely used, and ii) inadequate for detecting systematic errors in VLMs. We propose DASH (Detection and Assess- ment of Systematic Hallucinations), an automatic, large-scale pipeline designed to identify systematic hallucinations of VLMs on real-world images in an open-world setting. A key component is DASH-OPT for image-based retrieval, where we optimize over the \"natural image manifold\" to generate images that mislead the VLM. The output of DASH consists of clusters of real and semantically similar images for which the VLM hallucinates an object. We apply DASH to PaliGemma and two LLaVA-NeXT models across 380 object classes and, in total, find more than 19k clusters with 950k images. We study the transfer of the identified systematic hallucinations to other VLMs and show that fine-tuning PaliGemma with the model-specific images obtained with DASH mitigates object hallucinations",

    "abstract": "Model merging has emerged as a promising approach for multi-task learning (MTL) in large language models (LLMs), providing a training- and data-efficient alternative to conventional fine-tuning. However, with the rapid development of the open-source AI ecosystem and the increasing availability of fine-tuned LLMs, existing model merging methods face two key limitations: (i) they are primarily designed for in-house fine-tuned models, making them less adaptable to diverse model sources with partially unknown model and task information, (ii) they struggle to scale effectively when merging numerous model checkpoints.To address these challenges, we formulate model merging as a constrained optimization problem and introduce a novel approach: Frank-Wolfe Merging (FW-Merging). Inspired by the Frank-Wolfe optimization, our approach iteratively selects the most relevant model parameters to minimize a linear approximation of the objective function, merging them through a predefined merging function. The objective function is designed to capture the desired behavior of the target merged model, while the fine-tuned candidate models defines the constraint set.More importantly, FW-Merging serves as an orthogonal technique to existing merging methods, seamlessly integrating with them to further enhance performance.Our experiments show that FW-Merging scales across diverse model sources, remaining stable with 16 irrelevant models and improving by 15.3% with 16 relevant models on 20 CV tasks, all while maintaining constant memory overhead--unlike the linear overhead of data-informed methods.Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, FW-Merging surpasses the data-free merging method by 32.8% and outperforms the data-informed Adamerging by 8.39% when merging 20 ViT models.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the recently emerged problem of Language-assisted Image Clustering (LaIC), where textual semantics are leveraged to improve the discriminability of visual representations to facilitate image clustering. Due to the unavailability of true class names, one of core challenges of LaIC lies in how to filter positive nouns, i.e., those semantically close to the images of interest, from unlabeled wild corpus data. Existing filtering strategies are predominantly based on the off-the-shelf feature space learned by CLIP; however, despite being intuitive, these strategies lack a rigorous theoretical foundation. To fill this gap, we propose a novel gradient-based framework, termed as GradNorm, which is theoretically guaranteed and shows strong empirical performance. In particular, we measure the positiveness of each noun based on the magnitude of gradients back-propagated from the cross-entropy between the predicted target distribution and the softmax output. Theoretically, we provide a rigorous error bound to quantify the separability of positive nouns by GradNorm and prove that GradNorm naturally subsumes existing filtering strategies as extremely special cases of itself. Empirically, extensive experiments show that GradNorm achieves the state-of-the-art clustering performance on various benchmarks",

    "abstract": "The efficiency of large vision-language models (LVLMs) is constrained by the computational bottleneck of the attention mechanism during the prefill phase and the memory bottleneck of fetching the key-value (KV) cache in the decoding phase, particularly in scenarios involving high-resolution images or videos. Visual content often exhibits substantial redundancy, resulting in highly sparse attention maps within LVLMs. This sparsity can be leveraged to accelerate attention computation or compress the KV cache through various approaches. However, most studies focus on addressing only one of these bottlenecks and do not adequately support dynamic adjustment of sparsity concerning distinct layers or tasks. In this paper, we present ZipVL, an efficient inference framework designed for LVLMs through a dynamic ratio allocation strategy of important tokens. This ratio is adaptively determined based on the layer-specific distribution of attention scores, rather than fixed hyper-parameters, thereby improving efficiency for less complex tasks while maintaining high performance for more challenging ones. Then we select important tokens based on their normalized attention scores and perform sparse attention mechanism solely on those important tokens, reducing the latency in the prefill phase. Tokens deemed less important will be discarded to reduce KV cache size, alleviating the memory bottleneck in the decoding phase. Our experiments demonstrate that ZipVL can accelerate the prefill phase by 2.3x and improve decoding throughput by 2.8x, with a minimal accuracy reduction of only 0.5% on VQAv2 benchmark over LLaVA-Next-13B model, effectively enhancing the generation efficiency of LVLMs",

Existing approaches to OVMOT often merge OVD and MOT methodologies as separate modules, not fully leveraging the video information.

The method reduces to solving a system of linear equations, enabling an efficient algebraic least-squares solution. It requires only two local scales and two local orientations, which can be extracted from, e.g., SIFT features. Unlike prior approaches, our method does not impose restrictions on individual features, does not require class segmentation, and makes no assumptions about feature interrelations. It is compatible with any feature detector that provides local scale or orientation. Furthermore, combining scaled and oriented points with line segments yields a highly robust algorithm that outperforms baselines.

However, their sequential nature leads to long inference times, limiting their practical scalability. In this work, we introduce Grouped Speculative Decoding (GSD), a novel, training-free acceleration method for AR image models. While recent studies have explored Speculative Decoding (SD) as a means to speed up AR image generation, existing approaches either provide only modest acceleration or require additional training. Our in-depth analysis reveals a fundamental difference between language and image tokens: image tokens exhibit inherent redundancy and diversity, meaning multiple tokens can convey valid semantics. However, traditional SD methods are designed to accept only a single most-likley token, which fails to leverage this difference, leading to excessive false-negative rejections. To address this, we propose a new SD strategy that evaluates clusters of visually valid tokens rather than relying on a single target token. Additionally, we observe that static clustering based on embedding distance is ineffective, which motivates our dynamic GSD approach. Extensive experiments show that GSD accelerates AR image models by an average of 3.7x while preserving image quality--all without requiring any additional training",

In real-world scenarios, models on different vehicles are often heterogeneous due to manufacturer variations.

However, these methods are impractical in real-world applications, as each new collaborator must undergo joint training with the ego vehicle on a dataset before inference, or the ego vehicle stores models for all potential collaborators in advance. Therefore, we pose a new question: Can we tackle this challenge directly during inference, eliminating the need for joint training? To answer this, we introduce Progressive Heterogeneous Collaborative Perception (PHCP), a novel framework that formulates the problem as few-shot unsupervised domain adaptation. Unlike previous work, PHCP dynamically aligns features by self-training an adapter during inference, eliminating the need for labeled data and joint training. Extensive experiments on the OPV2V dataset demonstrate that PHCP achieves strong performance across diverse heterogeneous scenarios.

Instead, they typically learn to translate an input image into its diffuse image (and specular residue image). As a result, their performance remains somewhat limited. To overcome these limitations, we propose a neural DRM solver for specular highlight removal. Our pipeline consists of three networks: Highlight Detection Network (HDNet), Alpha-Chrom Estimation Network (ACENet), and Refinement Network (RNet). Specifically, HDNet is first used to detect specular highlights. Meanwhile, guided by multi-level contextual contrasted features from HDNet, ACENet estimates the DRM variables.

As such, MatchDiffusion is the first method for match-cut generation. Our method leverages an inherent property of diffusion models, whereby the early denoising steps determine the broad appearance of the scene, while the latter steps add details. Motivated by this property, MatchDiffusion first performs \"Joint Diffusion\", by initializing generation for two prompts from a shared noise sample, and following a shared denoising path for the first denoising steps.This process results in the two videos sharing structural and motion characteristics. After Joint Diffusion, we then conduct \"Disjoint Diffusion\", allowing the videos' denoising paths to diverge and introduce their unique details. MatchDiffusion thus yields visually coherent videos that are amenable to match-cuts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through user studies and metrics, showing its potential to democratize match-cut creation",

In this work, we introduce event camera to compensate for frame camera, and propose a spatiotemporal-disentangled Gaussian splatting framework for high-dynamic scene reconstruction. As for dynamic scene, we figure out that background and objects have appearance discrepancy in frame-based spatial features and motion discrepancy in event-based temporal features, which motivates us to distinguish the spatiotemporal features between background and objects via clustering. As for dynamic object, we discover that Gaussian representations and event data share the consistent spatiotemporal characteristic, which could serve as a prior to guide the spatiotemporal disentanglement of object Gaussians.

However, variations in staining and scanning can introduce semantic bias, while topological subgraphs that are not relevant to the causal relationships can create noise, resulting in biased slide-level representations. These issues can hinder both the interpretability and generalization of the analysis. To tackle this, we introduce a dual structural causal model as the theoretical foundation and propose a novel and interpretable dual causal graph-based MIL model, C2MIL. C2MIL incorporates a novel cross-scale adaptive feature disentangling module for semantic causal intervention and a new Bernoulli differentiable causal subgraph sampling method for topological causal discovery. A joint optimization strategy combining disentangling supervision and contrastive learning enables simultaneous refinement of both semantic and topological causalities. Experiments demonstrate that C2MIL consistently improves generalization and interpretability over existing methods and can serve as a causal enhancement for diverse MIL baselines.

    "abstract": "Establishing dense correspondences across image pairs is essential for tasks such as shape reconstruction and robot manipulation. In the challenging setting of matching across different categories, the function of an object, i.e., the effect that an object can cause on other objects, can guide how correspondences should be established. This is because object parts that enable specific functions often share similarities in shape and appearance. We derive the definition of dense functional correspondence based on this observation and propose a weakly-supervised learning paradigm to tackle the prediction task. The main insight behind our approach is that we can leverage vision-language models to pseudo-label multi-view images to obtain functional parts. We then integrate this with dense contrastive learning from pixel correspondences to distill both functional and spatial knowledge into a new model that can establish dense functional correspondence. Further, we curate synthetic and real evaluation datasets as task benchmarks. Our results demonstrate the advantages of our approach over baseline solutions consisting of off-the-shelf self-supervised image representations and grounded vision language models",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Multi-person motion prediction becomes particularly challenging when handling highly interactive scenarios involving extreme motions. Previous works focused more on the case of `moderate' motions (e.g., walking together), where predicting each pose in isolation often yields reasonable results. However, these approaches fall short in modeling extreme motions like lindy-hop dances, as they require a more comprehensive understanding of cross-person dependencies. To bridge this gap, we introduce Proxy-bridged Game Transformer (PGformer), a Transformer-based foundation model that captures the interactions driving extreme multi-person motions. PGformer incorporates a novel cross-query attention module to learn bidirectional dependencies between pose sequences and a proxy unit that subtly controls bidirectional spatial information flow. We evaluated PGformer on the challenging ExPI dataset, which involves large collaborative movements. Both quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the superiority of PGformer in both short- and long-term predictions. We also test the proposed method on moderate movement datasets CMU-Mocap and MuPoTS-3D, generalizing PGformer to scenarios with more than two individuals with promising results.

We first build a multi-condition image stylization framework based on the text-to-image generation model. Then, to drive it, we develop a fine-grained decoupling mechanism to implicitly separate the attributes from the image. Finally, we design a gated feature injection mechanism to adaptively regulate the importance of multiple attributes. To support the above procedure, we also build a dataset with fine-grained styles.

    "abstract": "Few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) aims to segment objects of novel categories in the query images given only a few annotated support samples. Existing methods primarily build the image-level correlation between the support target object and the entire query image. However, this correlation contains the hard pixel noise, i.e., irrelevant background objects, that is intractable to trace and suppress, leading to the overfitting of the background. To address the limitation of this correlation, we imitate the biological vision process to identify novel objects in the object-level information. Target identification in the general objects is more valid than in the entire image, especially in the low-data regime. Inspired by this, we design an Object-level Correlation Network (OCNet) by establishing the object-level correlation between the support target object and query general objects, which is mainly composed of the General Object Mining Module (GOMM) and Correlation Construction Module (CCM). Specifically, GOMM constructs the query general object feature by learning saliency and high-level similarity cues, where the general objects include the irrelevant background objects and the target foreground object. Then, CCM establishes the object-level correlation by allocating the target prototypes to match the general object feature. The generated object-level correlation can mine the query target feature and suppress the hard pixel noise for the final prediction.

Recently launched satellites can concurrently acquire HSIs and panchromatic (PAN) images, enabling the restoration of HSIs to generate clean and high-resolution imagery through fusing PAN images for denoising and super-resolution. However, previous studies treated these two tasks as independent processes, resulting in accumulated errors. This paper introduces Hyperspectral Image Joint Pandenoising and Pansharpening (Hipandas), a novel learning paradigm that reconstructs high quality HSIs from noisy low-resolution HSIs (NLRHS) and high-resolution PAN images. The proposed unsupervised Hipandas framework consists of a guided denoising network, a guided super-resolution network, and a PAN reconstruction network, utilizing an HSI low-rank prior and a newly introduced detail-oriented low-rank prior. The interconnection of these networks complicates the training process, necessitating a two-stage training strategy to ensure effective training. Experimental results on both simulated and real-world datasets indicate that the proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art algorithms, yielding more accurate and visually pleasing HRHS images.

Our empirical observations show that SAM effectively mitigates task conflicts in MTL. Motivated by these findings, we explore integrating SAM into MTL but face two key challenges. On one hand, both the average loss gradient and individual task gradients--referred to as global and local information--contribute to SAM, but how to combine them remains unclear. On the other hand, directly computing each task gradient introduces significant computational and memory overheads.

    "abstract": "Adversarial attack plays a critical role in evaluating the robustness of deep learning models. Jacobian-based Saliency Map Attack (JSMA) is an interpretable adversarial method that offers excellent pixel-level control and provides valuable insights into model vulnerabilities. However, its quadratic computational complexity O(M^2 xN) renders it impractical for large-scale datasets, limiting its application despite its inherent value. This paper proposes FastJSMA, an efficient attack method that addresses these computational limitations. Our approach introduces a gradient decoupling mechanism that decomposes the Jacobian calculation into complementary class suppression (g^-) and class excitation (g^+) gradients, reducing complexity to O(M\\sqrt N ). Additionally, we implement a class probing mechanism and an adaptive saliency threshold to further optimize the process. Experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate that FastJSMA maintains comparable attack success rates while dramatically reducing computation time--requiring only 2.9% of JSMA's processing time on CIFAR-10 and 1.2% on CIFAR-100, and successfully operating on ImageNet where traditional JSMA fails due to memory constraints. This advancement enables the practical application of interpretable saliency map-based attacks on large-scale datasets, balancing effectiveness with computational efficiency",

However, existing methods struggle with accurately modeling scenes affected by transient objects, leading to artifacts in the rendered images. We identify that the Gaussian densification process, while enhancing scene detail capture, unintentionally contributes to these artifacts by growing additional Gaussians that model transient disturbances. To address this, we propose RobustSplat, a robust solution based on two critical designs. First, we introduce a delayed Gaussian growth strategy that prioritizes optimizing static scene structure before allowing Gaussian splitting/cloning, mitigating overfitting to transient objects in early optimization. Second, we design a scale-cascaded mask bootstrapping approach that first leverages lower-resolution feature similarity supervision for reliable initial transient mask estimation, taking advantage of its stronger semantic consistency and robustness to noise, and then progresses to high-resolution supervision to achieve more precise mask prediction.

    "title": "Generalized Deep Multi-view Clustering via Causal Learning with Partially Aligned Cross-view Correspondence",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Multi-view clustering (MVC) aims to explore the common clustering structure across multiple views. Many existing MVC methods heavily rely on the assumption of view consistency, where alignments for corresponding samples across different views are ordered in advance. However, real-world scenarios often present a challenge as only partial data is consistently aligned across different views, restricting the overall clustering performance. In this work, we consider the model performance decreasing phenomenon caused by data order shift (i.e., from fully to partially aligned) as a generalized multi-view clustering problem. To tackle this problem, we design a causal multi-view clustering network, termed CauMVC. We adopt a causal modeling approach to understand multi-view clustering procedure. To be specific, we formulate the partially aligned data as an intervention and multi-view clustering with partially aligned data as an post-intervention inference. However, obtaining invariant features directly can be challenging. Thus, we design a Variational Auto-Encoder for causal learning by incorporating an encoder from existing information to estimate the invariant features. Moreover, a decoder is designed to perform the post-intervention inference. Lastly, we design a contrastive regularizer to capture sample correlations. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first work to deal generalized multi-view clustering via causal learning. Empirical experiments on both fully and partially aligned data illustrate the strong generalization and effectiveness of CauMVC",

    "title": "MeasureXpert: Automatic Anthropometric Measurement Extraction from Two Unregistered, Partial, Posed, and Dressed Body Scans",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "While automatic anthropometric measurement extraction has witnessed growth in recent years, effective, non-contact, and precise measurement methods for dressed humans in arbitrary poses are still lacking, limiting the widespread application of this technology. The occlusion caused by clothing and the adverse influence of posture on body shape significantly increase the complexity of this task. Additionally, current methods often assume the availability of a complete 3D body mesh in a canonical pose (e.g., \"A\" or \"T\" pose), which is not always the case in practice. To address these challenges, we propose MeasureXpert, a novel learning-based model that requires only two unregistered, partial, and dressed body scans as input, and accommodates entirely independent and arbitrary poses for each scan. MeasureXpert computes a comprehensive representation of the naked body shape by synergistically fusing features from the front- and back-view partial point clouds. The comprehensive representation obtained is mapped onto a 3D undressed body shape space, assuming a canonical posture and incorporating predefined measurement landmarks. A point-based offset optimization is also developed to refine the reconstructed complete body shape, enabling accurate regression of measurement values. To train the proposed model, a new large-scale dataset, consisting of 300K samples, was synthesized. The proposed model was validated using two publicly available real-world datasets and was compared with different relevant methods. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that MeasureXpert achieves superior performance compared to the reference methods. The code and dataset are available at: MeasureXpertProject",

    "abstract": "Neural fields provide a memory-efficient representation of data, which can effectively handle diverse modalities and large-scale data. However, learning to map neural fields often requires large amounts of training data and computations, which can be limited to resource-constrained edge devices. One approach to tackle this limitation is to leverage Federated Meta-Learning (FML), but traditional FML approaches suffer from privacy leakage. To address these issues, we introduce a novel FML approach called FedMeNF. FedMeNF utilizes a new privacy-preserving loss function that regulates privacy leakage in the local meta-optimization. This enables the local meta-learner to optimize quickly and efficiently without retaining the client's private data. Our experiments demonstrate that FedMeNF achieves fast optimization speed and robust reconstruction performance, even with few-shot or non-IID data across diverse data modalities, while preserving client data privacy",

    "abstract": "Single domain generalization aims to learn a model with good generalization ability from a single source domain. Recent advances in this field have focused on increasing the diversity of the training data through style (e.g., color and texture) augmentation. However, most existing methods apply uniform perturbations to the entire image, failing to simulate complex images with multiple distinct stylistic regions. To address this, we propose a \"Split-And-Combine\" (SAC) strategy to enhance style diversity. Specifically, SAC first performs patch-aware augmentation, which splits an image into multiple patches and applies style augmentation independently to each patch, enabling distinct color variations across regions. Then, SAC combines these patches to reconstruct a complete image and applies adaptive random convolutions, which utilizes a deformable convolution layer with random and Gaussian filters to enhance texture diversity while preserving object integrity. Notably, SAC leverages entropy as a risk assessment criterion to adaptively determine whether a sample should undergo augmentation within the iterative process of random convolutions, preventing excessive augmentation. Furthermore, SAC introduces an energy-based distribution discrepancy score to quantify out-of-distribution likelihood, systematically expanding the augmented data's distribution. SAC can serve as a plug-and-play component to improve the performance of recent methods. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SAC",

However, processing long sequences of visual tokens extracted from visual backbones poses challenges for deployment in real-time applications. To address this issue, we introduce FOLDER, a simple yet effective plug-and-play module designed to reduce the length of the visual token sequence, mitigating computational and memory demands during both training and inference. Through a comprehensive analysis of the token reduction process in the vision encoder, we analyze the information loss introduced by different reduction strategies and develop FOLDER to preserve key information while removing visual redundancy. We show the effectiveness of FOLDER by integrating it into the visual backbone of various MLLMs, significantly accelerating the inference phase. Furthermore, we evaluate its utility as a training accelerator or even performance booster for MLLMs. FOLDER achieves comparable or even better performance than the original models, while dramatically reducing complexity by removing up to 70% of visual tokens.

Here, we propose Hyperdimensional One Place Signatures (HOPS) to simultaneously improve the performance, compute and scalability of these state-of-the-art approaches by fusing the descriptors from multiple reference sets captured under different conditions. HOPS scales to any number of environmental conditions by leveraging the Hyperdimensional Computing framework. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach is highly generalizable and consistently improves recall performance across all evaluated VPR methods and datasets by large margins.

We employ this framework to analyze the LLaVA-NeXT-8B model using the LLaVA-OV-72B model, demonstrating that these features can effectively steer the model's behavior. Our results contribute to a deeper understanding of why LMMs excel in specific tasks, including EQ tests, and illuminate the nature of their mistakes along with potential strategies for their rectification. These findings offer new insights into the internal mechanisms of LMMs and suggest parallels with the cognitive processes of the human brain",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Latent diffusion models have demonstrated superior performance over traditional methods in generating highly detailed and aesthetically pleasing images, which makes them widely used for various image generation and editing tasks, including outpainting. However, most LDM-based outpainting methods impose constraints on resolution and aspect ratio, often leading to the loss of local details and blurring. One way to address these issues is progressive outpainting, where the image is extended outward incrementally. However, naive progressive outpainting suffers from two key challenges: (1) difficulty in effectively capturing global context, making it hard to maintain the original context, and (2) a tendency to generate unnatural patterns. These challenges are particularly pronounced in art, where artists pre-design the composition before painting. As a result, existing methods often introduce visual inconsistencies that distract the viewer and diminish the intended artistic emphasis. To address these limitations, we propose two types of composition planning modules that enhance progressive outpainting by leveraging global structural guidance. These modules guide a pre-trained stable diffusion model to consider the overall composition, enabling realistic and contextually appropriate artwork completion without labor-intensive user prompts. Through experiments on diverse artwork images, we show the effectiveness of our proposed method both quantitatively and qualitatively",

However, the assumption that VLMs provide visually grounded and reliable driving explanations remains unexamined. To address this, we introduce DriveBench, a benchmark evaluating 12 VLMs across 17 settings, covering 19,200 images, 20,498 QA pairs, and four key driving tasks. Our findings reveal that VLMs often generate plausible responses from general knowledge or textual cues rather than true visual grounding, especially under degraded or missing visual inputs. This behavior, concealed by dataset imbalances and insufficient evaluation metrics, poses significant risks in safety-critical scenarios like autonomous driving. We further observe that VLMs possess inherent corruption-awareness but only explicitly acknowledge these issues when directly prompted. Given the challenges and inspired by the inherent corruption awareness, we propose Robust Agentic Utilization (RAU), leveraging VLMs' corruption awareness and agentic planning with external tools to enhance perception reliability for downstream tasks.

    "abstract": "Domain randomization through synthesis is a powerful strategy to train networks that are unbiased with respect to the domain of the input images. Randomization allows networks to see a virtually infinite range of intensities and artifacts during training, thereby minimizing overfitting to appearance and maximizing generalization to unseen data. Although powerful, this approach relies on the accurate tuning of a large set of hyperparameters that govern the probabilistic distribution of the synthesized images. Instead of manually tuning these parameters, we introduce Learn2Synth, a novel procedure in which synthesis parameters are learned using a small set of real labeled data. Unlike methods that impose constraints to align synthetic data with real data (e.g., contrastive or adversarial techniques), which risk misaligning the image and its label map, we tune an augmentation engine such that a segmentation network trained on synthetic data has optimal accuracy when applied to real data. This approach allows the training procedure to benefit from real labeled examples, without ever using these real examples to train the segmentation network, which avoids biasing the network towards the properties of the training set. Specifically, we develop parametric and nonparametric strategies to enhance synthetic images in a way that improves the performance of the segmentation network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this learning strategy on synthetic and real-world brain scans. Code is available at: https://github.com/HuXiaoling/Learn2Synth",

To this end, we train a conditional Large Reconstruction Model (LRM) for masked reconstruction, using multi-view consistent masks rendered from a randomly generated 3D occlusion, and using one clean viewpoint as the conditional signal. During inference, we manually define a 3D region to edit and provide an edited image from a canonical viewpoint to fill that region. We demonstrate that, in just a single forward pass, our method not only preserves the input geometry in the unmasked region through reconstruction capabilities on par with SoTA, but is also expressive enough to perform a variety of mesh edits from a single image guidance that past works struggle with, while being 2-10 times faster than the top-performing prior work",

Compared to prior multiview generative models that require per-scene optimization for 3D reconstruction, Bolt3D reduces the inference cost by a factor of 300 times.

Recent methods explored fusion-based approaches, where a neural network linearly blends multiple sRGB versions of an input image, each processed with predefined WB presets. However, we demonstrate that these methods are suboptimal for common multi-illuminant scenarios. Additionally, existing fusion-based methods rely on sRGB WB datasets lacking dedicated multi-illuminant images, limiting both training and evaluation. To address these challenges, we introduce two key contributions. First, we propose an efficient transformer-based model that effectively captures spatial dependencies across sRGB WB presets, substantially improving upon linear fusion techniques. Second, we introduce a large-scale multi-illuminant dataset comprising over 16,000 sRGB images rendered with five different WB settings, along with WB-corrected images. Our method achieves up to 100% improvement over existing techniques on our new multi-illuminant image fusion dataset. We will release our code and dataset upon acceptance",

Previous methods for geometric assembly typically rely on aligning parts by finding identical surfaces between the parts as in conventional shape matching and registration. Specifically, we explicitly model two distinct properties of interlocking shapes: 'identical surface shape' and 'opposite volume occupancy.' Our method thus learns to establish correspondences across regions where their surface shapes appear identical but their volumes occupy the inverted space to each other. To facilitate this process, we also learn to align regions in rotation by estimating their shape orientations via equivariant neural networks. The proposed approach significantly reduces local ambiguities in matching and allows a robust combination of parts in assembly.

    "abstract": "Fusing and balancing multi-modal inputs from novel sensors for dense prediction tasks, particularly semantic segmentation, is critically important yet remains a significant challenge. One major limitation is the tendency of multi-modal frameworks to over-rely on easily learnable modalities, a phenomenon referred to as unimodal dominance or bias. This issue becomes especially problematic in real-world scenarios where the dominant modality may be unavailable, resulting in severe performance degradation. To this end, we apply a simple but effective plug-and-play regularization term based on functional entropy, which introduces no additional parameters or modules. This term is designed to intuitively balance the contribution of each visual modality to the segmentation results. Specifically, we leverage the log-Sobolev inequality to bound functional entropy using functional-Fisher-information. By maximizing the information contributed by each visual modality, our approach mitigates unimodal dominance and establishes a more balanced and robust segmentation framework. A multi-scale regularization module is proposed to apply our proposed plug-and-paly term on high-level features and also segmentation predictions for more balanced multi-modal learning. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves superior performance, i.e., +13.94%, +3.25% and +3.64%, without introducing any additional parameters",

    "abstract": "How can we benefit from large models without sacrificing inference speed, a common dilemma in self-driving systems? A prevalent solution is a dual-system architecture, employing a small model for rapid, reactive decisions and a larger model for slower but more informative analyses. Existing dual-system designs often implement parallel architectures where inference is either directly conducted using the large model at each current frame or retrieved from previously stored inference results. However, these works still struggle to enable large models for a timely response to every online frame. Our key insight is to shift intensive computations of the current frame to previous time steps and perform a batch inference of multiple time steps to make large models respond promptly to each time step. To achieve the shifting, we introduce Efficiency through Thinking Ahead (ETA), an asynchronous system designed to: (1) propagate informative features from the past to the current frame using future predictions from the large model, (2) extract current frame features using a small model for real-time responsiveness, and (3) integrate these dual features via an action mask mechanism that emphasizes action-critical image regions.

This restricts their applicability in diverse Earth observation scenarios. To address this, we introduce open-vocabulary (OV) learning for remote sensing instance segmentation. While current OV segmentation models perform well on natural image datasets, their direct application to remote sensing faces challenges such as diverse landscapes, seasonal variations, and the presence of small or ambiguous objects in aerial imagery. To overcome these challenges, we propose SCORE (Scene Context matters in Open-vocabulary REmote sensing instance segmentation), a framework that integrates multi-granularity scene context, i.e., regional context and global context, to enhance both visual and textual representations. Specifically, we introduce Region-Aware Integration, which refines class embeddings with regional context to improve object distinguishability. Additionally, we propose Global Context Adaptation, which enriches naive text embeddings with remote sensing global context, creating a more adaptable and expressive linguistic latent space for the classifier. We establish new benchmarks for OV remote sensing instance segmentation across diverse datasets.

Moreover, current approaches focus solely on producing static structures, where individual components remain non-movable, without considering functional applications in the generation process.

Leveraging a reorganized high-quality 3D dataset, we train a Diffusion model and a semantic segmentation model tailored for 3D generation tasks. Additionally, we design a motion-driven mechanism to introduce action sequences for functionally interactive modules after model fusion.

While previous approaches have explored using general-purpose large language models to generate these query sets, they rely on prompt engineering heuristics and often yield suboptimal query sets, resulting in a performance gap between IP and non-interpretable black-box predictors. In this work, we propose parameterizing IP queries as a learnable dictionary defined in the latent space of vision-language models such as CLIP.

Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) reduce this cost by introducing low-rank matrices for tuning fewer parameters. While LoRA allows for efficient fine-tuning, it requires significant data for adaptation, making Federated Learning (FL) an appealing solution due to its privacy-preserving collaborative framework. However, combining LoRA with FL introduces two key challenges: the Server-Side Aggregation Bias, where server-side averaging of LoRA matrices diverges from the ideal global update, and the Client-Side Initialization Lag, emphasizing the need for consistent initialization across rounds. Existing approaches address these challenges individually, limiting their effectiveness.

Concretely, the first stage targets developing a robust artifact detector, for which we collect a dataset of over 1M flawed synthesized images and set up an efficient human-in-the-loop annotation process, incorporating a carefully designed class-balance strategy.

To address this limitation, we present Activation-Informed Low-Rank Adaptation (AIRA), a novel approach that integrates activation information into initialization, training, and rank assignment to enhance model performance. Specifically, AIRA introduces: (1) Outlier-weighted SVD decomposition to reduce approximation errors in low-rank weight initialization, (2) Outlier-driven dynamic rank assignment using offline optimization for better layer-wise adaptation, and (3) Activation-informed training to amplify updates on significant weights. This cascaded activation-informed paradigm enables faster convergence and fewer fine-tuned parameters while maintaining high performance.

We further improve the performance by enriching the representation of text prompts by injecting visual embeddings of the personal concept into them.

However, due to the scarcity of large-scale 3D data, it is still hard to extract a universal 3D representation from web datasets. Instead, we are seeking a general visual pre-training framework that could improve all 3D representations as an alternative. Our framework, called FVP, is a novel 4D Visual Pre-training framework for real-world robot learning. FVP frames the visual pre-training objective as a next-point-cloud-prediction problem, models the prediction model as a diffusion model, and pre-trains the model on the larger public datasets directly. Across twelve real-world manipulation tasks, FVP boosts the average success rate of 3D Diffusion Policy (DP3) for these tasks by 28%. The FVP pre-trained DP3 achieves state-of-the-art performance across imitation learning methods. Moreover, the efficacy of \\ours adapts across various point cloud encoders and datasets.

    "abstract": "Textured 3D morphing creates smooth and plausible interpolation sequences between two 3D objects, focusing on transitions in both shape and texture. This is important for creative applications like visual effects in filmmaking. Previous methods rely on establishing point-to-point correspondences and determining smooth deformation trajectories, which inherently restrict them to shape-only morphing on untextured, topologically aligned datasets. This restriction leads to labor-intensive preprocessing and poor generalization. To overcome these challenges, we propose a method for 3D regenerative morphing using a 3D diffusion prior. Unlike previous methods that depend on explicit correspondences and deformations, our method eliminates the additional need for obtaining correspondence and uses the 3D diffusion prior to generate morphing. Specifically, we first introduce a 3D diffusion model and interpolate the source and target information at three levels: initial noise, model parameters, and condition features. We then explore an Attention Fusion strategy to generate smoother morphing sequences. To further improve the plausibility of semantic interpolation and the generated 3D surfaces, we propose two strategies: (a) Token Reordering, where we match approximate tokens based on semantic analysis to guide implicit correspondences in the denoising process of the diffusion model, and (b) Low-Frequency Enhancement, where we enhance low-frequency signals in the tokens to improve the quality of generated surfaces. Experimental results show that our method achieves superior smoothness and plausibility in 3D morphing across diverse cross-category object pairs, offering a novel regenerative method for 3D morphing with textured representations",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in multi-view scene reconstruction have been significant, yet existing methods face limitations when processing streams of input images. These methods either rely on time-consuming offline optimization or are restricted to shorter sequences, hindering their applicability in real-time scenarios. In this work, we propose LONG3R (LOng sequence streamiNG 3D Reconstruction), a novel model designed for streaming multi-view 3D scene reconstruction over longer sequences. Our model achieves real-time processing by operating recurrently, maintaining and updating memory with each new observation. We first employ a memory gating mechanism to filter relevant memory, which, together with a new observation, is fed into a dual-source refined decoder for coarse-to-fine interaction. To effectively capture long-sequence memory, we propose a 3D spatio-temporal memory that dynamically prunes redundant spatial information while adaptively adjusting resolution along the scene. To enhance our model's performance on long sequences while maintaining training efficiency, we employ a two-stage curriculum training strategy, each stage targeting specific capabilities. Experiments demonstrate that LONG3R outperforms state-of-the-art streaming methods, particularly for longer sequences, while maintaining real-time inference speed.

In this paper, we propose Blind2Sound, a simple yet effective approach to overcome residual noise in denoised images. The proposed adaptive re-visible loss senses noise levels and performs personalized denoising without noise residues while retaining the signal lossless. The theoretical analysis of intermediate medium gradients guarantees stable training, while the Cramer Gaussian loss acts as a regularization to facilitate the accurate perception of noise levels and improve the performance of the denoiser.

In this paper, a novel Sparse Optimization (SO) framework is proposed. Unlike low-rank approaches that typically constrain updates to a fixed subspace, our SO method leverages high sparsity to dynamically adjust very few parameters. We introduce two key paradigms. First, we advocate for local sparsity and global density, which updates a minimal subset of parameters per iteration while maintaining overall model expressiveness. As a second paradigm, we advocate for local randomness and global importance, which sparsifies the gradient using random selection while pruning the first moment based on importance. This combination significantly mitigates overfitting and ensures stable adaptation in low-data regimes.

While multi-scale features are perceptually critical for MDE, existing transformer-based methods have yet to leverage them explicitly. To address this limitation, we propose a hypergraph-based multi-scale representation fusion framework, Hyper-Depth.The proposed Hyper-Depth incorporates two key components: a Semantic Consistency Enhancement (SCE) module and a Geometric Consistency Constraint (GCC) module. The SCE module, designed based on hypergraph convolution, aggregates global information and enhances the representation of multi-scale patch features. Meanwhile, the GCC module provides geometric guidance to reduce over-fitting errors caused by excessive reliance on local features. In addition, we introduce a Correlation-based Conditional Random Fields (C-CRFs) module as the decoder to filter correlated patches and compute attention weights more effectively.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across all evaluation metrics on the KITTI and NYU-Depth-v2 datasets, achieving improvements of 6.21% and 3.32% on the main metric RMSE, respectively.

However, Mamba models struggle with structured 2D visual data using sequential computing, thereby lagging behind their attention-based counterparts. In this paper, we propose a Parallel Vision Mamba (PVMamba), a novel SSM architecture tailored for visual data. PVMamba encompasses two key designs: 1) Based on the sparsity and adjacency of visual signals, we parallelize the sequential computing through three core steps, termed Dynamic State Aggregation (DSA), i.e., parallelization, alignment, and aggregation. DSA generates the hidden state in SSM by a feasible spatial aggregation, thereby overcoming the inherent sequential constraints. 2) Along with maintaining linear computational complexity, we apply a dynamic operator to learn the spatial samplings for each hidden state. To further boost the local modeling capability, we restrict the dynamic operator to the neighboring pixels in shallow layers. We also devise a layer multiplexing technique to stabilize the training and reduce the learning redundancy. PVMamba is a versatile backbone network with dynamic operators for various vision tasks, such as image classification and dense prediction.

Prior methods have sought to mitigate this issue by adjusting model logits to reduce linguistic bias, but they often lack precise control over visual uncertainty, sometimes exacerbating hallucinations instead of mitigating them. To address this limitation, we propose a novel decoding strategy called fuzzy contrastive decoding (FuzzyCD) that uses Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy inference to refine hallucination control. FuzzyCD adaptively assigns weights to high-hallucination logits while mitigating unnecessary linguistic bias. Specifically, it transforms the log-probabilities of top-1 tokens from both standard and hallucination logits into a confidence linguistic fuzzy set. Through Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy inference, it dynamically adjusts hallucination logits to prevent the model from over-relying on spurious linguistic patterns. Experimental results on object hallucination datasets demonstrate that hallucination is mitigated by 11%p compared to conventional LVLMs. In-depth analyses highlight the effectiveness of FuzzyCD in enhancing the reliability of vision-language models",

In contrast, recent deep learning models, whether task-specific or foundational, are often specific to single sensors or to fixed combinations: adapting such models to different sensory inputs requires both architectural changes and re-training, limiting scalability and generalization across multiple RS sensors. On the contrary, a single model able to modulate its feature representations to accept diverse sensors as input would pave the way to agile and flexible multi-sensor RS data processing. To address this, we introduce SMARTIES, a generic and versatile foundation model lifting sensor-specific/dependent efforts and enabling scalability and generalization to diverse RS sensors: SMARTIES projects data from heterogeneous sensors into a shared spectrum-aware space, enabling the use of arbitrary combinations of bands both for training and inference. To obtain sensor-agnostic representations, we train a single, unified transformer model reconstructing masked multi-sensor data with cross-sensor token mixup.

Existing methods attribute this problem to the imbalanced learning between modalities and rebalance them through gradient modulation. However, they fail to explain why the dominant modality in multimodal models also underperforms that in unimodal learning. In this work, we reveal the optimization conflict between the modality encoder and modality fusion module in multimodal models. Specifically, we prove that the cross-modal fusion in multimodal models decreases the gradient passed back to each modality encoder compared with unimodal models. Consequently, the performance of each modality in the multimodal model is inferior to that in the unimodal model. To this end, we propose a disentangled gradient learning (DGL) framework to decouple the optimization of the modality encoder and modality fusion module in the multimodal model. DGL truncates the gradient back-propagated from the multimodal loss to the modality encoder and replaces it with the gradient from unimodal loss. Besides, DGL removes the gradient back-propagated from the unimodal loss to the modality fusion module. This helps eliminate the gradient interference between the modality encoder and modality fusion module while ensuring their respective optimization processes. Finally, extensive experiments on multiple types of modalities, tasks, and frameworks with dense cross-modal interaction demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed DGL",

However, without using large-scale datasets for retraining, these models are difficult to adapt to specialized vision tasks, e.g., chart understanding. This problem is caused by a mismatch between pre-training and downstream datasets: pre-training datasets primarily concentrate on scenes and objects but contain limited information about specialized, non-object images, such as charts and tables. In this paper, we share an interesting finding that training an MLLM with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning data can facilitate model adaptation in specialized vision tasks, especially under data-limited regimes. However, we identify a critical issue within CoT data distilled from pre-trained MLLMs, i.e., the data often contains multiple factual errors in the reasoning steps. To address the problem, we propose Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT), a simple bootstrapping-based approach that aims to inject grounding information (i.e., bounding boxes) into CoT data, essentially making the reasoning steps more faithful to input images. We evaluate our approach on five specialized vision tasks, which cover a variety of visual formats including charts, tables, receipts, and reports.

To address these issues, we introduce DisTime, a lightweight framework designed to enhance temporal comprehension in Video-LLMs. DisTime employs a learnable token to create a continuous temporal embedding space and incorporates a Distribution-based Time Decoder that generates temporal probability distributions, effectively mitigating boundary ambiguities and maintaining temporal continuity. Additionally, the Distribution-based Time Encoder re-encodes timestamps to provide time markers for Video-LLMs. To overcome temporal granularity limitations in existing datasets, we propose an automated annotation paradigm that combines the captioning capabilities of Video-LLMs with the localization expertise of dedicated temporal models. This leads to the creation of InternVid-TG, a substantial dataset with 1.25M temporally grounded events across 179k videos, surpassing ActivityNet-Caption by 55 times.

    "abstract": "Recently, Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have emerged as a dominant architecture in video generation, surpassing U-Net-based models in terms of performance. However, the enhanced capabilities of DiTs come with significant drawbacks, including increased computational and memory costs, which hinder their deployment on resource-constrained devices. Current acceleration techniques, such as quantization and cache mechanism, offer limited speedup and are often applied in isolation, failing to fully address the complexities of DiT architectures. In this paper, we propose QuantCache, a novel training-free inference acceleration framework that jointly optimizes hierarchical latent caching, adaptive importance-guided quantization, and structural redundancy-aware pruning. QuantCache achieves an end-to-end latency speedup of 6.72x on Open-Sora with minimal loss in generation quality. Extensive evaluations across multiple video generation benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, setting a new standard for efficient DiT inference. We will release all code and models to facilitate further research",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Human-centric generative models are becoming increasingly popular, giving rise to various innovative tools and applications, such as talking face videos conditioned on text or audio prompts. The core of these capabilities lies in powerful pre-trained foundation models, trained on large-scale, high-quality datasets. However, many advanced methods rely on in-house data subject to various constraints, and other current studies fail to generate high-resolution face videos, which is mainly attributed to the significant lack of large-scale, high-quality face video datasets. In this paper, we introduce a human face video dataset, DH-FaceVid-1K. Our collection spans 1,200 hours in total, encompassing 270,043 video clips from over 20,000 individuals. Each sample includes corresponding speech audio, facial keypoints, and text annotations. Compared to other publicly available datasets, ours distinguishes itself through its multi-ethnic coverage and high-quality, comprehensive individual attributes. We establish multiple face video generation models supporting tasks such as text-to-video and image-to-video generation. In addition, we develop comprehensive benchmarks to validate the scaling law when using different proportions of the proposed dataset. Our primary aim is to contribute a face video dataset, particularly addressing the underrepresentation of Asian faces in existing curated datasets and thereby enriching the global spectrum of face-centric data and mitigating demographic biases.

Recent methods update a visual projector to translate visual information for new tasks, connecting pre-trained vision encoders with large language models. However, such adjustments may cause the models to prioritize visual inputs over language instructions, particularly learning tasks with repetitive types of textual instructions. To address the neglect of language instructions, we propose a novel framework that grounds the translation of visual information on instructions for language models. We introduce a mixture of visual projectors, each serving as a specialized visual-to-language translation expert based on the given instruction context to adapt to new tasks. To avoid using experts for irrelevant instruction contexts, we propose an expert recommendation strategy that reuses experts for tasks similar to those previously learned. Additionally, we introduce expert pruning to alleviate interference from the use of experts that cumulatively activated in previous tasks.

While unsupervised CIS (UCIS) models aim to reduce the heavy reliance on labor-intensive image annotations, they fail to accurately capture cell boundaries, causing missed detections and poor performance. Recognizing the absence of error-free instances as a key limitation, we present COIN (COnfidence score-guided INstance distillation), a novel annotation-free framework with three key steps: (1) Increasing the sensitivity for the presence of error-free instances via unsupervised semantic segmentation with optimal transport, leveraging its ability to discriminate spatially minor instances, (2) Instance-level confidence scoring to measure the consistency between model prediction and refined mask and identify highly confident instances, offering an alternative to ground truth annotations, and (3) Progressive expansion of confidence with recursive self-distillation.

While existing works have attempted cross-category generalization in adaptive articulated object manipulation, two major challenges persist: (1) the geometric diversity of real-world articulated objects complicates visual perception and understanding, and (2) variations in object functions and mechanisms hinder the development of a unified adaptive manipulation strategy.To address these challenges, we propose AdaRPG, a novel framework that leverages foundation models to extract object parts, which exhibit greater local geometric similarity than entire objects, thereby enhancing visual affordance generalization for functional primitive skills. To support this, we construct a part-level affordance annotation dataset to train the affordance model. Additionally, AdaRPG utilizes the common knowledge embedded in foundation models to reason about complex mechanisms and generate high-level control codes that invoke primitive skill functions based on part affordance inference.Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate AdaRPG's strong generalization ability across novel articulated object categories",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Whether snipping with scissors or opening a box, humans can quickly understand the 3D configurations of familiar objects. For novel objects, we can resort to long-form inspection to build intuition. The more we observe the object, the better we get at predicting its 3D state immediately. Existing systems, however, are limited to either optimizing underlying representations from multi-view observations or training a feed-forward predictor from supervised datasets. We introduce Predict-Optimize-Distill (POD), a self-improving framework that interleaves prediction and optimization in a mutually reinforcing cycle to achieve better 4D object understanding with increasing observation time. Given a multi-view object scan and a long-form monocular video of human-object interaction, POD iteratively trains a neural network to predict local part poses from RGB frames, uses this predictor to initialize a global optimization which refines output poses through inverse rendering, then finally distills the results of optimization back into the model by generating synthetic self-labeled training data from novel viewpoints. Each iteration improves both the predictive model and the optimized motion trajectory, creating a virtuous cycle that bootstraps its own training data to learn about the pose configurations of an object. We also introduce a quasi-multiview mining strategy for reducing depth ambiguity by leveraging long video. We evaluate POD on 14 real-world and 5 synthetic objects with various joint types, including revolute and prismatic joints as well as multi-body configurations where parts detach or reattach independently. POD demonstrates significant improvement over a pure optimization baseline which gets stuck in local minima, particularly for longer videos. We also find that POD's performance improves with both video length and successive iterations of the self-improving cycle, highlighting its ability to scale performance with additional observations and compute",

Conversely, optimization-based video methods achieve higher fidelity but demand controlled capture conditions and computationally intensive refinement processes. Motivated by the emergence of large reconstruction models for efficient static reconstruction, we propose LHM (Large Animatable Human Reconstruction Model) to infer high-fidelity avatars represented as 3D Gaussian splatting in a feed-forward pass. Our model leverages a multimodal transformer architecture to effectively encode the human body positional features and image features with attention mechanism, enabling detailed preservation of clothing geometry and texture. To further boost the face identity preservation and fine detail recovery, we propose a head feature pyramid encoding scheme to aggregate multi-scale features of the head regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our LHM generates plausible animatable human in seconds without post-processing for face and hands, outperforming existing methods in both reconstruction accuracy and generalization ability",

In contrast, we propose Graph Spectral Domain Test-Time Adaptation (GSDTTA), a novel approach for 3D point cloud classification that shifts adaptation to the graph spectral domain, enabling more efficient adaptation by capturing global structural properties with fewer parameters. Point clouds in target domain are represented as outlier-aware graphs and transformed into graph spectral domain by Graph Fourier Transform (GFT). For efficiency, adaptation is performed by optimizing only the lowest 10% of frequency components, which capture the majority of the point cloud's energy. An inverse GFT (IGFT) is then applied to reconstruct the adapted point cloud with the graph spectral-driven point shift. This process is enhanced by an eigenmap-guided self-training strategy that iteratively refines both the spectral adjustments and the model parameters. Experimental results and ablation studies on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GSDTTA, outperforming existing TTA methods for 3D point cloud classification",

Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods mitigate this issue by updating only a subset of parameters; however, most existing approaches are task-agnostic, failing to fully exploit task-specific adaptations, which leads to suboptimal efficiency and performance. To address this limitation, we propose Task-Relevant Parameter and Token Selection (TR-PTS), a task-driven framework that enhances both computational efficiency and accuracy. Specifically, we introduce Task-Relevant Parameter Selection, which utilizes the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) to identify and fine-tune only the most informative parameters in a layer-wise manner, while keeping the remaining parameters frozen. Simultaneously, Task-Relevant Token Selection dynamically preserves the most informative tokens and merges redundant ones, reducing computational overhead. By jointly optimizing parameters and tokens, TR-PTS enables the model to concentrate on task-discriminative information. We evaluate TR-PTS on benchmark, including FGVC and VTAB-1k, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing full fine-tuning by 3.40% and 10.35%, respectively.

First, we design spatial states and use them as proxies to preserve spatial dependencies among points. Second, we enhance the SSM with a state-wise update strategy and incorporate a lightweight convolution to facilitate interactions between spatial states for efficient structure modeling. Third, our method reduces the sensitivity of pre-trained Mamba-based models to varying input lengths by introducing a sequence length-adaptive strategy. Experimental results across four downstream tasks showcase the superior performance of our method. In addition, our method attains the SOTA 95.1% accuracy on ModelNet40 and 92.75% accuracy on the most challenging split of ScanObjectNN without voting strategy",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Learning skills in open-world environments is essential for developing agents capable of handling a variety of tasks by combining basic skills. Online demonstration videos are typically long but unsegmented, making them difficult to segment and label with skill identifiers. Unlike existing methods that rely on random splitting or human labeling, we have developed a self-supervised learning-based approach to segment these long videos into a series of semantic-aware and skill-consistent segments. Drawing inspiration from human cognitive event segmentation theory, we introduce Skill Boundary Detection (SBD), an annotation-free temporal video segmentation algorithm. SBD detects skill boundaries in a video by leveraging prediction errors from a pretrained unconditional action-prediction model. This approach is based on the assumption that a significant increase in prediction error indicates a shift in the skill being executed. We evaluated our method in Minecraft, a rich open-world simulator with extensive gameplay videos available online. The SBD-generated segments yielded relative performance improvements of 63.7% and 52.1% for conditioned policies on short-term atomic tasks, and 11.3% and 20.8% for their corresponding hierarchical agents on long-horizon tasks, compared to unsegmented baselines. Our method can leverage the diverse YouTube videos to train instruction-following agents. The project page is at https://craftjarvis.github.io/SkillDiscovery/",

    "abstract": "Depth images captured by Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensors are prone to noise, requiring denoising for reliable downstream applications. Previous works either focus on single-frame processing, or perform multi-frame processing without considering depth variations at corresponding pixels across frames, leading to undesirable temporal inconsistency and spatial ambiguity. In this paper, we propose a novel ToF depth denoising network leveraging motion-invariant graph fusion to simultaneously enhance temporal stability and spatial sharpness. Specifically, despite depth shifts across frames, graph structures exhibit temporal self-similarity, enabling cross-frame geometric attention for graph fusion. Then, by incorporating an image smoothness prior on the fused graph and data fidelity term derived from ToF noise distribution, we formulate a maximum a posterior problem for ToF denoising. Finally, the solution is unrolled into iterative filters whose weights are adaptively learned from the graph-informed geometric attention, producing a high-performance yet interpretable network. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and consistency on synthetic DVToF dataset and exhibits robust generalization on the real Kinectv2 dataset.

Currently, GFMs primarily employ objectives like contrastive learning or masked image modeling, owing to their proven success in learning transferable representations. However, generative diffusion models, which demonstrate the potential to capture multi-grained semantics essential for RS tasks during image generation, remain underexplored for discriminative applications. This prompts the question: can generative diffusion models also excel and serve as GFMs with sufficient discriminative power? In this work, we answer this question with SatDiFuser, a framework that transforms a diffusion-based generative geospatial foundation model into a powerful pretraining tool for discriminative RS. By systematically analyzing multi-stage, noise-dependent diffusion features, we develop three fusion strategies to effectively leverage these diverse representations. Extensive experiments on remote sensing benchmarks show that SatDiFuser outperforms state-of-the-art GFMs, achieving gains of up to +5.7% mIoU in semantic segmentation and +7.9% F1-score in classification, demonstrating the capacity of diffusion-based generative foundation models to rival or exceed discriminative GFMs. The source code is available at: https://github.com/yurujaja/SatDiFuser",

Additionally, current approaches do not support end-to-end training and instead rely on a two-stage pipeline, which incurs higher computational costs. To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end Association Reasoning Network (ARN) for DSGG. ARN leverages CLIP's semantic priors to model fine-grained triplet cues to generate scene graph. In addition, we design a Predicate Association Parsing (PAP) module that employs a conditional weight mapping mechanism to structure entity and predicate representations.

ZSAR faces a fundamental challenge in bridging the modality gap between the two-kind features, which severely limits generalization to unseen actions. Previous methods focus on direct alignment between skeleton and text latent spaces, but the modality gaps between these spaces hinder robust generalization learning. Motivated by the success of diffusion models in multi-modal alignment (e.g., text-to-image, text-to-video), we firstly present a diffusion-based skeleton-text alignment framework for ZSAR. Our approach, Triplet Diffusion for Skeleton-Text Matching (TDSM), focuses on cross-alignment power of diffusion models rather than their generative capability. Specifically, TDSM aligns skeleton features with text prompts by incorporating text features into the reverse diffusion process, where skeleton features are denoised under text guidance, forming a unified skeleton-text latent space for robust matching. To enhance discriminative power, we introduce a triplet diffusion (TD) loss that encourages our TDSM to correct skeleton-text matches while pushing them apart for different action classes. Our TDSM significantly outperforms very recent state-of-the-art methods with significantly large margins of 2.36%-point to 13.05%-point, demonstrating superior accuracy and scalability in zero-shot settings through effective skeleton-text matching",

However, how to effectively integrate temporal information remains a critical research focus. Traditional approaches treat spatial and temporal information separately. Due to issues like motion blur, it is challenging to accurately represent the spatial information of rapidly moving objects. This can lead to temporally important regions being underemphasized during spatial feature extraction, which in turn hinders accurate spatio-temporal interaction and video understanding. To address this limitation, we propose an innovative video representation method called Dynamic-Image (DynImg). Specifically, we introduce a set of non-key frames as temporal prompts to highlight the spatial areas containing fast-moving objects. During the process of visual feature extraction, these prompts guide the model to pay additional attention to the fine-grained spatial features corresponding to these regions. Moreover, to maintain the correct sequence for DynImg, we employ a corresponding 4D video Rotary Position Embedding. This retains both the temporal and spatial adjacency of DynImg, helping MLLM understand the spatio-temporal order within this combined format. Experimental evaluations reveal that DynImg surpasses the state-of-the-art methods by approximately 2% across multiple video understanding benchmarks, proving the effectiveness of our temporal prompts in enhancing video comprehension",

This introduces a new challenge: how to effectively align local visual features with corresponding attributes based on pre-trained VLMs. To tackle this, we propose LaZSL, a locally-aligned vision-language model for interpretable ZSL. LaZSL employs local visual-semantic alignment via optimal transport to perform interaction between visual regions and their associated attributes, facilitating effective alignment and providing interpretable similarity without the need for additional training.

MaGS constrains 3D Gaussians to roam near the mesh, creating a mutually adsorbed mesh-Gaussian 3D representation. Such representation harnesses both the rendering flexibility of 3D Gaussians and the structured property of meshes. To achieve this, we introduce RMD-Net, a network that learns motion priors from video data to refine mesh deformations, alongside RGD-Net, which models the relative displacement between the mesh and Gaussians to enhance rendering fidelity under mesh constraints. To generalize to novel, user-defined deformations beyond input video without reliance on temporal data, we propose MPE-Net, which leverages inherent mesh information to bootstrap RMD-Net and RGD-Net. Due to the universality of meshes, MaGS is compatible with various deformation priors such as ARAP, SMPL, and soft physics simulation.

Building on this, continual visual instruction tuning (CVIT) extends the capability of MLLMs to incrementally learn new tasks, accommodating evolving functionalities. While prior work has advanced CVIT through the development of new benchmarks and approaches to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, these efforts largely follow traditional continual learning paradigms, neglecting the unique challenges specific to CVIT. We identify a dual form of catastrophic forgetting in CVIT, where MLLMs not only forget previously learned visual understanding but also experience a decline in instruction following abilities as they acquire new tasks. To address this, we introduce the Separable Mixture of Low-Rank Adaptation (SMoLoRA) framework, which employs separable routing through two distinct modules--one for visual understanding and another for instruction following. This dual-routing design enables specialized adaptation in both domains, preventing forgetting while improving performance. Furthermore, we propose a new CVIT benchmark that goes beyond existing benchmarks by additionally evaluating a model's ability to generalize to unseen tasks and handle diverse instructions across various tasks.

    "abstract": "Outside of urban hubs, autonomous cars and trucks have to master driving on intercity highways. Safe, long-distance highway travel at speeds exceeding 100 km/h demands perception distances of at least 250 m, which is about five times the 50-100m typically addressed in city driving, to allow sufficient planning and braking margins. Increasing the perception ranges also allows to extend autonomy from light two-ton passenger vehicles to large-scale forty-ton trucks, which need a longer planning horizon due to their high inertia. However, most existing perception approaches focus on shorter ranges and rely on Bird's Eye View (BEV) representations, which incur quadratic increases in memory and compute costs as distance grows. To overcome this limitation, we built on top of a sparse representation and introduced an efficient 3D encoding of multi-modal and temporal features, along with a novel self-supervised pre-training scheme that enables large-scale learning from unlabeled camera-LiDAR data. Our approach extends perception distances to 250 meters and achieves an 26.6% improvement in mAP in object detection and a decrease of 30.5% in Chamfer Distance in LiDAR forecasting compared to existing methods, reaching distances up to 250 meters",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Cross-view localization, the task of estimating a camera's 3-degrees-of-freedom (3-DoF) pose by aligning ground-level images with aerial images, is crucial for large-scale outdoor applications like autonomous navigation and augmented reality. Existing methods often rely on fully supervised learning, which requires costly ground-truth pose annotations. In this work, we propose GeoDistill, a Geometry guided weakly supervised self Distillation framework that uses teacher-student learning with Field-of-View (FoV)-based masking to enhance local feature learning for robust cross-view localization. In GeoDistill, the teacher model localizes a full view image, while the student model predicts locations from a limited FoV counterpart created by FoV-based masking. By aligning the student's predictions with those of the teacher, the student focuses on key features like lane lines and ignores textureless regions, such as roads. This results in more accurate predictions and reduced uncertainty. Our experiments show that GeoDistill significantly improves localization performance across different frameworks. Additionally, we introduce a novel orientation estimation network that predicts relative orientation without requiring precise planar position ground truth. GeoDistill provides a scalable and efficient solution for real-world cross-view localization challenges. Code and model can be found at https://github.com/tongshw/GeoDistill",

    "abstract": "Dynamic scene rendering and reconstruction play a crucial role in computer vision and augmented reality. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have enabled accurate modeling of dynamic urban scenes, but for urban scenes they require both camera and LiDAR data, ground-truth 3D segmentations and motion data in the form of tracklets or pre-defined object templates such as SMPL. In this work, we explore whether a combination of 2D object agnostic priors in the form of depth and point tracking coupled with a signed distance function (SDF) representation for dynamic objects can be used to relax some of these requirements. We present a novel approach that integrates Signed Distance Functions (SDFs) with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to create a more robust object representation by harnessing the strengths of both methods. Our unified optimization framework enhances the geometric accuracy of 3D Gaussian splatting and improves deformation modeling within the SDF, resulting in a more adaptable and precise representation. We demonstrate that our method achieves near state-of-the-art performance in rendering metrics even without LiDAR data on urban scenes. Furthermore, when incorporating LiDAR, our approach surpasses existing methods in reconstructing and generating novel views across diverse object categories, without ground-truth 3D motion annotation.

    "abstract": "Connectionist temporal classification (CTC)-based scene text recognition (STR) methods, e.g., SVTR, are widely employed in OCR applications, mainly due to their simple architecture, which only contains a visual model and a CTC-aligned linear classifier, and therefore fast inference. However, they generally exhibit worse accuracy than encoder-decoder-based methods (EDTRs) due to struggling with text irregularity and linguistic missing. To address these challenges, we propose SVTRv2, a CTC model endowed with the ability to handle text irregularities and model linguistic context. First, a multi-size resizing strategy is proposed to resize text instances to appropriate predefined sizes, effectively avoiding severe text distortion. Meanwhile, we introduce a feature rearrangement module to ensure that visual features accommodate the requirement of CTC, thus alleviating the alignment puzzle. Second, we propose a semantic guidance module. It integrates linguistic context into the visual features, allowing CTC model to leverage language information for accuracy improvement. This module can be omitted at the inference stage and would not increase the time cost. We extensively evaluate SVTRv2 in both standard and recent challenging benchmarks, where SVTRv2 is fairly compared to popular STR models across multiple scenarios, including different types of text irregularity, languages, long text, and whether employing pretraining. SVTRv2 surpasses most EDTRs across the scenarios in terms of accuracy and inference speed. Code: https://github.com/Topdu/OpenOCR",

    "abstract": "Blind deblurring is an ill-posed inverse problem that involves recovering both the clear image and the blur kernel from a single blurry image. In real photography, longer exposure time results in lots of noise in the blurry image. Although existing blind deblurring methods produce satisfactory results on blurred images with little or no noise, they struggle to handle high noise levels. Strong noise compromises the accuracy of the estimated kernel and significantly reduces the quality of the deblurring results. To address this challenge, we propose a Residual Guidance Strategy (RGS) to suppress the influence of noise. Our method leverages adjacent coarser-scale information in the image pyramid to guide the blur kernel estimation in the current scale. Therefore, for blurred images with unknown noise levels and types, our method still estimates more accurate blur kernels, which are essential for subsequent non-blind restoration. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets have demonstrated that our method consistently outperforms numerous state-of-the-art methods under high levels of noise quantitatively and qualitatively",

This paper proposes a lightweight illuminant estimation method that incorporates such contextual metadata, along with additional capture information and image colors, into a lightweight model (~5K parameters), achieving promising results, matching or surpassing larger models. To validate our method, we introduce a dataset of 3,224 smartphone images with contextual metadata collected at various times of day and under diverse lighting conditions.

Our key insight is that the importance sampling of the logarithm of the Signal-to-Noise ratio (\\log \\text SNR ), theoretically equivalent to a modified noise schedule, is particularly beneficial for training efficiency when increasing the sample frequency around \\log \\text SNR =0. This strategic sampling allows the model to focus on the critical transition point between signal dominance and noise dominance, potentially leading to more robust and accurate predictions.We empirically demonstrate the superiority of our noise schedule over the standard cosine schedule.Furthermore, we highlight the advantages of our noise schedule design on the ImageNet benchmark, showing that the designed schedule consistently benefits different prediction targets.Our findings contribute to the ongoing efforts to optimize diffusion models, potentially paving the way for more efficient and effective training paradigms in the field of generative AI",

    "abstract": "An important challenge when using computer vision models in the real world is to evaluate their performance in potential out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. While simple synthetic corruptions are commonly applied to test OOD robustness, they often fail to capture nuisance shifts that occur in the real world. Recently, diffusion models have been applied to generate realistic images for benchmarking, but they are restricted to binary nuisance shifts. In this work, we introduce CNS-Bench, a Continuous Nuisance Shift Benchmark to quantify OOD robustness of image classifiers for continuous and realistic generative nuisance shifts. CNS-Bench allows generating a wide range of individual nuisance shifts in continuous severities by applying LoRA adapters to diffusion models. To address failure cases, we propose a filtering mechanism that outperforms previous methods, thereby enabling reliable benchmarking with generative models. With the proposed benchmark, we perform a large-scale study to evaluate the robustness of more than 40 classifiers under various nuisance shifts. Through carefully designed comparisons and analyses, we find that model rankings can change for varying shifts and shift scales, which cannot be captured when applying common binary shifts. Additionally, we show that evaluating the model performance on a continuous scale allows the identification of model failure points, providing a more nuanced understanding of model robustness",

These characteristics can be formalized as knowledge, leveraged for fine-grained part comprehension. However, existing part segmentation models consistently fail to capture these complex inter-part relationships, treating parts as independent entities and disregarding object-level distinctions. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Knowledge-Guided Part Segmentation (KPS) framework. Our approach automatically extracts structural relationships between parts using a large language model (LLM) and integrates them into a knowledge graph. Subsequently, a structural knowledge guidance module employs a graph convolutional network (GCN) to model these relationships. Furthermore, a coarse-grained object guidance module captures object-specific distinctions and integrates them as visual guidance. The integrated insights from the part structure and object differentiation guide the fine-grained part segmentation. Our KPS achieves notable improvements in segmentation performance, with a 4.96% mIoU gain on PartImageNet and a 3.73% gain on Pascal-Part.

    "abstract": "Continual learning (CL) promises to allow neural networks to learn from continuous streams of inputs, instead of IID (independent and identically distributed) sampling, which requires random access to a full dataset. This would allow for much smaller storage requirements and self-sufficiency of deployed systems that cope with natural distribution shifts, similarly to biological learning.We focus on video CL employing a rehearsal-based approach, which reinforces past samples from a memory buffer. We posit that part of the reason why practical video CL is challenging is the high memory requirements of video, further exacerbated by long-videos and continual streams, which are at odds with the common rehearsal-buffer size constraints. To address this, we propose to use compressed vision, i.e. store video codes (embeddings) instead of raw inputs, and train a video classifier by IID sampling from this rolling buffer. Training a video compressor online (so not depending on any pre-trained networks) means that it is also subject to catastrophic forgetting. We propose a scheme to deal with this forgetting by refreshing video codes, which requires careful decompression with a previous version of the network and recompression with a new one. We name our method Continually Refreshed Amodal Memory (CRAM). We expand current video CL benchmarks to large-scale settings, namely EpicKitchens-100 and Kinetics-700, with thousands of relatively long videos, and demonstrate empirically that our video CL method outperforms prior art with a significantly reduced memory footprint",

While tokenization has revolutionized image and video generation, efficiently tokenizing complex 3D scenes remains a critical challenge for 3D world models. To address this, we propose I^ 2 -World, an efficient framework for 4D occupancy forecasting. Our method decouples scene tokenization into intra-scene and inter-scene tokenizers. The intra-scene tokenizer employs a multi-scale residual quantization strategy to hierarchically compress 3D scenes while preserving spatial details. The inter-scene tokenizer residually aggregates temporal dependencies across timesteps. This dual design retains the compactness of 3D tokenizers while capturing the dynamic expressiveness of 4D approaches. Unlike decoder-only GPT-style autoregressive models, I^ 2 -World adopts an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder aggregates spatial context from the current scene and predicts a transformation matrix to guide future scene generation. The decoder, conditioned on this matrix and historical tokens, ensures temporal consistency during generation. Experiments demonstrate that I^ 2 -World achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing approaches by 41.8% in 4D occupancy forecasting with exceptional efficiency--requiring only 2.9 GB of training memory and achieving real-time inference at 94.8 FPS",

    "abstract": "With the rapid progress of diffusion models (DMs), significant efforts are being made to unlearn harmful or copyrighted concepts from pretrained DMs to prevent potential model misuse. However, it is observed that even when DMs are properly unlearned before release, malicious finetuning can compromise this process, causing DMs to relearn the unlearned concepts. This occurs partly because certain benign concepts (e.g., \"skin\") retained in DMs are related to the unlearned ones (e.g., \"nudity\"), facilitating their relearning via finetuning. To address this, we propose meta-unlearning on DMs. Intuitively, a meta-unlearned DM should behave like an unlearned DM when used as is; moreover, if the meta-unlearned DM undergoes malicious finetuning on unlearned concepts, the related benign concepts retained within it will be triggered to self-destruct, hindering the relearning of unlearned concepts. Our meta-unlearning framework is compatible with most existing unlearning methods, requiring only the addition of an easy-to-implement meta objective. We validate our approach through empirical experiments on meta-unlearning concepts from Stable Diffusion models (SD-v1-4 and SDXL), supported by extensive ablation studies",

Our approach, AutoSeg, presents a framework that autonomously identifies relevant class names using semantically enhanced BLIP embeddings and segments them afterwards. Given that open-ended object category predictions cannot be directly compared with a fixed ground truth, we develop a Large Language Model-based Auto-Vocabulary Evaluator (LAVE) to efficiently evaluate the automatically generated classes and their corresponding segments.

In contrast, humans identify characters by integrating multiple perspectives, including linguistic and visual cues. Inspired by this, we propose a multi-task framework termed MSA^2, which considers multi-view character representations for open-set CTR. Within MSA^2, we introduce two novel strategies for character representation: structure-aware component encoding (SACE) and style-adaptive glyph embedding (SAGE). SACE utilizes a binary tree with dynamic representation space to emphasize the primary linguistic components, thereby generating structure-aware and discriminative linguistic representations for each character. Meanwhile, SAGE employs a glyph-centric contrastive learning to aggregate features from diverse forms, yielding robust glyph representations for the CTR model to adapt to the style variations among various fonts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed MSA^2 outperforms state-of-the-art CTR methods, achieving an average improvement of 1.3% and 6.0% in accuracy under closed-set and open-set settings on the BCTR dataset, respectively.

    "abstract": "Visual navigation with an image as goal is a fundamental and challenging problem. Conventional methods either rely on end-to-end RL learning or modular-based policy with topological graph or BEV map as memory, which cannot fully model the geometric relationship between the explored 3D environment and the goal image. In order to efficiently and accurately localize the goal image in 3D space, we build our navigation system upon the renderable 3D gaussian (3DGS) representation. However, due to the computational intensity of 3DGS optimization and the large search space of 6-DoF camera pose, directly leveraging 3DGS for image localization during agent exploration process is prohibitively inefficient. To this end, we propose IGL-Nav, an Incremental 3D Gaussian Localization framework for efficient and 3D-aware image-goal navigation. Specifically, we incrementally update the scene representation as new images arrive with feed-forward monocular prediction. Then we coarsely localize the goal by leveraging the geometric information for discrete space matching, which can be equivalent to efficient 3D convolution. When the agent is close to the goal, we finally solve the fine target pose with optimization via differentiable rendering. The proposed IGL-Nav outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin across diverse experimental configurations. It can also handle the more challenging free-view image-goal setting and be deployed on real-world robotic platform using a cellphone to capture goal image at arbitrary pose.

PCR-GS achieves regularization from two perspectives. The first is feature reprojection regularization which extracts view-robust DINO features from adjacent camera views and aligns their semantic information for camera pose regularization. The second is wavelet-based frequency regularization which exploits discrepancy in high-frequency details to further optimize the rotation matrix in camera poses.

However, existing detection methodologies remain limited by their insufficient exploration of temporal artifacts in synthetic videos. To bridge this gap, we establish a theoretical framework through second-order dynamical analysis under Newtonian mechanics, subsequently extending the Second-order Central Difference features tailored for temporal artifact detection. Building on this theoretical foundation, we reveal a fundamental divergence in second-order feature distributions between real and AI-generated videos. Concretely, we propose Detection by Difference of Differences (D3), a novel training-free detection method that leverages the above second-order temporal discrepancies.

    "abstract": "In many applications, machine-learned (ML) models are required to hold some invariance qualities, such as rotation, size, and intensity invariance. Among these, testing for background invariance presents a significant challenge due to the vast and complex data space it encompasses. To evaluate invariance qualities, we first use a visualization-based testing framework which allows human analysts to assess and make informed decisions about the invariance properties of ML models. We show that such informative testing framework is preferred as ML models with the same global statistics (e.g., accuracy scores) can behave differently and have different visualized testing patterns. However, such human analysts might not lead to consistent decisions without a systematic sampling approach to select representative testing suites. In this work, we present a technical solution for selecting background scenes according to their semantic proximity to a target image that contains a foreground object being tested. We construct an ontology for storing knowledge about relationships among different objects using association analysis. This ontology enables an efficient and meaningful search for background scenes of different semantic distances to a target image, enabling the selection of a test suite that is both diverse and reasonable. Compared with other testing techniques, e.g., random sampling, nearest neighbors, or other sampled test suites by visual-language models (VLMs), our method achieved a superior balance between diversity and consistency of human annotations, thereby enhancing the reliability and comprehensiveness of background invariance testing",

While several VFM adapters have shown promising results by leveraging the prior knowledge of VFMs, we identify two inefficiencies in these approaches. First, the interaction between convolutional neural network (CNN) and VFM backbone triggers early layer gradient backpropagation. Second, existing methods require tuning all components, adding complexity. Besides, these adapters alter VFM features, underutilizing the prior knowledge. To tackle these challenges, we propose a new approach called ViT-Split, based on a key observation: the layers of several VFMs, like DINOv2, can be divided into two distinct components: an extractor for learning low-level features and an adapter for learning task-specific features. Leveraging this insight, we eliminate the CNN branch and introduce two heads, task head and prior head, to the frozen VFM. The task head is designed to learn task-specific features, mitigating the early gradient propagation issue. The prior head is used to leverage the multi-scale prior features from the frozen VFM, reducing tuning parameters and overfitting. Extensive experiments on various tasks (e.g., segmentation, detection, depth estimation, and visual question answering) validate the effectiveness and efficiency of ViT-Split.

To this end, we introduce a high-diversity dataset ATR-UMOD covering varying scenarios, spanning altitudes from 80m to 300m, angles from 0deg to 75deg, and all-day, all-year time variations in rich weather and illumination conditions. Moreover, each RGB-IR image pair is annotated with 6 condition attributes, offering valuable high-level contextual information. To meet the challenge raised by such diverse conditions, we propose a novel prompt-guided condition-aware dynamic fusion (PCDF) to adaptively reassign multimodal contributions by leveraging annotated condition cues. By encoding imaging conditions as text prompts, PCDF effectively models the relationship between conditions and multimodal contributions through a task-specific soft-gating transformation. A prompt-guided condition-decoupling module further ensures the availability in practice without condition annotations. Experiments on ATR-UMOD dataset reveal the effectiveness of PCDF",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The distributed nature of federated learning exposes it to significant security threats, among which backdoor attacks are one of the most prevalent. However, existing backdoor attacks face a trade-off between attack strength and stealthiness: attacks maximizing the attack strength are often detectable, while stealthier approaches significantly reduce the effectiveness of the attack itself. Both of them result in ineffective backdoor injection. In this paper, we propose an adaptive layer-wise gradient alignment strategy to effectively evade various robust defense mechanisms while preserving attack strength. Without requiring additional knowledge, we leverage the previous global update as a reference for alignment to ensure stealthiness during dynamic FL training. This fine-grained alignment strategy applies appropriate constraints to each layer, which helps significantly maintain attack strength. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct extensive evaluations across a wide range of datasets and networks. Our experimental results show that the proposed attack effectively bypasses eight state-of-the-art defenses and achieves high backdoor accuracy, outperforming existing attacks by up to 54.76%. Additionally, it significantly preserves attack strength and maintains robust performance across diverse scenarios, highlighting its adaptability and generalizability.

    "title": "Hybrid Layout Control for Diffusion Transformer: Fewer Annotations, Superior Aesthetics",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Text-to-image generation models often struggle to interpret spatially aware text prompts effectively. To overcome this, existing approaches typically require millions of high-quality semantic layout annotations consisting of bounding boxes and regional prompts. This paper shows that the large amounts of regional prompts are non-necessary for the latest diffusion transformers like SD3 or FLUX.In this paper, we propose an efficient hybrid layout framework for diffusion transformers. Our approach drastically reduces need for extensive layout annotations and minimizes reliance on regional prompt annotations--incurring only minimal additional computational cost during inference--while maintaining high-quality layout adherence. Our key insight is to break the layout-control task into two sequential stages: first, generating the target objects within the designated regions specified by an anonymous layout, and second, refining these outputs to ensure they strictly adhere to the regional prompts in the semantic layout. Building on this insight, we propose a hybrid layout control scheme that first fine-tunes the DiTs (e.g., SD3) to follow an anonymous layout, then continues fine-tuning the DiTs to follow the semantic layout, and finally includes a quality-tuning stage to enhance visual aesthetics. We show that this hybrid design is highly data-efficient, as we find only using a small amount of semantic layout annotations is sufficient, thereby significantly reducing dependency on regional prompts. In addition, we propose an efficient regional diffusion transformer to encode the spatial layout information using just a set of lower-resolution regional tokens instead of various carefully designed layout tokens. The region-wise diffusion loss over these regional tokens can guide the diffusion transformer learn to follow the given layout implicitly. We empirically validate the effectiveness of our approach by comparing it with the latest version of SiamLayout and show that our method achieves better results while being more than 10 times more data efficient and ensuring superior aesthetics",

In particular, in FV we generate human-understandable images that reflect the information detected by neurons of interest. However, current methods often yield unrecognizable visualizations, exhibiting repetitive patterns and visual artifacts that are hard to understand for a human. To address these problems, we propose to guide FV through **statistics of real image features** combined with measures of **relevant network flow** to generate prototypical images.

    "abstract": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection holds significant importance across many applications. While semantic and domain-shift OOD problems are well-studied, this work focuses on covariate shifts - subtle variations in the data distribution that can degrade machine learning performance. We hypothesize that detecting these subtle shifts can improve our understanding of in-distribution boundaries, ultimately improving OOD detection. In adversarial discriminators trained with Batch Normalization (BN), real and adversarial samples form distinct domains with unique batch statistics - a property we exploit for OOD detection. We introduce DisCoPatch, an unsupervised Adversarial Variational Autoencoder (VAE) framework that harnesses this mechanism. During inference, batches consist of patches from the same image, ensuring a consistent data distribution that allows the model to rely on batch statistics. DisCoPatch uses the VAE's suboptimal outputs (generated and reconstructed) as negative samples to train the discriminator, thereby improving its ability to delineate the boundary between in-distribution samples and covariate shifts. By tightening this boundary, DisCoPatch achieves state-of-the-art results in public OOD detection benchmarks. The proposed model not only excels in detecting covariate shifts, achieving 95.5% AUROC on ImageNet-1K(-C), but also outperforms all prior methods on public Near-OOD (95.0%) benchmarks.

    "abstract": "Current language-guided robotic manipulation systems often require low-level action-labeled datasets for imitation learning. While object-centric flow prediction methods mitigate this issue, they remain limited to scenarios involving rigid objects with clear displacement and minimal occlusion. In this work, we present Embodiment-Centric Flow (EC-Flow), a framework that directly learns manipulation from action-unlabeled videos by predicting embodiment-centric flow. Our key insight is that incorporating the embodiment's inherent kinematics significantly enhances generalization to versatile manipulation scenarios, including deformable object handling, occlusions, and non-object-displacement tasks. To connect the EC-Flow with language instructions and object interactions, we further introduce a goal-alignment module by jointly optimizing movement consistency and goal-image prediction. Moreover, translating EC-Flow to executable robot actions only requires a standard robot URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) file to specify kinematic constraints across joints, which makes it easy to use in practice. We validate EC-Flow on both simulation (Meta-World) and real-world tasks, demonstrating its state-of-the-art performance in occluded object handling (62% improvement), deformable object manipulation (45% improvement), and non-object-displacement tasks (80% improvement) than prior state-of-the-art object-centric flow methods.

    "abstract": "Zero-shot depth estimation (DE) models exhibit strong generalization performance as they are trained on large-scale datasets. However, existing models struggle with high-resolution images due to the discrepancy in image resolutions of training (with smaller resolutions) and inference (for high resolutions). Processing them at full resolution leads to decreased estimation accuracy on depth with tremendous memory consumption, while downsampling to the training resolution results in blurred edges in the estimated depth images. Prevailing high-resolution depth estimation methods adopt a patch-based approach, which introduces depth discontinuity issues when reassembling the estimated depth patches, resulting in test-time inefficiency. Additionally, to obtain fine-grained depth details, these methods rely on synthetic datasets due to the real-world sparse ground truth depth, leading to poor generalizability. To tackle these limitations, we propose Patch Refine Once (PRO), an efficient and generalizable tile-based framework. Our PRO consists of two key components: (i) Grouped Patch Consistency Training that enhances test-time efficiency while mitigating the depth discontinuity problem by jointly processing four overlapping patches and enforcing a consistency loss on their overlapping regions within a single backpropagation step, and (ii) Bias Free Masking that prevents the DE models from overfitting to dataset-specific biases, enabling better generalization to real-world datasets even after training on synthetic data. Zero-shot evaluations on Booster, ETH3D, Middlebury 2014, and NuScenes demonstrate that our PRO can be seamlessly integrated into existing depth estimation models. It preserves the performance of original depth estimation models even under grid-based inference on high-resolution images, exhibiting minimal depth discontinuities along patch boundaries.

To address these limitations, we propose a Frequency-Semantic Enhanced Variational Autoencoder (FS-VAE) to explore the skeleton semantic representation learning with frequency decomposition. FS-VAE consists of three key components: 1) a frequency-based enhancement module with high- and low-frequency adjustments to enrich the skeletal semantics learning and improve the robustness of zero-shot action recognition; 2) a semantic-based action description with multilevel alignment to capture both local details and global correspondence, effectively bridging the semantic gap and compensating for the inherent loss of information in skeleton sequences; 3) a calibrated cross-alignment loss that enables valid skeleton-text pairs to counterbalance ambiguous ones, mitigating discrepancies and ambiguities in skeleton and text features, thereby ensuring robust alignment.

In this paper, we present CleanPose, a novel method that mitigates the data biases to enhance category-level pose estimation by integrating causal learning and knowledge distillation. By incorporating key causal variables (structural information and hidden confounders) into causal modeling, we propose the causal inference module based on front-door adjustment, which promotes unbiased estimation by reducing potential spurious correlations. Additionally, to further confront the data bias at the feature level, we devise a residual-based knowledge distillation approach to transfer unbiased semantic knowledge from 3D foundation model, providing comprehensive causal supervision.

This phase ultimately identifies the parameters within the model that are most suitable for learning new knowledge. In the subsequent incremental editing phase, a low-rank incremental update strategy is applied. This strategy ensures that the model parameter updates adhere to a Rank-One matrix structure. By doing so, it minimizes alterations to the original parameters, thereby enabling the model to integrate new knowledge while retaining as much of the previous knowledge as possible.

Articulate3D provides 8 types of annotations for articulated objects, covering parts and detailed motion information,all stored in a standardized scene representation format designed for scalable 3D content creation, exchange and seamless integration into simulation environments. (2) USDNet, a novel unified framework capable of simultaneously predicting part segmentation along with a full specification of motion attributes for articulated objects. We evaluate USDNet on Articulate3D as well as two existing datasets, demonstrating the advantage of our unified dense prediction approach.

However, real-world challenges, such as uneven or large scene motions, cause existing methods to struggle with limited interpolation precision. To address this, we introduce DiffPCI, a novel diffusion interpolation model that formulates the frame interpolation task as a progressive denoising diffusion process. Training DiffPCI involves two key stages: a forward interpolation diffusion process and a reverse interpolation denoising process. In the forward process, the clean intermediate frame is progressively transformed into a noisy one through continuous Gaussian noise injection. The reverse process then focuses on training a denoiser to gradually refine this noisy frame back to the ground-truth frame. In particular, we derive a point cloud interpolation-specific variational lower bound as our optimization objective for denoiser training. Furthermore, to alleviate the interpolation error especially in highly dynamic scenes, we develop a novel full-scale, dual-branch denoiser that enables more comprehensive front-back frame information fusion for robust bi-directional interpolation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffPCI significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art frame interpolation methods (e.g. 27% and 860% reduction in the Chamfer Distance and Earth Mover's Distance on Nuscenes)",

Recent tuning-free approaches address this by transferring local appearance via implicit cross-image matching in the augmented self-attention mechanism of pre-trained diffusion models. However, prior works are often restricted to single-object cases or foreground object appearance transfer, struggling with complex scenes involving multiple objects. To overcome this, we propose AM-Adapter (Appearance Matching Adapter) to address exemplar-based semantic image synthesis in-the-wild, enabling multi-object appearance transfer from a single scene-level image. AM-Adapter automatically transfers local appearances from the scene-level input. AM-Adapter alternatively provides controllability to map user-defined object details to specific locations in the synthesized images. Our learnable framework enhances cross-image matching within augmented self-attention by integrating semantic information from segmentation maps. To disentangle generation and matching, we adopt stage-wise training. We first train the structure-guidance and generation networks, followed by training the matching adapter while keeping the others frozen. During inference, we introduce an automated exemplar retrieval method for selecting exemplar image-segmentation pairs efficiently. Despite utilizing minimal learnable parameters, AM-Adapter achieves state-of-the-art performance, excelling in both semantic alignment and local appearance fidelity. Extensive ablations validate our design choices. Code and weights will be released",

Currently, MLLMs still lack the capability to autonomously control their own visual perception processes. For example, they cannot selectively re-encode specific regions of an image or focus on information related to specific object categories. In this work, we propose the concept of Visual Perception Token, aiming to empower MLLM with a mechanism to control its visual perception processes. We design two types of Visual Perception Tokens, termed the Region Selection Token and the Vision Re-Encoding Token. MLLMs autonomously generate these tokens, just as they generate natural language tokens, and use them to trigger additional visual perception process. The Region Selection Token explicitly identifies regions of interest that require further processing, while the Vision Re-Encoding Token utilizes its hidden states to guide an additional vision encoding process. Extensive experiments highlight the effectiveness of these tokens in enhancing spatial reasoning, fine-grained understanding, Text/OCR-related VQA, and a wide range of other visual tasks. On average, the introduction of Visual Perception Tokens improves the performance of a 2B model by 30.9%, increasing its score from 0.572 to 0.749, and even outperforms a 7B parameter model by 20.0% (from 0.624)",

To fix this, we propose SimpleVQ, which reparameterizes code vectors through a learnable linear transformation layer over a latent basis, optimizing the entire linear space rather than nearest individual code vectors. Although the multiplication of two linear matrices is equivalent to applying a single linear layer, this simple approach effectively prevents collapse. Extensive experiments on image and audio tasks demonstrate that SimVQ improves codebook usage, is easy to implement, and generalizes well across modalities and architectures",

Our approach leverages the observation that the middle, fast-learning stage of diffusion pretraining requires more conservative pruning to preserve critical model features, while the early and later, slow-learning stages benefit from a more aggressive pruning strategy. This adaptive pruning mechanism is the first to explicitly mirror the inherent learning speed variations of diffusion pretraining, thereby harmonizing the model's inner training dynamics with its accelerated sampling process. Extensive experiments on DiT and SDXL demonstrate that our method achieves significant speed-ups in sampling without compromising output quality, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods by large margins, also providing a new viewpoint for more efficient and robust training-free diffusion acceleration",

Humans do not rely solely on visual information for lip-reading but also incorporate additional cues, such as speech-related context and prior knowledge about the task. However, existing methods have largely overlooked such external information in automatic VSR systems. To systematically explore the role of such information for VSR, we introduce the concept of Peripheral Information. We categorize it into three types based on the relevance to the spoken content: (1) Contextual Guidance (e.g., topic or description of speech), (2) Task Expertise (e.g., human prior experience in lip-reading), and (3) Linguistic Perturbation (irrelevant signals processed alongside meaningful information). Considering the disparity that peripheral information provides additional clues with varying significance while visual input serves as the most direct source for VSR, we propose a framework that introduces a hierarchical processing strategy to handle different modalities. With visual-specific adaptation and a dynamic routing mechanism for multi-modal information, our approach reduces the impact of modality conflicts effectively and enables selective utilization of peripheral information with varying relevance. Leveraging readily available peripheral information, our model achieves a WER of 22.03% on LRS3. Further experiments on AVSpeech demonstrate its generalization in real-world scenarios",

Our empirical investigation reveals several intriguing properties of VPiT: (1) visual generation ability emerges as a natural byproduct of improved visual understanding, and can be unlocked efficiently with a small amount of generation data; (2) while we find understanding and generation to be mutually beneficial, understanding data contributes to both capabilities more effectively than generation data. Building upon these findings, we train our MetaMorph model and achieve competitive performance on both visual understanding and generation. In visual generation, MetaMorph can leverage the world knowledge and reasoning abilities gained from LLM pretraining, and overcome common failure modes exhibited by other generation models. Our results suggest that LLMs may have strong \"prior\" vision capabilities that can be efficiently adapted to both visual understanding and generation with a relatively simple instruction tuning process",

To mitigate this, we propose Camera Height Robust Monocular 3D Detector (CHARM3R), which averages both depth estimates within the model.

However, their ability to store vast amounts of knowledge raises concerns in scenarios where selective forgetting is necessary, such as removing copyrighted content, reducing biases, or eliminating harmful concepts. While existing unlearning methods can remove certain concepts, they struggle with multi-concept forgetting due to instability, residual knowledge persistence, and generation quality degradation. To address these challenges, we propose **Dynamic Mask coupled with Concept-Aware Loss**, a novel unlearning framework designed for multi-concept forgetting in diffusion models. Our **Dynamic Mask** mechanism adaptively updates gradient masks based on current optimization states, allowing selective weight modifications that prevent interference with unrelated knowledge. Additionally, our **Concept-Aware Loss** explicitly guides the unlearning process by enforcing semantic consistency through superclass alignment, while a regularization loss based on knowledge distillation ensures that previously unlearned concepts remain forgotten during sequential unlearning. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our approach. Results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing unlearning techniques in forgetting effectiveness, output fidelity, and semantic coherence, particularly in multi-concept scenarios.

Benefits from GenAI with the evolution of large language models (LLMs), the image generation task evolved from prompt-based to dialogue-based, which takes the real-world human intent expressed through conversations. When breaking this task into multiple steps, the best pathway of analyzing the dialogues is not determined, such as whether the objects or prompted template should be focused on the first step of dialogues analyzing. Thus, a multi-chain reasoning is requested to decompose this application beyond a pure chain-of-thought structure. After the divergent process, the question comes to how to converge the thinking chain that leads to the best matched image, which requires a new evaluation method to lead the thinking process. To address these challenges, we propose the LLM Thought Divergence and Convergence (LTDC) framework, which simulates human cognitive processes through three phases: (1) The Step-by-Step Thought process decomposes dialogue-based image generation tasks into sequential thinking chains using LLMs; (2) The Image Generation process creates image prompts following these thought instructions and produces corresponding images; (3) The Evaluation process aligns the coherence between generated images and dialogues through a multi-modal LLM, guiding the selection of optimal thinking chains.

Also, existing text-to-image PnP approaches are highly computationally expensive. We herein address these challenges by proposing a novel PnP inference paradigm specifically designed for embedding generative models within stochastic inverse solvers, with special attention to Latent Consistency Models (LCMs), which distill LDMs into fast generators. We leverage our framework to propose LAtent consisTency INverse sOlver (LATINO), the first zero-shot PnP framework to solve inverse problems with priors encoded by LCMs. Our conditioning mechanism avoids automatic differentiation and reaches SOTA quality in as little as 8 neural function evaluations. As a result, LATINO delivers remarkably accurate solutions and is significantly more memory and computationally efficient than previous approaches. We then embed LATINO within an empirical Bayesian framework that automatically calibrates the text prompt from the observed measurements by marginal maximum likelihood estimation. Extensive experiments show that prompt self-calibration greatly improves estimation, allowing LATINO with PRompt Optimization to define new SOTAs in image reconstruction quality and computational efficiency.

Although spatial-aware 3D LUT methods address this limitation, they introduce additional modules that require a substantial number of parameters, leading to increased runtime as image resolution increases. To address this issue, we propose a method for generating image-adaptive LUTs by focusing on the redundant parts of the tables. Our efficient framework decomposes a 3D LUT into a linear sum of low-dimensional LUTs and employs singular value decomposition (SVD).

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Foundation models that bridge vision and language have made significant progress. While they have inspired many life-enriching applications, their potential for abuse in creating new threats remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we reveal that vision-language models (VLMs) can be weaponized to enhance gradient inversion attacks (GIAs) in federated learning (FL), where an FL server attempts to reconstruct private data samples from gradients shared by victim clients. Despite recent advances, existing GIAs struggle to reconstruct high-resolution images when the victim has a large local data batch. One promising direction is to focus reconstruction on valuable samples rather than the entire batch, but current methods lack the flexibility to target specific data of interest. To address this gap, we propose Geminio, the first approach to transform GIAs into semantically meaningful, targeted attacks. It enables a brand new privacy attack experience: attackers can describe, in natural language, the data they consider valuable, and Geminio will prioritize reconstruction to focus on those high-value samples. This is achieved by leveraging a pretrained VLM to guide the optimization of a malicious global model that, when shared with and optimized by a victim, retains only gradients of samples that match the attacker-specified query. Geminio can be launched at any FL round and has no impact on normal training (i.e., the FL server can steal clients' data while still producing a high-utility ML model as in benign scenarios). Extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in pinpointing and reconstructing targeted samples, with high success rates across complex datasets and large batch sizes with resilience against defenses",

Inspired by the success of decoder-only models for language modeling, we propose DONUT, a Decoder-Only Network for Unrolling Trajectories. Unlike existing encoder-decoder forecasting models, we encode historical trajectories and predict future trajectories with a single autoregressive model. This allows the model to make iterative predictions in a consistent manner, and ensures that the model is always provided with up-to-date information, thereby enhancing performance. Furthermore, inspired by multi-token prediction for language modeling, we introduce an 'overprediction' strategy that gives the model the auxiliary task of predicting trajectories at longer temporal horizons. This allows the model to better anticipate the future and further improves performance.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have significantly improved performance in embodied tasks such as goal decomposition and visual comprehension. However, providing accurate rewards for robotic manipulation without fine-tuning VLMs remains challenging due to the absence of domain-specific robotic knowledge in pre-trained datasets and high computational costs that hinder real-time applicability. To address this, we propose T2-VLM, a novel training-free, temporally consistent framework that generates accurate rewards through tracking the status changes in VLM-derived subgoals. Specifically, our method first queries the VLM to establish spatially aware subgoals and an initial completion estimate before each round of interaction. We then employ a Bayesian tracking algorithm to update the goal completion status dynamically, using subgoal hidden states to generate structured rewards for reinforcement learning (RL) agents. This approach enhances long-horizon decision-making and improves failure recovery capabilities with RL. Extensive experiments indicate that T2-VLM achieves state-of-the-art performance in two robot manipulation benchmarks, demonstrating superior reward accuracy with reduced computation consumption. We believe our approach not only advances reward generation techniques but also contributes to the broader field of embodied AI. Project website: https://t2-vlm.github.io/",

However, their multi-step denoising process introduces significant computational overhead, limiting their practical deployment. Furthermore, existing methods struggle to effectively remove severe JPEG artifact, especially in highly compressed images.

The core of CODiff is the compression-aware visual embedder (CaVE), which extracts and leverages JPEG compression priors to guide the diffusion model. We propose a dual learning strategy that combines explicit and implicit learning. Specifically, explicit learning enforces a quality prediction objective to differentiate low-quality images with different compression levels. Implicit learning employs a reconstruction objective that enhances the model's generalization. This dual learning allows for a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of JPEG compression. Experimental results demonstrate that CODiff surpasses recent leading methods in both quantitative and visual quality metrics. The code is released at https://github.com/jp-guo/CODiff",

We present a probabilistic reinterpretation of training SCR models, which allows us to infuse high-level reconstruction priors. We investigate multiple such priors, ranging from simple priors over the distribution of reconstructed depth values to learned priors over plausible scene coordinate configurations. For the latter, we train a 3D point cloud diffusion model on a large corpus of indoor scans. Our priors push predicted 3D scene points towards a more plausible geometry at each training step to increase their likelihood.

    "abstract": "Image degradation synthesis is highly desirable in a wide variety of applications ranging from image restoration to simulating artistic effects. Existing models are designed to generate one specific or a narrow set of degradations, which often require user-provided degradation parameters. As a result, they lack the generalizability to synthesize degradations beyond their initial design or adapt to other applications. Here we propose the first universal degradation model that can synthesize a broad spectrum of complex and realistic degradations containing both homogeneous (global) and inhomogeneous (spatially varying) components. Our model automatically extracts and disentangles homogeneous and inhomogeneous degradation features, which are later used for degradation synthesis without user intervention. A disentangle-by-compression method is proposed to separate degradation information from images. Two novel modules for extracting and incorporating inhomogeneous degradations are created to model inhomogeneous components in complex degradations. We demonstrate the model's accuracy and adaptability in film-grain simulation and blind image restoration tasks.

To preserve content information adaptively, we propose Progressive Spectrum Regularization, which operates in the frequency domain to guide stylization progressively from low-frequency layouts to high-frequency details. In addition, we devise a Semantic-Aware Gradient Refinement technique that leverages relevance maps derived from diffusion semantic priors to selectively stylize semantically important regions. The proposed optimization formulation extends stylization from pixel space to parameter space, readily applicable to lightweight feedforward generators for efficient one-step stylization.

These \"rectangular shackles\" inherently struggle to precisely define objects with complex geometries, leading to incomplete coverage or erroneous localization. We propose a novel scheme, cross-view object segmentation (CVOS), which achieves fine-grained geo-localization by predicting pixel-level segmentation masks of query objects. CVOS enables accurate extraction of object shapes, sizes, and areas--critical for applications like urban planning and agricultural monitoring. We introduce the CVOGL-Seg dataset specifically to support and evaluate the new CVOS scheme. To tackle CVOS challenges, we propose Transformer Object Geo-localization (TROGeo), a two-stage framework. First, the Heterogeneous Task Training Stage (HTTS) employs a single transformer encoder with a Cross-View Object Perception Module (CVOPM) and is trained by learning a heterogeneous task. Second, the SAM Prompt Stage (SPS) utilizes SAM's zero-shot segmentation capability, guided by HTTS outputs, to generate precise masks. Extensive experiments on both CVOGL and CVOGL-Seg datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively breaking the rectangular shackles and unlocking new possibilities for fine-grained object geo-localization.

While previous supervised approaches rely on costly manual annotations, LiDAR sequences naturally capture temporal motion cues that can be leveraged for self-supervised learning.

TOP learns powerful spatiotemporal representations by predicting the occupancy states of temporal overlapping points that are commonly observed in current and adjacent scans. To further ground these representations in the current scene's geometry, we introduce an auxiliary pre-training objective of reconstructing the occupancy of the current scan.

Despite remarkable progress, this study identifies a critical issue--\"Toxic Siblings\" bias--which hinders the interaction decoder's learning, as numerous similar yet distinct HOI triplets interfere with and even compete against each other both input side and output side to the interaction decoder. This bias arises from high confusion among sibling triplets/categories, where increased similarity paradoxically reduces precision, as one's gain comes at the expense of its toxic sibling's decline. To address this, we propose two novel debiasing learning objectives--\"contrastive-then-calibration\" and \"merge-then-split\"--targeting the input and output perspectives, respectively. The former samples sibling-like incorrect HOI triplets and reconstructs them into correct ones, guided by strong positional priors. The latter first learns shared features among sibling categories to distinguish them from other groups, then explicitly refines intra-group differentiation to preserve uniqueness.

Current DM sampling techniques typically rely on first-order Langevin dynamics at each noise level, with efforts concentrated on refining inter-level denoising strategies. While leveraging additional second-order Hessian geometry to enhance the sampling quality of Langevin is a common practice in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), the naive attempts to utilize Hessian geometry in high-dimensional DMs lead to quadratic-complexity computational costs, rendering them non-scalable. In this work, we introduce a novel Levenberg-Marquardt-Langevin (LML) method that approximates the diffusion Hessian geometry in a training-free manner, drawing inspiration from the celebrated Levenberg-Marquardt optimization algorithm. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) A low-rank approximation of the diffusion Hessian, leveraging the DMs' inherent structure and circumventing explicit quadratic-complexity computations; (2) A damping mechanism to stabilize the approximated Hessian. This LML approximated Hessian geometry enables the diffusion sampling to execute more accurate steps and improve the image generation quality. We further conduct a theoretical analysis to substantiate the approximation error bound of low-rank approximation and the convergence property of the damping mechanism.

Previous methods face limitations in effectively modeling object states, primarily due to their reliance on executing ambiguous instructions devoid of explicit state information. In response, we present SD^2Actor, a zero-shot robotic manipulation framework that possesses the capability to generate precise actions in continuous states. Specifically, given the novel instructions, we aim to generate instruction-following and accurate robot manipulation actions. Instead of time-consuming optimization and finetuning, our zero-shot method generalizes to any object state with a wide range of translations and versatile rotations. At its core, we quantify multiple base states in the training set and utilize their combination to refine the target action generated by the diffusion model. To obtain novel state representations, we initially employ LLMs to extract the novel state from the instruction and decompose it into multiple learned base states. We then employ the linear combination of base state embeddings to produce novel state features. Moreover, we introduce the orthogonalization loss to constrain the state embedding space, which ensures the validity of linear interpolation. Experiments demonstrate that SD^2Actor outperforms state-of-the-art methods across a diverse range of manipulation tasks in ARNOLD Benchmark.

To address this issue and facilitate the research in this field, we introduce a Synthetic Dataset for Free-Form Motion Control (SynFMC). The proposed SynFMC dataset includes diverse object and environment categories and covers various motion patterns according to specific rules, simulating common and complex real-world scenarios. The complete 6D pose information facilitates models learning to disentangle the motion effects from objects and the camera in a video. To provide precise 3D-aware motion control, we further propose a method trained on SynFMC, Free-Form Motion Control (FMC).

Moreover, it is compatible with various personalized text-to-image (T2I) models for different content styles. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed FMC outperforms previous methods across multiple scenarios",

Then we project the physical properties from multi-view 2D images to 3D Gaussians using a voting strategy. We demonstrate that 3D Gaussians with physical property annotations enable applications in physics-based dynamic simulation and robotic grasping. For physics-based dynamic simulation, we leverage the Material Point Method (MPM) for realistic dynamic simulation. For robot grasping, we develop a grasping force prediction strategy that estimates a safe force range required for object grasping based on the estimated physical properties.

While recent studies enhance feature alignment by projecting features into the source domain, they often neglect intrinsic latent domain priors, leading to suboptimal results. In this paper, we introduce PDAF, a Probabilistic Diffusion Alignment Framework that enhances the generalization of existing segmentation networks through probabilistic diffusion modeling. PDAF introduces a Latent Domain Prior (LDP) to capture domain shifts and uses this prior as a conditioning factor to align both source and unseen target domains. To achieve this, PDAF integrates into a pre-trained segmentation model and utilizes paired source and pseudo-target images to simulate latent domain shifts, enabling LDP modeling. The framework comprises three modules: the Latent Prior Extractor (LPE) predicts the LDP by supervising domain shifts; the Domain Compensation Module (DCM) adjusts feature representations to mitigate domain shifts; and the Diffusion Prior Estimator (DPE) leverages a diffusion process to estimate the LDP without requiring paired samples. This design enables PDAF to iteratively model domain shifts, progressively refining feature representations to enhance generalization under complex target conditions.

The former dynamically selects optimal experts within MoE to adapt varying scenes across domains, while the latter injects inductive bias into frozen VFMs to improve geometric feature extraction.Importantly, to mitigate computational overhead, we further propose a lightweight decision network that selectively activates MoE modules based on input complexity, balancing efficiency with accuracy.

Our method involves building reward models for visual grounding and using them to guide the MLLM's decoding process. Concretely, we build two separate reward models to independently control the degree of object precision and recall in the model's output. Our approach enables on-the-fly controllability of an MLLM's inference process in two ways: first, by giving control over the relative importance of each reward function during decoding, allowing a user to dynamically trade off object precision for recall in image captioning tasks; second, by giving control over the breadth of the search during decoding, allowing the user to control the trade-off between the amount of test-time compute and the degree of visual grounding.

Temporal action segmentation (TAS), which classifies the action in every video frame, has become essential for understanding procedural videos. Existing TAS models, however, learn a fixed-set of tasks at training and unable to adapt to novel tasks at test time. Thus, we introduce the new problem of Multi-Modal Few-shot Temporal Action Segmentation (MMF-TAS) to learn open-set models that can generalize to novel procedural tasks with minimal visual/textual examples. We propose the first MMF-TAS framework, by designing a Prototype Graph Network (PGNet). In PGNet, a Prototype Building Block summarizes action information from support videos of the novel tasks via an Action Relation Graph, and encodes this information into action prototypes via a Dynamic Graph Transformer. Next, a Matching Block compares action prototypes with query videos to infer framewise action labels. To exploit the advantages of both visual and textual modalities, we compute separate action prototypes for each modality and combine the two modalities through prediction fusion to avoid overfitting on one modality.

On dense face motion generation, our generic pre-trained model surpasses specialized baselines. FPT can be fine-tuned in strongly out-of-distribution tasks such as synthetic datasets to enable significant improvements over in-domain methods in articulated object motion estimation.

This is because conventional 3D processing pipelines do not retain any uncertainty information from the raw measurements when constructing point clouds. We propose Probabilistic Point Clouds (PPC), a novel 3D scene representation where each point is augmented with a probability attribute that encapsulates the measurement uncertainty (or confidence) in the raw data. We further introduce inference approaches that leverage PPC for robust 3D object detection; these methods are versatile and can be used as computationally lightweight drop-in modules in 3D inference pipelines.

While large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have enabled OVAR in image domains, their adaptation to event data remains underexplored. Event cameras offer high temporal resolution and inherent privacy preservation, making them suitable for capturing fine-grained motion dynamics. However, leveraging event data for OVAR presents challenges: 1) bridging the domain gap between static image-based models and event streams, and 2) preserving the generalization capabilities of pretrained VLMs in open-vocabulary settings. In this paper, we propose SAMPLE, a lightweight adaptation of VLMs for event-based action recognition, balancing supervised and open-vocabulary performance.

Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SAMPLE outperforms prior methods across fully supervised, few-shot, base-to-novel and zero-shot settings.

Additionally, we introduce a center-aware embedding strategy that reduces the vulnerability of semantic watermarking due to cropping attacks by ensuring robust information retention. To validate our approach, we apply these techniques to existing semantic watermarking schemes, enhancing their frequency-domain structures for better robustness and retrieval accuracy.

The primary challenges involve maintaining consistency across multiple views and effectively synthesizing shapes and textures under diverse conditions. In this paper, we propose the Multi-View AutoRegressive (MV-AR) method, which leverages an autoregressive model to progressively generate consistent multiview images from arbitrary prompts. Firstly, the next-tokenprediction capability of the AR model significantly enhances its effectiveness in facilitating progressive multi-view synthesis. When generating widely-separated views, MV-AR can utilize all its preceding views to extract effective reference information. Subsequently, we propose a unified model that accommodates various prompts via architecture designing and training strategies. To address multiple conditions, we introduce condition injection modules for text, camera pose, image, and shape. To manage multi-modal conditions simultaneously, a progressive training strategy is employed. This strategy initially adopts the text-to-multiview (t2mv) model as a baseline to enhance the development of a comprehensive X-to-multi-view (X2mv) model through the randomly dropping and combining conditions. Finally, to alleviate the overfitting problem caused by limited high-quality data, we propose the \"Shuffle View\" data augmentation technique, thus significantly expanding the training data by several magnitudes. Experiments demonstrate the performance and versatility of our MV-AR, which consistently generates consistent multi-view images across a range of conditions and performs on par with leading diffusion-based multi-view image generation models.

    "abstract": "Occupancy is crucial for autonomous driving, providing essential geometric priors for perception and planning. However, existing methods predominantly rely on LiDAR-based occupancy annotations, which limits scalability and prevents leveraging vast amounts of potential crowdsourced data for auto-labeling. To address this, we propose GS-Occ3D, a scalable vision-only framework that directly reconstructs occupancy. Vision-only occupancy reconstruction poses significant challenges due to sparse viewpoints, dynamic scene elements, severe occlusions, and long-horizon motion. Existing vision-based methods primarily rely on mesh representation, which suffer from incomplete geometry and additional post-processing, limiting scalability. To overcome these issues, GS-Occ3D optimizes an explicit occupancy representation using an Octree-based Gaussian Surfel formulation, ensuring efficiency and scalability. Additionally, we decompose scenes into static background, ground, and dynamic objects, enabling tailored modeling strategies: (1) Ground is explicitly reconstructed as a dominant structural element, significantly improving large-area consistency; (2) Dynamic vehicles are separately modeled to better capture motion-related occupancy patterns. Extensive experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that GS-Occ3D achieves state-of-the-art geometry reconstruction results. By curating vision-only binary occupancy labels from diverse urban scenes, we show their effectiveness for downstream occupancy models on Occ3D-Waymo and superior zero-shot generalization on Occ3D-nuScenes. It highlights the potential of large-scale vision-based occupancy reconstruction as a new paradigm for scalable auto-labeling. Project Page: https://gs-occ3d.github.io/",

    "abstract": "This prospective study proposes CoMatch, a novel semi-dense image matcher with dynamic covisibility awareness and bilateral subpixel accuracy. Firstly, observing that modeling context interaction over the entire coarse feature map elicits highly redundant computation due to the neighboring representation similarity of tokens, a covisibility-guided token condenser is introduced to adaptively aggregate tokens in light of their covisibility scores that are dynamically estimated, thereby ensuring computational efficiency while improving the representational capacity of aggregated tokens simultaneously. Secondly, considering that feature interaction with non-covisible areas is distracting, which may degrade feature distinctiveness, a covisibility-assisted attention mechanism is deployed to selectively suppress irrelevant message broadcast from non-covisible reduced tokens, resulting in robust and compact attention to relevant rather than all ones. Thirdly, we find that at the fine-level stage, current methods adjust only the target view's keypoints to subpixel level, while those in the source view remain restricted at the coarse level and thus not informative enough, detrimental to keypoint location-sensitive usages. A simple yet potent fine correlation module is developed to refine matching candidates in both source and target views to subpixel level, attaining attractive performance improvement. Thorough experimentation across an array of public benchmarks affirms CoMatch's promising accuracy, efficiency, and generalizability. Code is available at https://github.com/ZizhuoLi/CoMatch",

We further conduct thorough empirical analyses and verify that complex interactions play a primary role in OOD detection, by developing a simple-yet-efficient method to force the DNN to learn interactions of specific complexities and evaluate the change of OOD detection performances. Besides, we also use interactions to investigate why near-OOD samples are more difficult to distinguish from in-distribution (ID) samples than far-OOD samples, mainly because compared to far-OOD samples, the distribution of interactions in near-OOD samples is more similar to that of ID samples.

However, as these models grow larger, deploying and fine-tuning them becomes increasingly challenging. While conventional quantization techniques help reduce model size, they struggle to achieve high compression rates without significant performance loss. As a result, memory footprint remains a critical challenge for generative models. In this work, we explore the extreme compression of generative models through codebook quantization, drastically reducing model size while maintaining performance. We extend product quantization for model compression, significantly increasing codebook capacity, which is crucial for preserving the generative quality of diffusion models. We also introduce a codebook compression method for memory efficiency. To further minimize performance degradation, we develop EM calibration with re-initialization that optimizes both assignments and centroids. By compressing the model to as low as 1 bit (achieving a 13xreduction in model size), we obtain a highly compact generative model with remarkable image quality. Extensive experiments on ImageNet demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing techniques.

However, existing USL-VI-ReID methods rely on artificially cross-modality paired data as implicit supervision, which is also expensive for human annotation and contrary to the setting of unsupervised tasks. In addition, this full alignment of identity across modalities is inconsistent with real-world scenarios, where unpaired settings are prevalent. To this end, we study the USL-VI-ReID task under unpaired settings, which uses cross-modality unpaired and unlabeled data for training a VI-ReID model. We propose a novel Mapping and Collaborative Learning (MCL) framework. Specifically, we first design a simple yet effective Cross-modality Feature Mapping (CFM) module to map and generate fake cross-modality positive feature pairs, constructing a cross-modal pseudo-identity space for feature alignment. Then, a Static-Dynamic Collaborative (SDC) learning strategy is proposed to align cross-modality correspondences through a collaborative approach, eliminating inter-modality discrepancies across different aspects i.e., cluster-level and instance-level, in scenarios with cross-modal identity mismatches.

    "abstract": "Federated Unsupervised Learning (FUL) aims to learn expressive representations in federated and self-supervised settings. The quality of representations learned in FUL is usually determined by uniformity, a measure of how uniformly representations are distributed in the embedding space. However, existing solutions perform well in achieving intra-client (local) uniformity for local models while failing to achieve inter-client (global) uniformity after aggregation due to non-IID data distributions and the decentralized nature of FUL. To address this issue, we propose Soft Separation and Distillation (SSD), a novel approach that preserves inter-client uniformity by encouraging client representations to spread toward different directions. This design reduces interference during client model aggregation, thereby improving global uniformity while preserving local representation expressiveness. We further enhance this effect by introducing a projector distillation module to address the discrepancy between loss optimization and representation quality. We evaluate SSD in both cross-silo and cross-device federated settings, demonstrating consistent improvements in representation quality and task performance across various training scenarios. Our results highlight the importance of inter-client uniformity in FUL and establish SSD as an effective solution to this challenge. Project page: https://ssd-uniformity.github.io/",

To exploit these relationships, TaxaDiffusion progressively trains conditioned diffusion models across different taxonomic levels --- starting from broad classifications such as Class and Order, refining through Family and Genus, and ultimately distinguishing at the Species level. This hierarchical learning strategy first captures coarse-grained morphological traits shared by species with common ancestors, facilitating knowledge transfer, before refining fine-grained differences for species-level distinction. As a result, TaxaDiffusion enables accurate generation even with limited training samples per species. Extensive experiments on three fine-grained animal datasets demonstrate that TaxaDiffusion outperforms existing approaches, achieving superior fidelity in fine-grained animal image generation.

We introduce MEMFOF, a memory-efficient multi-frame optical flow method that identifies a favorable trade-off between multi-frame estimation and GPU memory usage. Notably, MEMFOF requires only 2.09 GB of GPU memory at runtime for 1080p inputs, and 28.5 GB during training, which uniquely positions our method to be trained at native 1080p without the need for cropping or downsampling. We systematically revisit design choices from RAFT-like architectures, integrating reduced correlation volumes and high-resolution training protocols alongside multi-frame estimation, to achieve state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks while substantially reducing memory overhead. Our method outperforms more resource-intensive alternatives in both accuracy and runtime efficiency, validating its robustness for flow estimation at high resolutions. At the time of submission, our method ranks first on the Spring benchmark with a 1-pixel (1px) outlier rate of 3.289, leads Sintel (clean) with an endpoint error (EPE) of 0.963, and achieves the best Fl-all error on KITTI-2015 at 2.94%.

    "abstract": "The matching formulation makes it naturally hard for the stereo matching to handle ill-posed regions like occlusions and non-Lambertian surfaces. Fusing monocular priors has been proven helpful for ill-posed matching, but the biased monocular prior learned from small stereo datasets constrains the generalization. Recently, stereo matching has progressed by leveraging the unbiased monocular prior from the vision foundation model (VFM) to improve the generalization in ill-posed regions. We dive into the fusion process and observe three main problems limiting the fusion of the VFM monocular prior. The first problem is the misalignment between affine-invariant relative monocular depth and absolute depth of disparity. Besides, when we use the monocular feature in an iterative update structure, the over-confidence in the disparity update leads to local optima results. A direct fusion of a monocular depth map could alleviate the local optima problem, but noisy disparity results computed at the first several iterations will misguide the fusion. In this paper, we propose a binary local ordering map to guide the fusion, which converts the depth map into a binary relative format, unifying the relative and absolute depth representation. The computed local ordering map is also used to re-weight the initial disparity update, resolving the local optima and noisy problem. In addition, we formulate the final direct fusion of monocular depth to the disparity as a registration problem, where a pixel-wise linear regression module can globally and adaptively align them. Our method fully exploits the monocular prior to support stereo matching results effectively and efficiently. We significantly improve the performance from the experiments when generalizing from SceneFlow to Middlebury and Booster datasets while barely reducing the efficiency",

    "abstract": "Recently, the field of 3D scene stylization has attracted considerable attention, particularly for applications in the metaverse. A key challenge is rapidly transferring the style of an arbitrary reference image to a 3D scene while faithfully preserving its content structure and spatial layout. Works leveraging implicit representations with gradient-based optimization achieve impressive style transfer results, yet the lengthy processing time per individual style makes rapid switching impractical. In this paper, we propose A^3GS, a novel feed-forward neural network for zero-shot 3DGS stylization that enables transferring any image style to arbitrary 3D scenes in just 10 seconds without the need for per-style optimization. Our work introduces a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)-based autoencoder aimed at efficient feature aggregation and decoding of spatially structured 3D Gaussian scenes. The encoder converts 3DGS scenes into a latent space. Furthermore, for the latent space, we utilize Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) to inject features from the target style image into the 3D Gaussian scene. Finally, we constructed a 3DGS dataset using a generative model and proposed a two-stage training strategy for A^3GS. Owing to the feed-forward design, our framework can perform fast style transfer on large-scale 3DGS scenes, which poses a severe challenge to the memory consumption of optimization-based methods.

    "abstract": "The zero-shot performance of object detectors degrades when tested on different modalities, such as infrared and depth. While recent work has explored image translation techniques to adapt detectors to new modalities, these methods are limited to a single modality and traditional detectors. Recently, vision-language detectors (VLDs), such as YOLO-World and Grounding DINO, have shown promising zero-shot capabilities; however, they have not yet been adapted for other visual modalities. Traditional fine-tuning approaches compromise the zero-shot capabilities of the detectors. The visual prompt strategies commonly used for classification with vision-language models apply the same linear prompt translation to each image, making them less effective. To address these limitations, we propose ModPrompt, a visual prompt strategy to adapt VLDs to new modalities without degrading zero-shot performance. In particular, an encoder-decoder visual prompt strategy is proposed, further enhanced by the integration of inference-friendly modality prompt decoupled residual, facilitating a more robust adaptation. Empirical benchmarking results show our method for modality adaptation on YOLO-World and Grounding DINO for challenging infrared (LLVIP, FLIR) and depth (NYUv2) datasets, achieving performance comparable to full fine-tuning while preserving the model's zero-shot capability.

Unlike existing noise optimization methods designed for specific models, our approach is grounded in a fundamental examination of the generic finite-step noise scheduler design in diffusion formulation, allowing better generalization across different diffusion-based architectures in a tuning-free manner. This model-agnostic nature allows us to construct a reusable noise library compatible with multiple T2I models and enhancement techniques, serving as a foundational layer for more effective generation.

We propose a plug-and-play method named AnyBimanual, which transfers pretrained unimanual policy to general bimanual manipulation policy with few bimanual demonstrations.

To mitigate the observation discrepancy between unimanual and bimanual systems, we present a visual aligner to generate soft masks for visual embedding, which aims to align visual input of unimanual policy model for each arm with those during pretraining stage. AnyBimanual shows superiority on 12 simulated tasks from RLBench2 with a sizable 17.33% improvement in success rate over previous methods.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we tackle the task of online video temporal grounding (OnVTG), which requires the model to locate events related to a given text query within a video stream. Unlike regular video temporal grounding, OnVTG requires the model to make predictions without observing future frames. As online videos are streaming inputs and can go on indefinitely, it is impractical and inefficient to store all historical inputs. The existing OnVTG models employ memory to store recent historical video frame features and predict scores indicating whether the current frame corresponds to the start or end time of the target event. However, these methods lack effective event modeling and cannot retain long-term historical information, leading to low performance. To tackle these challenges, we propose a hierarchical event memory for OnVTG. We propose an event-based OnVTG framework that makes predictions based on event proposals that model event-level information with various durations. To preserve historically valuable event information, we introduce a hierarchical event memory that retains historical events, allowing the model to access both recent and long-term information. To enable the real-time prediction, we further propose a future prediction branch that predicts whether the target event will occur shortly and further regresses the start time of the event.

    "abstract": "Multimodal large language models(MLLMs) have demonstrated promising spatial understanding capabilities, such as referencing and grounding object descriptions. Despite their successes, MLLMs still fall short in fine-grained spatial perception abilities, such as generating detailed region descriptions or accurately localizing objects. Additionally, they often fail to respond to the user's requirements for desired fine-grained spatial understanding. This issue might arise because existing approaches primarily focus on tuning MLLMs to model pre-annotated instruction data to inject spatial knowledge, without direct supervision of MLLMs' actual responses. We address this issue by SPR, a Spatial Preference Rewarding(SPR) approach that enhances MLLMs' spatial capabilities by rewarding MLLMs' detailed responses with precise object localization over vague or inaccurate responses. With randomly selected image regions and region descriptions from MLLMs, SPR introduces semantic and localization scores to comprehensively evaluate the text quality and localization quality in MLLM-generated descriptions. We also refine the MLLM descriptions with better localization accuracy and pair the best-scored refinement with the initial descriptions of the lowest score for direct preference optimization, thereby enhancing fine-grained alignment with visual input. Extensive experiments over standard referring and grounding benchmarks show that SPR improves MLLM spatial understanding capabilities effectively with minimal overhead in training.

    "abstract": "Large vision models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) exhibit significant limitations when applied to downstream tasks in the wild. Consequently, reference segmentation, which leverages reference images and their corresponding masks to impart novel knowledge to the model, emerges as a promising new direction for adapting vision models. However, existing reference segmentation approaches predominantly rely on meta-learning, which still necessitates an extensive meta-training process and brings massive data and computational cost. In this study, we propose a novel approach by representing the inherent correspondence between reference-target image pairs as a pseudo video. This perspective allows the latest version of SAM, known as SAM2, which is equipped with interactive video object segmentation (iVOS) capabilities, to be adapted to downstream tasks in a lightweight manner. We term this approach Correspondence As Video for SAM (CAV-SAM). CAV-SAM comprises two key modules: the Diffusion-Based Semantic Transition (DBST) module employs a diffusion model to construct a semantic transformation sequence, while the Test-Time Geometric Alignment (TTGA) module aligns the geometric changes within this sequence through test-time fine-tuning. We evaluated CAV-SAM on widely-used datasets, achieving segmentation performance improvements exceeding 5% over SOTA methods. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/wanghr64/cav-sam",

Our analysis reveals distinct dependency patterns that do not straightforwardly correlate with depth, offering new insights into the layer-specific roles in RoPE-based MMDiT.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in intuitive 3D segmentation from 2D images have demonstrated impressive performance. However, current models typically require extensive scene-specific training to accurately reconstruct and segment objects, which limits their applicability in real-time scenarios. In this paper, we introduce WildSeg3D, an efficient approach that enables the segmentation of arbitrary 3D objects across diverse environments using a feed-forward mechanism. A key challenge of this feed-forward approach lies in the accumulation of 3D alignment errors across multiple 2D views, which can lead to inaccurate 3D segmentation results. To address this issue, we propose Dynamic Global Aligning (DGA), a technique that improves the accuracy of global multi-view alignment by focusing on difficult-to-match 3D points across images, using a dynamic adjustment function. Additionally, for real-time intuitive segmentation, we introduce Multi-view Group Mapping (MGM), a method that utilizes an object mask cache to integrate multi-view segmentations and respond rapidly to user prompts. WildSeg3D demonstrates robust generalization across arbitrary scenes, thereby eliminating the need for scene-specific training.

    "abstract": "Recognizing and reasoning about occluded (partially or fully hidden) objects is vital to understanding visual scenes, as occlusions frequently occur in real-world environments and act as obstacles for spatial comprehension. To test models' ability to reason about multiple occluded objects, we introduce a novel task, Counting Amodally for Patterns Through Unseen REgions (CAPTURe), which requires a model to count objects arranged in a pattern by inferring how the pattern continues behind an occluder (an object which blocks parts of the scene). CAPTURe requires both recognizing visual patterns and reasoning, making it a useful testbed for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs) on whether they understand occluded patterns and possess spatial understanding skills. By requiring models to reason about occluded objects, CAPTURe also tests VLMs' ability to form world models that would allow them to fill in missing information. CAPTURe consists of two parts: (1) CAPTURe-real, with manually filtered images of real objects in patterns and (2) CAPTURe-synthetic, a controlled diagnostic with generated patterned images. We evaluate four strong VLMs (GPT-4o, Intern-VL2, Molmo, and Qwen2-VL) on CAPTURe, finding that models struggle to count on both occluded and unoccluded patterns. Crucially, we find that models perform worse with occlusion, suggesting that VLMs are also deficient in inferring unseen spatial relationships: even the strongest VLMs like GPT-4o fail to count with occlusion. In contrast, we find that humans achieve very little error on CAPTURe. We also find that providing auxiliary information of occluded object locations increases performance, underscoring that the model error comes both from an inability to handle occlusion as well as difficulty in counting in images",

While prior studies have predominantly concentrated on improving vision-language interactions and achieving fine-grained localization, a systematic analysis of the fundamental bottlenecks in existing RIS frameworks remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose DeRIS , a novel framework that decomposes RIS into two key components: perception and cognition . This modular decomposition facilitates a systematic analysis of the primary bottlenecks impeding RIS performance. Our findings reveal that the predominant limitation lies not in perceptual deficiencies, but in the insufficient multi-modal cognitive capacity of current models. To mitigate this, we propose a Loopback Synergy mechanism, which enhances the synergy between the perception and cognition modules, thereby enabling precise segmentation while simultaneously improving robust image-text comprehension. Additionally, we analyze and introduce a simple non-referent sample conversion data augmentation to address the long-tail distribution issue related to target existence judgement in general scenarios.

    "abstract": "Monocular 3D human pose estimation (HPE) methods estimate the 3D positions of joints from individual images. Existing 3D HPE approaches often use the cropped image alone as input for their models. However, the relative depths of joints cannot be accurately estimated from cropped images without the corresponding camera intrinsics, which determine the perspective relationship between 3D objects and the cropped images. In this work, we introduce Perspective Encoding (PE) to encode the camera intrinsics of the cropped images. Moreover, since the human subject can appear anywhere within the original image, the perspective relationship between the 3D scene and the cropped image differs significantly, which complicates model fitting. Additionally, the further the human subject deviates from the image center, the greater the perspective distortions in the cropped image. To address these issues, we propose Perspective Rotation (PR), a transformation applied to the original image that centers the human subject, thereby reducing perspective distortions and alleviating the difficulty of model fitting. By incorporating PE and PR, we propose a novel 3D HPE framework, PersPose. Experimental results demonstrate that PersPose achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the 3DPW, MPI-INF-3DHP, and Human3.6M datasets. For example, on the in-the-wild dataset 3DPW, PersPose achieves an MPJPE of 60.1 mm, 7.54% lower than the previous SOTA approach. Code is available at: https://github.com/KenAdamsJoseph/PersPose",

This architectural shift presents significant challenges for existing editing techniques. In this paper, we systematically analyze MM-DiT's attention mechanism by decomposing attention matrices into four distinct blocks, revealing their inherent characteristics. Through these analyses, we propose a robust, prompt-based image editing method for MM-DiT that supports global to local edits across various MM-DiT variants, including few-step models.

    "abstract": "Super-resolution (SR) has been a pivotal task in image processing, aimed at enhancing image resolution across various applications. Recently, look-up table (LUT)-based approaches have attracted interest due to their efficiency and performance. However, these methods are typically designed for fixed scale factors, making them unsuitable for arbitrary-scale image SR (ASISR). Existing ASISR techniques often employ implicit neural representations, which come with considerable computational cost and memory demands. To address these limitations, we propose Interpolation Mixing LUT (IM-LUT), a novel framework that operates ASISR by learning to blend multiple interpolation functions to maximize their representational capacity. Specifically, we introduce IM-Net, a network trained to predict mixing weights for interpolation functions based on local image patterns and the target scale factor. To enhance efficiency of interpolation-based methods, IM-Net is transformed into IM-LUT, where LUTs are employed to replace computationally expensive operations, enabling lightweight and fast inference on CPUs while preserving reconstruction quality. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that IM-LUT consistently achieves a superior balance between image quality and efficiency compared to existing methods, highlighting its potential as a promising solution for resource-constrained applications",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recent advances in text-to-image synthesis largely benefit from sophisticated sampling strategies and classifier-free guidance (CFG) to ensure high-quality generation. However, CFG's reliance on two forward passes, especially when combined with intricate sampling algorithms, results in prohibitively high inference costs. To address this, we introduce TeEFusion (Text Embeddings Fusion), a novel and efficient distillation method that directly incorporates the guidance magnitude into the text embeddings and distills the teacher model's complex sampling strategy. By simply fusing conditional and unconditional text embeddings using linear operations, TeEFusion reconstructs the desired guidance without adding extra parameters, simultaneously enabling the student model to learn from the teacher's output produced via its sophisticated sampling approach. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art models such as SD3 demonstrate that our method allows the student to closely mimic the teacher's performance with a far simpler and more efficient sampling strategy. Consequently, the student model achieves inference speeds up to 6xfaster than the teacher model, while maintaining image quality at levels comparable to those obtained through the teacher's complex sampling approach.

Training SAM with this dataset enables it to generate precise matte masks while maintaining its zero-shot capability. Second, we design the zero-shot matting model equipped with a hierarchical pixel decoder to enhance mask representation, along with a prompt-aware masked attention mechanism to improve performance by enabling the model to focus on regions specified by visual prompts. We evaluate ZIM using the newly introduced MicroMat-3K test set, which contains high-quality micro-level matte labels. Experimental results show that ZIM outperforms existing methods in fine-grained mask generation and zero-shot generalization. Furthermore, we demonstrate the versatility of ZIM in various downstream tasks requiring precise masks, such as image inpainting and 3D segmentation.

    "title": "Heuristic-Induced Multimodal Risk Distribution Jailbreak Attack for Multimodal Large Language Models",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), concerns regarding their security have increasingly captured the attention of both academia and industry. Although MLLMs are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, designing effective jailbreak attacks poses unique challenges, especially given the highly constrained adversarial capabilities in real-world deployment scenarios. Previous works concentrate risks into a single modality, resulting in limited jailbreak performance. In this paper, we propose a heuristic-induced multimodal risk distribution jailbreak attack method, called HIMRD, which is black-box and consists of two elements: multimodal risk distribution strategy and heuristic-induced search strategy. The multimodal risk distribution strategy is used to distribute harmful semantics into multiple modalities to effectively circumvent the single-modality protection mechanisms of MLLMs. The heuristic-induced search strategy identifies two types of prompts: the understanding-enhancing prompt, which helps MLLMs reconstruct the malicious prompt, and the inducing prompt, which increases the likelihood of affirmative outputs over refusals, enabling a successful jailbreak attack. HIMRD achieves an average attack success rate (ASR) of 90% across seven open-source MLLMs and an average ASR of around 68% in three closed-source MLLMs. HIMRD reveals cross-modal security vulnerabilities in current MLLMs and underscores the imperative for developing defensive strategies to mitigate such emerging risks.

On top of conventional token compression approaches, our method introduces two complementary acceleration strategies. For training acceleration, we observe that Feed-Forward Network (FFN) computations on visual tokens induce marginal feature updates. This motivates our Skip-FFN strategy, which bypasses FFN layers for redundant visual tokens. For inference acceleration, we design a selective KV-cache removal mechanism that prunes the skipped key-value pairs during decoding while preserving model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that Skip-Vision reduces training time by up to 35%, inference FLOPs by 75%, and latency by 45%, while achieving comparable or superior performance to existing methods.

In the second stage, these enriched queries are grounded, using a lightweight decoder, which specializes at predicting accurate boundaries conditioned on contextualized representations of the enriched queries. To mitigate noise and reduce the impact of hallucinations, our model is trained with a multiple-instance-learning objective that dynamically selects the optimal version of the query for each training sample.

    "abstract": "Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) utilizes Class Activation Maps (CAMs) to extract spatial cues from image-level labels. However, CAMs highlight only the most discriminative foreground regions, leading to incomplete results. Recent Vision Transformer-based methods leverage class-patch attention to enhance CAMs, yet they still suffer from partial activation due to the token gap: classification-focused class tokens prioritize discriminative features, while patch tokens capture both discriminative and non-discriminative characteristics. This mismatch prevents class tokens from activating all relevant features, especially when discriminative and non-discriminative regions exhibit significant differences. To address this issue, we propose Optimal Transport-assisted Proxy Learning (OTPL), a novel framework that bridges the token gap by learning adaptive proxies. OTPL introduces two key strategies: (1) optimal transport-assisted proxy learning, which combines class tokens with their most relevant patch tokens to produce comprehensive CAMs, and (2) optimal transport-enhanced contrastive learning, aligning proxies with confident patch tokens for bounded proxy exploration. Our framework overcomes the limitation of class tokens in activating patch tokens, providing more complete and accurate CAM results.

MaskSAM introduces a prompt generator integrated with SAM's image encoder to produce auxiliary classifier tokens, binary masks, and bounding boxes.

In this paper, we investigate the critical but underexplored problem of keeping LMM's good performance while protecting visual privacy information in the input data. We tackle this problem in the practical scenario where the LMM remains a black box, i.e., we can only access its input and output without knowing the LMM's internal information. To address such a challenging problem, we propose a new Privacy-Aware Boundary Probing (PABP) framework, which, from a novel perspective, converts this problem into a privacy optimization problem guided by the decision boundary between the \"satisfactory\" and \"unsatisfactory\" LMM utility states. We propose two tailored schemes, Gradually-Expanding-Probing (GEP) and Prior-Guided-Probing (PGP), to maintain satisfactory LMM performance while achieving privacy protection.

In this paper, we introduce Refined Logit Distillation (RLD) to address the limitations of current logit distillation methods. Our approach is motivated by the observation that even high-performing teacher models can make incorrect predictions, creating an exacerbated divergence between the standard distillation loss and the cross-entropy loss, which can undermine the consistency of the student model's learning objectives. Previous attempts to use labels to empirically correct teacher predictions may undermine the class correlations. In contrast, our RLD employs labeling information to dynamically refine teacher logits. In this way, our method can effectively eliminate misleading information from the teacher while preserving crucial class correlations, thus enhancing the value and efficiency of distilled knowledge.

Moreover, we design a Dynamic Cross-Guided module that integrates both initial and updated target features to address pose variations in long-term tracking. This module captures the latest target information to generate highly relevant candidate regions and refines them through precise optimization to achieve more accurate tracking results. Extensive experiments performed on the TDTIV and the well-recognized Anti-UAV 410 datasets have demonstrated the superiority of MCATrack over state-of-the-art competing trackers.

    "abstract": "Text-guided video prediction (TVP) involves predicting the motion of future frames from the initial frame according to an instruction, which has wide applications in virtual reality, robotics, and content creation. Previous TVP methods make significant breakthroughs by adapting Stable Diffusion for this task. However, they struggle with frame consistency and temporal stability primarily due to the limited scale of video datasets. We observe that pretrained Image2Video diffusion models possess good video dynamics priors but lack fine-grained textual control. Hence, transferring pretrained models to leverage their video dynamic priors while injecting fine-grained control to generate controllable videos is both a meaningful and challenging task. To achieve this, we introduce the Multi-Modal Large Language Model (MLLM) to predict future video states based on initial frames and text instructions. More specifically, we design a dual query transformer (DQFormer) architecture, which integrates the instructions and frames into the conditional embeddings for future frame prediction. Additionally, we develop Temporal and Spatial Adapters that can quickly transfer general video diffusion models to specific scenarios with minimal training costs. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on four datasets: Something Something V2, Epic Kitchen-100, Bridge Data, and UCF-101. Notably, AID achieves 91.2% and 55.5% FVD improvements on Bridge and SSv2 respectively, demonstrating its effectiveness in various domains",

Despite strong performance, LMMs' generative outputs are not specialized for vision-language classification tasks (i.e., tasks with vision-language inputs and discrete labels) such as image classification and multiple-choice VQA. One key challenge in utilizing LMMs for these tasks is the extraction of useful features from generative LMMs. To overcome this, we propose an approach that leverages multimodal feature extraction from the LMM's latent space. Toward this end, we present Sparse Attention Vectors (SAVs)---a finetuning-free method that leverages sparse attention head activations (fewer than 5% of the heads) in LMMs as strong feature representations. With only few-shot examples, SAVs demonstrate state-of-the-art performance compared to a variety of few-shot and finetuned baselines on a collection of vision-language classification tasks.

    "abstract": "Pre-trained vision-language models have exhibited remarkable abilities in detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. However, some challenging OOD samples, which lie close to in-distribution (InD) data in image feature space, can still lead to misclassification. The emergence of foundation models like diffusion models and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offers a potential solution to this issue. In this work, we propose SynOOD, a novel approach that harnesses foundation models to generate synthetic, challenging OOD data for fine-tuning CLIP models, thereby enhancing boundary-level discrimination between InD and OOD samples. Our method uses an iterative in-painting process guided by contextual prompts from MLLMs to produce nuanced, boundary-aligned OOD samples. These samples are refined through noise adjustments based on gradients from OOD scores like the energy score, effectively sampling from the InD/OOD boundary. With these carefully synthesized images, we fine-tune the CLIP image encoder and negative label features derived from the text encoder to strengthen connections between near-boundary OOD samples and a set of negative labels. Finally, SynOOD achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale ImageNet benchmark, with minimal increases in parameters and runtime.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We propose a splat-based 3D scene reconstruction method from RGB-D input that effectively handles extreme motion blur, a frequent challenge in low-light environments. Under dim illumination, RGB frames often suffer from severe motion blur due to extended exposure times, causing traditional camera pose estimation methods, such as COLMAP, to fail. This results in inaccurate camera pose and blurry color input, compromising the quality of 3D reconstructions. Although recent 3D reconstruction techniques like Neural Radiance Fields and Gaussian Splatting have demonstrated impressive results, they rely on accurate camera trajectory estimation, which becomes challenging under fast motion or poor lighting conditions. Furthermore, rapid camera movement and the limited field of view of depth sensors reduce point cloud overlap, limiting the effectiveness of pose estimation with the ICP algorithm. To address these issues, we introduce a method that combines camera pose estimation and image deblurring using a Gaussian Splatting framework, leveraging both 3D Gaussian splats and depth inputs for enhanced scene representation. Our method first aligns consecutive RGB-D frames through optical flow and ICP, then refines camera poses and 3D geometry by adjusting Gaussian positions for optimal depth alignment. To handle motion blur, we model camera movement during exposure and deblur images by comparing the input with a series of sharp, rendered frames. Experiments on a new RGB-D dataset with extreme motion blur show that our method outperforms existing approaches, enabling high-quality reconstructions even in challenging conditions. This approach has broad implications for 3D mapping applications in robotics, autonomous navigation, and augmented reality.

While existing studies have made significant progress in achieving superior performance on clean datasets, the challenge of robustness under various corruptions remains largely unexplored. However, the lack of proper testing environments for corrupted conditions persists as a challenge, since extensive collection of new person images attempting to cover numerous corruption scenarios inevitably introduces privacy concerns. In this context, we establish an evaluation framework for analyzing corruption robustness using existing publicly available data, and introduce two new benchmarks: CUHK-SYSU-C and PRW-C. Based on this framework incorporating 18 corruptions with 5 severity levels each, we conduct an extensive robustness evaluation of popular person search methods. Moreover, we explore a straightforward solution that naturally arises: integrating corruption-robust detection and re-identification models. Our experiments reveal that existing person search models remain highly vulnerable to corruption, and this issue is not resolved by the simple integration approach. To analyze the underlying reasons, we further investigate the vulnerability of the detection and representation stages to corruption and explore its impact on both foreground and background areas. Based on these analyses, we propose a foreground-aware augmentation and corresponding robust proposal regularizer to enhance the robustness of person search models. Supported by our comprehensive robustness analysis and evaluation framework our benchmarks provide, our proposed technique substantially improves the robustness of existing person search models",

However, frequent cooperative interactions and real-time requirements impose stringent bandwidth constraints. Previous works proves that query-based instance-level interaction reduces bandwidth demands and manual priors, however, LiDAR-focused implementations in collaborative perception remain underdeveloped, with performance still trailing state-of-the-art approaches. To bridge this gap, we propose INSTINCT (instance-level interaction architecture), a novel collaborative perception framework featuring three core components: 1) a quality-aware filtering mechanism for high-quality instance feature selection; 2) a dual-branch detection routing scheme to decouple collaboration-irrelevant and collaboration-relevant instances; 3) a Cross Agent Local Instance Fusion module to aggregate local hybrid instance features. Additionally, we enhance the ground truth (GT) sampling technique to facilitate training with diverse hybrid instance features. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that INSTINCT achieves superior performance. Specifically, our method achieves an improvement in accuracy 13.23%/32.24% in DAIR-V2X and V2V4Real while reducing the communication bandwidth to 1/281 and 1/264 compared to state-of-the-art methods.

These prompts are then utilized to initialize learnable OOD prompts and optimized with adaptive prompt learning. Also, OOD pseudo-samples are synthesised via gaussian outlier synthesis.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed remarkable advances in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), which have achieved human-level performance across various complex vision-language tasks. Following LLaVA's paradigm, mainstream LVLMs typically employ a shallow MLP for visual-language alignment through a two-stage training process: pretraining for cross-modal alignment followed by instruction tuning. While this approach has proven effective, the underlying mechanisms of how MLPs bridge the modality gap remain poorly understood. Although some research has explored how LLMs process transformed visual tokens, few studies have investigated the fundamental alignment mechanism. Furthermore, the MLP adapter requires retraining whenever switching LLM backbones. To address these limitations, we first investigate the working principles of MLP adapters and discover that they learn to project visual embeddings into subspaces spanned by corresponding text embeddings progressively. Based on this insight, we propose LangBridge, a novel adapter that explicitly maps visual tokens to linear combinations of LLM vocabulary embeddings. This innovative design enables pretraining-free adapter transfer across different LLMs while maintaining performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that a LangBridge adapter pre-trained on Qwen2-0.5B can be directly applied to larger models such as LLaMA3-8B or Qwen2.5-14B while maintaining competitive performance. Overall, LangBridge enables interpretable vision-language alignment by grounding visual representations in LLM vocab embedding, while its plug-and-play design ensures efficient reuse across multiple LLMs with nearly no performance degradation.

Specifically, AR models suffer from spatial poverty of attention maps and sequential accumulation of structural errors during image editing, which disrupt object layouts and global consistency. In this work, we introduce Implicit Structure Locking (*ISLock*), the first training-free editing strategy for AR visual models. Rather than relying on explicit attention manipulation or fine-tuning, *ISLock* preserves structural blueprints by dynamically aligning self-attention patterns with reference images through the Anchor Token Matching (*ATM*) protocol. By implicitly enforcing structural consistency in latent space, our method *ISLock* enables structure-aware editing while maintaining generative autonomy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that *ISLock* achieves high-quality, structure-consistent edits without additional training and is superior or comparable to conventional editing techniques. Our findings pioneer the way for efficient and flexible AR-based image editing, further bridging the performance gap between diffusion and autoregressive generative models",

    "abstract": "Reliable integration of prior information is crucial for self-verifying and self-updating HD maps. However, no public dataset includes the required triplet of prior maps, current maps, and sensor data. As a result, existing methods must rely on synthetic priors, which create inconsistencies and lead to a significant sim2real gap. To address this, we introduce ArgoTweak, the first dataset to complete the triplet with realistic map priors. At its core, ArgoTweak employs a bijective mapping framework, breaking down large-scale modifications into fine-grained atomic changes at the map element level, thus ensuring interpretability. This paradigm shift enables accurate change detection and integration while preserving unchanged elements with high fidelity. Experiments show that training models on ArgoTweak significantly reduces the sim2real gap compared to synthetic priors. Extensive ablations further highlight the impact of structured priors and detailed change annotations. By establishing a benchmark for explainable, prior-aided HD mapping, ArgoTweak advances scalable, self-improving mapping solutions.

After training, only the prompts are shared by the clients with the central server for aggregation. However, textual prompt tuning suffers from overfitting to known concepts, limiting its generalizability to unseen concepts. To address this limitation, we propose Multimodal Visual Prompt Tuning (FedMVP) that conditions the prompts on multimodal contextual information - derived from the input image and textual attribute features of a class. At the core of FedMVP is a PromptFormer module that synergistically aligns textual and visual features through a cross-attention mechanism. The dynamically generated multimodal visual prompts are then input to the frozen vision encoder of CLIP, and trained with a combination of CLIP similarity loss and a consistency loss. Extensive evaluation on 20 datasets, spanning three generalization settings, demonstrates that FedMVP not only preserves performance on in-distribution classes and domains, but also displays higher generalizability to unseen classes and domains, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by a notable margin of +1.57% - 2.26%.

However, existing methods show severe performance degradation when applied to noisy datasets. To address this, we present robust dataset condensation (RDC), an end-to-end method that mitigates noise to generate a clean and robust synthetic set, without requiring separate noise-reduction preprocessing steps. RDC refines the condensation process by integrating contrastive learning tailored for robust condensation, named golden MixUp contrast. It uses synthetic samples to sharpen class boundaries and to mitigate noisy representations, while its augmentation strategy compensates for the limited size of the synthetic set by identifying clean samples from noisy training data, enriching synthetic images with real-data diversity. We evaluate RDC against existing condensation methods and a conventional approach that first applies noise cleaning algorithms to the dataset before performing condensation. Extensive experiments show that RDC outperforms other approaches on CIFAR-10/100 across different types of noise, including asymmetric, symmetric, and real-world noise.

However, despite their popularity, these models rely on user-provided text and image prompts, and there is currently no dedicated dataset for studying these prompts. In this paper, we introduce TIP-I2V, the first large-scale dataset of over 1.70 million unique user-provided Text and Image Prompts specifically for Image-to-Video generation. Additionally, we provide the corresponding generated videos from five state-of-the-art image-to-video models.

Next, we compare TIP-I2V to two popular prompt datasets, VidProM (text-to-video) and DiffusionDB (text-to-image), highlighting differences in both basic and semantic information. This dataset enables advancements in image-to-video research. For instance, to develop better models, researchers can use the prompts in TIP-I2V to analyze user preferences and evaluate the multi-dimensional performance of trained models; and to enhance model safety, they may focus on addressing the misinformation issue caused by image-to-video models.

Extensive experiments demonstrate its significant effectiveness in both image and video synthesis, especially in high acceleration ratios.For instance, it achieves an almost lossless acceleration of 4.99xon FLUX and 5.00xon HunyuanVideo without additional training.

    "abstract": "With the increasing demand for the right to be forgotten, machine unlearning (MU) has emerged as a vital tool for enhancing trust and regulatory compliance by enabling the removal of sensitive data influences from machine learning (ML) models. However, most MU algorithms primarily rely on in-training methods to adjust model weights, with limited exploration of the benefits that data-level adjustments could bring to the unlearning process. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach that leverages digital watermarking to facilitate MU by strategically modifying data content. By integrating watermarking, we establish a controlled unlearning mechanism that enables precise removal of specified data while maintaining model utility for unrelated tasks. We first examine the impact of watermarked data on MU, finding that MU effectively generalizes to watermarked data. Building on this, we introduce an unlearning-friendly watermarking framework, termed Water4MU, to enhance unlearning effectiveness. The core of Water4MU is a bi-level optimization (BLO) framework: at the upper level, the watermarking network is optimized to minimize unlearning difficulty, while at the lower level, the model itself is trained independently of watermarking. Experimental results demonstrate that Water4MU is effective in MU across both image classification and image generation tasks. Notably, it outperforms existing methods in challenging MU scenarios, known as \"challenging forgets\"",

    "abstract": "Layout-to-image (L2I) generation has exhibited promising results in natural domains, but suffers from limited generative fidelity and weak alignment with user-provided layouts when applied to degraded scenes (i.e., low-light, underwater). We primarily attribute these limitations to the \"contextual illusion dilemma\" in degraded conditions, where foreground instances are overwhelmed by context-dominant frequency distributions. Motivated by this, our paper proposes a new Frequency-Inspired Contextual Disentanglement Generative (FICGen) paradigm, which seeks to transfer frequency knowledge of degraded images into the latent diffusion space, thereby facilitating the rendering of degraded instances and their surroundings via contextual frequency-aware guidance. To be specific, FICGen consists of two major steps. Firstly, we introduce a learnable dual-query mechanism, each paired with a dedicated frequency resampler, to extract contextual frequency prototypes from pre-collected degraded exemplars in the training set. Secondly, a visual-frequency enhanced attention is employed to inject frequency prototypes into the degraded generation process. To alleviate the contextual illusion and attribute leakage, an instance coherence map is developed to regulate latent-space disentanglement between individual instances and their surroundings, coupled with an adaptive spatial-frequency aggregation module to reconstruct spatial-frequency mixed degraded representations. Extensive experiments on 5 benchmarks involving a variety of degraded scenarios--from severe low-light to mild blur--demonstrate that FICGen consistently surpasses existing L2I methods in terms of generative fidelity, alignment and downstream auxiliary trainability",

Motivated by this gap, we propose UMIVR, an Uncertainty-Minimizing Interactive Text-to-Video Retrieval framework that explicitly quantifies three critical uncertainties-text ambiguity, mapping uncertainty, and frame uncertainty-via principled, training-free metrics: semantic entropy-based Text Ambiguity Score (TAS), Jensen-Shannon divergence-based Mapping Uncertainty Score (MUS), and a Temporal Quality-based Frame Sampler (TQFS). By adaptively generating targeted clarifying questions guided by these uncertainty measures, UMIVR iteratively refines user queries, significantly reducing retrieval ambiguity.

In this paper, we investigate layer-wise redundancy in MLLMs by introducing a novel metric, Layer Contribution (LC), which quantifies the impact of a layer's transformations on visual and text tokens, respectively. The calculation of LC involves measuring the divergence in model output that results from removing the layer's transformations on the specified tokens. Our pilot experiment reveals that many layers of MLLMs exhibit minimal contribution during the processing of visual tokens. Motivated by this observation, we propose ShortV, a training-free method that leverages LC to identify ineffective layers, and freezes visual token updates in these layers. Experiments show that ShortV can freeze visual token in approximately 60% of the MLLM layers, thereby dramatically reducing computational costs related to updating visual tokens.

Weakly supervised affordance grounding (WSAG) seeks to imitate human learning from third-person demonstrations, where humans intuitively grasp functional parts without needing pixel-level annotations. To achieve this, grounding is typically learned using a shared classifier across images from different perspectives, along with distillation strategies incorporating part discovery process. However, since affordance-relevant parts are not always easily distinguishable, models primarily rely on classification, often focusing on common but unaffordable features. To address this limitation, we move beyond isolated part-level learning by introducing selective prototypical and pixel contrastive objectives that adaptively learn affordance-relevant cues at both the part and object levels, depending on the granularity of the available information. Initially, we find the action-associated objects in both egocentric (object-focused) and exocentric (third-person example) images by leveraging CLIP. Then, cross-referencing the discovered objects of complementary views, we excavate the precise part-level affordance clues in each perspective.

While recent multimodal MIL pretraining approaches leveraging auxiliary modalities have demonstrated performance gains over unimodal WSI pretraining, the acquisition of these additional modalities necessitates extensive clinical profiling. This requirement increases costs and limits scalability in existing WSI datasets lacking such paired modalities. To address this, we propose Gigapixel Vision-Concept Knowledge Contrastive pretraining (GECKO), which aligns WSIs with a Concept Prior derived from the available WSIs. First, we derive an inherently interpretable concept prior by computing the similarity between each WSI patch and textual descriptions of predefined pathology concepts. GECKO then employs a dual-branch MIL network: one branch aggregates patch embeddings into a WSI-level deep embedding, while the other aggregates the concept prior to a corresponding WSI-level concept embedding. Both aggregated embeddings are aligned using a contrastive objective, thereby pretraining the entire dual-branch MIL model. Moreover, when auxiliary modalities such as transcriptomics data are available, GECKO seamlessly integrates them. Across five diverse tasks, GECKO consistently outperforms prior unimodal and multimodal pretraining approaches while also delivering clinically meaningful interpretability that bridges the gap between computational models and pathology expertise.

    "abstract": "Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced out-of-distribution (OOD) detection recently. However, existing CLIP-based methods often focus on learning OOD-related knowledge to improve OOD detection, showing limited generalization or reliance on external large-scale auxiliary datasets. In this study, instead of delving into the intricate OOD-related knowledge, we propose an innovative CLIP-based framework based on Forced prompt leArning (FA), designed to make full use of the In-Distribution (ID) knowledge and ultimately boost the effectiveness of OOD detection. Our key insight is to learn a prompt (i.e., forced prompt) that contains more diversified and richer descriptions of the ID classes beyond the textual semantics of class labels. Specifically, it promotes better discernment for ID images, by forcing more notable semantic similarity between ID images and the learnable forced prompt. Moreover, we introduce a forced coefficient, encouraging the forced prompt to learn more comprehensive and nuanced descriptions of the ID classes. In this way, FA is capable of achieving notable improvements in OOD detection, even when trained without any external auxiliary datasets, while maintaining an identical number of trainable parameters as CoOp. Extensive empirical evaluations confirm our method consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at https://github.com/0xFAFA/FA",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are commonly derived by extending pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) with visual capabilities. In this work, we investigate how MLLMs process visual inputs by analyzing their attention mechanisms. We reveal a surprising sparsity phenomenon: only a small subset (approximately less than 5%) of attention heads in LLMs actively contribute to visual understanding, termed visual heads. To identify these heads efficiently, we design a training-free framework that quantifies head-level visual relevance through targeted response analysis. Building on this discovery, we introduce SparseMM, a KV-Cache optimization strategy that allocates asymmetric computation budgets to heads in LLMs based on their visual scores, leveraging the sparity of visual heads for accelerating the inference of MLLMs. Compared with prior KV-Cache acceleration methods that ignore the particularity of visual, SparseMM prioritizes stress and retaining visual semantics during decoding. Extensive evaluations across mainstream multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that SparseMM achieves superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. Notably, SparseMM delivers 1.38x real-time acceleration and 52% memory reduction during generation while maintaining performance parity on efficiency test.

In this paper, we introduce the Attribute-aware Prompt Attack (AP-Attack), a novel method that leverages VLM's image-text alignment capability to explicitly disrupt fine-grained semantic features of pedestrian images by destroying attribute-specific textual embeddings. To obtain personalized textual descriptions for individual attributes, textual inversion networks are designed to map pedestrian images to pseudo tokens that represent semantic embeddings, trained in the contrastive learning manner with images and a predefined prompt template that explicitly describes the pedestrian attributes. Inverted benign and adversarial fine-grained textual semantics facilitate attacker in effectively conducting thorough disruptions, enhancing the transferability of adversarial examples.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The fine-tuning of large vision-language foundation models remains an underexplored area, particularly regarding its impact on learning gains and catastrophic forgetting. Inspired by the significance of modality gaps in contrastive dual-encoders, we introduce the Inter-Intra Modal Measure (IIMM)--a predictive metric that quantifies the relationship between intra-modal image embedding similarity and inter-modal misalignment. Through extensive empirical analysis across four state-of-the-art vision-language models and five fine-tuning techniques, we establish a strong linear relationship: tasks with higher IIMM scores yield greater in-domain performance improvements but suffer from more pronounced out-of-domain degradation, with some parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods exhibiting severe forgetting. Compared to existing transferability measures, the IIMM demonstrates significantly stronger predictive power for accuracy changes post fine-tuning in dual-encoder models. Moreover, we provide a theoretical bound, proving that changes in IIMM are limited by the Wasserstein distance between pre- and post-fine-tuning embedding distributions, ensuring its stability and robustness as a predictive measure. With only a single forward pass of the target data, practitioners can leverage this key insight to evaluate the degree to which a model can be expected to improve following fine-tuning. When combined with prior knowledge of a model's performance across diverse tasks, the IIMM further enhances transferability predictions for novel tasks, offering a lightweight yet effective tool for guiding model adaptation strategies.

    "title": "DualReal: Adaptive Joint Training for Lossless Identity-Motion Fusion in Video Customization",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Customized text-to-video generation with pre-trained large-scale models has recently garnered significant attention by focusing on identity and motion consistency. Existing works typically follow the isolated customized paradigm, where the subject identity or motion dynamics are customized exclusively. However, this paradigm completely ignores the intrinsic mutual constraints and synergistic interdependencies between identity and motion, resulting in identity-motion conflicts throughout the generation process that systematically degrade. To address this, we introduce DualReal, a novel framework that employs adaptive joint training to construct interdependencies between dimensions collaboratively. Specifically, DualReal is composed of two units: (1) Dual-aware Adaptation dynamically switches the training step (i.e., identity or motion), learns the current information guided by the frozen dimension prior, and employs a regularization strategy to avoid knowledge leakage; (2) StageBlender Controller leverages the denoising stages and Diffusion Transformer depths to guide different dimensions with adaptive granularity, avoiding conflicts at various stages and ultimately achieving lossless fusion of identity and motion patterns. We constructed a more comprehensive evaluation benchmark than existing methods. The experimental results show that DualReal improves CLIP-I and DINO-I metrics by 21.7% and 31.8% on average, and achieves top performance on nearly all motion metrics.

First, we develop a simulated dataset called Hard-case Augmented Synthetic Scenarios (HASS), which covers 13 high-risk edge-case categories, as well as balanced environmental conditions such as day/night and sunny/rainy. Second, we introduce Scenario-aware Prompt Engineering (SPE) and an Image-to-Ego Encoder (I2E Encoder) to enable multimodal large language models to effectively learn real-world challenging driving skills from HASS, via adapting to environmental deviations and hardware differences between real-world and simulated scenarios. Extensive experiments on nuScenes show that RoboTron-Sim improves driving performance in challenging scenarios by 50%, achieving state-of-the-art results in real-world open-loop planning.

To prevent the student from entirely losing its architecture-specific capabilities, we further design a lightweight module that decouples the RSD objective from the student's internal representations. Our method is devoid of the architecture-specific designs and complex operations in the pioneering method of OFA.

    "abstract": "Inertial tracking (IT), independent of the environment and external infrastructure, has long been the ideal solution for providing location services to humans. Despite significant strides in inertial tracking empowered by deep learning, prevailing neural inertial tracking predominantly utilizes conventional spatial-temporal features from inertial measurements. Unfortunately, the frequency domain dimension is usually overlooked in the current literature. To this end, in this paper, we propose a Multi-Domain Mixture of Experts model for Neural Inertial Tracking, named M^2EIT. Specifically, M^2EIT first leverages ResNet as a spatial decomposition expert to capture spatial relationships between multivariate timeseries, and State Space Model (SSM)-based Bi-Mamba, the other expert to focus on learning temporal correlations. In the frequency domain mapping, we then introduce the Wavelet-based frequency decomposition expert, which decomposes IMU samples into low-frequency bands and high-frequency bands using the Haar wavelet transform for simulating motion patterns at different temporal scales. To bridge the semantic gap across multiple domains and integrate them adaptively, we design the Multi-Representation Alignment Router (MAR), which consists of a dual cross-domain translation layer, followed by a dynamic router, to achieve multi-domain semantic alignment and optimize expert contributions. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed M^2EIT can achieve SOTA results in neural inertial tracking",

More specifically, we employ the recently researched trajectory-preserving few-step diffusion model, which enables a shortcut over the original denoising chain, and construct a shortcut-based denoising chain of shorter length. The optimization on this chain notably enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of fine-tuning the foundational model.

In response to these limitations, we propose a traceable and authorizable copyright traceability method that embeds the copyright watermark into images through a series of invertible compound coupling modules. We introduce a novel information exchange mechanism for invertible neural network and design a contrastive learning-based optimization strategy tailored to address personalized infringement issues.

This inconsistency highly results in mis-labeling where different language embeddings are assigned to the same part of an object. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet powerful method that aligns language embeddings via the identity information. The key idea is to locate language embeddings for the same identity closely in the latent space while putting them apart otherwise. This approach allows the same object to have identical language embeddings in novel views with accurate semantic masks, which are well aligned with the input text. Furthermore, we propose a progressive mask expanding scheme that enables more accurate extraction of semantic mask boundaries.

    "abstract": "As large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) gain prominence, ensuring their safe deployment has become critical. Recent studies have explored VLM robustness against jailbreak attacks--techniques that exploit model vulnerabilities to elicit harmful outputs. However, the limited availability of diverse multimodal data has constrained current approaches to rely heavily on adversarial or manually crafted images derived from harmful text datasets, which often lack effectiveness and diversity across different contexts. In this paper, we propose IDEATOR, a novel jailbreak method that autonomously generates malicious image-text pairs for black-box jailbreak attacks. IDEATOR is grounded in the insight that VLMs themselves could serve as powerful red team models for generating multimodal jailbreak prompts. Specifically, IDEATOR leverages a VLM to create targeted jailbreak texts and pairs them with jailbreak images generated by a state-of-the-art diffusion model. Extensive experiments demonstrate IDEATOR's high effectiveness and transferability, achieving a 94% attack success rate (ASR) in jailbreaking MiniGPT-4 with an average of only 5.34 queries, and high ASRs of 82%, 88%, and 75% when transferred to LLaVA, InstructBLIP, and Chameleon, respectively. Building on IDEATOR's strong transferability and automated process, we introduce the VLJailbreakBench, a safety benchmark comprising 3,654 multimodal jailbreak samples. Our benchmark results on 11 recently released VLMs reveal significant gaps in safety alignment.

We introduce Degradation-Modeled Multipath Diffusion for tunable metalens photography, leveraging powerful natural image priors from pretrained models instead of large datasets. Our framework uses positive, neutral, and negative-prompt paths to balance high-frequency detail generation, structural fidelity, and suppression of metalens-specific degradation, alongside pseudo data augmentation. A tunable decoder enables controlled trade-offs between fidelity and perceptual quality. Additionally, a spatially varying degradation-aware attention (SVDA) module adaptively models complex optical and sensor-induced degradation. Finally, we design and build a millimeter-scale MetaCamera for real-world validation.

Existing methods excel at view interpolation along recorded paths but struggle to generalize to novel trajectories due to limited viewpoints in driving videos. To tackle this challenge, we propose DriveX, a novel free-form driving view synthesis framework, that progressively distills generative prior into the 3D Gaussian model during its optimization. Within this framework, we utilize a video diffusion model to refine the degraded novel trajectory renderings from the in-training Gaussian model, while the restored videos in turn serve as additional supervision for optimizing the 3D Gaussian. Concretely, we craft an inpainting-based video restoration task, which can disentangle the identification of degraded regions from the generative capability of the diffusion model and remove the need of simulating specific degraded pattern in the training of the diffusion model. To further enhance the consistency and fidelity of generated contents, the pseudo ground truth is progressively updated with gradually improved novel trajectory rendering, allowing both components to co-adapt and reinforce each other while minimizing the disruption on the optimization. By tightly integrating 3D scene representation with generative prior, DriveX achieves high-quality view synthesis beyond recorded trajectories in real time--unlocking new possibilities for flexible and realistic driving simulations on free-form trajectories",

Our experiments demonstrate the superior performance of cwFedAvg over existing PFL methods through efficient personalization while maintaining the communication cost of FedAvg and avoiding additional local training and pairwise computations",

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) is a popular radiance field method, with many application-specific extensions. Most variants rely on the same core algorithm: depth-sorting of Gaussian splats then rasterizing in primitive order. This ensures correct alpha compositing, but can cause rendering artifacts due to built-in approximations. Moreover, for a fixed representation, sorted rendering offers little control over render cost and visual fidelity. For example, and counter-intuitively, rendering a lower-resolution image is not necessarily faster. In this work, we address the above limitations by combining 3D Gaussian splatting with stochastic rasterization. Concretely, we leverage an unbiased Monte Carlo estimator of the volume rendering equation. This removes the need for sorting, and allows for accurate 3D blending of overlapping Gaussians. The number of Monte Carlo samples further imbues 3DGS with a way to trade off computation time and quality. We implement our method using OpenGL shaders, enabling efficient rendering on modern GPU hardware. At a reasonable visual quality, our method renders more than four times faster than sorted rasterization",

    "abstract": "Long-Tailed Class-Incremental Learning (LT-CIL) remains a fundamental challenge due to biased gradient updates caused by highly imbalanced data distributions and the inherent stability-plasticity dilemma. These factors jointly degrade tail-class performance and exacerbate catastrophic forgetting. To tackle these issues, we propose Geometric Prototype Alignment (GPA), a model-agnostic approach that calibrates classifier learning dynamics via geometric feature-space alignment. GPA initializes classifier weights by projecting frozen class prototypes onto a unit hypersphere, thereby disentangling magnitude imbalance from angular discriminability. During incremental updates, a Dynamic Anchoring mechanism adaptively adjusts classifier weights to preserve geometric consistency, effectively balancing plasticity for new classes with stability for previously acquired knowledge. Integrated into state-of-the-art CIL frameworks such as LUCIR and DualPrompt, GPA yields substantial gains, improving average incremental accuracy by 6.11% and reducing forgetting rates by 6.38% on CIFAR100-LT. Theoretical analysis further demonstrates that GPA accelerates convergence by 2.7X and produces decision boundaries approaching Fisher-optimality.

To address these limitations, we propose a transformer-based model to efficiently reconstruct dense 3D point clouds of hand-held objects. Our method follows a coarse-to-fine strategy, first generating a sparse point cloud from the image and progressively refining it into a dense representation using pixel-aligned image features. To enhance reconstruction accuracy, we integrate image features with 3D hand geometry to jointly predict the object point cloud and its pose relative to the hand.

    "abstract": "Despite recent advances in diffusion models, achieving reliable image generation and editing results remains challenging due to the inherent diversity induced by stochastic noise in the sampling process. Particularly, instruction-guided image editing with diffusion models offers user-friendly editing capabilities, yet editing failures, such as background distortion, frequently occur across different attempts. Users often resort to trial and error, adjusting seeds or prompts to achieve satisfactory results, which is inefficient.While seed selection methods exist for Text-to-Image (T2I) generation, they depend on external verifiers, limiting their applicability, and evaluating multiple seeds increases computational complexity, reducing practicality.To address this, we first establish a new multiple-seed-based image editing baseline using background consistency scores, achieving Best-of-N performance without supervision. Building on this, we introduce ELECT (Early-timestep Latent Evaluation for Candidate Selection), a zero-shot framework that selects reliable seeds by estimating background mismatches at early diffusion timesteps, identfying the seed that retains the background while modifying only the foreground. ELECT ranks seed candidates by a background inconsistency score, filtering unsuitable samples early based on background consistency while fully preserving editability.Beyond standalone seed selection, ELECT integrates into instruction-guided editing pipelines and extends to Multimodal Large-Language Models (MLLMs) for joint seed + prompt selection, further improving results when seed selection alone is insufficient. Experiments show that ELECT reduces computational costs (by 41% on average and up to 61%) while improving background consistency and instruction adherence, achieving around 40% success rates in previously failed cases--without any external supervision or training",

    "abstract": "We present a novel framework for training 3D image-conditioned diffusion models using only 2D supervision. Recovering 3D structure from 2D images is inherently ill-posed due to the ambiguity of possible reconstructions, making generative models a natural choice. However, most existing 3D generative models rely on full 3D supervision, which is impractical due to the scarcity of large-scale 3D datasets. To address this, we propose leveraging sparse-view supervision as a scalable alternative. While recent reconstruction models use sparse-view supervision with differentiable rendering to lift 2D images to 3D, they are predominantly deterministic, failing to capture the diverse set of plausible solutions and producing blurry predictions in uncertain regions. A key challenge in training 3D diffusion models with 2D supervision is that the standard training paradigm requires both the denoising process and supervision to be in the same modality. We address this by decoupling the noisy samples being denoised from the supervision signal, allowing the former to remain in 3D while the latter is provided in 2D. Our approach leverages suboptimal predictions from a deterministic image-to-3D model--acting as a \"teacher\"--to generate noisy 3D inputs, enabling effective 3D diffusion training without requiring full 3D ground truth. We validate our framework on both object-level and scene-level datasets, using two different 3D Gaussian Splat (3DGS) teachers.

However, aligning medical images with a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to reports with a high SNR presents a semantic density gap, leading to visual alignment bias. In this paper, we propose boosting vision semantic density to improve alignment effectiveness. On the one hand, we enhance visual semantics through disease-level vision contrastive learning, which strengthens the model's ability to differentiate between normal and abnormal samples for each anatomical structure. On the other hand, we introduce an anatomical normality modeling method to model the distribution of normal samples for each anatomy, leveraging VQ-VAE for reconstructing normal vision embeddings in latent space. This process amplifies abnormal signals by leveraging distribution shifts in abnormal samples, enhancing the model's perception and discrimination of abnormal attributes. The enhanced visual representation effectively captures the diagnostic-relevant semantics, facilitating more efficient and accurate alignment with the diagnostic report. We conduct extensive experiments on two chest CT datasets, CT-RATE and Rad-ChestCT, and an abdominal CT dataset, MedVL-69K, and comprehensively evaluate the diagnosis performance across multiple tasks in the chest and abdominal CT scenarios, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot performance.

As point clouds serve as a widely-used and easily accessible form of 3D representation, bridging the gap between point clouds and Gaussians becomes increasingly important. Recent studies have explored how to convert the colored points into Gaussians, but directly generating Gaussians from colorless 3D point clouds remains an unsolved challenge. In this paper, we propose GAP, a novel approach that gaussianizes raw point clouds into high-fidelity 3D Gaussians with text guidance. Our key idea is to design a multi-view optimization framework that leverages a depth-aware image diffusion model to synthesize consistent appearances across different viewpoints. To ensure geometric accuracy, we introduce a surface-anchoring mechanism that effectively constrains Gaussians to lie on the surfaces of 3D shapes during optimization. Furthermore, GAP incorporates a diffuse-based inpainting strategy that specifically targets at completing hard-to-observe regions. We evaluate GAP on the Point-to-Gaussian generation task across varying complexity levels, from synthetic point clouds to challenging real-world scans, and even large-scale scenes.

This challenge is further exacerbated by the limited context length of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). To address this issue, many previous works have attempted to extract key video information, where the \"key\" is typically semantic-aware and heavily dependent on the CLIP model as prior. In this paper, we propose Flow4Agent, a novel framework that pioneeringly incorporates motion priors from optical flow to facilitate LLM-based long video understanding. Flow4Agent mitigates the redundancy in long videos at both temporal and spatial levels through two core modules: Temporal Granularity Optimization (TGO) adaptively refines frame-level hierarchies, which first leverages coarse flow priors to group similar visual contents and then applies semantic priors to filter out highly irrelevant scene information. Motion Token Pruning (MTP) further refines the intra-frame visual representations, pruning high-redundancy video tokens using fine-grained optical flow information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Flow4Agent outperforms existing methods across a wide range of video MLLM benchmarks, especially for hour-level video understanding tasks, achieving 64.7% on Video-MME, 71.4% on MLVU and 60.4% on LongVideoBench",

    "abstract": "Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) pre-trained on extensive corpora have shown significant success in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks with minimal fine-tuning. This success offers new promise for robotics, which has long been constrained by the high cost of action-labeled data. We ask: given the abundant video data containing interaction-related knowledge available as a rich \"corpus\", can a similar generative pre-training approach be effectively applied to enhance robot learning? The key challenge is to identify an effective representation for autoregressive pre-training that benefits robot manipulation tasks.Inspired by the way humans learn new skills through observing dynamic environments, we propose that effective robotic learning should emphasize motion-related knowledge, which is closely tied to low-level actions and is hardware-agnostic, facilitating the transfer of learned motions to actual robot actions. To this end, we introduce Moto, which converts video content into latent Motion Token sequences by a Latent Motion Tokenizer, learning a bridging \"language\" of motion from videos in an unsupervised manner. We pre-train Moto-GPT through motion token autoregression, enabling it to capture diverse visual motion knowledge. After pre-training, Moto-GPT demonstrates the promising ability to produce semantically interpretable motion tokens, predict plausible motion trajectories, and assess trajectory rationality through output likelihood.To transfer learned motion priors to real robot actions, we implement a co-fine-tuning strategy that seamlessly bridges latent motion token prediction and real robot control. Extensive experiments show that the fine-tuned Moto-GPT exhibits superior robustness and efficiency on robot manipulation benchmarks, underscoring its effectiveness in transferring knowledge from video data to downstream visual manipulation tasks",

However, incorporating causal relations as seen in real-world videos into synthetic videos remains challenging. This work argues that precisely identifying the accident participants and capturing their related behaviors are of critical importance. In this regard, we propose a novel diffusion model Causal-VidSyn for synthesizing egocentric traffic accident videos. To enable causal entity grounding in video diffusion, Causal-VidSyn leverages the cause descriptions and driver fixations to identify the accident participants and behaviors, facilitated by accident reason answering and gaze-conditioned selection modules. To support Causal-VidSyn, we further construct Drive-Gaze, the largest driver gaze dataset (with 1.54M frames of fixations) in driving accident scenarios. Extensive experiments show that Causal-VidSyn surpasses state-of-the-art video diffusion models in terms of frame quality and causal sensitivity in various tasks, including accident video editing, normal-to-accident video diffusion, and text-to-video generation",

Most existing methods rely on object pose annotations, using these poses to reconstruct dynamic objects and move them during the rendering process.

To address this challenge, we propose Bezier curve Gaussian splatting (BezierGS), which represents the motion trajectories of dynamic objects using learnable Bezier curves. This approach fully leverages the temporal information of dynamic objects and, through learnable curve modeling, automatically corrects pose errors. By introducing additional supervision on dynamic object rendering and inter-curve consistency constraints, we achieve reasonable and accurate separation and reconstruction of scene elements.

To address these real-world application issues, we propose RealCam-I2V, a novel diffusion-based video generation framework that integrates monocular metric depth estimation to establish 3D scene reconstruction in a preprocessing step. During training, the reconstructed 3D scene enables scaling camera parameters from relative to metric scales, ensuring compatibility and scale consistency across diverse real-world images.

We address this task with a novel encoder-decoder approach that encodes the scene's key properties from an audio-visual observation and generates the target Room Impulse Response (RIR) conditioned on the material specifications provided by the user.

Previous works based on neural radiance field or 3D Gaussian splatting are limited to modeling fine-scale motion, greatly restricting their application. In this paper, we introduce \\ourname, which consists of two parts to adapt our method to both large-scale and fine-scale motion scenes:1) We decompose a complex dynamic scene into streamlined local spaces defined by seeds, enabling global modeling by capturing motion within each local space.2) We decouple static and dynamic features for local space motion modeling. A static feature shared across time steps captures static information, while a dynamic residual field provides time-specific features. These are combined and decoded to generate Temporal Gaussians, modeling motion within each local space.As a result, we propose a novel dynamic scene reconstruction framework to model highly dynamic real-world scenes more realistically.

This framework treats each stage of LIC models as an independent sub-task, mirroring the teacher model's task decomposition to the student, thereby simplifying knowledge transfer. We identify two crucial factors determining the effectiveness of knowledge distillation: student model construction and loss function design. Specifically, we first propose Teacher-Guided Student Model Construction, a pruning-like method ensuring architectural consistency between teacher and student models. Next, we introduce Implicit End-to-end Supervision, facilitating adaptive energy compaction and bitrate regularization. Based on these insights, we develop KDIC, a lightweight student model derived from the state-of-the-art S2CFormer model.

However, the substantial computational and resource demands associated with training on large datasets have prompted interest in training-free methods for OVSS. Existing training-free approaches primarily focus on modifying model architectures and generating prototypes to improve segmentation performance. However, they often neglect the challenges posed by class redundancy, where multiple categories are not present in the current test image, and visual-language ambiguity, where semantic similarities among categories create confusion in class activation. These issues can lead to suboptimal class activation maps and affinity-refined activation maps. Motivated by these observations, we propose FreeCP, a novel training-free class purification framework designed to address these challenges. FreeCP focuses on purifying semantic categories and rectifying errors caused by redundancy and ambiguity. The purified class representations are then leveraged to produce final segmentation predictions. We conduct extensive experiments across eight benchmarks to validate FreeCP's effectiveness.

The existing disentangling methods require an explicit parametric form for the transformation, which is unavailable for conformation, making these methods unsuitable. To overcome this limitation, we propose DualContrast, a novel contrastive learning-based method that implicitly parameterizes and disentangles both transformation and content. DualContrast achieves this by generating positive and negative pairs for content and transformation in both data and latent spaces. We demonstrate that existing self-supervised approaches fail under similar implicit parameterization, underscoring the necessity of our method.

Initially, we train the face recognition model using a real face dataset and create a feature space for both real and virtual identities, where virtual prototypes are orthogonal to other prototypes. Subsequently, we train the diffusion model based on the established feature space, enabling it to generate authentic human face images from real prototypes and synthesize virtual face images from virtual prototypes.Our proposed framework provides two significant benefits. Firstly, it shows clear separability between existing individuals and virtual face images, allowing one to create synthetic images with confidence and without concerns about privacy and portrait rights.

    "abstract": "Current object re-identification (ReID) methods train domain-specific models (e.g., for persons or vehicles), which lack generalization and demand costly labeled data for new categories. While self-supervised learning reduces annotation needs by learning instance-wise invariance, it struggles to capture identity-sensitive features critical for ReID. This paper proposes Visual In-Context Prompting (VICP), a novel framework where models trained on seen categories can directly generalize to unseen novel categories using only in-context examples as prompts, without requiring parameter adaptation. VICP synergizes LLMs and vision foundation models (VFM): LLMs infer semantic identity rules from few-shot positive/negative pairs through task-specific prompting, which then guides a VFM (e.g., DINO) to extract ID-discriminative features via dynamic visual prompts. By aligning LLM-derived semantic concepts with the VFM's pre-trained prior, VICP enables generalization to novel categories, eliminating the need for dataset-specific retraining. To support evaluation, we introduce ShopID10K, a dataset of 10K object instances from e-commerce platforms, featuring multi-view images and cross-domain testing.

    "abstract": "Recent Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) advancements are promising, but their idealized assumptions about robot movement and control fail to reflect physically embodied deployment challenges. To bridge this gap, we introduce VLN-PE, a physically realistic VLN platform supporting humanoid, quadruped, and wheeled robots. For the first time, we systematically evaluate several ego-centric VLN methods in physical robotic settings across different technical pipelines, including classification models for single-step discrete action prediction, a diffusion model for dense waypoint prediction, and a train-free, map-based large language model (LLM) integrated with path planning. Our results reveal significant performance degradation due to limited robot observation space, environmental lighting variations, and physical challenges like collisions and falls. This also exposes locomotion constraints for legged robots in complex environments. VLN-PE is highly extensible, allowing seamless integration of new scenes beyond MP3D, thereby enabling more comprehensive VLN evaluation. Despite the weak generalization of current models in physical deployment, VLN-PE provides a new pathway for improving cross-embodiment's overall adaptability. We hope our findings and tools inspire the community to rethink VLN limitations and advance robust, practical VLN models. The code is available at https://crystalsixone.github.io/vln_pe.github.io/",

    "abstract": "With the advancement of RNN models with linear complexity, the quadratic complexity challenge of transformers has the potential to be overcome. Notably, the emerging Mamba-2 has demonstrated competitive performance, bridging the gap between RNN models and transformers. However, due to sequential processing and vanishing gradients, RNN models struggle to capture long-range dependencies, limiting contextual understanding. This results in slow convergence, high resource demands, and poor performance on downstream understanding and complex reasoning tasks. In this work, we present MaTVLM, a method for distilling pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) into an efficient Mamba-Transformer hybrid architecture. Specifically, we construct this hybrid architecture by replacing a portion of the transformer decoder layers in the pre-trained VLM with Mamba-2 layers. Building on this design, we employ a single-stage distillation process, incorporating a clever initialization strategy, leveraging the inherent relationship between attention mechanisms and Mamba-2, and initialize Mamba-2 with corresponding attention weights, which notably accelerates convergence. With the pre-trained VLM serving as the teacher model, this distillation process further boosts both convergence speed and model performance. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of differential distillation loss within our training framework. We evaluate MaTVLM on multiple benchmarks, demonstrating competitive performance against the teacher model and existing VLMs while surpassing both Mamba-based VLMs and models of comparable parameter scales. Remarkably, MaTVLM achieves up to 4.3 times faster inference than the teacher model while reducing GPU memory consumption by 27.5%, all without compromising performance.

    "abstract": "Fitting a body to a 3D clothed human point cloud is a common yet challenging task. Traditional optimization-based approaches use multi-stage pipelines that are sensitive to pose initialization, while recent learning-based methods often struggle with generalization across diverse poses and garment types. We propose Equivariant Tightness Fitting for Clothed Humans, or ETCH, a novel pipeline that estimates cloth-to-body surface mapping through locally approximate SE(3) equivariance, encoding tightness as displacement vectors from the cloth surface to the underlying body. Following this mapping, pose-invariant body features regress sparse body markers, simplifying clothed human fitting into an inner-body marker fitting task. Extensive experiments on CAPE and 4D-Dress show that ETCH significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods -- both tightness-agnostic and tightness-aware -- in body fitting accuracy on loose clothing (16.7% 69.5%) and shape accuracy (average 49.9%). Our equivariant tightness design can even reduce directional errors by (67.2% 89.8%) in one-shot (or out-of-distribution) settings ( 1% data). Qualitative results demonstrate strong generalization of ETCH, regardless of challenging poses, unseen shapes, loose clothing, and non-rigid dynamics.

    "abstract": "Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to recognize unseen classes without labeled training examples by leveraging class-level semantic descriptors such as attributes. A fundamental challenge in ZSL is semantic misalignment, where semantic-unrelated information involved in visual features introduce ambiguity to visual-semantic interaction. Unlike existing methods that suppress semantic-unrelated information post hoc either in the feature space or the model space, we propose addressing this issue at the input stage, preventing semantic-unrelated patches from propagating through the network. To this end, we introduce Semantically contextualized VIsual Patches (SVIP) for ZSL, a transformer-based framework designed to enhance visual-semantic alignment. Specifcally, we propose a self-supervised patch selection mechanism that preemptively learns to identify semantic-unrelated patches in the input space. This is trained with the supervision from aggregated attention scores across all transformer layers, which estimate each patch's semantic score. As removing semantic-unrelated patches from the input sequence may disrupt object structure, we replace them with learnable patch embeddings. With initialization from word embeddings, we can ensure they remain semantically meaningful throughout feature extraction. Extensive experiments on ZSL benchmarks demonstrate that SVIP achieves state-of-the-art performance results while providing more interpretable and semantically rich feature representations.

    "title": "Forgetting Through Transforming: Enabling Federated Unlearning via Class-Aware Representation Transformation",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Federated Unlearning (FU) should satisfy three key requirements: a guarantee of data erasure, preservation of model utility, and reduction of unlearning time. Recent studies focus on identifying and modifying original model parameters relevant to unlearning data. While they can achieve faster unlearning, they degrade the model performance on remaining data or fail to forget unlearning data due to the difficulty in isolating specific parameters of the unlearning data. By revisiting the representation distribution of the optimal unlearning models (i.e., the retrained models), we observe that unlearning data tends to cluster within semantically related categories of remaining data. This inspired us to transform the distribution of unlearning data to fuse with similar categories in the remaining data for effective FU. Based on this insight, we propose a novel framework, named FUCRT, to achieve Federated Unlearning via Class-aware Representation Transformation. FUCRT consists of two key components: (1) a transformation class identification strategy (TCI) that leverages the original model to identify appropriate transformation classes for unlearning data, and (2) a targeted transformation learning process (TTL) with cross-class fusion mechanism to ensure effective and consistent transformation. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that FUCRT not only achieves 100% of data erasure but also outperforms state-of-the-art methods by an average of 2.96% and 3.78% in utility preservation under IID and Non-IID settings, respectively.

    "abstract": "Neural surface reconstruction faces persistent challenges in reconciling geometric fidelity with photometric consistency under complex scene conditions. We present HiNeuS, a unified framework that holistically addresses three core limitations in existing approaches: multi-view radiance inconsistency, missing keypoints in textureless regions, and structural degradation from over-enforced Eikonal constraints during joint optimization. To resolve these issues through a unified pipeline, we introduce: 1) Differential visibility verification through SDF-guided ray tracing, resolving reflection ambiguities via continuous occlusion modeling; 2) Planar-conformal regularization via ray-aligned geometry patches that enforce local surface coherence while preserving sharp edges through adaptive appearance weighting; and 3) Physically-grounded Eikonal relaxation that dynamically modulates geometric constraints based on local radiance gradients, enabling detail preservation without sacrificing global regularity. Unlike prior methods that handle these aspects through sequential optimizations or isolated modules, our approach achieves cohesive integration where appearance-geometry constraints evolve synergistically throughout training. Comprehensive evaluations across synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate SotA performance, including a 21.4% reduction in Chamfer distance over reflection-aware baselines and 2.32 dB PSNR improvement against neural rendering counterparts. Qualitative analyses reveal superior capability in recovering specular instruments, urban layouts with centimeter-scale infrastructure, and low-textured surfaces without local patch collapse. The method's generalizability is further validated through successful application to inverse rendering tasks, including material decomposition and view-consistent relighting.

To address these issues, we propose Revised Direct Preference Optimization (RDPO), a simple but effective step-wise DPO-based text-to-image diffusion model alignment method. By designing a more theoretically grounded and efficient intermediate-step reward estimation and introducing an additional regularization terms to constrain the sampling probability of dispreferred samples, RDPO can achieve more effective and stable text-to-image alignment performance.

In this context, only a pre-trained model and unlabeled test data are available, making it particularly relevant for privacy-sensitive applications. In practice, we observe that feature redundancy in embeddings tends to increase as domain shifts intensify in TTA. However, existing TTA methods often overlook this redundancy, which can hinder the model's adaptability to new data. To address this issue, we introduce Feature Redundancy Elimination for Test-time Adaptation (FRET), a novel perspective for TTA. A straightforward approach (S-FRET) is to directly minimize the feature redundancy score as an optimization objective to improve adaptation. Despite its simplicity and effectiveness, S-FRET struggles with label shifts, limiting its robustness in real-world scenarios. To mitigate this limitation, we further propose Graph-based FRET (G-FRET), which integrates a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) with contrastive learning. This design not only reduces feature redundancy but also enhances feature discriminability in both the representation and prediction layers. Extensive experiments across multiple model architectures, tasks, and datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of S-FRET and show that G-FRET achieves state-of-the-art performance. Further analysis reveals that G-FRET enables the model to extract non-redundant and highly discriminative features during inference, thereby facilitating more robust test-time adaptation",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "To generate 3D objects, early research focused on multi-view-driven approaches relying solely on 2D renderings. Recently, the 3D native latent diffusion paradigm has demonstrated superior performance in 3D generation, because it fully leverages the geometric information provided in ground truth 3D data. Despite its fast development, 3D diffusion still faces three challenges. First, the majority of these methods represent a 3D object by one single latent, regardless of its complexity. This may lead to detail loss when generating 3D objects with multiple complicated parts. Second, most 3D assets are designed parts by parts, yet the current holistic latent representation overlooks the independence of these parts and their interrelationships, limiting the model's generative ability. Third, current methods rely on global conditions (e.g., text, image, point cloud) to control the generation process, lacking detailed controllability. Therefore, motivated by how 3D designers create a 3D object, we present a new part-based 3D generation framework, CoPart, which represents a 3D object with multiple contextual part latents and simultaneously generates coherent 3D parts. This part-based framework has several advantages, including: i) reduces the encoding burden of intricate objects by decomposing them into simpler parts, ii) facilitates part learning and part relationship modeling, and iii) naturally supports part-level control. Furthermore, to ensure the coherence of part latents and to harness the powerful priors from foundation models, we propose a novel mutual guidance strategy to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion models for joint part latent denoising. Benefiting from the part-based representation, we demonstrate that CoPart can support various applications including part-editing, articulated object generation, and mini-scene generation. Moreover, we collect a new large-scale 3D part dataset named Partverse from Objaverse through automatic mesh segmentation and subsequent human post-annotations. By training on the proposed dataset, CoPart achieves promising part-based 3D generation with high controllability. Project page: https://hkdsc.github.io/project/copart",

Given this challenge, we propose a new approach, CaptionSmiths, to acquire a single captioning model that can handle diverse language patterns. First, our approach quantifies three properties of each caption, length, descriptiveness, and uniqueness of a word, as continuous scalar values, without human annotation. Given the values, we represent the conditioning via interpolation between two endpoint vectors corresponding to the extreme states, e.g., one for a very short caption and one for a very long caption. Empirical results demonstrate that the resulting model can smoothly change the properties of the output captions and show higher lexical alignment than baselines. For instance, CaptionSmiths reduces the error in controlling caption length by 506% despite better lexical alignment. Code will be available on https://github.com/omronsinicx/captionsmiths",

    "abstract": "The newly proposed Generalized Referring Expression Segmentation (GRES) amplifies the formulation of classic RES by involving complex multiple/non-target scenarios. Recent approaches address GRES by directly extending the well-adopted RES frameworks with object-existence identification. However, these approaches tend to encode multi-granularity object information into a single representation, which makes it difficult to precisely represent comprehensive objects of different granularity. Moreover, the simple binary object-existence identification across all referent scenarios fails to specify their inherent differences, incurring ambiguity in object understanding. To tackle the above issues, we propose a **Co**unting-Aware **H**ierarchical **D**ecoding framework (CoHD) for GRES. By decoupling the intricate referring semantics into different granularity with a visual-linguistic hierarchy, and dynamic aggregating it with intra- and inter-selection, CoHD boosts multi-granularity comprehension with the reciprocal benefit of the hierarchical nature. Furthermore, we incorporate the counting ability by embodying multiple/single/non-target scenarios into count- and category-level supervision, facilitating comprehensive object perception. Experimental results on gRefCOCO, Ref-ZOM, R-RefCOCO, and RefCOCO benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and rationality of CoHD which outperforms state-of-the-art GRES methods by a remarkable margin.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The current text-to-video (T2V) generation has made significant progress in synthesizing realistic general videos, but it is still under-explored in identity-specific human video generation with customized ID images. The key challenge lies in maintaining high ID fidelity consistently while preserving the original motion dynamic and semantic following after the identity injection. Current video identity customization methods mainly rely on reconstructing given identity images on text-to-image models, which have a divergent distribution with the T2V model. This process introduces a tuning-inference gap, leading to dynamic and semantic degradation. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel framework, dubbed PersonalVideo, that applies a mixture of reward supervision on synthesized videos instead of the simple reconstruction objective on images. Specifically, we first incorporate identity consistency reward to effectively inject the reference's identity without the tuning-inference gap. Then we propose a novel semantic consistency reward to align the semantic distribution of the generated videos with the original T2V model, which preserves its dynamic and semantic following capability during the identity injection. With the non-reconstructive reward training, we further employ simulated prompt augmentation to reduce overfitting by supervising generated results in more semantic scenarios, gaining good robustness even with only a single reference image.Extensive experiments demonstrate our method's superiority in delivering high identity faithfulness while preserving the inherent video generation qualities of the original T2V model, outshining prior methods",

    "abstract": "Hyperspectral images (HSIs) often suffer from diverse and unknown degradations during imaging, leading to severe spectral and spatial distortions. Existing HSI restoration methods typically rely on specific degradation assumptions, limiting their effectiveness in complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose MP-HSIR, a novel multi-prompt framework that effectively integrates spectral, textual, and visual prompts to achieve universal HSI restoration across diverse degradation types and intensities. Specifically, we develop a prompt-guided spatial-spectral transformer, which incorporates spatial self-attention and a prompt-guided dual-branch spectral self-attention. Since degradations affect spectral features differently, we introduce spectral prompts in the local spectral branch to provide universal low-rank spectral patterns as prior knowledge for enhancing spectral reconstruction. Furthermore, the text-visual synergistic prompt fuses high-level semantic representations with fine-grained visual features to encode degradation information, thereby guiding the restoration process. Extensive experiments on 9 HSI restoration tasks, including all-in-one scenarios, generalization tests, and real-world cases, demonstrate that MP-HSIR not only consistently outperforms existing all-in-one methods but also surpasses state-of-the-art task-specific approaches across multiple tasks.

For example, Diffusion Models have demonstrated remarkable semantic structural and memory capabilities in image generation, denoising, and restoration, which intuitively benefits representation learning. However, current gait networks rarely embrace this perspective, relying primarily on learning by contrasting gait samples under varying complex conditions, leading to semantic inconsistency and uniformity issues. To address these issues, we propose Origins with generative capabilities whose underlying philosophy is that different entities are generated from a unified template, inherently regularizing gait representations within a consistent and diverse semantic space to capture differences accurately. Admittedly, learning this unified template is exceedingly challenging, as it requires the comprehensiveness of the template to encompass gait representations with various conditions. Inspired by Diffusion Models, Origins diffuses the unified template into timestep templates for gait generative modeling, and meanwhile transfers the unified template for gait representation learning. Especially, gait generative modeling and representation learning serve as a unified framework to end-to-end joint training. Extensive experiments on CASIA-B, CCPG, SUSTech1K, Gait3D, GREW and CCGR-MINI demonstrate that Origins performs representation learning within a unified template, achieving superior performance",

Unlike prior approaches that depend on domain-specific guidance functions, LangTraj incorporates language conditioning during training, facilitating more intuitive traffic simulation control. We propose a novel closed-loop training strategy for diffusion models, explicitly tailored to enhance stability and realism during closed-loop simulation. To support language-conditioned simulation, we develop Inter-Drive, a large-scale dataset with diverse and interactive labels for training language-conditioned diffusion models. Our dataset is built upon a scalable pipeline for annotating agent-agent interactions and single-agent behaviors, ensuring rich and varied supervision.

Prior works addressed this by modifying model architectures, such as using hypernetworks.

We introduce Generative Active Learning for Trajectory prediction (GALTraj), the first method to successfully deploy generative active learning into trajectory prediction. It actively identifies rare tail samples where the model fails and augments these samples with a controllable diffusion model during training. In our framework, generating scenarios that are diverse, realistic, and preserve tail-case characteristics is paramount. Accordingly, we design a tail-aware generation method that applies tailored diffusion guidance to generate trajectories that both capture rare behaviors and respect traffic rules. Unlike prior simulation methods focused solely on scenario diversity, GALTraj is the first to show how simulator-driven augmentation benefits long-tail learning in trajectory prediction.

Our experiments demonstrate that our approach enables superior encoding-decoding performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly as the compression ratio increases. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, we report results from our video embedders achieving a temporal compression ratio of up to 32x (8x higher than leading video emebbders) and validate the robustness of this ultra-compact latent space for text-to-video generation, providing a significant efficiency boost in latent diffusion model training and inference",

In this paper, we define a scenario named diffusion anomaly where the generated results of a reverse process under attack deviate significantly from the normal ones. By analyzing the underlying formation mechanism of the diffusion anomaly, we reveal how perturbations are amplified during the reverse process and accumulated in the results. Based on the analysis, we reveal the phenomena of divergence and homogeneity, which cause the diffusion process to deviate significantly from the normal process and to decline in diversity. Leveraging these two phenomena, we propose a method named Diffusion Anomaly Detection (DADet) to effectively detect both backdoor and adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposal achieves excellent defense performance against backdoor and adversarial attacks. Specifically, for the backdoor attack detection, our method achieves an F1 score of 99% on different datasets, including MS COCO and CIFAR-10. For the detection of adversarial samples, the F1 score exceeds 84% across three adversarial attacks and two different tasks, evaluated on the MS COCO and Places365 datasets, respectively",

Among the various PEFT methods, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its variants have gained significant attention due to their effectiveness, enabling users to fine-tune models with limited computational resources. However, the approximation gap between the low-rank assumption and desired fine-tuning weights prevents the simultaneous acquisition of ultra-parameter-efficiency and better performance. To reduce this gap and further improve the power of LoRA, we propose a new PEFT method that combines two classes of adaptations, namely, transform and residual adaptations. In specific, we first apply a full-rank and dense transform to the pre-trained weight. This learnable transform is expected to align the pre-trained weight as closely as possible to the desired weight, thereby reducing the rank of the residual weight. Then, the residual part can be effectively approximated by more compact and parameter-efficient structures, with a smaller approximation error. To achieve ultra-parameter-efficiency in practice, we design highly flexible and effective tensor decompositions for both the transform and residual adaptations. Additionally, popular PEFT methods such as DoRA can be summarized under this transform plus residual adaptation scheme. Experiments are conducted on fine-tuning Stable Diffusion models in subject-driven and controllable generation.

This study identifies a positive correlation between cache-enhanced performance and intra-class compactness. Based on this observation, we propose a Multi-Cache enhanced Prototype-based Test-Time Adaptation (MCP) featuring three caches: an entropy cache for initializing prototype representations with low-entropy samples, an align cache for integrating visual and textual information to achieve compact intra-class distributions, and a negative cache for prediction calibration using high-entropy samples. We further developed MCP++, a framework incorporating cross-modal prototype alignment and residual learning, introducing prototype residual fine-tuning. Comparative and ablation experiments across 15 downstream tasks demonstrate that the proposed method and framework achieve state-of-the-art generalization performance",

    "abstract": "Despite impressive advancements in diffusion-based video editing models in altering video attributes, there has been limited exploration into modifying motion information while preserving the original protagonist's appearance and background. In this paper, we propose MotionFollower, a score-guided diffusion model for video motion editing. To introduce conditional controls to the denoising process, we propose two signal controllers, one for poses and the other for appearances, both consist of convolution blocks without involving heavy attention calculations. Further, we design a score guidance principle based on a two-branch architecture (a reconstruction and an editing branch), significantly enhancing the modeling capability of texture details and complicated backgrounds. Concretely, we enforce several consistency regularizers during the score estimation. The resulting gradients thus inject appropriate guidance to latents, forcing the model to preserve the original background details and protagonists' appearances without interfering with the motion modification. Experiments demonstrate MotionFollower's competitive motion editing ability qualitatively and quantitatively. Compared with MotionEditor, the most advanced motion editing model, MotionFollower delivers superior motion editing performance and exclusively supports large camera movements. To the best of our knowledge, MotionFollower is the first diffusion model to explore score regularization in video editing",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Accelerating diffusion model sampling is crucial for efficient AIGC deployment. While diffusion distillation methods -- based on distribution matching and trajectory matching -- reduce sampling to as few as one step, they fall short on complex tasks like text-to-image generation. Few-step generation offers a better balance between speed and quality, but existing approaches face a persistent trade-off: distribution matching lacks flexibility for multi-step sampling, while trajectory matching often yields suboptimal image quality.To bridge this gap, we propose learning few-step diffusion models by Trajectory Distribution Matching (TDM), a unified distillation paradigm that combines the strengths of distribution and trajectory matching. Our method introduces a data-free score distillation objective, aligning the student's trajectory with the teacher's at the distribution level. Further, we develop a sampling-steps-aware objective that decouples learning targets across different steps, enabling more adjustable sampling.This approach supports both deterministic sampling for superior image quality and flexible multi-step adaptation, achieving state-of-the-art performance with remarkable efficiency. Our model, TDM, outperforms existing methods on various backbones, such as SDXL and PixArt-\\alpha, delivering superior quality and significantly reduced training costs.In particular, our method distills PixArt-\\alpha into a 4-step generator that outperforms its teacher on real user preference at 1024 resolution. This is accomplished with 500 iterations and 2 A800 hours -- a training cost of approximately 1% of the previous state-of-the-art distillation method. In addition, our proposed TDM can be extended to accelerate text-to-video diffusion. Notably, TDM can outperform its teacher model (CogVideoX-2B) by using only 4 NFE on VBench, improving the total score from 80.91 to 81.65",

However, real-world partial observation caused by occlusions leads to inevitable model failure, which demands a unified framework for coexisting trajectory prediction, imputation, and recovery. Unlike previous attempts that handled observed and unobserved behaviors in a coupled manner, we explore a decoupled denoising diffusion modeling paradigm with a unidirectional information valve to separate the interference from uncertain behaviors. Building on this, we proposed a Unified Masked Trajectory Diffusion model (UniMTD) for arbitrary levels of missing observations. We designed a unidirectional attention as a valve unit to control the direction of information flow between the observed and masked areas, gradually refining the missing observations toward a real-world distribution. We construct it into a unidirectional MoE structure to handle varying proportions of missing observations. A Cached Diffusion model is further designed to improve generation quality while reducing computation and time overhead. Our method has achieved a great leap across human motions and vehicle traffic. UniMTD efficiently achieves 65% improvement in minADE20 and reaches SOTA with advantages of 98%, 50%, 73%, and 29% across 4 fidelity metrics on out-of-boundary, velocity, and trajectory length.

Many methods for solving this problem exist, and there are also several theoretical results analyzing difficulty and optimality. However, one aspect that most of these have in common is a focus on the isotropic setting, where the intrinsic uncertainties in the measurements are not fully incorporated into the resulting optimization task. Recent empirical results suggest that moving to an anisotropic framework, where these uncertainties are explicitly included, can result in an improvement of solution quality. However, global optimization for rotation averaging has remained a challenge in this scenario.In this paper we show how anisotropic costs can be incorporated in certifiably optimal rotation averaging. We also demonstrate how existing solvers, designed for isotropic situations, fail in the anisotropic setting. Finally, we propose a stronger relaxation and show empirically that it is able to recover global optima in all tested datasets and leads to a more accurate reconstruction in all but one of the scenes",

We further observe that Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), which explicitly controls the degree of flatness, effectively enhances flatness in diffusion models even surpassing the indirectly promoting flatness methods---Input Perturbation (IP) which enforces the Lipschitz condition, ensembling-based approach like Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA) and Exponential Moving Average (EMA)---are less effective.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Text-to-image generation has transformed content creation, yet precise visual text rendering remains challenging for generative models due to blurred glyphs, semantic inconsistencies, and limited style controllability. Current methods typically employ pre-rendered glyph images as conditional inputs, but their inability to preserve original font styles and color information forces reliance on multi-branch architectures to compensate for missing details. This leads to increased model complexity, higher computational costs, and reduced reusability.To address these limitations, we propose a segmentation-guided framework that leverages pixel-level visual text segmentation masks--complete representations preserving glyph shapes, colors, and spatial details--as unified conditional inputs. Our approach integrates two key innovations: (1) a fine-tuned bilingual segmentation model for extracting precise text masks from source images, and (2) a streamlined diffusion model enhanced with adaptive glyph condition and glyph region loss to ensure semantic and stylistic fidelity. On the AnyText-benchmark, our method achieves a sentence accuracy (Sen.Acc) of 0.8267 and a Normalized Edit Distance (NED) of 0.8976 for Chinese text generation, while the English test set delivers even stronger performance with 0.9018 Sen.Acc and 0.9582 NED, surpassing prior methods by substantial margins. To address broader evaluation needs, we introduce two novel benchmarks: GlyphMM-benchmark (for holistic glyph consistency assessment) and MiniText-benchmark (targeting small-scale glyph fidelity analysis). Experimental results demonstrate our method's dominance across these new benchmarks: 16% Sen.Acc improvement on the Chinese subset of GlyphMM-benchmark and 50% gain on its English counterpart. Notably, our approach achieves over a 100% Sen.Acc boost on the challenging MiniText test set designed for localized text regions.

In this paper, we present TAViS, a novel framework that couples the knowledge of multimodal foundation models (ImageBind) for cross-modal alignment and a segmentation foundation model (SAM2) for precise segmentation. However, effectively combining these models poses two key challenges: the difficulty in transferring the knowledge between SAM2 and ImageBind due to their different feature spaces, and the insufficiency of using only segmentation loss for supervision. To address these challenges, we introduce a text-bridged design with two key components: (1) a text-bridged hybrid prompting mechanism where pseudo text provides class prototype information while retaining modality-specific details from both audio and visual inputs, and (2) an alignment supervision strategy that leverages text as a bridge to align shared semantic concepts within audio-visual modalities.

Such videos entangle the motion of dynamic elements, undermining the assumption of static environments required by traditional systems.

However, the former often results in incomplete reconstructions, while the latter can lead to inconsistent motion estimates. Taking a novel approach, this work leverages a 3D point tracker to separate camera-induced motion from the observed motion of dynamic objects. By considering only the camera-induced component, bundle adjustment can operate reliably on all scene elements. We further ensure depth consistency across video frames with lightweight post-processing based on scale maps. Our framework combines the core of traditional SLAM---bundle adjustment---with a robust learning-based 3D tracker. Integrating motion decomposition, bundle adjustment, and depth refinement, our unified framework, BA-Track, accurately tracks camera motion and produces temporally coherent and scale-consistent dense reconstructions, accommodating both static and dynamic elements.

This is challenging as it involves deep vision-language understanding, pixel-level dense prediction and spatiotemporal reasoning. Despite notable progress in recent years, existing methods still exhibit a noticeable gap when considering all these aspects. In this work, we propose ReferDINO, a strong RVOS model that inherits region-level vision-language alignment from foundational visual grounding models, and is further endowed with pixel-level dense perception and cross-modal spatiotemporal reasoning. In detail, ReferDINO integrates two key components: 1) a grounding-guided deformable mask decoder that utilizes location prediction to progressively guide mask prediction through differentiable deformation mechanisms; 2) an object-consistent temporal enhancer that injects pretrained time-varying text features into inter-frame interaction to capture object-aware dynamic changes. Moreover, a confidence-aware query pruning strategy is designed to accelerate object decoding without compromising model performance. Extensive experimental results on five benchmarks demonstrate that our ReferDINO significantly outperforms previous methods (e.g., +3.9% (\\mathcal J &\\mathcal F ) on Ref-YouTube-VOS) with real-time inference speed (51 FPS)",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes LA-MOTR, a novel Tracking-by-Learnable-Association framework that resolves the competing optimization objectives between detection and association in end-to-end Tracking-by-Attention (TbA) Multi-Object Tracking. Current TbA methods employ shared decoders for simultaneous object detection and tracklet association, often resulting in task interference and suboptimal accuracy. By contrast, our end-to-end framework decouples these tasks into two specialized modules: Separated Object-Tracklet Detection (SOTD) and Spatial-Guided Learnable Association (SGLA). This decoupled design offers flexibility and explainability. In particular, SOTD independently detects new objects and existing tracklets in each frame, while SGLA associates them via Spatial-Weighted Learnable Attention module guided by relative spatial cues. Temporal coherence is further maintained through Tracklet Updates Module. The learnable association mechanism resolves the inherent suboptimal association issues in decoupled frameworks, avoiding the task interference commonly observed in joint approaches. Evaluations on DanceTrack, MOT17, and SportMOT datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Extensive ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the designed modules.

Unlike indoor scene generation, which has been a primary focus of prior work, outdoor scene generation presents unique challenges, including wide variations in scene heights and the need for a method capable of rapidly producing large landscapes. To address this, we propose an efficient approach that encodes scene chunks as uniform vector sets, offering better compression and performance than the spatially structured latents used in prior methods. Furthermore, we train an explicit outpainting model for unbounded generation, which improves coherence compared to prior resampling-based inpainting schemes while also speeding up generation by eliminating extra diffusion steps. To facilitate this task, we curate NuiScene43, a small but high-quality set of scenes, preprocessed for joint training.

Detecting small objects is challenging as they usually suffer from inadequate feature representation. Hence, to address this, we propose the Expanded Features Set (EFS) form - a simple yet effective idea to improve the feature representation of small objects by utilizing the untapped higher resolution features from the shallower layers of the backbone module. We observe that the EFS form improves the SOD performance. However, due to processing of additional features, it has a higher computational cost which reduces inference efficiency. Hence, to address this, we propose Dynamic Feature Multiplexing (DFM) - a novel design that optimizes the usage of the EFS form during inference by dynamically multiplexing it to create our aforementioned DM-EFS form. Since our DM-EFS form is a multiplexed (or subsampled) optimal version of the EFS form, it improves the SOD performance like the EFS form but with a lower computational cost. Extensive experiments confirm the efficacy of our DM-EFS approach. Integrated with YOLOv7 base model, our DM-EFS achieves state-of-the art results on diverse SOD datasets outperforming the base model and SOD baselines, with on-par or even better inference efficiency",

We propose OmniVTON, the first training-free universal VTON framework that decouples garment and pose conditioning to achieve both texture fidelity and pose consistency across diverse settings. To preserve garment details, we introduce a garment prior generation mechanism that aligns clothing with the body, followed by continuous boundary stitching technique to achieve fine-grained texture retention. For precise pose alignment, we utilize DDIM inversion to capture structural cues while suppressing texture interference, ensuring accurate body alignment independent of the original image textures. By disentangling garment and pose constraints, OmniVTON eliminates the bias inherent in diffusion models when handling multiple conditions simultaneously. Experimental results demonstrate that OmniVTON achieves superior performance across diverse datasets, garment types, and application scenarios.

    "abstract": "Dense visual prediction tasks, such as detection and segmentation, are crucial for time-critical applications (e.g., autonomous driving and video surveillance). While deep models achieve strong performance, their efficiency remains a challenge. Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective model compression technique, but existing feature-based KD methods rely on static, teacher-driven feature selection, failing to adapt to the student's evolving learning state or leverage dynamic student-teacher interactions. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive student-teacher Cooperative Attention Masking for Knowledge Distillation (ACAM-KD), which introduces two key components: (1) Student-Teacher Cross-Attention Feature Fusion (STCA-FF), which adaptively integrates features from both models for a more interactive distillation process, and (2) Adaptive Spatial-Channel Masking (ASCM), which dynamically generates importance masks to enhance both spatial and channel-wise feature selection. Unlike conventional KD methods, ACAM-KD adapts to the student's evolving needs throughout the entire distillation process. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks validate its effectiveness. For instance, on COCO2017, ACAM-KD improves object detection performance by up to 1.4 mAP over the state-of-the-art when distilling a ResNet-50 student from a ResNet-101 teacher.

PlanGen integrates layout conditions into the model as context without requiring specialized encoding of local captions and bounding box coordinates, which provides significant advantages over the previous embed-and-pool operations on layout conditions, particularly when dealing with complex layouts. Unified prompting allows PlanGen to perform multitasking training related to layout, including layout planning, layout-to-image generation, image layout understanding, etc. In addition, PlanGen can be seamlessly expanded to layout-guided image manipulation thanks to the well-designed modeling, with teacher-forcing content manipulation policy and negative layout guidance.

However, processing a large number of visual tokens and generating long-context outputs impose substantial computational overhead, leading to excessive demands for key-value (KV) cache. To address this critical bottleneck, we propose AirCache, a novel KV cache compression method aimed at accelerating LVLMs inference. This work systematically investigates the correlations between visual and textual tokens within the attention mechanisms of LVLMs. Our empirical analysis reveals considerable redundancy in cached visual tokens, wherein strategically eliminating these tokens preserves model performance while significantly accelerating context generation. We introduce an elite observation window for assessing the importance of visual components in the KV cache, focusing on stable inter-modal relevancy modeling with enhanced multi-perspective consistency. Additionally, we develop an adaptive layer-wise budget allocation strategy that capitalizes on the strength and skewness of token importance distribution, showcasing superior efficiency compared to uniform allocation. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple LVLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves comparable performance to the full cache while retaining only 10% of visual KV cache, thereby reducing decoding latency by 29% to 66% across various batch size and prompt length of inputs.

This task aims to retrieve the missing parts from a set of candidates and predict their 6-DoF poses to make the partial assembly complete. However, due to the inherent uncertainty in completion and the similarity among candidates, even humans struggle to achieve precise completion without external guidance. To address this challenge, we introduce an auxiliary image depicting the complete assembly from a specific view. The primary challenge lies in the lack of correspondence or grounding between the partial assembly and the image, leading to ambiguities in identifying missing parts and ineffective guidance for completion. Moreover, this correspondence heavily depends on the view of image, which, unfortunately, is often unknown in real-world scenarios. To this end, we propose a novel cross-modal 3D assembly completion framework. At its core is missing-oriented feature fusion augmented by self-supervised view alignment to establish view-consistent 2D-3D correspondence between the image and the partial assembly, which effectively captures clues of missing parts from the image and provides targeted guidance for completion.

    "abstract": "Test-time adaptation with pre-trained vision-language models has gained increasing attention for addressing distribution shifts during testing. Among these approaches, memory-based algorithms stand out due to their training-free nature and ability to leverage historical test data. However, existing test-time adaptation methods are typically designed for a single domain with abundant data. In decentralized settings such as federated learning, applying these methods individually to each client suffers from limited test data, while directly sharing a single global memory via the server prevents proper personalization to each client's unique distribution. To address this, we propose Latte, a novel framework where each client maintains a local memory to store embeddings from its own historical test data and an external memory to store class prototypes from other relevant clients. During communication, each client retrieves prototypes from similar clients under the server's coordination to expand its memory. For local adaptation, Latte utilizes both embedding similarity and uncertainty to enhance model performance. Our theoretical analysis shows that Latte effectively leverages in-distribution clients while remaining robust to out-of-distribution clients. Extensive experiments on domain adaptation and corruption benchmarks validate that Latte achieves superior performance in decentralized settings, while introducing only negligible communication and computation costs.

    "abstract": "Vector Quantization (VQ) has emerged as a prominent weight compression technique, showcasing substantially lower quantization errors than uniform quantization across diverse models, particularly in extreme compression scenarios. However, its efficacy during fine-tuning is limited by the constraint of the compression format, where weight vectors assigned to the same codeword are restricted to updates in the same direction. Consequently, many quantized weights are compelled to move in directions contrary to their local gradient information. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a novel VQ paradigm, Sign-Splitting VQ (SSVQ), which decouples the sign bit of weights from the codebook. Our approach involves extracting the sign bits of uncompressed weights and performing clustering and compression on all-positive weights. We then introduce latent variables for the sign bit and jointly optimize both the signs and the codebook. Additionally, we implement a progressive freezing strategy for the learnable sign to ensure training stability. Extensive experiments on various modern models and tasks demonstrate that SSVQ achieves a significantly superior compression-accuracy trade-off compared to conventional VQ. Furthermore, we validate our algorithm on a hardware accelerator, showing that SSVQ achieves a 3x speedup over the 8-bit compressed model by reducing memory access.

It enables independent training on graphics programs and captioned images and allows for zero-shot text-guided graphics program synthesis during inference. We show that our method substantially outperforms baselines that can only operate with caption-aligned graphics programs. Furthermore, when leveraging caption-aligned graphics programs as a complementary training signal, TikZero matches or exceeds the performance of much larger models, including commercial systems like GPT-4o.

Our work aims to unify both driving model simulation and trajectory planning into a single sequence modeling problem. We introduce a multimodal driving language based on interleaved image and action tokens, and develop DrivingGPT to learn joint world modeling and planning through standard next-token prediction.

To address this challenge, we propose a novel knowledge inheritance approach named OSKT (One-Shot Knowledge Transfer), which consolidates the knowledge of the teacher model into an intermediate carrier called a weight chain. When a downstream scenario demands a model that meets specific resource constraints, this weight chain can be expanded to the target model size without additional computation.

We propose GS-ID, an end-to-end framework for illumination decomposition that integrates adaptive light aggregation with diffusion-based material priors. In addition to a learnable environment map for ambient illumination, we model spatially-varying local lighting using anisotropic spherical Gaussian mixtures (SGMs) that are jointly optimized with scene content. To better capture cast shadows, we associate each splat with a learnable unit vector that encodes shadow directions from multiple light sources, further improving material and lighting estimation. By combining SGMs with intrinsic priors from diffusion models, GS-ID significantly reduces ambiguity in light-material-geometry interactions and achieves state-of-the-art performance on inverse rendering and relighting benchmarks.

Recent efforts have explored tuning-free strategies to exhibit the untapped potential higher-resolution visual generation of pre-trained models. However, these methods are still prone to producing low-quality visual content with repetitive patterns. The key obstacle lies in the inevitable increase in high-frequency information when the model generates visual content exceeding its training resolution, leading to undesirable repetitive patterns deriving from the accumulated errors. To tackle this challenge, we propose FreeScale, a tuning-free inference paradigm to enable higher-resolution visual generation via scale fusion. Specifically, FreeScale processes information from different receptive scales and then fuses it by extracting desired frequency components. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our paradigm in extending the capabilities of higher-resolution visual generation for both image and video models.

EM data exhibits unique characteristics including high noise levels, anisotropic voxel dimensions, and ultra-long spatial dependencies that make traditional vision models inadequate. Inspired by autoregressive pretraining in language models, we propose TokenUnify, a hierarchical predictive coding framework that captures multi-scale dependencies through three complementary learning objectives. TokenUnify integrates random token prediction, next-token prediction, and next-all token prediction to create a comprehensive representational space with emergent properties. From an information-theoretic perspective, these three tasks are complementary and provide optimal coverage of visual data structure, with our approach reducing autoregressive error accumulation from O(K) to O(\\sqrt K ) for sequences of length K. We also introduce a large-scale EM dataset with 1.2 billion annotated voxels, offering ideal long-sequence visual data with spatial continuity. Leveraging the Mamba architecture's linear-time sequence modeling capabilities, TokenUnify achieves a 44% performance improvement on downstream neuron segmentation and outperforms MAE by 25%.

First, by generating motion masks, we obtain static and dynamic priors for each pixel. To eliminate the influence of static scenes and improve the efficiency of learning the motion of dynamic objects, we classify the Gaussian primitives into static and dynamic Gaussian sets, while the sparse control points along with an MLP are utilized to model the transformation fields of the dynamic Gaussians. To more accurately learn the motion of dynamic Gaussians, a novel 2D optical flow map reconstruction algorithm is designed to render optical flows of dynamic objects between neighbor images, which are further used to supervise the 4D Gaussian radiance fields along with traditional photometric and geometric constraints.

Traditional HMR methods are designed to be user-agnostic and optimized for generalization. While these methods often refine poses using constraints derived from the 2D image to improve alignment, this process compromises 3D accuracy by failing to jointly account for person-specific body shapes and the plausibility of 3D poses. In contrast, our pipeline decouples this process by first calibrating the user's body shape and then employing a personalized pose fitting process conditioned on that shape. To achieve this, we develop a body shape-conditioned 3D pose prior, implemented as a Point Diffusion Transformer, which iteratively guides the pose fitting via a Point Distillation Sampling loss. This learned 3D pose prior effectively mitigates errors arising from an over-reliance on 2D constraints. Consequently, our approach improves not only pelvis-aligned pose accuracy but also absolute pose accuracy -- an important metric often overlooked by prior work. Furthermore, our method is highly data-efficient, requiring only synthetic data for training, and serves as a versatile plug-and-play module that can be seamlessly integrated with existing 3D pose estimators to enhance their performance.

The recent approach, which integrates event cameras with conventional sensors for continuous-time detection, struggles in fast-motion scenarios due to its dependency on synchronized sensors.

However, this constrained architecture for visual and textual tokens restricts the design space for processing visual tokens, potentially leading to suboptimal performance and efficiency. In this paper, we propose Decomposed Attention (D-Attn), a more flexible attention architecture for LVLMs, which enables modification of visual token operations without affecting textual-to-textual attention. D-Attn decomposes the 1-D causal self-attention of LVLMs into visual-to-visual, textual-to-visual, and textual-to-textual attentions, and the visual and textual output tokens from the decomposed attentions are merged with a carefully derived weighting strategy, namely \\alpha-weighting. Taking advantage of the flexibility, we are able to introduce two critical improvements in visual token processing while maintaining the capacity of pre-trained LLMs: 1) We rectify the biased positional encoding in textual-to-visual attention to boost visual understanding performance. 2) We diagonalize visual-to-visual attention to reduce computation complexity from \\mathcal O (|V|^2) to \\mathcal O (|V|) for |V| visual tokens without compromising performance. Extensive experiments and analysis validate the effectiveness of D-Attn, demonstrating significant improvements on multiple image benchmarks while significantly reducing computational costs (e.g., 5xfaster).

Nevertheless, these works have assumed that models overfit to all degradation types (e.g., blur, noise), while through careful investigations in this paper, we discover that models predominantly overfit to noise, largely attributable to the distinct degradation pattern in noise compared to other degradation types. In this paper, we propose a targeted feature denoising framework, comprising noise detection and denoising modules.

    "abstract": "Despite the promise of Multi-Task Learning (MTL) in leveraging complementary knowledge across tasks, existing multi-task optimization (MTO) techniques remain fixated on resolving conflicts through optimizer-centric loss scaling and gradient manipulation, yet fail to deliver consistent gains. In this paper, we argue that the shared representation space, where task interactions naturally occur, offers rich information and potential for operations complementary to existing optimizer designs, especially for facilitating the inter-task complementarity, which is rarely explored in MTO. This intuition leads to Rep-MTL, which exploits the representation-level task saliency to quantify interactions between task-specific optimization and shared representation learning. By steering these saliencies through entropybased penalization and sample-wise cross-task alignment, Rep-MTL aims to mitigate negative transfer by maintaining the effective training of individual tasks instead pure conflict-solving, while explicitly promoting complementary information sharing. Experiments are conducted on four challenging MTL benchmarks covering both task-shift and domain-shift scenarios. The results show that Rep-MTL, even paired with the basic equal weighting (EW) policy, achieves competitive performance gains with favorable efficiency. Beyond standard performance metrics, Power Law (PL) exponent analysis demonstrates Rep-MTL's efficacy in balancing task-specific learning and cross-task sharing",

    "abstract": "Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) aims to predict the intermediate frame I_n (we use n to denote time in videos to avoid notation overload with the timestep t in diffusion models) based on two consecutive neighboring frames I_0 and I_1. Recent approaches apply diffusion models (both image-based and video-based) in this task and achieve strong performance. However, image-based diffusion models are unable to extract temporal information and are relatively inefficient compared to non-diffusion methods. Video-based diffusion models can extract temporal information, but they are too large in terms of training scale, model size, and inference time. To mitigate the above issues, we propose Temporal-Aware Latent Brownian Bridge Diffusion for Video Frame Interpolation (TLB-VFI), an efficient video-based diffusion model. By extracting rich temporal information from video inputs through our proposed 3D-wavelet gating and temporal-aware autoencoder, our method achieves 20% improvement in FID on the most challenging datasets over recent SOTA of image-based diffusion models. Meanwhile, due to the existence of rich temporal information, our method achieves strong performance while having 3xfewer parameters. Such a parameter reduction results in 2.3xspeed up. By incorporating optical flow guidance, our method requires 9000xless training data and achieves over 20xfewer parameters than video-based diffusion models",

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has shown its detailed expressive ability and highly efficient rendering speed in the novel view synthesis (NVS) task. The application to inverse rendering still faces several challenges, as the discrete nature of Gaussian primitives makes it difficult to apply geometry constraints. Recent works introduce the signed distance field (SDF) as an extra continuous representation to regularize the geometry defined by Gaussian primitives. It improves the decomposition quality, at the cost of increasing memory usage and complicating training. Unlike these works, we introduce a **discretized SDF** to represent the continuous SDF in a discrete manner by encoding it within each Gaussian using a sampled value. This approach allows us to link the SDF with the Gaussian opacity through an SDF-to-opacity transformation, enabling rendering the SDF via splatting and avoiding the computational cost of ray marching. The key challenge is to regularize the discrete samples to be consistent with the underlying SDF, as the discrete representation can hardly apply the gradient-based constraints (e.g., Eikonal loss). For this, we project Gaussians onto the zero-level set of SDF and enforce alignment with the surface from splatting, namely a projection-based consistency loss. Thanks to the discretized SDF, our method achieves higher relighting quality, while requiring no extra memory beyond GS and avoiding complex manually designed optimization. The experiments reveal that our method outperforms existing Gaussian-based inverse rendering methods. We will release the code upon acceptance",

We further design a unified region cluster discrimination loss that jointly supports object and OCR learning within a single classification framework, enabling efficient and scalable distributed training on large-scale data.

However, the development of image analysis methods for EBCs is challenging due to the sparse and asynchronous nature of the data. This work addresses the problem of object detection for EBC cameras. The current approaches to EBC object detection focus on constructing complex data representations and rely on specialized architectures. We introduce I2EvDet (Image-to-Event Detection), a novel adaptation framework that bridges mainstream object detection with temporal event data processing. First, we demonstrate that a Real-Time DEtection TRansformer, or RT-DETR, a state-of-the-art natural image detector, trained on a simple image-like representation of the EBC data achieves performance comparable to specialized EBC methods. Next, as part of our framework, we develop an efficient adaptation technique that transforms image-based detectors into event-based detection models by modifying their frozen latent representation space through minimal architectural additions. The resulting EvRT-DETR model reaches state-of-the-art performance on the standard benchmark datasets Gen1 (mAP +2.3) and 1Mpx/Gen4 (mAP +1.4).

Building on recent advances in artist-reminiscent triangle mesh generation, our approach addresses the need for interactive mesh creation.

Both operations are invoked by simple user edits of a sketch image, facilitating an iterative content creation process and enabling the construction of complex 3D meshes. Our approach is based on a triangle sequence-based mesh representation, exploiting a large Transformer model for mesh triangle addition and deletion. In order to perform edits interactively, we introduce a vertex-aligned speculative prediction strategy on top of our additive mesh generator. This speculator predicts multiple output tokens corresponding to a vertex, thus significantly reducing the computational cost of inference and accelerating the editing process, making it possible to execute each editing step in only a few seconds. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MeshPad outperforms state-of-the-art sketch-conditioned mesh generation methods, achieving more than 22% mesh quality improvement in Chamfer distance, and being preferred by 90% of participants in perceptual evaluations",

In this paper, we make three contributions to reduce the cost of computing features for temporally dense tasks. First, we introduce a vision transformer (ViT) architecture, dubbed ResidualViT, that leverages the large temporal redundancy in videos to efficiently compute temporally dense frame-level features. Our architecture incorporates (i) learnable residual connections that ensure temporal consistency across consecutive frames and (ii) a token reduction module that enhances processing speed by selectively discarding temporally redundant information while reusing weights of a pretrained foundation model. Second, we propose a lightweight distillation strategy to approximate the frame-level features of the original foundation model. Finally, we evaluate our approach across four tasks and five datasets, in both zero-shot and fully supervised settings, demonstrating significant reductions in computational cost (up to 60%) and improvements in inference speed (up to 2.5x faster), all while closely approximating the accuracy of the original foundation model",

This constraint has driven conventional 4D methods to fine-tune 3D models on scalable dynamic video data with additional geometric priors such as optical flow and depths. In this work, we take an opposite path and introduce Easi3R, a simple yet efficient training-free method for 4D reconstruction. Our approach applies attention adaptation during inference, eliminating the need for from-scratch pre-training or network fine-tuning. We find that the attention layers in DUSt3R inherently encode rich information about camera and object motion. By carefully disentangling these attention maps, we achieve accurate dynamic region segmentation, camera pose estimation, and 4D dense point map reconstruction.

To address this issue, we introduce Attribute-Leakage-Free Editing (ALE), a framework that tackles attribute leakage at its source. ALE combines Object-Restricted Embeddings (ORE) to disentangle text embeddings, Region-Guided Blending for Cross-Attention Masking (RGB-CAM) for spatially precise attention, and Background Blending (BB) to preserve non-edited content. To quantitatively evaluate attribute leakage across various editing methods, we propose the Attribute-Leakage Evaluation Benchmark (ALE-Bench), featuring comprehensive editing scenarios and new metrics.

This interdependence naturally raises an interesting question: Can we reciprocally leverage LVLMs to enhance the quality of image-text pair data, thereby opening the possibility of a self-reinforcing cycle for continuous improvement? In this work, we take a significant step toward this vision by introducing an LVLM-driven data refinement pipeline. Our framework leverages LVLMs to process images and their raw alt-text, generating four complementary textual formulas: long positive descriptions, long negative descriptions, short positive tags, and short negative tags. Applying this pipeline to the curated DFN-Large dataset yields VLM-150M, a refined dataset enriched with multi-grained annotations. Based on this dataset, we further propose a training paradigm that extends conventional contrastive learning by incorporating negative descriptions and short tags as additional supervised signals. The resulting model, namely HQ-CLIP, demonstrates remarkable improvements across diverse benchmarks. Within a comparable training data scale, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot classification, cross-modal retrieval, and fine-grained visual understanding tasks.

    "abstract": "We propose a model-agnostic, progressive test-time energy adaptation approach for medical image segmentation. Maintaining model performance across diverse medical datasets is challenging, as distribution shifts arise from inconsistent imaging protocols and patient variations. Unlike domain adaptation methods that require multiple passes through target data--impractical in clinical settings--our approach adapts pretrained models progressively as they process test data. Our method leverages a shape energy model trained on source data, which assigns an energy score at the patch level to segmentation maps: low energy represents in-distribution (accurate) shapes, while high energy signals out-of-distribution (erroneous) predictions. By minimizing this energy score at test time, we refine the segmentation model to align with the target distribution. To validate effectiveness and adaptability, we evaluated our framework on eight public MRI (bSSFP, T1- and T2-weighted) and X-ray datasets spanning cardiac, spinal cord, and lung segmentation. We consistently outperform baselines both quantitatively and qualitatively.

    "abstract": "The emergence of neural rendering has significantly advanced the rendering quality of 3D human avatars, with the recently popular 3DGS technique enabling real-time performance. However, SMPL-driven 3DGS human avatars still struggle to capture fine appearance details due to the complex mapping from pose to appearance during fitting. In this paper, we propose SeqAvatar, which excavates the explicit 3DGS representation to better model human avatars based on a hierarchical motion context. Specifically, we utilize a coarse-to-fine motion conditions that incorporate both the overall human skeleton and fine-grained vertex motions for non-rigid deformation. To enhance the robustness of the proposed motion conditions, we adopt a spatio-temporal multi-scale sampling strategy to hierarchically integrate more motion clues to model human avatars. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms 3DGS-based approaches and renders human avatars orders of magnitude faster than the latest NeRF-based models that incorporate temporal context, all while delivering performance that is at least comparable or even superior.

To address this, we introduce a novel MTL framework that leverages weight perturbation to regulate gradient norms. thus improve generalization. By carefully modulating weight perturbations, our approach harmonizes task-specific gradients, reducing conflicts and encouraging more robust learning across tasks.

Our approach derives a novel feature space based on foundation features that ensure multi-view consistency and overcome symmetry ambiguities inherent in foundation features using a self-supervised triplet loss.

We conduct extensive evaluations on the real-world ScanNet25k dataset, where our method outperforms SOTA weakly supervised baselines by +4.3% mean alignment accuracy and is the only weakly supervised approach to surpass the supervised ROCA by +2.7%.

    "abstract": "Detecting deepfake videos is highly challenging given the complexity of characterizing spatio-temporal artifacts. Most existing methods rely on binary classifiers trained using real and fake image sequences, therefore hindering their generalization capabilities to unseen generation methods. Moreover, with the constant progress in generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), deepfake artifacts are becoming imperceptible at both the spatial and the temporal levels, making them extremely difficult to capture. To address these issues, we propose a fine-grained deepfake video detection approach called FakeSTormer that enforces the modeling of subtle spatio-temporal inconsistencies while avoiding overfitting. Specifically, we introduce a multi-task learning framework that incorporates two auxiliary branches for explicitly attending artifact-prone spatial and temporal regions. Additionally, we propose a video-level data synthesis strategy that generates pseudo-fake videos with subtle spatio-temporal artifacts, providing high-quality samples and hand-free annotations for our additional branches.

However, existing methods encode all shapes into a fixed-size token, disregarding the inherent variations in scale and complexity across 3D data. This leads to inefficient latent representations that can compromise downstream generation. We address this challenge by introducing Octree-based Adaptive Tokenization, a novel framework that adjusts the dimension of latent representations according to shape complexity. Our approach constructs an adaptive octree structure guided by a quadric-error-based subdivision criterion and allocates a shape latent vector to each octree cell using a query-based transformer. Building upon this tokenization, we develop an octree-based autoregressive generative model that effectively leverages these variable-sized representations in shape generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach reduces token counts by 50% compared to fixed-size methods while maintaining comparable visual quality. When using a similar token length, our method produces significantly higher-quality shapes. When incorporated with our downstream generative model, our method creates more detailed and diverse 3D content than existing approaches",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a generation-detection cycle consistent (GDCC) learning framework that jointly optimizes both layout-to-image (L2I) generation and object detection (OD) tasks in an end-to-end manner. The key of GDCC lies in the inherent duality between the two tasks, where L2I takes all object boxes and labels as input conditions to generate images, and OD maps images back to these layout conditions. Specifically, in GDCC, L2I generation is guided by a layout translation cycle loss, ensuring that the layouts used to generate images align with those predicted from the synthesized images. Similarly, OD benefits from an image translation cycle loss, which enforces consistency between the synthesized images fed into the detector and those generated from predicted layouts. While current L2I and OD tasks benefit from large-scale annotated layout-image pairs, our GDCC enables more efficient use of annotation-free synthetic data, thereby further enhancing data efficiency. It is worth noting that our GDCC framework is computationally efficient thanks to the perturbative single-step sampling strategy and a priority timestep re-sampling strategy during training. Besides, GDCC preserves the architectures of L2I, OD models, and the generation pipeline within the framework, thus maintaining the original inference speed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GDCC significantly improves the controllability of diffusion models and the accuracy of object detectors",

Despite significant progress, due to the limitations of the weakly-supervised and the deficiencies of the model architecture, existing methods are lacking in simultaneously improving both the segment-level prediction and the event-level prediction. In this work, we propose an audio-visual Mamba network with pseudo labeling aUGmentation (MUG) for emphasising the uniqueness of each segment and excluding the noise interference from the alternate modalities. Specifically, we annotate some of the pseudo-labels based on previous work. Using unimodal pseudo-labels, we perform cross-modal random combinations to generate new data, which can enhance the model's ability to parse various segment-level event combinations. For feature processing and interaction, we employ a audio-visual mamba network. The AV-Mamba enhances the ability to perceive different segments and excludes additional modal noise while sharing similar modal information. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that MUG improves state-of-the-art results on LLP dataset in all metrics ( e.g., gains of 2.1% and 1.2% in terms of visual Segment-level and audio Segment-level metrics).

Conventional deep learning models are typically modality-dependent, often requiring custom architectures and objectives for different types of signals. However, existing INR frameworks frequently rely on global latent vectors or exhibit computational inefficiencies that limit their broader applicability. We introduce **LIFT**, a novel, high-performance framework that addresses these challenges by capturing multiscale information through meta-learning. LIFT leverages multiple parallel localized implicit functions alongside a hierarchical latent generator to produce unified latent representations that span local, intermediate, and global features. This architecture facilitates smooth transitions across local regions, enhancing expressivity while maintaining inference efficiency. Additionally, we introduce ReLIFT, an enhanced variant of LIFT that incorporates residual connections and expressive frequency encodings. With this straightforward approach, ReLIFT effectively addresses the convergence-capacity gap found in comparable methods, providing an efficient yet powerful solution to improve capacity and speed up convergence. Empirical results show that LIFT achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in generative modeling and classification tasks, with notable reductions in computational costs.

The proposed nested descriptor learning strategy generates a series of ultra-compact global descriptors, reduced by approximately compared to state-of-the-art methods, in a coarse-to-fine manner, eliminating the need for offline dimensionality reduction or training multiple models. Extensive experiments across various VPR benchmarks demonstrate that SemVPR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods with significantly lower computational costs, rendering its feasibility for latency-sensitive scenarios in real-world applications",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Multi-Modal Object Detection (MMOD), due to its stronger adaptability to various complex environments, has been widely applied in various applications. Extensive research is dedicated to the RGB-IR object detection, primarily focusing on how to integrate complementary features from RGB-IR modalities. However, they neglect the mono-modality insufficient learning problem, which arises from decreased feature extraction capability in multi-modal joint learning. This leads to a prevalent but unreasonable phenomenon\\textemdash Fusion Degradation, which hinders the performance improvement of the MMOD model. Motivated by this, in this paper, we introduce linear probing evaluation to the multi-modal detectors and rethink the multi-modal object detection task from the mono-modality learning perspective. Therefore, we construct a novel framework called M2D-LIF, which consists of the Mono-Modality Distillation (M2D) method and the Local Illumination-aware Fusion (LIF) module. The M2D-LIF framework facilitates the sufficient learning of mono-modality during multi-modal joint training and explores a lightweight yet effective feature fusion manner to achieve superior object detection performance. Extensive experiments conducted on three MMOD datasets demonstrate that our M2D-LIF effectively mitigates the Fusion Degradation phenomenon and outperforms the previous SOTA detectors.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "While recent video diffusion models enable video editing, unifying diverse instructional editing tasks (e.g., add, remove, modify) under a single framework remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we introduce VEGGIE, a Video Editor with Grounded Generation from Instructions, a simple end-to-end framework that unifies video concept editing, grounding, and reasoning based on diverse user instructions. Specifically, given a video and text query, VEGGIE first utilises an MLLM to interpret user intentions in instructions and ground them to the video contexts, generating frame-specific grounded task queries for pixel-space responses. A diffusion model then renders these plans and generates edited videos that align with user intent. To support diverse tasks and complex instructions, we employ a curriculum learning strategy: first aligning the MLLM and video diffu- sion model with large-scale instructional image editing data, followed by end-to-end fine-tuning on high-quality multitask video data. Additionally, we introduce a novel data synthe- sis pipeline to generate paired instructional video editing data for model training. It transforms static image data into diverse, high-quality video editing samples by leveraging Image-to-Video models to inject dynamics. VEGGIE shows strong performance in instructional video editing with different editing skills, outperforming the best instructional baseline as a versatile model, while other models struggle with multi-tasking. VEGGIE also excels in video object grounding and reasoning segmentation, where other baselines fail. We further reveal how the multiple tasks help each other and highlight promising applications like zero-shot multimodal instructional and in-context video editing",

    "abstract": "Federated Continual Learning (FCL) has recently garnered significant attention due to its ability to continuously learn new tasks while protecting user privacy. However, existing Data-Free Knowledge Transfer (DFKT) methods require training the entire model, leading to high training and communication costs, while prompt pool-based methods with access to other task-specific prompts in the pool may pose a privacy leakage risk. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method: Task-aware Prompt gradient Projection and Replay (TPPR), which leverages visual prompts to build a parameter-efficient tuning architecture. Specifically, we propose the Task-Aware Prompt Gradient Projection (TAPGP) mechanism to balance the learning of task-agnostic and task-specific knowledge. In practice, we make the gradient of the deep prompts orthogonal to the virtual data and prompts of preceding tasks, which prevents the erosion of old task knowledge while allowing the model to learn new information. Additionally, we introduce Dual-Level Prompt Replay (DLPR) based on the exponential moving average to facilitate knowledge review at both inter-task and intra-task levels, effectively inheriting learned knowledge. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively reduces model communication overhead and alleviates forgetting while fully protecting privacy.

    "abstract": "Evaluating the quality of image-text pairs is essential for data processing in vision-language pre-training. Most metrics currently use off-the-shelf models, like CLIP-Score, to score pairs based on feature similarity. However, we find that different scoring models often produce inconsistent quality scores for the same data. This disparity impacts data processing results, leading to variations in datasets and, consequently, in model performance when trained on these datasets. Notably, no single quality score excels across all tasks, as each has biases toward specific concepts, resulting in complementary effects on model performance. This complicates the selection of scoring models. In this paper, we analyze these disparities and propose a method called Mixture-of-Scores (MoS). This approach integrates various quality scores into a robust ensemble score, effectively mitigating biases. It can be implemented easily in just three lines of code. Our extensive experiments show that MoS outperforms existing single quality scores across multiple vision-language tasks and benchmarks.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Video generation models have achieved remarkable progress in text-to-video tasks. These models are typically trained on text-video pairs with highly detailed and carefully crafted descriptions, while real-world user inputs during inference are often concise, vague, or poorly structured. This gap makes prompt optimization crucial for generating high-quality videos. Current methods often rely on large language models (LLMs) to refine prompts through in-context learning, but suffer from several limitations: they may distort user intent, omit critical details, or introduce safety risks. Moreover, they optimize prompts without considering the impact on the final video quality, which can lead to suboptimal results. To address these issues, we introduce VPO, a principled framework that optimizes prompts based on three core principles: harmlessness, accuracy, and helpfulness. The generated prompts faithfully preserve user intents and, more importantly, enhance the safety and quality of generated videos. To achieve this, VPO employs a two-stage optimization approach. First, we construct and refine a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) dataset based on principles of safety and alignment. Second, we introduce both text-level and video-level feedback to further optimize the SFT model with preference learning. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that VPO significantly improves safety, alignment, and video quality compared to baseline methods. Moreover, VPO shows strong generalization across video generation models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that VPO could outperform and be combined with RLHF methods on video generation models, underscoring the effectiveness of VPO in aligning video generation models.

While many methods explain black-box reasoning, most lack effective interventions or only operate at sample-level without modifying the model itself.

CBM-HNMU leverages the Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM) as an interpretable framework to approximate black-box reasoning and communicate conceptual understanding. Detrimental concepts are automatically identified and refined (removed/replaced) based on global gradient contributions. The modified CBM then distills corrected knowledge back into the black-box model, enhancing both interpretability and accuracy. We evaluate CBM-HNMU on various CNN and transformer-based models across Flower-102, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, FGVC-Aircraft, and CUB-200, achieving a maximum accuracy improvement of 2.64% and a maximum increase in average accuracy across 1.03%.

Our key contribution is separating the view synthesis process into two tasks of reconstructing visible regions and hallucinating missing regions, and introducing two personalized diffusion models, each tailored to one of these tasks. Specifically, one model ('repair') takes a rendered image as input and predicts the corresponding high-quality image, which in turn is used as a pseudo ground truth image to constrain the optimization. The other model ('inpainting') primarily focuses on hallucinating details in unobserved areas. To integrate these models effectively, we introduce a two-stage optimization strategy: the first stage reconstructs visible areas using the repair model, and the second stage reconstructs missing regions with the inpainting model while ensuring coherence through further optimization. Moreover, we augment the optimization with a novel Gaussian initialization method that obtains per-image depth by combining 3D-consistent and smooth depth with highly detailed relative depth. We demonstrate that by separating the process into two tasks and addressing them with the repair and inpainting models, we produce results with detailed textures in both visible and missing regions that outperform state-of-the-art approaches on a diverse set of scenes with extremely sparse inputs",

However, existing diffusion model quantization methods do not consider input conditions, such as text prompts, as an essential source of information for quantization. In this paper, we propose a novel quantization method dubbed Quantization of Language-to-Image diffusion models using text Prompts (QLIP). QLIP leverages text prompts to guide the selection of bit precision for every layer at each time step. In addition, QLIP can be seamlessly integrated into existing quantization methods to enhance quantization efficiency. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of QLIP in reducing computational complexity and improving the quality of the generated images across various datasets",

    "abstract": "This paper tackles the challenge of robust reconstruction, i.e., the task of reconstructing a 3D scene from a set of inconsistent multi-view images. Some recent works have attempted to simultaneously remove image inconsistencies and perform reconstruction by integrating image degradation modeling into neural 3D scene representations. However, these methods rely heavily on dense observations for robustly optimizing model parameters. To address this issue, we propose to decouple robust reconstruction into two subtasks: restoration and reconstruction, which naturally simplifies the optimization process. To this end, we introduce UniVerse, a unified framework for robust reconstruction based on a video diffusion model. Specifically, UniVerse first converts inconsistent images into initial videos, then uses a specially designed video diffusion model to restore them into consistent images, and finally reconstructs the 3D scenes from these restored images. Compared with case-by-case per-view degradation modeling, the diffusion model learns a general scene prior from large-scale data, making it applicable to diverse image inconsistencies. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the strong generalization capability and superior performance of our method in robust reconstruction. Moreover, UniVerse can control the style of the reconstructed 3D scene. The code will be released for the reproducibility",

We introduce a method for reconstructing generic dynamic scenes, featuring explicit, persistent 3D motion trajectories in the world coordinate frame, from casually captured monocular videos.We tackle the problem with two key insights: First, we exploit the low-dimensional structure of 3D motion by representing scene motion with a compact set of SE(3) motion bases. Each point's motion is expressed as a linear combination of these bases, facilitating soft decomposition of the scene into multiple rigidly-moving groups. Second, we take advantage of off-the-shelf data-driven priors such as monocular depth maps and long-range 2D tracks, and devise a method to effectively consolidate these noisy supervisory signals, resulting in a globally consistent representation of the dynamic scene. Experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance for both long-range 3D/2D motion estimation and novel view synthesis on dynamic scenes",

    "abstract": "Inserting 3D objects into videos is a longstanding challenge in computer graphics with applications in augmented reality, virtual try-on, and video composition. Achieving both temporal consistency, or realistic lighting remains difficult, particularly in dynamic scenarios with complex object motion, perspective changes, and varying illumination. While 2D diffusion models have shown promise for producing photorealistic edits, they often struggle with maintaining temporal coherence across frames. Conversely, traditional 3D rendering methods excel in spatial and temporal consistency but fall short in achieving photorealistic lighting. In this work, we propose a hybrid object insertion pipeline that combines the strengths of both paradigms. Specifically, we focus on inserting bracelets into dynamic wrist scenes, leveraging the high temporal consistency of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for initial rendering and refining the results using a 2D diffusion-based enhancement model to ensure realistic lighting interactions. Our method introduces a shading-driven pipeline that separates intrinsic object properties (albedo, shading, reflectance) and refines both shading and sRGB images for photorealism. To maintain temporal coherence, we optimize the 3DGS model with multi-frame weighted adjustments. This is the first approach to synergize 3D rendering and 2D diffusion for video object insertion, offering a robust solution for realistic and consistent video editing",

    "abstract": "Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to deep neural networks (DNNs), as attackers can inject a backdoor by tampering with only a few samples. The variety of backdoor attacks makes comprehensive defense extremely challenging. Previous defenses typically assume that backdoor samples are out-of-distribution (OOD) data of benign samples. However, backdoor samples can also be in-distribution (ID) data of benign samples and hard to identify as outliers, potentially causing defenses to fail. To address this issue, we propose a two-stage backdoor defense based on Enhanced Splitting and Trap Isolation (ESTI), leveraging attackers' tampering to defend against their attacks. In the first stage, we introduce backdoored models in conjunction with a benign model to split the dataset into a reliable clean subset and a poisoned subset. In the second stage, we introduce a trap mechanism to isolate the poisoned subset into a trap class to train a trap-model. The trap-model can flip the predictions of poisoned samples from the attacker's target class to the trap class. Through extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and five model architectures, we demonstrate that ESTI effectively defends against various backdoor attacks while maintaining model performance on benign data, proving the superiority of our approach.

While such methods deliver the current state of the art, they often fail to correctly separate instances overlapping in 2D image space since only semantics are considered. To tackle this issue, we instead propose to cut the semantic masks in 3D to obtain the final 2D instances by utilizing a point cloud representation of the scene. Furthermore, we derive a Spatial Importance function, which we use to resharpen the semantics along the 3D borders of instances. Nevertheless, these pseudo-masks are still subject to mask ambiguity. To address this issue, we further propose to augment the training of a class-agnostic detector with three Spatial Confidence components aiming to isolate a clean learning signal.

Despite advancements in spatial reasoning within VLMs, recent research has shown that modern VLMs significantly lack perspective-aware reasoning capabilities and exhibit a strong bias toward egocentric interpretations. To bridge the gap between VLMs and human perception, we focus on the role of mental imagery, where humans perceive the world through abstracted representations that facilitate perspective shifts. Motivated by this, we propose a framework for perspective-aware reasoning, named Abstract Perspective Change (APC), that effectively leverages vision foundation models, such as object detection, segmentation, and orientation estimation, to construct scene abstractions and enable perspective changes. Our experiments on synthetic and real-image benchmarks, compared with various VLMs, demonstrate significant improvements in perspective-aware reasoning with our framework, further outperforming fine-tuned spatial reasoning models and novel-view-synthesis-based approaches",

Recent efforts have shifted toward training a single model capable of handling multiple classes. However, directly extending early AD methods to multi-class settings often results in degraded performance. In this paper, we investigate this performance degradation observed in reconstruction-based methods, identifying the key issue: inter-class confusion. This confusion emerges when a model trained in multi-class scenarios incorrectly reconstructs samples from one class as those of another, thereby exacerbating reconstruction errors. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective modification, called class-aware contrastive learning (CCL). By explicitly leveraging raw object category information (e.g., carpet or wood) as supervised signals, we introduce local CL to refine multiscale dense features, and global CL to obtain more compact feature representations of normal patterns, thereby effectively adapting the models to multi-class settings.

Our key finding is that the majority of latency arises from the large-scale step where most tokens have already converged. Leveraging this observation, we develop the cached token pruning strategy that only forwards pivotal tokens for scale-specific modeling while using cached tokens from previous scale steps to restore the pruned slots. This significantly reduces the number of forwarded tokens and improves the efficiency at larger resolutions. Experiments show the proposed FastVAR can further speedup FlashAttention-accelerated VAR by 2.7x with negligible performance drop of <1%.

This task faces unique challenges of identifying subtle, taxonomy-free event changes in real-time, without the access to future frames. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel On-GEBD framework, ESTimator, inspired by Event Segmentation Theory (EST) which explains how humans segment ongoing activity into events by leveraging the discrepancies between predicted and actual information. Our framework consists of two key components: the Consistent Event Anticipator (CEA), and the Online Boundary Discriminator (OBD). Specifically, the CEA generates a prediction of the future frame reflecting current event dynamics based solely on prior frames. Then, the OBD measures the prediction error and adaptively adjusts the threshold using statistical tests on past errors to capture diverse, subtle event transitions.

Despite this advantage, the existing method can only measure the proximity without yielding the distance as an explicit function of rigid body transformation. Thus, an optimizable distance function on the manifold has remained underdeveloped, stifling its application in registration problems. This paper is the first to explicitly derive an optimizable cost function between two Grassmannian features with respect to rigid body transformation (R and t). Specifically, we present a rigorous mathematical proof demonstrating that the bases of high-dimensional linear subspaces can serve as an explicit representation of the cost. Finally, we propose an optimizable cost function based on the transformed bases that can be applied to the registration problem of any affine subspace. Compared to vector parameter-based approaches, our method is able to find a globally optimal solution by directly minimizing the geodesic distance which is agnostic to representation ambiguity. The resulting cost function and its extension to the inlier-set maximizing Branch-and-Bound (BnB) solver have been demonstrated to improve the convergence of existing solutions or outperform them in various computer vision tasks.

    "abstract": "3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has gained increasing attention due to its pivotal role in 3D perception. Recent advancements have primarily focused on refining voxel-level features to construct 3D scenes. However, treating voxels as the basic interaction units inherently limits the utilization of class-level information, which is proven critical for enhancing the granularity of completion results. To address this, we propose Disentangling Instance and Scene Contexts (DISC), a novel dual-stream paradigm that enhances learning for both instance and scene categories through separated optimization. Specifically, we replace voxel queries with discriminative class queries, which incorporate class-specific geometric and semantic priors. Additionally, we exploit the intrinsic properties of classes to design specialized decoding modules, facilitating targeted interactions and efficient class-level information flow. Experimental results demonstrate that DISC achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks, with mIoU scores of 17.35 and 20.55, respectively. Remarkably, DISC even outperforms multi-frame SOTA methods using only single-frame input and significantly improves instance category performance, surpassing both single-frame and multi-frame SOTA instance mIoU by 17.9% and 11.9%, respectively, on the SemanticKITTI hidden test",

    "abstract": "End-to-end autonomous driving directly generates planning trajectories from raw sensor data, yet it typically relies on costly perception supervision to extract scene information. A critical research challenge arises: constructing an informative driving world model to enable perception annotation-free, end-to-end planning via self-supervised learning. In this paper, we present World4Drive, an end-to-end autonomous driving framework that employs vision foundation models to build latent world models for generating and evaluating multi-modal planning trajectories. Specifically, World4Drive first extracts scene features, including driving intention and world latent representations enriched with spatial-semantic priors provided by vision foundation models. It then generates multi-modal planning trajectories based on current scene features and driving intentions and predicts multiple intention-driven future states within the latent space. Finally, it introduces a world model selector module to evaluate and select the best trajectory. We achieve perception annotation-free, end-to-end planning through self-supervised alignment between actual future observations and predicted observations reconstructed from the latent space. World4Drive achieves state-of-the-art performance without manual perception annotations on both the open-loop nuScenes and closed-loop NavSim benchmarks, demonstrating an 18.0% relative reduction in L2 error, 46.7% lower collision rate, and 3.75 faster training convergence.

While prior work has made significant progress by integrating language features into geometrically detailed 3D scene representations using 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS), these approaches rely on computationally intensive offline preprocessing of language features for each input image, limiting adaptability to new environments. In this work, we introduce Online Language Splatting, the first framework to achieve online, near real-time, open-vocabulary language mapping within a 3DGS-SLAM system without requiring pre-generated language features. The key challenge lies in efficiently fusing high-dimensional language features into 3D representations while balancing the computation speed, memory usage, rendering quality and open-vocabulary capability. To this end, we innovatively design: (1) a high-resolution CLIP embedding module capable of generating detailed language feature maps in 18ms per frame, (2) a two-stage online auto-encoder that compresses 768-dimensional CLIP features to 15 dimensions while preserving open-vocabulary capabilities, and (3) a color-language disentangled optimization approach to improve rendering quality.

This task addresses the question of whether models can effectively perceive the geometry of occluded regions based on visible cues. Prior methods primarily rely on synthetic datasets and focus on metric depth estimation, limiting their generalization to real-world settings due to domain shifts and scalability challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel formulation of amodal depth estimation in the wild, focusing on relative depth prediction to improve model generalization across diverse natural images. We introduce a new large-scale dataset, Amodal Depth In the Wild (ADIW), created using a scalable pipeline that leverages segmentation datasets and compositing techniques. Depth maps are generated using large pre-trained depth models, and a scale-and-shift alignment strategy is employed to refine and blend depth predictions, ensuring consistency in ground-truth annotations. To tackle the amodal depth task, we present two complementary frameworks: Amodal-DAV2, a deterministic model based on Depth Anything V2, and Amodal-DepthFM, a generative model that integrates conditional flow matching principles. Our proposed frameworks effectively leverage the capabilities of large pre-trained models with minimal modifications to achieve high-quality amodal depth predictions (Fig. 1).

    "abstract": "Accurate breast ultrasound (BUS) image segmentation is critical for diagnosis and surgical planning, but faces challenges due to limited labeled images. Semi-supervised methods show promise by leveraging pseudo-labels to mitigate reliance on large-scale annotations. However, their performance is highly dependent on the quality of pseudo-labels, which is difficult to guarantee in BUS images due to inherent complexities such as low contrast, speckle noise, and artifacts. Previous studies primarily focus on refining pseudo-labels in one way or the other, or introducing auxiliary supervision; yet they overlook the potential of harnessing intrinsic and inherent pixel relations to enhance the robustness of semi-supervised segmentation. In this paper, we present a novel relation-aware semi-supervised model for BUS image segmentation, which is composed of two innovative components: an adjacent relation propagation (ARP) module and a cross-layer relation alignment (CRA) module, for comprehensively explore pixel relations to improve segmentation performance. The ARP propagates relations among adjacent pixels to reinforce the collaborative prediction of correlated pixels and enhance the model's awareness of local semantic consistency. The CRA aligns cross-layer pixel relations, employing deep-layer guidance to rectify erroneous correlations in shallow layers for noise suppression, while integrating multi-scale contexts to enable robust segmentation of lesions with varying sizes.

    "abstract": "Recent video-language models have shown great potential for video understanding, but still struggle with accurate temporal grounding for event-level perception. We observe that two main factors in video understanding (i.e., temporal grounding and textual response) form a logical hierarchy: accurate temporal evidence grounding lays the foundation for reliable textual response. However, existing works typically handle these two tasks in a coupled manner without a clear logical structure, leading to sub-optimal objectives. We address this from a factorized learning perspective. We first propose D2VLM, a framework that decouples the learning of these two tasks while also emphasizing their inherent dependency. We adopt a \"grounding then answering with evidence referencing\" paradigm and introduce evidence tokens for evidence grounding, which emphasize event-level visual semantic capture beyond the focus on timestamp representation in existing works. To further facilitate the learning of these two tasks, we introduce a novel factorized preference optimization (FPO) algorithm. Unlike standard preference optimization, FPO explicitly incorporates probabilistic temporal grounding modeling into the optimization objective, enabling preference learning for both temporal grounding and textual response. We also construct a synthetic dataset to address the lack of suitable datasets for factorized preference learning with explicit temporal grounding.

Existing studies based on Variational Autoencoders (VAE) improve efficiency by transferring the image restoration process from pixel space to latent space.

These lead to restored images often exhibiting image detail loss and incomplete degradation removal. To address this issue, we propose a Controlled Differential Disentangled VAE, which utilizes Hierarchical Contrastive Disentanglement Learning and an Orthogonal Gated Projection Module to guide the VAE to actively discard easily recoverable background information while encoding more difficult-to-recover degraded information into the latent space. Additionally, we design a Complex Invertible Multiscale Fusion Network to handle background features, ensuring their consistency, and utilize a latent space restoration network to transform the degraded latent features, leading to more accurate restoration results. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively alleviates the information loss problem in VAE models while ensuring computational efficiency, significantly improving the quality of UHD image restoration, and achieves state-of-the-art results in six UHD restoration tasks with only 1M parameters.Our code will be available here",

The key insight is to iteratively align the knowledge domain of task planning and action execution.

Regrettably, privacy concerns lead to the discontinuation of real datasets, underscoring the pressing need for a tailored synthetic dataset dedicated to the FIQA task. However, creating satisfactory synthetic datasets for FIQA is challenging. It requires not only controlling the intra-class degradation of different quality factors (e.g., pose, blur, occlusion) for the pseudo-identity generation but also designing an optimized quality characterization method for quality annotations. This paper undertakes the pioneering initiative to establish a Synthetic dataset for FIQA (SynFIQA) based on a hypothesis: accurate quality labelling can be achieved through the utilization of quality priors across the diverse domains involved in quality-controllable generation. To validate this, we tailor the generation of reference and degraded samples by aligning pseudo-identity image features in stable diffusion latent space, editing 3D facial parameters, and customizing dual text prompts and post-processing. Furthermore, we propose a novel quality characterization method that thoroughly examines the relationship of Multiple Reference representations among recognition embedding, spatial, and visual-language domains to acquire annotations essential for fitting FIQA models (MR-FIQA).

    "abstract": "As face recognition systems (FRS) become more widely used, user privacy becomes more important. A key privacy issue in FRS is protecting the user's face template, as the characteristics of the user's face image can be recovered from the template. Although recent advances in cryptographic tools such as homomorphic encryption (HE) have provided opportunities for securing the FRS, HE cannot be used directly with FRS in an efficient plug-and-play manner. In particular, although HE is functionally complete for arbitrary programs, it is basically designed for algebraic operations on encrypted data of predetermined shape, such as a polynomial ring. Thus, a non-tailored combination of HE and the system can yield very inefficient performance, and many previous HE-based face template protection methods are hundreds of times slower than plain systems without protection. In this study, we propose \\mathsf IDFace , a new HE-based secure and efficient face identification method with template protection. \\mathsf IDFace is designed on the basis of two novel techniques for efficient searching on a (homomorphically encrypted) biometric database with an angular metric. The first technique is a template representation transformation that sharply reduces the unit cost for the matching test. The second is a space-efficient encoding that reduces wasted space from the encryption algorithm, thus saving the number of operations on encrypted templates. Through experiments, we show that \\mathsf IDFace can identify a face template from among a database of 1M encrypted templates in 126ms, showing only 2xoverhead compared to the identification over plaintexts",

This absence hinders the development and evaluation of display-based inverse rendering methods. In this paper, we introduce the first real-world dataset for display-based inverse rendering. To achieve this, we construct and calibrate an imaging system comprising an LCD display and stereo polarization cameras. We then capture a diverse set of objects with diverse geometry and reflectance under one-light-at-a-time (OLAT) display patterns. We also provide high-quality ground-truth geometry. Our dataset enables the synthesis of captured images under arbitrary display patterns and different noise levels. Using this dataset, we evaluate the performance of existing photometric stereo and inverse rendering methods, and provide a simple, yet effective baseline for display inverse rendering, outperforming state-of-the-art inverse rendering methods.Code and dataset are available on our project page at https://michaelcsj.github.io/DIR/",

We introduce Lyra, an efficient MLLM that enhances multi-modal abilities, including advanced long speech comprehension, sound understanding, cross-modality efficiency, and seamless speech interaction. To achieve efficiency and speech-centric capabilities, Lyra employs three strategies: (1) leveraging existing open-source large models and a proposed multi-modality LoRA to reduce training costs and data requirements; (2) using a latent multi-modality regularizer and extractor to strengthen the relationship between speech and other modalities, thereby enhancing model performance; and (3) constructing a high-quality, extensive dataset that includes 1.5M multi-modal (language, vision, audio) data samples and 12K long speech samples, enabling Lyra to handle complex long speech inputs and achieve more robust omni-cognition. Compared to other omni-methods, Lyra achieves state-of-the-art performance on various vision-language, vision-speech, and speech-language benchmarks, while also using fewer computational resources and less training data.

It features a lightweight design, low adaptation overhead and powerful spatio-temporal feature adaptation capabilities. D^2ST-Adapter is structured with an internal dual-pathway architecture that enables built-in disentangled encoding of spatial and temporal features within the adapter, seamlessly integrating into the single-stream feature learning framework of pre-trained image models. In particular, we develop an efficient yet effective implementation of the D^2ST-Adapter, incorporating the specially devised anisotropic Deformable Spatio-Temporal Attention as its pivotal operation. This mechanism can be individually tailored for two pathways with anisotropic sampling densities along the spatial and temporal domains in 3D spatio-temporal space, enabling disentangled encoding of spatial and temporal features while maintaining a lightweight design.

In this paper, we propose Hi-Gaussian, which employs feed-forward 3D Gaussians for efficient and generalizable single-view 3D reconstruction. A Normalized Spherical Projection module is introduced following an Encoder-Decoder network in our model, assigning a larger range to the transformed spherical coordinates, which can enlarge the field of view during scene reconstruction. Besides, to reconstruct occluded regions behind the visible part, we introduce a novel Hierarchical Gaussian Sampling strategy, utilizing two layers of Gaussians to hierarchically represent 3D scenes. We first use a pre-trained monocular depth estimation model to provide depth initialization for leader Gaussians, and then leverage the leader Gaussians to estimate the distribution followed by follower Gaussians, which can flexibly move into occluded areas.

An analytical optical flow composition module integrates these motion representations in 3D space and projects them into a unified optical flow. An optical flow adapter takes the flow to control the base image-to-video diffusion model for generating fine-grained controlled videos. After that, an optional rethinking step can be adopted to ensure the generated video is aligned well with motion information in the prompt. The significant improvement in the Video-Text Camera Motion metrics on VBench indicates that our method achieves precise control over camera motion.

Instead of introducing novel architectural components, SAIL adapts mix-attention mechanisms and multimodal rotary position embedding to better align with the distinct characteristics of visual and textual modalities. We systematically compare SAIL's properties-including scalability, cross-modal information flow patterns, and visual representation capabilities-with those of modular MLLMs. By scaling both training data and model size, SAIL achieves performance comparable to modular MLLMs. Notably, the removal of pretrained ViT components enhances SAIL's scalability and results in significantly different cross-modal information flow patterns. Moreover, SAIL demonstrates strong visual representation capabilities, achieving results on par with ViT-22B in vision tasks such as semantic segmentation.

    "abstract": "Generalizable depth completion enables the acquisition of dense metric depth maps for unseen environments, offering robust perception capabilities for various downstream tasks. However, training such models typically requires large-scale datasets with metric depth labels, which are often labor-intensive to collect. This paper presents PacGDC, a label-efficient technique that enhances data diversity with minimal annotation effort for generalizable depth completion. PacGDC builds on novel insights into inherent ambiguities and consistencies in object shapes and positions during 2D-to-3D projection, allowing the synthesis of numerous pseudo geometries for the same visual scene. This process greatly broadens available geometries by manipulating scene scales of the corresponding depth maps. To leverage this property, we propose a new data synthesis pipeline that uses multiple depth foundation models as scale manipulators. These models robustly provide pseudo depth labels with varied scene scales, affecting both local objects and global layouts, while ensuring projection consistency that supports generalization. To further diversify geometries, we incorporate interpolation and relocation strategies, as well as unlabeled images, extending the data coverage beyond the individual use of foundation models. Extensive experiments show that PacGDC achieves remarkable generalizability across multiple benchmarks, excelling in diverse scene semantics/scales and depth sparsity/patterns under both zero-shot and few-shot settings.

However, existing methods have limitations: 3D diffusion models are limited by dataset scarcity and the absence of strong pre-trained priors, while 2D diffusion-based approaches struggle with geometric consistency. We propose a method that leverages 2D diffusion models' implicit 3D reasoning ability while ensuring 3D consistency via Gaussian-splatting-based geometric distillation. Specifically, the proposed Gaussian Splatting Decoder enforces 3D consistency by transforming SV3D latent outputs into an explicit 3D representation. Unlike SV3D, which only relies on implicit 2D representations for video generation, Gaussian Splatting explicitly encodes spatial and appearance attributes, enabling multi-view consistency through geometric constraints. These constraints correct view inconsistencies, ensuring robust geometric consistency. As a result, our approach simultaneously generates high-quality, multi-view-consistent images and accurate 3D models, providing a scalable solution for single-image-based 3D generation and bridging the gap between 2D Diffusion diversity and 3D structural coherence.

However, recent research introduces a more practical threat model by injecting backdoors at the inference stage. These approaches leverage bit flip attacks to modify model weights using memory fault injection techniques such as Rowhammer. Despite their effectiveness, they suffer from a significant limitation---the need to flip a relatively large number of bits simultaneously, which is highly challenging in practice. To overcome this constraint, we propose SOLEFLIP, the first one-bit-flip backdoor attack on quantized models. Unlike prior methods that rely on optimization-based bit searches and require flipping multiple bits, our algorithm identifies a promising weight for the attack and flips a single bit to insert a backdoor. We evaluate SOLEFLIP on CIFAR-10, SVHN, and ImageNet across various DNN architectures, including a vision transformer. The results show that SOLEFLIP achieves high attack success rates (up to 99.9%, with an average of 98.9%) while causing minimal degradation to benign accuracy (0.0% on average). Furthermore, SOLEFLIP is resilient to backdoor defenses. Our findings reveal a critical threat to DNNs: flipping just one bit in quantized models is sufficient to execute a successful backdoor attack",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Contrastive learning (CL) has become a cornerstone of self-supervised pretraining (SSP) in foundation models; however, extending CL to pixel-wise representation--crucial for medical vision--remains an open problem. Standard CL formulates SSP as a binary optimization problem (binary CL) where the excessive pursuit of feature dispersion leads to an \"over-dispersion\" problem, breaking pixel-wise feature correlation thus disrupting the intra-class distribution. Our vector CL reformulates CL as a vector regression problem, enabling dispersion quantification in pixel-wise pretraining via modeling feature distances in regressing displacement vectors. To implement this novel paradigm, we propose the COntrast in VEctor Regression (COVER) framework. COVER establishes an extendable vector-based self-learning, enforces a consistent optimization flow from vector regression to distance modeling, and leverages a vector pyramid architecture for granularity adaptation, thus preserving pixel-wise feature correlations in SSP. Extensive experiments across 8 tasks, spanning 2 dimensions and 4 modalities, show that COVER significantly improves pixel-wise SSP, advancing generalizable medical visual foundation models.

To address this, we propose CODet, a plug-and-play framework that enhances OVOD by integrating object co-occurrence ---- a form of external contextual knowledge pervasive in real-world scenes. Specifically, CODet extracts visual co-occurrence patterns from images, aligns them with textual dependencies validated by Large Language Models (LLMs), and injects contextual co-occurrence pseudo-labels as external knowledge to guide detection. Without architectural changes, CODet consistently improves five state-of-the-art VLM-based detectors across two benchmarks, achieving notable gains (up to +2.3 AP on novel categories).

In this paper, we rethink that the redundancy in inversion-based image editing exists in both the spatial and temporal dimensions, such as the unnecessary computation in unedited regions and the redundancy in the inversion progress. To tackle these challenges, we propose an Efficient Editing framework, named EEdit, to achieve efficient image editing. Specifically, we introduce three techniques to solve them one by one. For spatial redundancy, spatial locality caching is introduced to compute the edited region and its neighboring regions while skipping the unedited regions, and token indexing preprocessing is designed to further accelerate the caching. For temporal redundancy, inversion step skipping is proposed to reuse the latent for efficient editing. Our experiments demonstrate an average of 2.46x acceleration without performance drop in a wide range of editing tasks including prompt-guided image editing, dragging and image composition.

    "title": "Enhancing Adversarial Transferability by Balancing Exploration and Exploitation with Gradient-Guided Sampling",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Adversarial attacks present a critical challenge to deep neural networks' robustness, particularly in transfer scenarios across different model architectures. However, the transferability of adversarial attacks faces a fundamental dilemma between Exploitation (maximizing attack potency) and Exploration (enhancing cross-model generalization). Traditional momentum-based methods over-prioritize Exploitation, i.e., higher loss maxima for attack potency but weakened generalization (narrow loss surface). Conversely, recent methods with inner-iteration sampling over-prioritize Exploration, i.e., flatter loss surfaces for cross-model generalization but weakened attack potency (suboptimal local maxima). To resolve this dilemma, we propose a simple yet effective Gradient-Guided Sampling (GGS), which harmonizes both objectives through guiding sampling along the gradient ascent direction to improve both sampling efficiency and stability. Specifically, based on MI-FGSM, GGS introduces inner-iteration random sampling and guides the sampling direction using the gradient from the previous inner-iteration (the sampling's magnitude is determined by a random distribution). This mechanism encourages adversarial examples to reside in balanced regions with both flatness for cross-model generalization and higher local maxima for strong attack potency. Comprehensive experiments across multiple DNN architectures and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art transfer attacks.

    "title": "SuperEdit: Rectifying and Facilitating Supervision for Instruction-Based Image Editing",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Due to the challenges of manually collecting accurate editing data, existing datasets are typically constructed using various automated methods, leading to noisy supervision signals caused by the mismatch between editing instructions and original-edited image pairs. Recent efforts attempt to improve editing models through generating higher-quality edited images, pre-training on recognition tasks, or introducing vision-language models (VLMs) but fail to resolve this fundamental issue. In this paper, we offer a novel solution by constructing more effective editing instructions for given image pairs. This includes rectifying the editing instructions to better align with the original-edited image pairs and using contrastive editing instructions to further enhance their effectiveness. Specifically, we find that editing models exhibit specific generation attributes at different inference steps, independent of the text. Based on these prior attributes, we define a unified guide for VLMs to rectify editing instructions. However, there are some challenging editing scenarios that cannot be resolved solely with rectified instructions. To this end, we further construct contrastive supervision signals with positive and negative instructions and introduce them into the model training using triplet loss, thereby further facilitating supervision effectiveness. Our method does not require the VLM modules or pre-training tasks used in previous work, offering a more direct and efficient way to provide better supervision signals, and providing a novel, simple, and effective solution for instruction-based image editing. Results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches.

    "abstract": "Suffering from performance bottlenecks in passively detecting high-quality Deepfake images due to the advancement of generative models, proactive perturbations offer a promising approach to disabling Deepfake manipulations by inserting signals into benign images. However, existing proactive perturbation approaches remain unsatisfactory in several aspects: 1) visual degradation due to direct element-wise addition; 2) limited effectiveness against face swapping manipulation; 3) unavoidable reliance on white- and grey-box settings to involve generative models during training. In this study, we analyze the essence of Deepfake face swapping and argue the necessity of protecting source identities rather than target images, and we propose NullSwap, a novel proactive defense approach that cloaks source image identities and nullifies face swapping under a pure black-box scenario. We design an Identity Extraction module to obtain facial identity features from the source image, while a Perturbation Block is then devised to generate identity-guided perturbations accordingly. Meanwhile, a Feature Block extracts shallow-level image features, which are then fused with the perturbation in the Cloaking Block for image reconstruction. Furthermore, to ensure adaptability across different identity extractors in face swapping algorithms, we propose Dynamic Loss Weighting to adaptively balance identity losses. Experiments demonstrate the outstanding ability of our approach to fool various identity recognition models, outperforming state-of-the-art proactive perturbations in preventing face swapping models from generating images with correct source identities",

This is primarily due to the absence of a designated ego vehicle and the associated sensor inputs, such as camera or LiDAR, typically provided in real-world scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce SynAD, the first framework designed to enhance real-world E2E AD models using synthetic data. Our method designates the agent with the most comprehensive driving information as the ego vehicle in a multi-agent synthetic scenario. We further project path-level scenarios onto maps and employ a newly developed Map-to-BEV Network to derive bird's-eye-view features without relying on sensor inputs. Finally, we devise a training strategy that effectively integrates these map-based synthetic data with real driving data. Experimental results demonstrate that SynAD effectively integrates all components and notably enhances safety performance.

With the advancement of pre-training, leveraging pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) offers a promising starting point for CIL. However, CLIP makes decisions by matching visual embeddings to class names, overlooking the rich contextual information conveyed through language. For instance, the concept of \"cat\" can be decomposed into features like tail, fur, and face for recognition.Besides, since the model is continually updated, these detailed features are overwritten in CIL, requiring external knowledge for compensation.In this paper, we introduce ExterNal knowledGe INjEction (ENGINE) for CLIP-based CIL. To enhance knowledge transfer from outside the dataset, we propose a dual-branch injection tuning framework that encodes informative knowledge from both visual and textual modalities. The visual branch is enhanced with data augmentation to enrich the visual features, while the textual branch leverages GPT-4 to rewrite discriminative descriptors. In addition to this on-the-fly knowledge injection, we also implement post-tuning knowledge by re-ranking the prediction results during inference. With the injected knowledge, the model can better capture informative features for downstream tasks as data evolves. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of ENGINE.

Prevalent event-based solutions primarily utilize events triggered by motion, i.e., \"motion events\" to strengthen only the edge texture, while leaving the high dynamic range and excellent low-light responsiveness of event cameras largely unexplored. This paper instead opens a new avenue from the perspective of estimating the illumination using \"temporal-mapping\" events, i.e., by converting the timestamps of events triggered by a transmittance modulation into brightness values. The resulting fine-grained illumination cues facilitate a more effective decomposition and enhancement of the reflectance component in low-light images through the proposed Illumination-aided Reflectance Enhancement module. Furthermore, the degradation model of temporal-mapping events under low-light condition is investigated for realistic training data synthesis. To address the lack of datasets under this regime, we construct a beam-splitter setup and collect EvLowLight dataset that includes images, temporal-mapping events, and motion events. Extensive experiments across 5 synthetic datasets and our real-world EvLowLight dataset substantiate that the devised pipeline, dubbed RetinEV, excels in producing well-illuminated, high dynamic range images, outperforming previous state-of-the-art event-based methods by up to 6.62 dB, while maintaining an efficient inference speed of 35.6 frames per second on a 640x480 image.

To address the above issues, in this paper, we regard font generation as a font transfer process from the source font to the target font, and construct a video generation framework to model this process. Moreover, a test-time condition alignment mechanism is further developed to enhance the consistency between the generated samples and the provided condition samples. Specifically, we first construct a diffusion-based image-to-image font generation framework for the few-shot font generation task. This framework is expanded into an image-to-video font generation framework by integrating temporal components and frame-index information, enabling the production of high-quality font videos that transition from the source font to the target font. Based on this framework, we develop a noise inversion mechanism in the generative process to perform content and style alignment between the generated samples and the provided condition samples, enhancing style consistency and structural accuracy. The experimental results show that our model achieves superior performance on FFG tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method. We will release our code after publication",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective method for enhancing a small model, named student, by training it under the supervision of larger teacher models. However, existing studies indicate that a substantial capacity gap between the student and teacher can lead to poor learning for the student model. This capacity gap problem limits the applicability of KD and necessitates careful selection of the teacher's size. Despite its importance, the underlying cause of the capacity gap problem remains underexplored. In this paper, we reveal that a substantial disparity in the output distributions of teacher and student models is a key factor behind this issue. To demonstrate this, we decompose the KD loss into two components: class-wise similarity and intra-class distribution, and analyze the contribution of each term. Our analysis shows that a large distributional mismatch can lead to poor student learning.Inspired by this observation, we propose the Adapted Intra-class Distribution (AID) method, wherein the teacher model is fine-tuned to optimize its intra-class distribution to better align with the student's capacity prior to knowledge distillation. This approach effectively bridges the capacity gap between teacher and student models and consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across a diverse range of architectures",

    "abstract": "Recent advances have shown that video generation models can enhance robot learning by deriving effective robot actions through inverse dynamics. However, these methods heavily depend on the quality of generated data and struggle with fine-grained manipulation due to the lack of environment feedback. While video-based reinforcement learning improves policy robustness, it remains constrained by the uncertainty of video generation and the challenges of collecting large-scale robot datasets for training diffusion models. To address these limitations, we propose GENFLOWRL, which derives shaped rewards from generated flow trained from diverse cross-embodiment datasets. This enables learning generalizable and robust policies from diverse demonstrations using low-dimensional, object-centric features. Experiments on 10 manipulation tasks, both in simulation and real-world cross-embodiment evaluations, demonstrate that GENFLOWRL effectively leverages manipulation features extracted from generated object-centric flow, consistently achieving superior performance across diverse and challenging scenarios.

    "abstract": "Despite recent advances in text-to-speech (TTS) models, audio-visual-to-audio-visual (AV2AV) translation still faces a critical challenge: maintaining speaker consistency between the original and translated vocal and facial features. To address this issue, we propose a conditional flow matching (CFM) zero-shot audio-visual renderer that utilizes strong dual guidance from both audio and visual modalities. By leveraging multimodal guidance with CFM, our model robustly preserves speaker-specific characteristics and enhances zero-shot AV2AV translation abilities. For the audio modality, we enhance the CFM process by integrating robust speaker embeddings with x-vectors, which serve to bolster speaker consistency. Additionally, we convey emotional nuances to the face rendering module. The guidance provided by both audio and visual cues remains independent of semantic or linguistic content, allowing our renderer to effectively handle zero-shot translation tasks for monolingual speakers in different languages. We empirically demonstrate that the inclusion of high-quality mel-spectrograms conditioned on facial information not only enhances the quality of the synthesized speech but also positively influences facial generation, leading to overall performance improvements in LSE and FID score.

However, due to the complexity of the process and the need for specialized editing skills, video color grading remains primarily the domain of professional colorists. In this paper, we present a reference based video color grading framework. Our key idea is explicitly generating a look-up table (LUT) for color attribute alignment between reference scenes and input video via a diffusion model. As a training objective, we enforce that high-level features of the reference scenes like look, mood, and emotion should be similar to that of the input video. Our LUT-based approach allows for color grading without any loss of structural details in the whole video frames as well as achieving fast inference. We further build a pipeline to incorporate a user-preference via text prompts for low-level feature enhancement such as contrast and brightness, etc. Experimental results, including extensive user studies, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for video color grading",

While parametric modeling has been actively studied for human and animal shapes, plant leaves present unique challenges due to their diverse shapes and flexible deformation, making common approaches inapplicable. To this problem, we introduce a learning-based parametric model, NeuraLeaf, disentangling the leaves' geometry into their 2D base shapes and 3D deformations. Since the base shapes represent flattened 2D leaves, it allows learning from rich sources of 2D leaf image datasets, and also has the advantage of simultaneously learning texture aligned with the geometry. To model the 3D deformation, we propose a novel skeleton-free skinning model and a newly captured 3D leaf dataset called DeformLeaf. We establish a parametric deformation space by converting the sample-wise skinning parameters into a compact latent representation, allowing for flexible and efficient modeling of leaf deformations. We show that NeuraLeaf successfully generates a wide range of leaf shapes with deformation, resulting in accurate model fitting to 3D observations like depth maps and point clouds.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Video inpainting aims to fill in corrupted regions of the video with plausible contents. Existing methods generally assume that the locations of corrupted regions are known, focusing primarily on the \"how to inpaint\". This reliance necessitates manual annotation of the corrupted regions using binary masks to indicate \"where to inpaint\". However, the annotation of these masks is labor-intensive and expensive, limiting the practicality of current methods. In this paper, we expect to relax this assumption by defining a new blind video inpainting setting, enabling the networks to learn the mapping from corrupted video to inpainted result directly, eliminating the need of corrupted region annotations. Specifically, we propose an end-to-end blind video inpainting network (BVINet) to address both \"where to inpaint\" and \"how to inpaint\" simultaneously. On the one hand, BVINet can predict the masks of corrupted regions by detecting semantic-discontinuous regions of the frame and utilizing temporal consistency prior of the video. On the other hand, the predicted masks are incorporated into the BVINet, allowing it to capture valid context information from uncorrupted regions to fill in corrupted ones. Besides, we introduce a consistency loss to regularize the training parameters of BVINet. In this way, mask prediction and video completion mutually constrain each other, thereby maximizing the overall performance of the trained model. Recognizing that existing datasets are unsuitable for the blind video inpainting task due to the presence of prior knowledge (e.g., corrupted contents and clear borders), we contribute a new dataset specifically designed for blind video inpainting.

    "abstract": "Deep learning models deployed in real-world applications (e.g., medicine) face challenges because source models do not generalize well to domain-shifted target data. Many successful domain adaptation (DA) approaches require full access to source data or reliably labeled target data. Yet, such requirements are unrealistic in scenarios where source data cannot be shared either because of privacy concerns or because it is too large and incurs prohibitive storage or computational costs. Moreover, resource constraints may limit the availability of labeled targets. We illustrate this challenge in a neuroscience setting where source data are unavailable, labeled target data are meager, and predictions involve continuous-valued outputs. We build upon Contradistinguisher (CUDA), an efficient framework that learns a shared model across the labeled source and unlabeled target samples, without intermediate representation alignment. Yet, CUDA was designed for unsupervised DA, with full access to source data, and for classification tasks. We develop CRAFT -- a Contradistinguisher-based Regularization Approach for Flexible Training -- for source-free (SF), semi-supervised transfer of pretrained models in regression tasks. We showcase the efficacy of CRAFT in two neuroscience settings: gaze prediction with electroencephalography (EEG) data and \"brain age\" prediction with structural MRI data. For both datasets, CRAFT yielded up to 9% improvement in root-mean-squared error (RMSE) over fine-tuned models when labeled training examples were scarce. Moreover, CRAFT leveraged unlabeled target data and outperformed four competing state-of-the-art source-free domain adaptation models by more than 3%. Lastly, we demonstrate the efficacy of CRAFT on two other real-world regression benchmarks. We propose CRAFT as an efficient approach for source-free, semi-supervised deep transfer for regression that is ubiquitous in biology and medicine",

    "abstract": "Modern over-parameterized deep models are highly data-dependent, with large scale general-purpose and domain-specific datasets serving as the bedrock for rapid advancements. However, many datasets are proprietary or contain sensitive information, making unrestricted model training problematic. In the open world where data thefts cannot be fully prevented, Dataset Ownership Verification (DOV) has emerged as a promising method to protect copyright by detecting unauthorized model training and tracing illicit activities. Due to its diversity and superior stealth, evading DOV is considered extremely challenging. However, this paper identifies that previous studies have relied on oversimplistic evasion attacks for evaluation, leading to a false sense of security. We introduce a unified evasion framework, in which a teacher model first learns from the copyright dataset and then transfers task-relevant yet identifier-independent domain knowledge to a surrogate student using an out-of-distribution (OOD) dataset as the intermediary. Leveraging Vision-Language Models and Large Language Models, we curate the most informative and reliable subsets from the OOD gallery set as the final transfer set, and propose selectively transferring task-oriented knowledge to achieve a better trade-off between generalization and evasion effectiveness. Experiments across diverse datasets covering eleven DOV methods demonstrate our approach simultaneously eliminates all copyright identifiers and significantly outperforms nine state-of-the-art evasion attacks in both generalization and effectiveness, with moderate computational overhead. As a proof of concept, we reveal key vulnerabilities in current DOV methods, highlighting the need for long-term development to enhance practicality",

In this paper, we explore an orthogonal direction to build a hybrid Mamba-Transformer model (VAMBA) that employs Mamba-2 blocks to encode video tokens with linear complexity. Without any token reduction, VAMBA can encode more than 1024 frames (640x360) on a single GPU, while transformer-based models can only encode 256 frames. On long video input, VAMBA achieves at least 50% reduction in GPU memory usage during training and inference, and nearly doubles the speed per training step compared to transformer-based LMMs. Our experimental results demonstrate that VAMBA improves accuracy by 4.3% on the challenging hour-long video understanding benchmark LVBench over prior efficient video LMMs, and maintains strong performance on a broad spectrum of long and short video understanding tasks",

Recently, researchers in Large Language Models (LLMs) have expanded the scaling to test-time, which can significantly improve LLM performance by using more inference-time computation. Instead of scaling up video foundation models through expensive training costs, we explore the power of Test-Time Scaling (TTS) in video generation, aiming to answer the question: if a video generation model is allowed to use non-trivial amount of inference-time compute, how much can it improve generation quality given a challenging text prompt. In this work, we reinterpret the test-time scaling of video generation as a searching problem to sample better trajectories from Gaussian noise space to the target video distribution. Specifically, we build the search space with test-time verifiers to provide feedback and heuristic algorithms to guide searching process. Given a text prompt, we first explore an intuitive linear search strategy by increasing noise candidates at inference time. As full-step denoising all frames simultaneously requires heavy test-time computation costs, we further design a more efficient TTS method for video generation called Tree-of-Frames (ToF) that adaptively expands and prunes video branches in an autoregressive manner.

    "abstract": "Multi-modal Large language models (MLLMs) show remarkable ability in video understanding. Nevertheless, understanding long videos remains challenging as the models can only process a finite number of frames in a single inference, potentially omitting crucial visual information. To address the challenge, we propose generating multiple predictions through visual context sampling, followed by a scoring mechanism to select the final prediction. Specifically, we devise a bin-wise sampling strategy that enables MLLMs to generate diverse answers based on various combinations of keyframes, thereby enriching the visual context. To determine the final prediction from the sampled answers, we employ a self-reward by linearly combining three scores: (1) a frequency score indicating the prevalence of each option, (2) a marginal confidence score reflecting the inter-intra sample certainty of MLLM predictions, and (3) a reasoning score for different question types, including clue-guided answering for global questions and temporal self-refocusing for local questions. The frequency score ensures robustness through majority correctness, the confidence-aligned score reflects prediction certainty, and the typed-reasoning score addresses cases with sparse key visual information using tailored strategies. Experiments show that this approach covers the correct answer for a high percentage of long video questions, on seven datasets show that our method improves the performance of three MLLMs",

While demonstrating promising effectiveness, existing LNL approaches typically rely on various forms of prior knowledge, such as noise rates or thresholds, to sustain performance. This dependence limits their adaptability and practicality in real-world scenarios where such priors are usually unavailable. To this end, we propose a novel LNL approach, termed CA2C (Combined Asymmetric Co-learning and Co-training), which alleviates the reliance on prior knowledge through an integration of complementary learning paradigms. Specifically, we first introduce an asymmetric co-learning strategy with paradigm deconstruction. This strategy trains two models simultaneously under distinct learning paradigms, harnessing their complementary strengths to enhance robustness against noisy labels. Then, we propose an asymmetric co-training strategy with cross-guidance label generation, wherein knowledge exchange is facilitated between the twin models to mitigate error accumulation. Moreover, we design a confidence-based re-weighting approach for label disambiguation, enhancing robustness against potential disambiguation failures.

    "abstract": "We present a universal prior model for 3D head avatars with explicit hair compositionality. Existing approaches to build generalizable priors for 3D head avatars often adopt a holistic modeling approach, treating the face and hair as an inseparable entity. This overlooks the inherent compositionality of the human head, making it difficult for the model to naturally disentangle face and hair representations, especially when the dataset is limited. Furthermore, such holistic models struggle to support applications like 3D face and hairstyle swapping in a flexible and controllable manner. To address these challenges, we introduce a prior model that explicitly accounts for the compositionality of face and hair, learning their latent spaces separately. A key enabler of this approach is our synthetic hairless data creation pipeline, which removes hair from studio-captured datasets using estimated hairless geometry and texture derived from a diffusion prior. By leveraging a paired dataset of original and synthetic hairless captures, we train disentangled prior models for face and hair, incorporating compositionality as an inductive bias to facilitate effective separation. Our model's inherent compositionality enables seamless transfer of face and hair components between avatars while preserving identity. Additionally, we demonstrate that our model can be fine-tuned in a data-efficient manner using monocular captures to create high-fidelity, hair-compositional 3D head avatars for unseen subjects. These capabilities highlight the practical applicability of our approach in real-world scenarios, paving the way for flexible and expressive 3D avatar generation",

    "abstract": "With the rise of social media, vast amounts of user-uploaded videos (e.g., YouTube) are utilized as training data for Visual Object Tracking (VOT). However, the VOT community has largely overlooked video data-privacy issues, as many private videos have been collected and used for training commercial models without authorization. To alleviate these issues, this paper presents the first investigation on preventing personal video data from unauthorized exploitation by deep trackers. Existing methods for preventing unauthorized data use primarily focus on image-based tasks (e.g., image classification), directly applying them to videos reveals several limitations, including inefficiency, limited effectiveness, and poor generalizability. To address these issues, we propose a novel generative framework for generating Temporal Unlearnable Examples (TUEs), and whose efficient computation makes it scalable for usage on large-scale video datasets. The trackers trained w/ TUEs heavily rely on unlearnable noises for temporal matching, ignoring the original data structure and thus ensuring training video data-privacy. To enhance the effectiveness of TUEs, we introduce a temporal contrastive loss, which further corrupts the learning of existing trackers when using our TUEs for training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in video data-privacy protection, with strong transferability across VOT models, datasets, and temporal matching tasks",

However, existing reconstruction pipelines fail to take full advantage of large-FOV input data because they convert input views to perspective images, resulting in stretching that prevents the use of the full image. Additionally, they calibrate lenses using models that do not accurately fit real fisheye lenses in the periphery. We present a new reconstruction pipeline based on Gaussian Splatting that uses a flexible lens model and supports fields of view approaching 180 degrees. We represent lens distortion with a hybrid neural field based on an Invertible ResNet and use a cubemap to render wide-FOV images while retaining the efficiency of the Gaussian Splatting pipeline. Our system jointly optimizes lens distortion, camera intrinsics, camera poses, and scene representations using a loss measured directly against the original input pixels. We present extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world scenes, demonstrating that our model accurately fits real-world fisheye lenses and that our end-to-end self-calibration approach provides higher-quality reconstructions than existing methods.

To address this limitation, we develop an automated model evaluation (AutoEval) framework for object detection.

PCR estimates detection performance without ground-truth labels by jointly measuring 1) the spatial consistency between boxes before and after NMS, and 2) the reliability of the retained boxes via the confidence scores of overlapping boxes. For a more realistic and scalable evaluation, we construct a meta-dataset by applying image corruptions of varying severity.

One understudied capability in MLLMs is visual spatial planning---the ability to comprehend the spatial arrangements of objects and devise action plans to achieve desired outcomes in visual scenes. It is unclear why MLLMs fall short on these tasks generally considered easy for humans, given their successes across other diverse scenarios.

Our evaluation confirms that both open-source and private MLLMs fail to generate effective plans for even simple spatial planning tasks.

NVQG employs negative score by intentionally simulating content leakage scenarios that swap queries instead of key and values of self-attention layers from visual style prompts. This simple yet effective method significantly reduces content leakage. Furthermore, we provide careful solutions for using a real image as visual style prompts.Through extensive evaluation across various styles and text prompts, our method demonstrates superiority over existing approaches, reflecting the style of the references, and ensuring that resulting images match the text prompts",

    "abstract": "One can hardly model self-contact of human poses without considering underlying body shapes. For example, the pose of rubbing a belly for a person with a low BMI leads to penetration of the hand into the belly for a person with a high BMI. Despite its relevance, existing self-contact datasets lack the variety of self-contact poses and precise body shapes, limiting conclusive analysis between self-contact poses and shapes. To address this, we begin by introducing the first extensive self-contact dataset with precise body shape registration, Goliath-SC, consisting of 383K self-contact poses across 130 subjects. Using this dataset, we propose generative modeling of self-contact prior conditioned by body shape parameters, based on a body-part-wise latent diffusion with self-attention. We further incorporate this prior into single-view human pose estimation while refining estimated poses to be in contact. Our experiments suggest that shape conditioning is vital to the successful modeling of self-contact pose distribution, hence improving single-view pose estimation in self-contact",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Current training-free text-driven image translation primarily uses diffusion features (convolution and attention) of pre-trained model as guidance to preserve the style/structure of source image in translated image. However, the coarse guidance at feature level struggles with style (e.g., visual patterns) and structure (e.g., edges) alignment with the source. Based on the observation that the low-/high-frequency components retain style/structure information of image, in this work, we propose training-free Frequency-Guided Diffusion (FGD), which tailors low-/high-frequency guidance for style- and structure-guided translation, respectively. For low-frequency guidance (style-guided), we substitute the low-frequency components of diffusion latents from sampling process with those from inversion of source and normalize the obtained latent with composited spectrum to enforce color alignment. For high-frequency guidance (structure-guided), we propose high-frequency alignment and high-frequency injection that compensate each other. High-frequency alignment preserves edges and contour by adjusting the predicted noise with guidance function that aligns high-frequency image regions between sampling and source image. High-frequency injection facilitates layout preservation by injecting high-frequency components of diffusion convolution features (from inversion) to sampling process. Qualitative and quantitative results verify the superiority of our method on style- and structure-guided translation tasks",

    "title": "DictAS: A Framework for Class-Generalizable Few-Shot Anomaly Segmentation via Dictionary Lookup",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recent vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have demonstrated remarkable class-generalizable ability to unseen classes in few-shot anomaly segmentation (FSAS), leveraging supervised prompt learning or fine-tuning on seen classes. However, their cross-category generalization largely depends on prior knowledge of real seen anomaly samples. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, namely DictAS, which enables a unified model to detect visual anomalies in unseen object categories without any retraining on the target data, only employing a few normal reference images as visual prompts. The insight behind DictAS is to transfer dictionary lookup capabilities to the FSAS task for unseen classes via self-supervised learning, instead of merely memorizing the normal and abnormal feature patterns from the training set. Specifically, DictAS mainly consists of three components: (1) **Dictionary Construction** - to simulate the index and content of a real dictionary using features from normal reference images. (2) **Dictionary Lookup** - to retrieve queried region features from the dictionary via a sparse lookup strategy. When a query feature cannot be retrieved, it is classified as an anomaly. (3) **Query Discrimination Regularization**- to enhance anomaly discrimination by making abnormal features harder to retrieve from the dictionary. To achieve this, Contrastive Query Constraint and Text Alignment Constraint are further proposed. Extensive experiments on seven public industrial and medical datasets demonstrate that DictAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FSAS methods",

    "abstract": "Compared to 2D data, the scale of point cloud data in different domains available for training, is quite limited. Researchers have been trying to combine these data of different domains for masked autoencoder (MAE) pre-training to leverage such a data scarcity issue. However, the prior knowledge learned from mixed domains may not align well with the downstream 3D point cloud analysis tasks, leading to degraded performance. To address such an issue, we propose the Domain-Adaptive Point Cloud Masked Autoencoder (DAP-MAE), an MAE pre-training method, to adaptively integrate the knowledge of cross-domain datasets for general point cloud analysis. In DAP-MAE, we design a heterogeneous domain adapter that utilizes an adaptation mode during pre-training, enabling the model to comprehensively learn information from point clouds across different domains, while employing a fusion mode in the fine-tuning to enhance point cloud features. Meanwhile, DAP-MAE incorporates a domain feature generator to guide the adaptation of point cloud features to various downstream tasks. With only one pre-training, DAP-MAE achieves excellent performance across four different point cloud analysis tasks, reaching 95.18% in object classification on ScanObjectNN and 88.45% in facial expression recognition on Bosphorus.

While research in model-based 6D object pose estimation has delivered promising results, model-free methods are hindered by the high computational load in rendering and inferring consistent poses of arbitrary objects in a live RGB-D video stream. To address this issue, we present 6DOPE-GS, a novel method for online 6D object pose estimation & tracking with a single RGB-D camera by effectively leveraging advances in Gaussian Splatting. Thanks to the fast differentiable rendering capabilities of Gaussian Splatting, 6DOPE-GS can simultaneously optimize for 6D object poses and 3D object reconstruction. To achieve the necessary efficiency and accuracy for live tracking, our method uses incremental 2D Gaussian Splatting with an intelligent dynamic keyframe selection procedure to achieve high spatial object coverage and prevent erroneous pose updates. We also propose an opacity statistic-based pruning mechanism for adaptive Gaussian density control, to ensure training stability and efficiency. We evaluate our method on the HO3D and YCBInEOAT datasets and show that 6DOPE-GS matches the performance of state-of-the-art baselines for model-free simultaneous 6D pose tracking and reconstruction while providing a 5x speedup. We also demonstrate the method's suitability for live, dynamic object tracking and reconstruction in a real-world setting",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Existing incremental few-shot semantic segmentation (IFSS) methods often learn novel classes by fine-tuning parameters from previous stages. This inevitably reduces the distinguishability of old class features, leading to catastrophic forgetting and overfitting to limited new samples. In this paper, we propose a novel prompt-based IFSS method with a visual prompt pool to store and switch multi-granular knowledge across stages, enhancing the model's ability to learn new classes. Specifically, we introduce three levels of prompts: 1) Task-persistent prompts: capturing generalizable knowledge shared across stages, such as foreground-background distributions, to ensure consistent recognition guidance; 2) Stage-specific prompts: adapting to the unique requirements of each stage by integrating its discriminative knowledge (e.g., shape difference) with common knowledge from previous stages; and 3) Region-unique prompts: encoding category-specific structures (e.g., edges) to more accurately guide the model to retain local details. In particular, we introduce a prompt switching mechanism that adaptively allocates the knowledge required for base and new classes, avoiding interference between prompts and preventing catastrophic forgetting and reducing the increasing computation. Our method achieves a new state-of-the-art performance, outperforming previous SoTA methods by 30.28% mIoU-N on VOC and 13.90% mIoU-N on COCO under 1-shot setting.

    "abstract": "Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification has been widely used in pathological diagnosis and prognosis prediction, and it is commonly formulated as a weakly-supervised Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem because of the large size of WSIs and the difficulty of obtaining fine-grained annotations. In the MIL formulation, a WSI is treated as a bag and the patches cut from it are treated as its instances, and most existing methods first extract instance features and then aggregate them into bag feature using attention-based mechanism for bag-level prediction. These models are trained using only bag-level labels, so they often lack instance-level insights and lose detailed semantic information, which limits their bag-level classification performance and damages their ability to explore high-expressive information. In this paper, we propose Flow-MIL, which leverages normalizing flow-based Latent Semantic Embedding Space (LSES) to enhance feature representation. By mapping patches into the simple and highly-expressive latent space LSES, Flow-MIL achieves effective slide-level aggregation while preserving critical semantic information. We also introduce Gaussian Mixture Model-based Latent Semantic Prototypes (LSP) within the LSES to capture class-specific pathological distribution for each class and refine pseudo instance labels.

To enhance targeted AE transferability, we propose a novel approach using Inverse Target Gradient Competition (ITC) and Spatial Distance Stretching (SDS) in the optimization process. Specifically, we employ a siamese-network-like framework to generate both non-targeted and targeted AEs. The ITC mechanism applies non-targeted adversarial gradients each epoch to impede the optimization of targeted perturbations, thereby improving robustness. Additionally, a top-k SDS strategy guides AEs to penetrate target class regions in the latent space while distancing from non-targeted regions, achieving optimal transferability.

    "abstract": "Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) can generate short photorealistic videos, yet directly training and sampling longer videos with full attention across the video remains computationally challenging. Alternative methods break long videos down into sequential generation of short video segments, requiring multiple sampling chain iterations and specialized consistency modules. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a new paradigm called Video Interface Networks (VINs), which augment DiTs with an abstraction module to enable parallel inference of video chunks. At each diffusion step, VINs encode global semantics from the noisy input of local chunks and the encoded representations, in turn, guide DiTs in denoising chunks in parallel. The coupling of VIN and DiT is learned end-to-end on the denoising objective. Further, the VIN architecture maintains fixed-size encoding tokens that encode the input via a single cross-attention step. Disentangling the encoding tokens from the input thus enables VIN to scale to long videos and learn essential semantics. Experiments on VBench demonstrate that VINs surpass existing chunk-based methods in preserving background consistency and subject coherence. We then show via an optical flow analysis that our approach attains state-of-the-art motion smoothness while using 25-40% fewer FLOPs than full generation. Finally, human raters favorably assessed the overall video quality and temporal consistency of our method in a user study",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Given a textual query along with a corresponding video, the objective of moment retrieval aims to localize the moments relevant to the query within the video. While commendable results have been demonstrated by existing transformer-based approaches, predicting the accurate temporal span of the target moment is still a major challenge. This paper reveals that a crucial reason stems from the spurious correlation between the text query and the moment context. Namely, the model makes predictions by overly associating queries with background frames rather than distinguishing target moments. To address this issue, we propose a dynamic learning approach for moment retrieval, where two strategies are designed to mitigate the spurious correlation. First, we introduce a novel video synthesis approach to construct a dynamic context for the queried moment, enabling the model to attend to the target moment of the corresponding query across dynamic backgrounds. Second, to alleviate the over-association with backgrounds, we enhance representations temporally by incorporating text-dynamics interaction, which encourages the model to align text with target moments through complementary dynamic representations. With the proposed method, our model significantly alleviates the spurious correlation issue in moment retrieval and establishes new state-of-the-art performance on two popular benchmarks, i.e., QVHighlights and Charades-STA. In addition, detailed ablation studies and evaluations across different architectures demonstrate the generalization and effectiveness of the proposed strategies.

This paper introduces Score-based Discriminator Correction (SBDC), a guidance technique for aligning noisy pre-trained conditional diffusion models. The guidance is built on discriminator training using adversarial loss, drawing on prior noise detection techniques to assess the authenticity of each sample.We further show that limiting the usage of our guidance to the early phase of the generation process leads to better performance.Our method is computationally efficient, only marginally increases inference time, and does not require retraining diffusion models.Experiments on different noise settings demonstrate the superiority of our method over previous state-of-the-art methods",

    "abstract": "Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize unseen combinations of known objects and attributes by leveraging knowledge from previously seen compositions. Traditional approaches primarily focus on disentangling attributes and objects, treating them as independent entities during learning. However, this assumption overlooks the semantic constraints and contextual dependencies inside a composition. For example, certain attributes naturally pair with specific objects (e.g., \"striped\" applies to \"zebra\" or \"shirts\" but not \"sky\" or \"water\"), while the same attribute can manifest differently depending on context (e.g., \"young\" in \"young tree\" *vs* \"young dog\"). Thus, capturing attribute-object interdependence remains a fundamental yet long-ignored challenge in CZSL.In this paper, we adopt a Conditional Probability Framework (CPF) to explicitly model attribute-object dependencies. We decompose the probability of a composition into two components: the likelihood of an object and the conditional likelihood of its attribute. To enhance object feature learning, we incorporate textual descriptors to highlight semantically relevant image regions. These enhanced object features then guide attribute learning through a cross-attention mechanism, ensuring better contextual alignment. By jointly optimizing object likelihood and conditional attribute likelihood, our method effectively captures compositional dependencies and generalizes well to unseen compositions. Extensive experiments on multiple CZSL benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Code is available at here",

However, prior methods either cannot perform satisfactorily under targeted attack scenarios or fail to produce contextually coherent adversarial patches, causing them to be easily noticeable by human examiners and insufficiently stealthy against automatic patch defenses. In this paper, we introduce IAP, a novel attack framework that generates highly invisible adversarial patches based on perceptibility-aware localization and perturbation optimization schemes. Specifically, IAP first searches for a proper location to place the patch by leveraging classwise localization and sensitivity maps, balancing the susceptibility of patch location to both victim model prediction and human visual system, then employs a perceptibility-regularized adversarial loss and a gradient update rule that prioritizes color constancy for optimizing invisible perturbations. Comprehensive experiments across various image benchmarks and model architectures demonstrate that IAP consistently achieves competitive attack success rates in targeted settings with significantly improved patch invisibility compared to existing baselines. In addition to being highly imperceptible to humans, IAP is shown to be stealthy enough to render several state-of-the-art patch defenses ineffective",

However, current training is restricted to aligning images with predefined known categories and cannot be associated with unknown categories. In this work, we propose utilizing universal attributes as a bridge to enhance the alignment between images and unknown categories. Specifically, we introduce an Attribute-anchored Textual Prompt learning method for vision-language models, named ATPrompt. This approach expands the learning space of soft prompts from the original one-dimensional category level into the multi-dimensional attribute level by incorporating multiple attribute tokens into the learnable soft prompts. Through this modification, we transform the text prompt from a category-centric form to an attribute-category hybrid form. Additionally, we introduce a straightforward differentiable attribute search method to identify representative and suitable attributes for downstream tasks. As an easy-to-use plug-in technique, ATPrompt can seamlessly replace the existing basic prompt format in textual-based methods, providing general improvements at a negligible computational cost.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Based on pseudo-labels, voxel-wise contrastive learning (VCL) is a prominent approach designed to learn effective feature representations for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. However, in multi-organ segmentation (MoS), the complex anatomical structures of certain organs often lead to many unreliable pseudo-labels. Directly applying VCL can introduce confirmation bias, resulting in poor segmentation performance. A common practice is to first transform these unreliable pseudo-labels into complementary ones, which represent classes that voxels are least likely to belong to, and then push voxels away from the generated complementary labels. However, we find that this approach may fail to allow voxels with unreliable pseudo-labels (unreliable voxels) to fully benefit from the advantages of VCL. In this paper, we propose DVCL, a novel distance-aware VCL method for semi-supervised MoS. DVCL is based on the observation that unreliable voxels, which may not form discriminative feature boundaries, still form clear clusters. Hence, voxels close to each other in the feature space ('neighbors') likely belong to the same semantic class, while distant ones ('outsiders') likely belong to different classes. In DVCL, we first identify neighbors and outsiders for all unreliable voxels, and then pull their neighbors into the same clusters while pushing outsiders away. In this way, unreliable voxels can learn more discriminative features, thereby fully enjoying the advantages of VCL. However, DVCL itself will inevitably introduce the problem of noisy neighbors and outliers. To address these challenges, we further propose a neighbor partitioning strategy and a query outlier strategy to provide more stable feature representations for DVCL.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Reasoning segmentation (RS) aims to identify and segment objects of interest based on implicit text queries. As such, RS is a catalyst for embodied AI agents, enabling them to interpret high-level commands without requiring explicit step-by-step guidance. However, current RS approaches rely heavily on the visual perception capabilities of multimodal large language models (LLMs), leading to several major limitations. First, they struggle with queries that require multiple steps of reasoning or those that involve complex spatial/temporal relationships. Second, they necessitate LLM fine-tuning, which may require frequent updates to maintain compatibility with contemporary LLMs and may increase risks of catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning. Finally, being primarily designed for static images or offline video processing, they scale poorly to online video data. To address these limitations, we propose an agent framework that disentangles perception and reasoning for online video RS without LLM fine-tuning. Our innovation is the introduction of a just-in-time digital twin concept, where -- given an implicit query -- an LLM plans the construction of a low-level scene representation from high-level video using specialist vision models. We refer to this approach to creating a digital twin as \"just-in-time\" because the LLM planner will anticipate the need for specific information and only request this limited subset instead of always evaluating every specialist model. The LLM then performs reasoning on this digital twin representation to identify target objects. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a new comprehensive video reasoning segmentation benchmark comprising 200 videos with 895 implicit text queries. The benchmark spans three reasoning categories (semantic, spatial, and temporal) with three different reasoning chain complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that our method performs best across all reasoning categories, suggesting that our just-in-time digital twin can bridge the gap between high-level reasoning and low-level perception in embodied AI.

    "abstract": "Recently, multi-view learning (MVL) has garnered significant attention due to its ability to fuse discriminative information from multiple views. However, real-world multi-view datasets are often heterogeneous and imperfect, which usually causes MVL methods designed for specific combinations of views to lack application potential and limits their effectiveness. To address this issue, we propose a novel robust MVL method (namely RML) with simultaneous representation fusion and alignment. Specifically, we introduce a simple yet effective multi-view transformer fusion network where we transform heterogeneous multi-view data into homogeneous word embeddings, and then integrate multiple views by the sample-level attention mechanism to obtain a fused representation. Furthermore, we propose a simulated perturbation based multi-view contrastive learning framework that dynamically generates the noise and unusable perturbations for simulating imperfect data conditions. The simulated noisy and unusable data obtain two distinct fused representations, and we utilize contrastive learning to align them for learning discriminative and robust representations. Our RML is self-supervised and can also be applied for downstream tasks as a regularization. In experiments, we employ it in multi-view unsupervised clustering, noise-label classification, and as a plug-and-play module for cross-modal hashing retrieval.

However, the multi-view editing often exhibits significant local inconsistency, especially in areas of non-rigid deformation, which lead to local artifacts, texture blurring, or semantic variations in edited 3D scenes. We also found that the existing editing methods, which rely entirely on text prompts make the editing process a \"one-shot deal\", making it difficult for users to control the editing degree flexibly. In response to these challenges, we present InterGSEdit, a novel framework for high-quality 3DGS editing via interactively selecting key views with users' preferences. We propose a CLIP-based Semantic Consistency Selection (CSCS) strategy to adaptively screen a group of semantically consistent reference views for each user-selected key view. Then, the cross-attention maps derived from the reference views are used in a weighted Gaussian Splatting unprojectionto construct the 3D Geometry-Consistent Attention Prior (GAP^ 3D ). We project GAP^ 3D to obtain 3D-constrained attention, which are fused with 2D cross-attention via Attention Fusion Network (AFN). AFN employs an adaptive attention strategy that prioritizes 3D-constrained attention for geometric consistency during early inference, and gradually prioritizes 2D cross-attention maps in diffusion for fine-grained features during the later inference.

To this end, we introduce VLADBench, a challenging and fine-grained benchmark featuring close-form QAs that progress from static foundational knowledge and elements to advanced reasoning for dynamic on-road situations. The elaborate VLADBench spans 5 key domains: Traffic Knowledge Understanding, General Element Recognition, Traffic Graph Generation, Target Attribute Comprehension, and Ego Decision-Making and Planning. These domains are further broken down into 11 secondary aspects and 29 tertiary tasks for a granular evaluation. A thorough assessment of general and domain-specific (DS) VLMs on this benchmark reveals both their strengths and critical limitations in AD contexts. To further exploit the cognitive and reasoning interactions among the 5 domains for AD understanding, we start from a small-scale VLM and train the DS models on individual domain datasets (collected from 1.4M DS QAs across public sources). The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed benchmark provides a crucial step toward a more comprehensive assessment of VLMs in AD, paving the way for the development of more cognitively sophisticated and reasoning-capable AD systems.

    "abstract": "Approaches for improving generative adversarial networks (GANs) training under a few samples have been explored for natural images. However, these methods have limited effectiveness for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, as they do not account for the unique electromagnetic scattering properties of SAR. To remedy this, we propose a physics-inspired regularization method dubbed Phi-GAN, which incorporates the ideal point scattering center (PSC) model of SAR with two physical consistency losses. The PSC model approximates SAR targets using physical parameters, ensuring that Phi-GAN generates SAR images consistent with real physical properties while preventing discriminator overfitting by focusing on PSC-based decision cues. To embed the PSC model into GANs for end-to-end training, we introduce a physics-inspired neural module capable of estimating the physical parameters of SAR targets efficiently. This module retains the interpretability of the physical model and can be trained with limited data. We propose two physical loss functions: one for the generator, guiding it to produce SAR images with physical parameters consistent with real ones, and one for the discriminator, enhancing its robustness by basing decisions on PSC attributes. We evaluate Phi-GAN across several conditional GAN (cGAN) models, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in data-scarce scenarios on three SAR image datasets",

To address this issue, we first conduct comprehensive empirical studies on parameter-efficient LoRA structure. Then, we establish design guidelines that emphasize the use of serial structures, optimal placements, and nested LoRA. Based on these insights, we present NoRA, a nested parameter-efficient LoRA structure that revolutionizes the initialization and fine-tuning of projection matrices. Our NoRA's innovative approach involves freezing outer layer LoRA weights and employing a serial inner layer design, enabling precise task-specific adaptations while maintaining compact training parameters. In addition, we propose an activation-aware Singular Value Decomposition (AwSVD) that adjusts the weight matrices based on activation distributions for initialization of outer layer LoRA weights. This schema enhances decomposition accuracy and mitigates computational errors. Extensive evaluations across multiple large models demonstrate that NoRA outperforms state-of-the-art LoRA variants, achieving significant improvements in performance-efficiency trade-off on visual few-shot tasks, visual instruction tuning and subject-driven generation.

    "abstract": "While contrastive pre-training is widely employed, its data efficiency problem has remained relatively under-explored thus far. Existing methods often rely on static coreset selection algorithms to pre-identify important data for training. However, this static nature renders them unable to dynamically track the data utility throughout pre-training, leading to subpar pre-trained models. To address this challenge, our paper introduces a novel dynamic bootstrapping dataset pruning method. It involves pruning data preparation followed by dataset mutation operations, both of which undergo iterative and dynamic updates. We apply this method to two prevalent contrastive pre-training frameworks: CLIP and MoCo, representing vision-language and vision-centric domains, respectively. In particular, we individually pre-train seven CLIP models on two large-scale image-text pair datasets, and two MoCo models on the ImageNet dataset, resulting in a total of 16 pre-trained models. With a data pruning rate of 30-35% across all 16 models, our method exhibits only marginal performance degradation (less than 1% on average) compared to corresponding models trained on the full dataset counterparts across various downstream datasets, and also surpasses several baselines with a large performance margin. Additionally, the byproduct from our method, i.e., coresets derived from the original datasets after pre-training, also demonstrates significant superiority in terms of downstream performance over other static coreset selection approaches.

However, existing methods face significant challenges, such as disease class imbalance and insufficient cross-modal fusion. To address these issues, we propose the learnable Retrieval Enhanced Visual-Text Alignment and Fusion (REVTAF) framework, which effectively tackles both class imbalance and visual-text fusion in report generation. REVTAF incorporates two core components: (1) a Learnable Retrieval Enhancer (LRE) that utilizes semantic hierarchies from hyperbolic space and intra-batch context through a ranking-based metric. LRE adaptively retrieves the most relevant reference reports, enhancing image representations, particularly for underrepresented (tail) class inputs; and (2) a fine-grained visual-text alignment and fusion strategy that ensures consistency across multi-source cross-attention maps for precise alignment. This component further employs an optimal transport-based cross-attention mechanism to dynamically integrate task-relevant textual knowledge for improved report generation. By combining adaptive retrieval with multi-source alignment and fusion, REVTAF achieves fine-grained visual-text integration under weak image-report level supervision while effectively mitigating data imbalance issues. The experiments demonstrate that REVTAF outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average improvement of 7.4% on the MIMIC-CXR dataset and 2.9% on the IU X-Ray dataset.

However, we identify that existing defense evaluations lack a unified and comprehensive framework, resulting in inconsistent and incomplete assessments of current methods. To address this issue, we revisit 11 representative defenses and present the first patch defense benchmark, involving 2 attack goals, 13 patch attacks, 11 object detectors, and 4 diverse metrics. This leads to the large-scale adversarial patch dataset with 94 types of patches and 94,000 images. Our comprehensive analyses reveal new insights: (1) The difficulty in defending against naturalistic patches lies in the data distribution, rather than the commonly believed high frequencies. Our new dataset with diverse patch distributions can be used to improve existing defenses by 15.09% AP@0.5. (2) The average precision of the attacked object, rather than the commonly pursued patch detection accuracy, shows high consistency with defense performance. (3) Adaptive attacks can substantially bypass existing defenses, and defenses with complex/stochastic models or universal patch properties are relatively robust. We hope that our analyses will serve as guidance on properly evaluating patch attacks/defenses and advancing their design.

To address this challenge, we propose an effective distillation method, \\loss, that integrates DPO and SFT. Our approach leverages DPO to guide the student model to focus on recovering only the targeted properties, rather than passively imitating the teacher, while also utilizing SFT to enhance overall performance. We additionally propose \\ours, a novel framework for filtering and curating high-quality pair datasets, along with a step-by-step online approach for calibrated training. We validate our method on two leading T2V models, VideoCrafter2 and AnimateDiff, achieving parameter reduction of 36.2% and 67.5% each, while maintaining or even surpassing the performance of full models.

Although existing approaches based on data augmentation exhibit promising results, they overlook domain discrepancies across multiple augmented domains, which limits the performance of object detectors.

The proposed SDG-DiffDet consists of a memory-guided diffusion module and a source-guided denoising module.

The augmented features further serve as noise in the diffusion process, enabling the model to capture distribution differences between practical domain distributions. In the source-guided denoising module, we design a text-guided condition to facilitate distribution transfer from any unseen distribution to source distribution in the denoising process. By combining these two designs, our proposed SDG-DiffDet effectively models feature augmentation and target-to-source distribution transfer within a unified diffusion framework, thereby enhancing the generalization ability of object detector.

Contrary to a previous methodology, by decomposing the AVSS task into two discrete subtasks by initially providing a prompted segmentation mask to facilitate subsequent semantic analysis, our approach innovates on this foundational strategy. We introduce a novel collaborative framework, Stepping Stone Plus (SSP), which integrates optical flow and textual prompts to assist the segmentation process. In scenarios where sound sources frequently coexist with moving objects, our pre-mask technique leverages optical flow to capture motion dynamics, providing essential temporal context for precise segmentation. To address the challenge posed by stationary sound-emitting objects, such as alarm clocks, SSP incorporates two specific textual prompts: one identifies the category of the sound-emitting object, and the other provides a broader description of the scene. Additionally, we implement a visual-textual alignment module (VTA) to facilitate cross-modal integration, delivering more coherent and contextually relevant semantic interpretations. Our training regimen involves a post-mask technique aimed at compelling the model to learn the diagram of the optical flow.

In MHA, heads perform attention calculation independently from uniform split subspaces, and a redundancy issue is triggered to hinder the model from achieving satisfactory outputs. In this paper, we propose to improve MHA by exploring diverse learners and introducing various interactions between heads, which results in a Hierarchical multI-head atteNtion driven Transformer model, termed HINT, for image restoration. HINT contains two modules, i.e., the Hierarchical Multi-Head Attention (HMHA) and the Query-Key Cache Updating (QKCU) module, to address the redundancy problem that is rooted in vanilla MHA. Specifically, HMHA extracts diverse contextual features by employing heads to learn from subspaces of varying sizes and containing different information. Moreover, QKCU, comprising intra- and inter-layer schemes, further reduces the redundancy problem by facilitating enhanced interactions between attention heads within and across layers. Extensive experiments are conducted on 12 benchmarks across 5 image restoration tasks, including low-light enhancement, dehazing, desnowing, denoising, and deraining, to demonstrate the superiority of HINT.

In this work, we propose Epona, an autoregressive diffusion world model that enables localized spatiotemporal distribution modeling through two key innovations: 1) Decoupled spatiotemporal factorization that separates temporal dynamics modeling from fine-grained future world generation, and 2) Modular trajectory and video prediction that seamlessly integrate motion planning with visual modeling in an end-to-end framework. Our architecture enables high-resolution, long-duration generation while introducing a novel chain-of-forward training strategy to address error accumulation in autoregressive loops. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with 7.4% FVD improvement and minutes-longer prediction duration compared to prior works. The learned world model further serves as a real-time motion planner, outperforming strong end-to-end planners on NAVSIM benchmarks",

    "abstract": "Adversarial examples, crafted with imperceptible perturbations, reveal a significant vulnerability of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). More critically, the transferability of adversarial examples allows attackers to induce unreasonable predictions without requiring knowledge about the target model. DNNs exhibit spatial invariance, meaning that the position of an object does not affect the classification result. However, existing input transformation-based adversarial attacks solely focus on behavioral patterns at a singular position, failing to fully exploit the spatial invariance exhibited by DNNs across multiple positions, thus constraining the transferability of adversarial examples. To address this, we propose a multi-scale, multi-position input transformation-based attack called Spatial Invariance Diversity (SID). Specifically, SID uses hybrid spatial-spectral fusion mechanisms within localized receptive fields, followed by multi-scale spatial downsampling and positional perturbations via random transformations, thereby crafting an ensemble of inputs to activate diverse behavioral patterns for effective adversarial perturbations. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that SID could achieve better transferability than the current state-of-the-art input transformation-based attacks. Additionally, SID can be flexibly integrated with other input transformation-based or gradient-based attacks, further enhancing the transferability of adversarial examples.

Integrating motion as an implicit supervisory signal, our method learns representations that generalize across frames, improving robustness in dynamic scenes and challenging occlusion scenarios.

ViCTr's design allows for precise control over anatomical accuracy and pathological attributes across CT and MRI modalities via a two-stage architecture. In Stage 1, it performs anatomical learning on the ATLAS-8k dataset using Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) to selectively train model weights tailored for medical data. In Stage 2, an adversarial fine-tuning strategy is applied: the base model from Stage 1 remains frozen while a LoRA adapter is exclusively applied to the weights tuned in Stage 1, allowing targeted adaptation for downstream tasks while preserving the core medical data properties learned during pretraining. ViCTr achieves notable improvements by utilizing segmentation maps and textual prompts to enable refined control over CT and MRI synthesis. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including BTCV, AMOS, and CirrMRI600+, demonstrate ViCTr's superiority, showing significant enhancements in quantitative metrics and clinical detail, such as liver surface nodularity in cirrhosis synthesis.

    "abstract": "Generating coherent and diverse human dances from music signals has gained tremendous progress in animating virtual avatars. While existing methods support direct dance synthesis, they fail to recognize that enabling users to edit dance movements is far more practical in real-world choreography scenarios. Moreover, the lack of high-quality dance datasets incorporating iterative editing also limits addressing this challenge. To achieve this goal, we first construct DanceRemix, a large-scale multi-turn editable dance dataset comprising the prompt featuring over 25.3M dance frames and 84.5K pairs. In addition, we propose a novel framework for iterative and editable dance generation coherently aligned with given music signals, namely DanceEditor. Considering the dance motion should be both musical rhythmic and enable iterative editing by user descriptions, our framework is built upon a prediction-then-editing paradigm unifying multi-modal conditions. At the initial prediction stage, our framework improves the authority of generated results by directly modeling dance movements from tailored, aligned music. Moreover, at the subsequent iterative editing stages, we incorporate text descriptions as conditioning information to draw the editable results through a specifically designed Cross-modality Edition Module (CEM). Specifically, CEM adaptively integrates the initial prediction with music and text prompts as temporal motion cues to guide the synthesized sequences.Thereby, the results display music harmony while preserving fine-grained semantic alignment with text descriptions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art models on our newly collected DanceRemix dataset. Code is available at https://lzvsdy.github.io/DanceEditor/",

    "abstract": "Few-shot object detection aims to detect novel classes with limited samples. Recent methods have leveraged the rich semantic representations of pretrained vision transformer (ViT) to overcome the limitations of model fine-tuning, thereby improving the performance on novel classes. However, existing pretrained ViT schemes only perform transformer encoding in the feature dimension, ignoring the exploration of pixel-wise differences in low-level features and multiscale variations. The current challenges lie in: (i) the extracted features suffer from blurred boundary features and smooth transition from center to boundary, leading to insufficient distinction between objects and backgrounds, and (ii) how to balance the extraction of local details and global contour features under multiscale scenarios. So Pixel Difference Vision Transformer (PiDiViT) is proposed. Innovations include: (i) difference convolution fusion module (DCFM), which enhances the feature differences from object centers to boundaries and effectively preserves global information by fusing pixel-wise central difference features with original features through an attention mechanism, and (ii) multiscale feature fusion module (MFFM), which adaptively fuses features extracted by five different scale convolutional kernels using a scale attention mechanism to generate attention weights, achieving an optimal balance between local detail and global semantic information extraction. PiDiViT achieves SOTA on COCO benchmark: surpassing few-shot detection SOTA by 2.7 nAP50 (10-shot) and 4.0 nAP50 (30-shot) for novel classes, exceeding one-shot detection SOTA by 4.4 nAP50 and open-vocabulary detection SOTA by 3.7 nAP50.

Recent advances in computer vision have significantly contributed to automating fundamental wildlife observation tasks, such as animal detection and species identification. However, accurately identifying species from indirect evidence like footprints and feces remains relatively underexplored, despite its importance in contributing to wildlife monitoring. To bridge this gap, we introduce AnimalClue, the first large-scale dataset for species identification from images of indirect evidence. Our dataset consists of 159,605 bounding boxes encompassing five categories of indirect clues: footprints, feces, eggs, bones, and feathers. It covers 968 species, 200 families, and 65 orders. Each image is annotated with species-level labels, bounding boxes or segmentation masks, and fine-grained trait information, including activity patterns and habitat preferences. Unlike existing datasets primarily focused on direct visual features (e.g., animal appearances), AnimalClue presents unique challenges for classification, detection, and instance segmentation tasks due to the need for recognizing more detailed and subtle visual features. In our experiments, we extensively evaluate representative vision models and identify key challenges in animal identification from their traces.

To address this challenge, we present a novel framework that expands the capability of standard object detectors beyond mere object recognition to complex event understanding through LLM-guided symbolic reasoning. Our key innovation lies in bridging the semantic gap between object detection and event understanding without requiring expensive task-specific training.

However, their dependence on bidirectional self-attention inherently conflicts with conventional KV caching mechanisms, creating unexpected computational bottlenecks that undermine their expected efficiency. To address this problem, this paper studies the caching mechanism for MAR by leveraging two types of redundancy: Token Redundancy indicates that a large portion of tokens have very similar representations in the adjacent decoding steps, which allows us to first cache them in previous steps and then reuse them in the later steps. Condition Redundancy indicates that the difference between conditional and unconditional output in classifier-free guidance exhibits very similar values in adjacent steps. Based on these two redundancies, we propose LazyMAR, which introduces two caching mechanisms to handle them one by one. LazyMAR is training-free and plug-and-play for all MAR models.

The foreground and background prototypes are assigned to the 3D object detection task and the map segmentation task, respectively, while both are assigned to the 3D occupancy prediction task. TSFG leverages these prototype groups to retain task-relevant features while suppressing irrelevant features, thereby enhancing the performance for each task. SPA enhances the prototype groups assigned for 3D occupancy prediction by utilizing the information produced by the 3D object detection head and the map segmentation head. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Occ3D benchmarks demonstrate that MAESTRO consistently outperforms existing methods across 3D object detection, BEV map segmentation, and 3D occupancy prediction tasks",

    "abstract": "Semi-dense feature matching methods have shown strong performance in challenging scenarios. However, the existing pipeline relies on a global search across the entire feature map to establish coarse matches, limiting further improvements in accuracy and efficiency. Motivated by this limitation, we propose a novel pipeline, CasP, which leverages cascaded correspondence priors for guidance. Specifically, the matching stage is decomposed into two progressive phases, bridged by a region-based selective cross-attention mechanism designed to enhance feature discriminability. In the second phase, one-to-one matches are determined by restricting the search range to the one-to-many prior areas identified in the first phase. Additionally, this pipeline benefits from incorporating high-level features, which helps reduce the computational costs of low-level feature extraction. The acceleration gains of CasP increase with higher resolution, and our lite model achieves a speedup of ~2.2xat a resolution of 1152 compared to the most efficient method, ELoFTR. Furthermore, extensive experiments demonstrate its superiority in geometric estimation, particularly with impressive cross-domain generalization. These advantages highlight its potential for latency-sensitive and high-robustness applications, such as SLAM and UAV systems",

    "abstract": "Deep learning-based light field image super-resolution methods have witnessed remarkable success in recent years. However, most of them only focus on the encoder design and overlook the importance of upsampling process in decoder part. Inspired by the recent progress in single image domain with implicit neural representation, we elaborately propose spatial-epipolar implicit image function (SEIIF), which optimizes upsampling process to significantly improve performance and supports arbitrary-scale light filed image super-resolution. Specifically, SEIIF contains two complementary upsampling patterns. One is spatial implicit image function (SIIF) that exploits intra-view information in sub-aperture images. The other is epipolar implicit image function (EIIF) that mines inter-view information in epipolar plane images. By unifying the upsampling step of two branches, SEIIF extra introduces cross-branch feature interaction to fully fuse intra-view information and inter-view information. Besides, given that line structure in epipolar plane image integrates spatial-angular correlation of light field, we present an oriented line sampling strategy to exactly aggregate inter-view information. The experimental results demonstrate that our SEIIF can be effectively combined with most encoders and achieve outstanding performance on both fixed-scale and arbitrary-scale light field image super-resolution.

    "abstract": "Creating high-quality, generalizable speech-driven 3D talking heads remains a persistent challenge. Previous methods achieve satisfactory results for fixed viewpoints and small-scale audio variations, but they struggle with large head rotations and out-of-distribution (OOD) audio. Moreover, they are constrained by the need for time-consuming, identity-specific training. We believe the core issue lies in the lack of sufficient 3D priors, which limits the extrapolation capabilities of synthesized talking heads. To address this, we propose GGTalker, which synthesizes talking heads through a combination of generalizable priors and identity-specific adaptation. We introduce a two-stage Prior-Adaptation training strategy to learn Gaussian head priors and adapt to individual characteristics. We train Audio-Expression and Expression-Visual priors to capture the universal patterns of lip movements and the general distribution of head textures. During the Customized Adaptation, individual speaking styles and texture details are precisely modeled. Additionally, we introduce a color MLP to generate fine-grained, motion-aligned textures and a Body Inpainter to blend rendered results with the background, producing indistinguishable, photorealistic video frames. Comprehensive experiments show that GGTalker achieves state-of-the-art performance in rendering quality, 3D consistency, lip-sync accuracy, and training efficiency",

    "abstract": "Outliers are ubiquitous in geometric vision contexts such as pose estimation and mapping, leading to inaccurate estimates. While robust loss functions can tackle outliers, it is challenging to make the estimation robust to the choice of initialization and to estimate the appropriate robust loss shape parameter that allows distinguishing inliers from outliers. Graduated non-convexity (GNC) often mitigates these issues. However, typical GNC uses a fixed annealing factor to update the shape parameter, which can lead to low-quality or inefficient estimates. This paper proposes a novel approach to adaptively anneal the shape parameter within a GNC framework. We developed a search strategy that incorporates a sampling of annealing choices and model scorings to select the most promising shape parameter at each GNC iteration. Additionally, we propose new stopping criteria and an initialization technique that improves performance for diverse data, and we show the benefits of combining discrete and continuous robust estimation strategies. We evaluate our method using synthetic and real-world data in two problems: 3D registration and pose graph optimization in SLAM sequences.

    "abstract": "Adapting pre-trained foundation models for diverse downstream tasks is a core practice in artificial intelligence. However, the wide range of tasks and high computational costs make full fine-tuning impractical. To overcome this, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA have emerged and are becoming a growing research focus. Despite the success of these methods, they are primarily designed for linear layers, focusing on two-dimensional matrices while largely ignoring higher-dimensional parameter spaces like convolutional kernels. Moreover, directly applying these methods to higher-dimensional parameter spaces often disrupts their structural relationships. Given the rapid advancements in matrix-based PEFT methods, rather than designing a specialized strategy, we propose a generalization that extends matrix-based PEFT methods to higher-dimensional parameter spaces without compromising their structural properties. Specifically, we treat parameters as elements of a Lie group, with updates modeled as perturbations in the corresponding Lie algebra. These perturbations are mapped back to the Lie group through the exponential map, ensuring smooth, consistent updates that preserve the inherent structure of the parameter space.

In a first step, an initial 3D reconstructed human through a generalized NeRF provides comprehensive conditioning, ensuring high-quality synthesis faithful to the reference appearance and structure. Subsequently, the derived geometry and appearance from the generalized NeRF serve as input to a video-based diffusion model.

    "abstract": "Scaling up motion datasets is crucial to enhance motion generation capabilities. However, training on large-scale multi-source datasets introduces data heterogeneity challenges due to variations in motion content. To address this, we propose Generative Pretrained Multi-path Motion Model (GenM^3), a comprehensive framework designed to learn unified motion representations. GenM^3 comprises two components: 1) a Multi-Expert VQ-VAE (MEVQ-VAE) that adapts to different dataset distributions to learn a unified discrete motion representation, and 2) a Multi-path Motion Transformer (MMT) that improves intra-modal representations by using separate modality-specific pathways, each with densely activated experts to accommodate variations within that modality, and improves inter-modal alignment by the text-motion shared pathway. To enable large-scale training, we integrate and unify 11 high-quality motion datasets (approximately 220 hours of motion data) and augment it with textual annotations (nearly 10,000 motion sequences labeled by a large language model and 300+ by human experts). After training on our integrated dataset, GenM^3 achieves a state-of-the-art FID of 0.035 on the HumanML3D benchmark, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. It also demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization on IDEA400 dataset, highlighting its effectiveness and adaptability across diverse motion scenarios",

    "abstract": "Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) is a non-invasive imaging modality, similar to ultrasound, with wide-ranging medical applications. Conventional PACT images are degraded by wavefront distortion caused by the heterogeneous speed of sound (SOS) in tissue. Accounting for these effects can improve image quality and provide medically useful information, but measuring the SOS directly is burdensome and the existing joint reconstruction method is computationally expensive. Traditional supervised learning techniques are currently inaccessible in this data-starved domain. In this work, we introduce an efficient, self-supervised joint reconstruction method that recovers SOS and high-quality images for ring array PACT systems. To solve this semi-blind inverse problem, we parametrize the SOS using either a pixel grid or a neural field (NF) and update it directly by backpropagating the gradients through a differentiable imaging forward model. Our method removes SOS aberrations more accurately and 35x faster than the current SOTA. We demonstrate the success of our method quantitatively in simulation and qualitatively on experimentally-collected and in vivo data.

    "abstract": "Dataset distillation, which compresses large-scale datasets into compact synthetic representations (i.e., distilled datasets), has become crucial for the efficient training of modern deep learning architectures. While existing large-scale dataset distillation methods leverage a pre-trained model through batch normalization statistics alignment, they neglect the essential role of covariance matrices in preserving inter-feature correlations, resulting in reduced diversity in the distilled datasets. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective approach, Diversity-Enhanced Distribution Alignment (DEDA), which enhances the diversity of distilled data by leveraging inter-feature relationships. Our method first establishes Gaussian distribution alignment by matching the means and covariances of each class in the original dataset with those of the distilled dataset in the feature space of a pre-trained model. Since features within the last layer of a pre-trained model are often highly similar within each class, aligning distributions in this layer cannot obtain diversified distilled data, resulting in gradient starvation during downstream training tasks. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a regularizer that constrains the covariance matrix of the distilled data in the last layer to maximize diagonal elements while minimizing non-diagonal elements.

As an essential part of RAG, external knowledge bases are commonly built by extracting structured data from unstructured PDF documents using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). However, given the imperfect prediction of OCR and the inherent non-uniform representation of structured data, knowledge bases inevitably contain various OCR noises. In this paper, we introduce OHRBench, the first benchmark for understanding the cascading impact of OCR on RAG systems. OHRBench includes 8,561 carefully selected unstructured document images from seven real-world RAG application domains, along with 8,498 Q&A pairs derived from multimodal elements in documents, challenging existing OCR solutions used for RAG. To better understand OCR's impact on RAG systems, we identify two primary types of OCR noise: Semantic Noise and Formatting Noise and apply perturbation to generate a set of structured data with varying degrees of each OCR noise. Using OHRBench, we first conduct a comprehensive evaluation of current OCR solutions and reveal that none is competent for constructing high-quality knowledge bases for RAG systems. We then systematically evaluate the impact of these two noise types and demonstrate the trend relationship between the degree of OCR noise and RAG performance.

However, significant challenges exist in algorithm design when faced with diverse sizes, complex topologies, and (often) incomplete data annotation of these structures. We address these difficulties by proposing a new tubular structure segmentation framework named HarmonySeg. First, we design a deep-to-shallow decoder network featuring flexible convolution blocks with varying receptive fields, which enables the model to effectively adapt to tubular structures of different scales. Second, to highlight potential anatomical regions and improve the recall of small tubular structures, we incorporate vesselness maps as auxiliary information. These maps are aligned with image features through a shallow-and-deep fusion module, which simultaneously eliminates unreasonable candidates to maintain high precision. Finally, we introduce a topology-preserving loss function that leverages contextual and shape priors to balance the growth and suppression of tubular structures, which also allows the model to handle low-quality and incomplete annotations. Extensive quantitative experiments are conducted on four public datasets. The results show that our model can accurately segment 2D and 3D tubular structures and outperform existing state-of-the-art methods. External validation on a private dataset also demonstrates good generalizability. Code will be released at this link upon institutional approval",

However, the training of current CBMs is heavily dependent on the precision and richness of the annotated concepts in the dataset. These concept labels are typically provided by experts, which can be costly and require significant resources and effort. Additionally, concept saliency maps frequently misalign with input saliency maps, causing concept predictions to correspond to irrelevant input features - an issue related to annotation alignment. To address these limitations, we propose a new framework called SSCBM (Semi-supervised Concept Bottleneck Model). Our SSCBM is suitable for practical situations where annotated data is scarce. By leveraging joint training on both labeled and unlabeled data and aligning the unlabeled data at the concept level, we effectively solve these issues. We propose a strategy to generate pseudo labels and an alignment loss. Experiments demonstrate that our SSCBM is both effective and efficient.

However, achieving high performance in zero-shot video tasks remains challenging. Traditional video processing methods rely heavily on fine-tuning to capture nuanced spatial-temporal details, which incurs significant data and computation costs. In contrast, training-free approaches, though efficient, often lack robustness in preserving context-rich features across complex video content. To this end, we propose DyTo, a novel dynamic token merging framework for zero-shot video understanding that adaptively optimizes token efficiency while preserving crucial scene details. DyTo integrates hierarchical frame selection and bipartite token merging strategy to dynamically cluster key frames and selectively compress token sequences, striking a balance between computational efficiency with semantic richness. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of DyTo. Our method not only sets a new state-of-the-art for zero-shot video understanding when applied to image-trained MLLMs, but also further boosts the performance of models already fine-tuned on video data.

The key challenge is disentangling domain-invariant semantics from domain-specific geometric variations, as point clouds exhibit local inconsistency and global redundancy, making direct alignment ineffective. To address this, we propose CounterPC, a counterfactual intervention-based domain adaptation framework, which formulates domain adaptation within a causal latent space, identifying category-discriminative features entangled with intra-class geometric variation confounders. Through counterfactual interventions, we generate counterfactual target samples that retain domain-specific characteristics while improving class separation, mitigating domain bias for optimal feature transfer. To achieve this, we introduce two key modules: i) Joint Distribution Alignment, which leverages 3D foundation models (3D-FMs) and a self-supervised autoregressive generative prediction task to unify feature alignment, and ii) Counterfactual Feature Realignment, which employs Optimal Transport (OT) to align category-relevant and category-irrelevant feature distributions, ensuring robust sample-level adaptation while preserving domain and category properties.

The Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) has shown great effectiveness across various video segmentation tasks. However, its application to offline RVOS is challenged by the translation of the text into effective prompts and a lack of global context awareness. In this paper, we propose a novel RVOS framework, termed MPG-SAM 2, to address these challenges. Specifically, MPG-SAM 2 employs a multimodal encoder to jointly encode video and textual features, generating semantically aligned video and text embeddings along with multimodal class tokens. A mask prior generator is devised to utilize the video embeddings and class tokens to create pseudo masks of target objects and global context. These masks are fed into the prompt encoder as dense prompts, along with multimodal class tokens as sparse prompts to generate accurate prompts for SAM 2. To provide the online SAM 2 with a global view, we propose a hierarchical global-historical aggregator, which allows SAM 2 to aggregate global and historical information of target objects at both pixel and object levels, enhancing the target representation and temporal consistency. Extensive experiments on several RVOS benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of MPG-SAM 2 and the effectiveness of the proposed modules.

Current methods resort to integrating depth prediction to recover the spatial information for object query decoding, which necessitates explicit supervision from LiDAR points during the training phase. However, the predicted depth quality is still unsatisfactory such as depth discontinuity of object boundaries and indistinction of small objects, which are mainly caused by the sparse supervision of projected points and the use of high-level image features for depth prediction. Besides, cross-view consistency and scale invariance are also overlooked in previous methods. In this paper, we introduce Frequency-aware Positional Depth Embedding (FreqPDE) to equip 2D image features with spatial information for 3D detection transformer decoder, which can be obtained through three main modules. Specifically, the Frequency-aware Spatial Pyramid Encoder (FSPE) constructs a feature pyramid by combining high-frequency edge clues and low-frequency semantics from different levels respectively. Then the Cross-view Scale-invariant Depth Predictor (CSDP) estimates the pixel-level depth distribution with cross-view and efficient channel attention mechanism. Finally, the Positional Depth Encoder (PDE) combines the 2D image features and 3D position embeddings to generate the 3D depth-aware features for query decoding.

The key to this task is to make specified changes to specific objects in the reference image based on the text. Previous works generate single or multiple pseudo words by projecting the reference image to the word embedding space. However, these methods ignore the fact that the editing objects of CIR are naturally hierarchical, and lack the ability of text adaptation, thus failing to adapt to multi-level editing needs. In this paper, we argue that the hierarchical object decomposition is the key to learning pseudo words, and propose a hierarchy-aware dynamic pseudo word learning (HIT) framework to equip with HIerarchy semantic parsing and Text-adaptive filtering. The proposed HIT enjoys several merits. First, HIT is empowered to dynamically decompose the image into different granularity of editing objects by a set of learnable group tokens as guidance, thus naturally forming the hierarchical semantic concepts. Second, the text-adaptive filtering strategy is proposed to screen out specific objects from different levels based on the text, so as to learn hierarchical pseudo words that meet diverse editing needs.

To address these challenges, we first introduce WSI-Bench, a large-scale morphology-aware benchmark containing 180k VQA pairs from 9,850 WSIs across 30 cancer types, specifically designed to evaluate MLLMs' understanding of morphological characteristics crucial for accurate diagnosis. To the best of our knowledge, WSI-Bench presents the first benchmarking systematically evaluate morphological understanding capabilities in WSI analysis. To enhance the model explainability, we present WSI-LLaVA, an MLLM framework for gigapixel WSI understanding with a three-stage training strategy, which can provide detailed morphological findings to explain its final answer. For more precise model assessment in pathological contexts, we develop two specialized WSI metrics: WSI-Precision and WSI-Relevance. Extensive evaluation on WSI-Bench reveals both the capabilities and limitations of current WSI MLLMs in morphological analysis and various pathology tasks, while demonstrating WSI-LLaVA's superior performance across all capabilities",

Given such poses, humans can intuitively infer the context and anticipate possible past and future dynamics, drawing on strong priors of human behavior. Inspired by this observation, we propose Ponimator, a simple framework anchored on proximal interactive poses for versatile interaction animation. Our training data consists of close-contact two-person poses and their surrounding temporal context from motion-capture interaction datasets. Leveraging interactive pose priors, Ponimator employs two conditional diffusion models: (1) a pose animator that uses the temporal prior to generate dynamic motion sequences from interactive poses, and (2) a pose generator that applies the spatial prior to synthesize interactive poses from a single pose, text, or both when interactive poses are unavailable. Collectively, Ponimator supports diverse tasks, including image-based interaction animation, reaction animation, and text-to-interaction synthesis, facilitating the transfer of interaction knowledge from high-quality mocap data to open-world scenarios. Empirical experiments across diverse datasets and applications demonstrate the universality of the pose prior and the effectiveness and robustness of our framework.

We hypothesize that achieving these goals requires large-scale supervision, but manually collecting sufficient data is simply too expensive. The key observation in this paper is that many mass-produced objects recur across multiple images of large unlabeled datasets, in different scenes, poses, and lighting conditions. We use this observation to create massive supervision by retrieving sets of diverse views of the same object. This powerful paired dataset enables us to train a straightforward text-to-image diffusion architecture to map the object and scene descriptions to the composite image. We compare our method, ObjectMate, with state-of-the-art methods for object insertion and subject-driven generation, using a single or multiple references.

Building upon this differentiable foundation, we introduce CycleVAR, which reformulates image-to-image translation as image-conditional visual autoregressivegeneration by injecting multi-scale source image tokens as contextual prompts, analogous to prefix-based conditioning in language models.CycleVAR exploits two modes to generate the target image tokens, including (1) serial multi-step generation enabling iterative refinement across scales and (2) parallel one-step generation synthesizing all resolution outputs in a single forward pass.Experimental findings indicate that the parallel one-step generation mode attains superior translation quality with quicker inference speed than the serial multi-step mode in unsupervised scenarios.Furthermore, both quantitativeand qualitative results indicate that CycleVAR surpasses previous state-of-the-artunsupervised image translation models, e.g., CycleGAN-Turbo",

To address this issue, we propose the first hyperbolic modeling framework for PRVR, namely HLFormer, which leverages hyperbolic space learning to compensate for the suboptimal hierarchical modeling capabilities of Euclidean space. Specifically, HLFormer integrates the Lorentz Attention Block and Euclidean Attention Block to encode video embeddings in hybrid spaces, using the Mean-Guided Adaptive Interaction Module to dynamically fuse features. Additionally, we introduce a Partial Order Preservation Loss to enforce \"\\text text \\prec \\text video \" hierarchy through Lorentzian cone constraints. This approach further enhances cross-modal matching by reinforcing partial relevance between video content and text queries.

To tackle these challenges, we introduce DiGA3D, a novel and versatile 3D inpainting pipeline that leverages diffusion models to propagate consistent appearance and geometry in a coarse-to-fine manner. First, DiGA3D develops a robust strategy for selecting multiple reference views to reduce errors during propagation. Next, DiGA3D designs an Attention Feature Propagation (AFP) mechanism that propagates attention features from the selected reference views to other views via diffusion models to maintain appearance consistency. Furthermore, DiGA3D introduces a Texture-Geometry Score Distillation Sampling (TG-SDS) loss to further improve the geometric consistency of inpainted 3D scenes.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The recent Segment Anything Models (SAMs) have emerged as foundational visual models for general interactive segmentation. Despite demonstrating robust generalization abilities, they still suffer from performance degradations in scenarios that demand accurate masks. Existing methods for high-precision interactive segmentation face a trade-off between perceiving intricate local details and maintaining stable prompting capability, which hinders the applicability and effectiveness of foundational segmentation models. In this paper, we present a SAM2Refiner framework built upon the SAM2 backbone. This architecture allows SAM2 to generate fine-grained segmentation masks for both images and videos while preserving its inherent strengths. Specifically, we design a localization augment module, which incorporates local contextual cues to enhance global features via a cross-attention mechanism, thereby exploiting potential detailed patterns while maintaining semantic information. Moreover, to strengthen the prompting ability toward the enhanced object embeddings, we introduce a prompt retargeting module that renews the embedding with spatially aligned prompt features. In addition, to obtain accurate high resolution segmentation masks, a mask refinement module is devised by employing a multi-scale cascaded structure to fuse mask features with hierarchical representations from the encoder. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, revealing that the proposed method can produce highly precise masks for both images and videos, surpassing state-of-the-art methods",

These tasks include face parsing, landmark detection, head pose estimation, attribute prediction, age, gender, and race estimation, facial expression recognition, face recognition, and face visibility. Traditional face analysis approaches rely on task-specific architectures and pre-processing techniques, limiting scalability and integration. In contrast, FaceXFormer employs a transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture, where each task is represented as a learnable token, enabling seamless multi-task processing within a unified model. To enhance efficiency, we introduce FaceX, a lightweight decoder with a novel bi-directional cross-attention mechanism, which jointly processes face and task tokens to learn robust and generalized facial representations. We train FaceXFormer on ten diverse face perception datasets and evaluate it against both specialized and multi-task models across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating state-of-the-art or competitive performance. Additionally, we analyze the impact of various components of FaceXFormer on performance, assess real-world robustness in \"in-the-wild\" settings, and conduct a performance comparison under different backbones. To the best of our knowledge, FaceXFormer is the first model capable of handling ten facial analysis tasks while maintaining real-time performance at 33.21 FPS",

    "title": "Puzzle Similarity: A Perceptually-guided Cross-Reference Metric for Artifact Detection in 3D Scene Reconstructions",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Modern reconstruction techniques can effectively model complex 3D scenes from sparse 2D views. However, automatically assessing the quality of novel views and identifying artifacts is challenging due to the lack of ground truth images and the limitations of no-reference image metrics in predicting reliable artifact maps. The absence of such metrics hinders assessment of the quality of novel views and limits the adoption of post-processing techniques, such as inpainting, to enhance reconstruction quality. To tackle this, recent work has established a new category of metrics (cross-reference), predicting image quality solely by leveraging context from alternate viewpoint captures. In this work, we propose a new cross-reference metric, Puzzle Similarity, which is designed to localize artifacts in novel views. Our approach utilizes image patch statistics from the training views to establish a scene-specific distribution, later used to identify poorly reconstructed regions in the novel views. Given the lack of good measures to evaluate cross-reference methods in the context of 3D reconstruction, we collected a novel human-labeled dataset of artifact and distortion maps in unseen reconstructed views. Through this dataset, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art localization of artifacts in novel views, correlating with human assessment, even without aligned references. We can leverage our new metric to enhance applications like automatic image restoration, guided acquisition, or 3D reconstruction from sparse inputs.

    "abstract": "Infrared and visible image fusion (IVF) endeavors to engineer composite outputs by blending optimal virtues of divergent modalities. This paper reveals, unprecedentedly, the intrinsic \"attention properties\" of infrared images, which directly arise from their physical characteristics (i.e., heat distribution) and can be linked to attention mechanisms naturally, as observed in the gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) visualization analysis of image classification models. To incorporate this property into IVF for better fusion, we propose the source infrared cross attention (I-SCA) and further extend it to the visible modality, subsequently introducing the source visible cross attention (V-SCA). The joint use of I-SCA and V-SCA greatly alleviate longstanding issues, such as insufficient and incomplete multimodal feature interaction and fusion, in IVF. Moreover, an auxiliary component for I-SCA and V-SCA, termed CBSM, is employed to boost the channel, map space, and suppress redundancy and misleading information of the source images. Specifically, we directly treat the CBSM-processed raw image as the query, while the intermediate features of another modality are treated as keys and values in I-SCA and V-SCA. Unlike attention mechanisms that divide images into patches or limit computations to local windows, our cross attention modules achieve smoother and more robust IVF through true global modeling across the entire image space with linear complexity.

Unlike previous approaches, AlignDiff shifts focus from semantic to geometric features, enabling more accurate modeling of local distortions. We propose AlignDiff, a diffusion model conditioned on geometric priors, enabling the simultaneous estimation of camera distortions and scene geometry. To enhance distortion prediction, we incorporate edge-aware attention, focusing the model on geometric features around image edges, rather than semantic content. Furthermore, to enhance generalizability to real-world captures, we incorporate a large database of ray-traced lenses containing over three thousand samples.

    "abstract": "Federated learning research has recently shifted from Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to Vision Transformers (ViTs) due to their superior capacity. ViTs training demands higher computational resources due to the lack of 2D inductive biases inherent in CNNs. However, efficient federated training of ViTs on resource-constrained clients remains unexplored in the community. In this paper, we propose EFTViT, a hierarchical federated framework that leverages masked images to enable efficient, full-parameter training on resource-constrained clients, offering substantial benefits for learning on heterogeneous data. In general, we patchify images and randomly mask a portion of the patches, observing that excluding them from training has minimal impact on performance while substantially reducing computation costs and enhancing data content privacy protection. Specifically, EFTViT comprises a series of lightweight local modules and a larger global module, updated independently on clients and the central server, respectively. The local modules are trained on unmasked image patches, while the global module is trained on intermediate patch features uploaded from the local client, balanced through a proposed median sampling strategy to erase client data distribution privacy. We analyze the computational complexity and privacy protection of EFTViT. We analyze the computational complexity and privacy protection of EFTViT. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks show that EFTViT reduces local training computational cost by up to 5.6x, cuts local training time by up to 3.1x, and achieves up to 2.46% accuracy improvement compared to existing methods",

    "abstract": "Fairness in AI-assisted medical image analysis is crucial for equitable healthcare, but is often neglected, especially in prevalent cross-domain scenarios (diverse demographics and imaging protocols). Effective and equitable deployment of AI models in these scenarios is critical, yet traditional Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) methods exhibit limited improvements. Emerging Active Domain Adaptation (ADA) approaches offer more effective enhancements, but all ignore fairness issues. Therefore, in this work, we propose the first fairness-aware ADA paradigm that simultaneously achieves both enhanced fairness and superior overall performance. Our method leverages the multimodal alignment capability of Vision-Language Models (VLMs): By performing medical images (vision) and sensitive attributes (language) learning, VLM inherently captures semantic correlations between visual features and protected attributes, enabling explicit attributes representation. Building on this foundation, we further devise an attribute-aware strategy (FairAP), which dynamically adapts to diverse patient demographics to promote equitable and high-quality outcomes by considering both Attribute and Polysemy. Extensive experiments on the FairDomain benchmark demonstrate that our method significantly reduces bias and maintains leading performance, outperforming existing UDA and ADA methods. This work pioneers a VLM-driven ADA paradigm for fair cross-domain medical segmentation, offering a blueprint for effective and equitable AI deployment in clinical practice.

Additionally, the Region of Blurry Attention Module (RBAM) is introduced to generate a blurry mask in an unsupervised manner, effectively extracting motion clues from the event features and guiding more accurate cross-modal feature fusion. Extensive subjective and objective evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets",

    "abstract": "Recent point tracking methods have made great strides in recovering the trajectories of any point (especially key points) in long video sequences associated with large motions. However, the spatial and temporal granularities of point trajectories remain constrained by limited motion estimation accuracy and video frame rate. Leveraging the high temporal resolution and motion sensitivity of event cameras, we introduce event data for the first time to recover spatially dense and temporally continuous trajectories of every point at any time. Specifically, we define the dense and continuous point trajectory representation as estimating multiple control points of curves for each pixel and model the movement of sparse events triggered along continuous point trajectories. Building on this, we propose a novel multi-frame iterative streaming framework that first estimates local inter-frame motion representations from two consecutive frames with inter-frame events, then aggregates them into a global long-term motion representation to utilize input full video and event data with an arbitrary number of frames. Extensive experiments on simulated and real data demonstrate the significant improvement of our framework over state-of-the-art methods and the crucial role of introducing events to model continuous point trajectories",

Most 3D data simulation methods inject predefined physical priors but struggle to capture the full complexity of real data. An optimal approach involves learning an implicit mapping from synthetic to realistic data in a data-driven manner, but progress in this solution has met stagnation in recent studies. This work explores a new solution path of data-driven 3D simulation, called Stable-Sim2Real, based on a novel two-stage depth diffusion model. The initial stage finetunes StableDiffusion to generate the residual between the real and synthetic paired depth, producing a stable but coarse depth, where some local regions may deviate from realistic patterns. To enhance this, both the synthetic and initial output depth are fed into a second-stage diffusion, where diffusion loss is adjusted to prioritize these distinct areas identified by a 3D discriminator. We provide a new benchmark scheme to evaluate 3D data simulation methods. Extensive experiments show that training the network with the 3D simulated data derived from our method significantly enhances performance in real-world 3D visual tasks.

Our approach integrates Soft Confident Learning, which assigns lower weights to low-confidence samples, and Meta-Learning, which stabilizes training by regularizing updates based on training-validation loss covariance. This prevents overfitting and enhances robustness to noisy data. CoMet is model-agnostic and can be applied to any anomaly detection method trainable via gradient descent. Experiments on MVTec-AD, VIADUCT, and KSDD2 with two state-of-the-art models demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, consistently improving over the baseline methods, remaining insensitive to anomalies in the training set, and setting a new state-of-the-art across all datasets",

To address these problems, we propose a Multi-schemA Proximity Network (MAPNet) for CIR, consisting of two key components: Multi-Schema Interaction (MSI) and Relaxed Proximity Loss (RPLoss). Specifically, MSI leverages textual descriptions as an implicit guide to establish correspondences between multiple objects and attributes in the reference and target images, enabling multi-schema interactions.

Specifically, we propose two token partitioning strategies: Spatial Progressive Partitioning for image tokens and Temporal Next-Frame Partitioning for video tokens. Additionally, we construct a denoising sampler to generate outputs from the token set distribution within a continuous domain. This method unifies image and video generation under a cohesive next-set prediction framework.Experimental results indicate that our method achieves video quality comparable to recent diffusion models, while significantly reducing inference costs.

The key to our approach lies in adapting event data representations to align with image pretrained models while simultaneously integrating spatiotemporal information and mitigating data sparsity. To achieve this, we propose a lightweight SpatioTemporal information fusion Prompting (STP) method, which progressively fuses the spatiotemporal characteristics of event data through a dynamic perception module with multi-scale spatiotemporal receptive fields, enabling compatibility with image pretrained models.STP enhances event data representation by capturing local information within a large receptive field and performing global information exchange along the temporal dimension. This strategy effectively reduces sparse regions in event data while refining fine-grained details, all while preserving its inherent spatiotemporal structure. Our method significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches across classification, semantic segmentation, and optical flow estimation tasks.

    "abstract": "Diffusion-based models, widely used in text-to-image generation, have proven effective in 2D representation learning. Recently, this framework has been extended to 3D self-supervised learning by constructing a conditional point generator for enhancing 3D representations. However, its performance remains constrained by the 3D diffusion model, which is trained on the available 3D datasets with limited size. We hypothesize that the robust capabilities of text-to-image diffusion models, particularly Stable Diffusion (SD), which is trained on large-scale datasets, can help overcome these limitations. To investigate this hypothesis, we propose PointSD, a framework that leverages the SD model for 3D self-supervised learning. By replacing the SD model's text encoder with a 3D encoder, we train a point-to-image diffusion model that allows point clouds to guide the denoising of rendered noisy images. With the trained point-to-image diffusion model, we use noise-free images as the input and point clouds as the condition to extract SD features. Next, we train a 3D backbone by aligning its features with these SD features, thereby facilitating direct semantic learning. Comprehensive experiments on downstream point cloud tasks and ablation studies demonstrate that the SD model can enhance point cloud self-supervised learning.

    "abstract": "Neural decoding has recently made significant progress in reconstructing images and text from brain activity, yet seeking biologically valid semantic alignment between artificial models and the brain remains challenging. Large pre-trained foundation models such as CLIP excel at capturing rich semantic details in complex visual scenes. In contrast, due to selective attention, only part of the visual semantics in the stimulus may be preferentially represented in the neural patterns when subjects view images. Past studies have generally assumed that stimulus images and their evoked brain recordings are strictly semantically equivalent, potentially leading to semantic misalignment between supervision signals and neural recordings. In order to address this, we propose a novel self-adaptive semantic decoding method (Mind-SA), designed to dynamically detect the regions within stimulus images that the brain actually focuses on and use them as supervision to guide brain-to-text reconstruction. We find that the proposed Mind-SA can be used to reduce the semantic gap between supervision signals (i.e., stimulus images) and neural representations, thus enabling the reconstruction model to focus on the parts that the brain actually perceives.

We first conduct an extensive computational analysis on existing Diffusion Policy architectures, identifying the denoising network as the primary contributor to latency. To overcome performance degradation typically associated with conventional pruning methods, we introduce a unified pruning and retraining pipeline, optimizing the model's post-pruning recoverability explicitly. Furthermore, we combine pruning techniques with consistency distillation to effectively reduce sampling steps while maintaining action prediction accuracy. Experimental evaluations on the standard datasets, i.e., PushT, Robomimic, CALVIN, and LIBERO, demonstrate that LightDP achieves real-time action prediction on mobile devices with competitive performance, marking an important step toward practical deployment of diffusion-based policies in resource-limited environments.

Although unsupervised part discovery can eliminate the reliance on labels, most of them cannot maintain robustness across various categories and scenarios, which restricts their application range. To overcome this limitation, we present a more effective paradigm for unsupervised part discovery, named Masked Part Autoencoder (MPAE). It first learns part descriptors as well as a feature map from the inputs and produces patch features from a masked version of the original images. Then, the masked regions are filled with the learned part descriptors based on the similarity between the local features and descriptors. By restoring these masked patches using the part descriptors, they become better aligned with their part shapes, guided by appearance features from unmasked patches. Finally, MPAE robustly discovers meaningful parts that closely match the actual object shapes, even in complex scenarios. Moreover, several looser yet more effective constraints are proposed to enable MPAE to identify the presence of parts across various scenarios and categories in an unsupervised manner. This provides the foundation for addressing challenges posed by occlusion and for exploring part similarity across multiple categories.

Our method addresses the persistent challenge in Video-LLMs of efficiently compressing high-dimensional video data into semantic tokens that are comprehensible to LLMs. Compared to prior methods which resort to downsampling the original video or aggregating visual tokens using resamplers, leading to information loss and entangled semantics, VideoOrion not only offers a more natural and efficient way to derive compact, disentangled semantic representations but also enables explicit object modeling of video content with minimal computational cost. Moreover, the introduced object tokens naturally allow VideoOrion to accomplish video-based referring tasks. Experimental results show that VideoOrion can learn to make good use of the object tokens, and achieves competitive results on both general video question answering and video-based referring benchmarks",

    "abstract": "Text-guided image editing is an essential task, enabling users to modify images through natural language descriptions. Recent advances in diffusion models and rectified flows have significantly improved editing quality, primarily relying on inversion techniques to extract structured noise from input images. However, inaccuracies in inversion can propagate errors, leading to unintended modifications and compromising fidelity. Moreover, even with perfect inversion, the entanglement between textual prompts and image features often results in global changes when only local edits are intended. To address these challenges, we propose a novel text-guided image editing framework based on VAR (Visual AutoRegressive modeling), which eliminates the need for explicit inversion while ensuring precise and controlled modifications. Our method introduces a caching mechanism that stores token indices and probability distributions from the original image, capturing the relationship between the source prompt and the image. Using this cache, we design an adaptive fine-grained masking strategy that dynamically identifies and constrains modifications to relevant regions, preventing unintended changes. A token re-assembling approach further refines the editing process, enhancing diversity, fidelity, and control. Our framework operates in a training-free manner and achieves high-fidelity editing with faster inference speeds, processing a 1K resolution image in as fast as 1.2 seconds. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves performance comparable to, or even surpassing, existing diffusion- and rectified flow-based approaches in both quantitative metrics and visual quality.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Backdoor attacks have revealed the vulnerability of deep neural networks (DNNs), which motivates the development of secure deep learning systems. However, existing backdoor attacks often fail to bypass backdoor detection and human visual inspection, resulting in the exposure of the backdoor implanted in DNNs, which can subsequently be significantly mitigated through pruning or fine-tuning on benign data. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel backdoor attack called SPD (Shallow Protecting Deep), which consists of a deep backdoor in the frequency domain and a shallow backdoor in the pixel domain, where the shallow backdoor acts as a firewall to protect the deep backdoor from being detected. Specifically, the deep backdoor in SPD samples from a specific Gaussian distribution, and encodes the sampled results into the intensity of the image's amplitude component in the frequency domain using an autoencoder, which serves as the backdoor trigger, thereby ensuring the invisibility of the backdoor attack. The shallow backdoor leverages traditional patch-based triggers, which covers all classes and attracts the defender's attention, thereby preserving the deep backdoor's resistance to existing backdoor detection techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that SPD not only can resist existing backdoor detection techniques, but also, due to the minimal disturbance caused by the backdoor trigger on benign samples, remains invisible, allowing the backdoor samples to pass through the human visual inspection.

    "abstract": "Unifying diverse image generation tasks within a single framework remains a fundamental challenge in visual generation. While large language models (LLMs) achieve unification through task-agnostic data and generation, existing visual generation models fail to meet these principles. Current approaches either rely on per-task datasets and large-scale training or adapt pre-trained image models with task-specific modifications, limiting their generalizability. In this work, we explore video models as a foundation for unified image generation, leveraging their inherent ability to model temporal correlations. We introduce RealGeneral, a novel framework that reformulates image generation as a conditional frame prediction task, analogous to in-context learning in LLMs. To bridge the gap between video models and condition-image pairs, we propose (1) a Unified Conditional Embedding module for multi-modal alignment and (2) a Unified Stream DiT Block with decoupled adaptive LayerNorm and attention mask to mitigate cross-modal interference. RealGeneral demonstrates effectiveness in multiple important visual generation tasks, e.g., it achieves a 14.5% improvement in subject similarity for customized generation and a 10% enhancement in image quality for canny-to-image task.

While transformer-based methods dominate 3D-VL research, their quadratic complexity and simplistic positional embedding mechanisms severely limits effective modeling of long-range 3D-VL dependencies and spatial relationships in 3D-VL tasks. State Space Models (SSM) have emerged as promising linear-complexity alternatives for sequential data processing, while inherent selection mechanism offers notable capability for spatial modeling. Despite its potential, straightforward adoption of Mamba to 3D-VL tasks encounters two obstacles: (1) how to perceive the position of 3D objects and understand complex spatial relationships, and (2) how to achieve thorough synergies of multi-modal features. In this paper, we propose Mamba-3VL, a pioneering 3D-VL framework to model complex intra- and inter-modality correlations and enhance spatial relation reasoning, while guaranteeing top-tier performance, high efficiency, and generalization potential for 3D-VL tasks. Specifically, Mamba Mixer explicitly models 3D-VL interaction via channel twisting and relation-prioritized spatial scanning policy. It maximally retain spatial relation of object-centric features. To further provide precise spatial encoding for mamba, we develop Instance-aware Dynamic Position Adapter (IDPA) to dynamically adjust instance-specific positional embeddings and enhance local spatial relation of 3D objects.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Impressive results on real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) have been achieved by employing pre-trained stable diffusion (SD) models. However, one critical issue of such methods lies in their poor reconstruction of image fine structures, such as small characters and textures, due to the aggressive resolution reduction of the VAE (e.g., 8xdownsampling) in the SD model. One solution is to employ a VAE with a lower downsampling rate for diffusion; however, adapting its latent features with the pre-trained UNet while mitigating the increased computational cost poses new challenges. To address these issues, we propose a Transfer VAE Training (TVT) strategy to transfer the 8xdownsampled VAE into a 4xone while adapting to the pre-trained UNet. Specifically, we first train a 4xdecoder based on the output features of the original VAE encoder, then train a 4xencoder while keeping the newly trained decoder fixed. Such a TVT strategy aligns the new encoder-decoder pair with the original VAE latent space while enhancing image fine details. Additionally, we introduce a compact VAE and compute-efficient UNet by optimizing their network architectures, reducing the computational cost while capturing high-resolution fine-scale features. Experimental results demonstrate that our TVT method significantly improves fine-structure preservation, which is often compromised by other SD-based methods, while requiring fewer FLOPs than state-of-the-art one-step diffusion models.

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian splatting enables high-quality novel view synthesis (NVS) at real-time frame rates. However, its quality drops sharply as we depart from the training views. Thus, dense captures are needed to match the high-quality expectations of applications like Virtual Reality (VR). However, such dense captures are very laborious and expensive to obtain. Existing works have explored using 2D generative models to alleviate this requirement by distillation or generating additional training views. These models typically rely on a noise-to-data generative process conditioned only on a handful of reference input views, leading to hallucinations, inconsistent generation results, and subsequent reconstruction artifacts. Instead, we propose a multi-view, flow matching model that learns a flow to directly connect novel view renderings from possibly sparse reconstructions to renderings that we expect from dense reconstructions. This enables augmenting scene captures with consistent, generated views to improve reconstruction quality. Our model is trained on a novel dataset of 3.6M image pairs and can process up to 45 views at 540x960 resolution (91K tokens) on one H100 GPU in a single forward pass.

However, consistent generation of high-quality images remains challenging partly due to the lack of conditioning mechanisms for perceptual quality. In this work, we propose methods to integrate image quality assessment (IQA) models into diffusion-based generators, enabling quality-aware image generation. We show that diffusion models can learn complex qualitative relationships from both IQA models' outputs and internal activations. First, we experiment with gradient-based guidance to optimize image quality directly and show this method has limited generalizability. To address this, we introduce IQA-Adapter, a novel framework that conditions generation on target quality levels by learning the implicit relationship between images and quality scores. When conditioned on high target quality, IQA-Adapter can shift the distribution of generated images towards a higher-quality subdomain, and, inversely, it can be used as a degradation model, generating progressively more distorted images when provided with a lower-quality signal. Under high-quality condition, IQA-Adapter achieves up to a 10% improvement across multiple objective metrics, as confirmed by a user preference study, while preserving generative diversity and content. Furthermore, we extend IQA-Adapter to a reference-based conditioning scenario, utilizing the rich activation space of IQA models to transfer highly specific, content-agnostic qualitative features between images",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Medical image segmentation data inherently contain uncertainty. This can stem from both imperfect image quality and variability in labeling preferences on ambiguous pixels, which depend on annotator expertise and the clinical context of the annotations. For instance, a boundary pixel might be labeled as tumor in diagnosis to avoid under-estimation of severity, but as normal tissue in radiotherapy to prevent damage to sensitive structures. As segmentation preferences vary across downstream applications, it is often desirable for an image segmentation model to offer user-adaptable predictions rather than a fixed output. While prior uncertainty-aware and interactive methods offer adaptability, they are inefficient at test time: uncertainty-aware models require users to choose from numerous similar outputs, while interactive models demand significant user input through click or box prompts to refine segmentation. To address these challenges, we propose SPA, a new Segmentation Preference Alignment framework that efficiently adapts to diverse test-time preferences with minimal human interaction. By presenting users with a select few, distinct segmentation candidates that best capture uncertainties, it reduces the user workload to reach the preferred segmentation. To accommodate user preference, we introduce a probabilistic mechanism that leverages user feedback to adapt a model's segmentation preference. The proposed framework is evaluated on several medical image segmentation tasks: color fundus images, lung lesion and kidney CT scans, MRI scans of brain and prostate. SPA shows 1) a significant reduction in user time and effort compared to existing interactive segmentation approaches, 2) strong adaptability based on human feedback, and 3) state-of-the-art image segmentation performance across different imaging modalities and semantic labels.

However, existing methods require extensive preoperative training (several hours), making them unsuitable for emergency surgeries where minutes significantly impact patient outcomes. We present GaussianReg, a novel registration framework that achieves clinically acceptable accuracy within minutes of preprocessing. Unlike prior approaches that learn primarily from 2D projections, we explicitly utilize 3D information by representing CT volumes as sparse Gaussian primitives and propose an innovative ray-based registration approach. These primitives emit rays toward potential camera positions, creating a hypothesis space of viewpoints. The registration problem then reduces to identifying rays that best match the target X-ray through our cross-modality attention mechanism. We further introduce canonical ellipsoid ray parameterization for stable optimization, bipartite matching-based patch aggregation for computational efficiency, and network pruning to accelerate training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GaussianReg achieves 10mm-level accuracy with only 10 minutes of training, compared to hours required by existing methods. Our approach thus offers a promising solution for emergency surgical scenarios where rapid adaptation to patient-specific anatomy is critical.

This leads to a feature-level discrepancy between clean and adversarial samples of their augmented variants. Thus, we propose to represent groups of samples as subspaces to capture distributions and turn the traditional sample-wise adversarial fine-tuning into its distributional counterpart. For each image, we build distributions from (i) a clean sample with its augmentations and (ii) their adversarial counterparts. For text, we build distributions from (iii) a clean prompt and its synonymous prompts and (iv) their adversarial counterparts. We then perform alignment between image and text subspaces, and \"adversarial\" subspaces are also aligned toward \"clean\" subspaces. Thus, all samples underlying these distributions (think infinite number) also get aligned, leading to generalizable robustness. Evaluations on 15 datasets are provided",

However, existing fine-tuning approaches often encounter challenges in extreme cross-domain few-shot learning scenarios, primarily due to the significant domain shift between pre-training data and target tasks, as well as the scarcity of annotated target samples. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel absorption adaptation learning framework which meticulously regularizes the fine-tuning procedure of foundation model using an expert model with the same architecture but trained from scratch on the targeted data in two aspects. On one hand, we first design a masked cross-model unidirectional reconstruction scheme, which forces the foundation model to recover the intermediate feature of the expert model in a randomly masked manner. On the other hand, a decision graph association loss is developed to encourage the consistency of token similarity matrix between these two models. By doing these, the task-relevant semantic knowledge in the expert model from both intermediate feature and the final decision levels are appropriately extracted and absorbed by the foundation model during its fine-tuning, thus mitigating the performance drop caused by domain gap and limited annotation.

Unlike prior methods that compress the per-image global illumination into a single latent vector, our approach enables simultaneously diverse shading manipulation and the generation of dynamic shadow effects. This is achieved through three key innovations: (1) a residual-based sun visibility extraction method to accurately separate direct sunlight effects, (2) a region-based supervision framework with a structural consistency loss for physically interpretable and coherent illumination decomposition, and (3) a ray-tracing-based technique for realistic shadow simulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework synthesizes novel views with competitive fidelity against state-of-the-art relighting solutions and produces more natural and multifaceted illumination and shadow effects",

    "abstract": "We propose a novel method for aerial visual localization over low Level-of-Detail (LoD) city models. Previous wireframe-alignment-based method LoD-Loc [99] has shown promising localization results leveraging LoD models. However, LoD-Loc mainly relies on high-LoD (LoD3 or LoD2) city models, but the majority of available models and those many countries plan to construct nationwide are low-LoD (LoD1). Consequently, enabling localization on low-LoD city models could unlock drones' potential for global urban localization. To address these issues, we introduce LoD-Loc v2, which employs a coarse-to-fine strategy using explicit silhouette alignment to achieve accurate localization over low-LoD city models in the air. Specifically, given a query image, LoD-Loc v2 first applies a building segmentation network to shape building silhouettes. Then, in the coarse pose selection stage, we construct a pose cost volume by uniformly sampling pose hypotheses around a prior pose to represent the pose probability distribution. Each cost of the volume measures the degree of alignment between the projected and predicted silhouettes. We select the pose with maximum value as the coarse pose. In the fine pose estimation stage, a particle filtering method incorporating a multi-beam tracking approach is used to efficiently explore the hypothesis space and obtain the final pose estimation. To further facilitate research in this field, we release two datasets with LoD1 city models covering 10.7 km2, along with real RGB queries and ground-truth pose annotations. Experimental results show that LoD-Loc v2 improves estimation accuracy with high-LoD models and enables localization with low-LoD models for the first time. Moreover, it outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by large margins, even surpassing texture-model-based methods, and broadens the convergence basin to accommodate larger prior errors.

    "abstract": "Painting textures for existing geometries is a critical yet labor-intensive process in 3D asset generation. Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) models have led to significant progress in texture generation. Most existing research approaches this task by first generating images in 2D spaces using image diffusion models, followed by a texture baking process to achieve UV texture. However, these methods often struggle to produce high-quality textures due to inconsistencies among the generated multi-view images, resulting in seams and ghosting artifacts. In contrast, 3D-based texture synthesis methods aim to address these inconsistencies, but they often neglect 2D diffusion model priors, making them challenging to apply to real-world objects. To overcome these limitations, we propose RomanTex, a multiview-based texture generation framework that integrates a multi-attention network with an underlying 3D representation, facilitated by our novel 3D-aware Rotary Positional Embedding. Additionally, we incorporate a decoupling characteristic in the multi-attention block to enhance the model's robustness in image-to-texture task, enabling semantically-correct back-view synthesis. Furthermore, we introduce a geometry-related Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) mechanism to further improve the alignment with both geometries and images.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The problem of learning from long-tailed noisy data, referred to as Long-Tailed Noisy Label Learning (LTNLL), presents significant challenges in deep learning. LTNLL datasets are typically affected by two primary issues: class imbalance and label noise. While previous methods have addressed these problems separately, the simultaneous presence of both in real-world applications remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective method, Instances Benefitting Classes (IBC). Our philosophy is to simultaneously overcome overfitting to noisy classes and transfer knowledge between semantically related classes. At the instance level, we propose selecting top-k semantically similar classes and use them to construct soft labels. Specifically, we soften noisy hard labels by reducing the probability of noisy classes and reallocating this probability to the semantically similar classes. This reduces the model's overconfidence in noisy classes while enhancing its focus on tail classes. We next propose a novel shot-specific multi-expert ensemble learning framework to make knowledge transfer more targeted, where we maintain multiple shot-specific soft labels for each instance, with each expert supervised by one of these labels. By integrating these experts, we demonstrate that IBC exhibits more separable representations, improving both overall and partition performance. Extensive experiments show that IBC outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on a variety of benchmark and real-world datasets, achieving improvements ranging from 1.89% to 4.99% on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets across all settings.

    "abstract": "Data heterogeneity, stemming from local non-IID data and global long-tailed distributions, is a major challenge in federated learning (FL), leading to significant performance gaps compared to centralized learning. Previous research found that poor representations and biased classifiers are the main problems and proposed neural-collapse-inspired synthetic simplex ETF to help representations be closer to neural collapse optima. However, we find that the neural-collapse-inspired methods are not strong enough to reach neural collapse and still have huge gaps to centralized training. In this paper, we rethink this issue from a self-distillation perspective and propose FedYoYo (You Are Your Own Best Teacher), introducing Augmented Self-bootstrap Distillation (ASD) to improve representation learning by distilling knowledge between weakly and strongly augmented local samples, without needing extra datasets or models. We further introduce Distribution-aware Logit Adjustment (DLA) to balance the self-distillation process and correct biased feature representations. FedYoYo nearly eliminates the performance gap, achieving centralized-level performance even under mixed heterogeneity. It enhances local representation learning, reducing model drift and improving convergence, with feature prototypes closer to neural collapse optimality. Extensive experiments show FedYoYo achieves state-of-the-art results, even surpassing centralized logit adjustment methods by 5.4% under global long-tailed settings.

To achieve this, we leverage advanced off-the-shelf multimodal encoders to extract representations from short segments within the long video, followed by pre-training a masked-embedding autoencoder capturing high-level interactions across segments.LV-MAE is highly efficient to train and enables the processing of much longer videos by alleviating the constraint on the number of input frames.Furthermore, unlike existing methods that typically pre-train on short-video datasets, our approach offers self-supervised pre-training using long video samples (e.g., 20+ minutes video clips) at scale.Using LV-MAE representations, we achieve state-of-the-art results on three long-video benchmarks -- LVU, COIN, and Breakfast -- employing only a simple classification head for either attentive or linear probing.Finally, to assess LV-MAE pre-training and visualize its reconstruction quality, we leverage the video-language aligned space of short video representations to monitor LV-MAE through video-text retrieval.Our code will be made available upon publication",

    "abstract": "A crucial issue in federated learning is the heterogeneity of data across clients, which may lead to model divergence, eventually deteriorating the model performance. Personalized federated learning (pFL) has been shown to be an effective approach to addressing data heterogeneity in federated learning. However, many existing pFL studies rely on directly using the global model for local training without fully assessing its impact on the performance of the local model, resulting in a potential conflict between personalization and generalization. To address this issue, we propose a parallel structure of a local supervisor and an inter-learning model for the local model and introduce a novel pFL method called federated learning by considering data similarity across clients assisted by a local supervisor (FedSimSup). Specifically, FedSimSup maintains an inter-learning model for each client and refines the inter-learning model using a local supervisor for each client. The local supervisor monitors the aggregated global information and ensures that the inter-learning model aligns with the local heterogeneous data to enhance local model performance. Additionally, the similarity between clients is measured based on differences in local data distributions, and this similarity is used to adjust the weights of the inter-learning models.Experimental results show that FedSimSup outperforms eight state-of-the-art federated learning methods in handling heterogeneous data. Additionally, it supports different model architectures across clients, providing greater flexibility when computational resources vary among them.

    "abstract": "Automated segmentation of polyps from colonoscopy videos is of great clinical significance as it can assist clinicians in making accurate diagnoses and precise interventions. However, video polyp segmentation (VPS) is challenging due to ambiguous polyp boundaries, as well as variations in polyp scale, contrast, and position across consecutive frames. Moreover, to meet clinical requirements, the inference must operate in real-time to enable intraoperative tracking and guidance. In this paper, we propose a novel and efficient segmentation network, STDDNet, which integrates a spatial-aligned temporal modeling strategy and a discriminative dynamic representation learning mechanism, to comprehensively address these challenges by harnessing the advantages of Mamba. Specifically, a spatial-aligned temporal dependency propagation (STDP) module is developed to model temporal consistency from the consecutive frames based on a bidirectional scanning Mamba block. Furthermore, we design a discriminative dynamic feature extraction (DDFE) module to explore frame-wise dynamic information from the structural feature generated by the Mamba block. Such dynamic features can effectively deal with the variations across colonoscopy frames, providing more details for refined segmentation. We extensively evaluate STDDNet on two benchmark datasets, SUN-SEG and CVC-ClinicDB, demonstrating superior segmentation performance compared to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining real-time inference.

    "abstract": "Human body actions are an important form of non-verbal communication in social interactions. This paper specifically focuses on a subset of body actions known as micro-actions, which are subtle, low-intensity body movements with promising applications in human emotion analysis. In real-world scenarios, human micro-actions often temporally co-occur, with multiple micro-actions overlapping in time, such as concurrent head and hand movements. However, current research primarily focuses on recognizing individual micro-actions while overlooking their co-occurring nature. To address this gap, we propose a new task named Multi-label Micro-Action Detection (MMAD), which involves identifying all micro-actions in a given short video, determining their start and end times, and categorizing them. Accomplishing this requires a model capable of accurately capturing both long-term and short-term action relationships to detect multiple overlapping micro-actions. To facilitate the MMAD task, we introduce a new dataset named Multi-label Micro-Action-52 (MMA-52) and propose a baseline method equipped with a dual-path spatial-temporal adapter to address the challenges of subtle visual change in MMAD. We hope that MMA-52 can stimulate research on micro-action analysis in videos and prompt the development of spatio-temporal modeling in human-centric video understanding. The proposed MMA-52 dataset is available at: https://github.com/VUT-HFUT/Micro-Action",

    "abstract": "Understanding the 3D geometry of transparent objects from RGB images is challenging due to their inherent physical properties, such as reflection and refraction. To address these difficulties, especially in scenarios with sparse views and dynamic environments, we introduce TRAN-D, a novel 2D Gaussian Splatting-based depth reconstruction method for transparent objects. Our key insight lies in separating transparent objects from the background, enabling focused optimization of Gaussians corresponding to the object. We mitigate artifacts with an object-aware loss that places Gaussians in obscured regions, ensuring coverage of invisible surfaces while reducing overfitting. Furthermore, we incorporate a physics-based simulation that refines the reconstruction in just a few seconds, effectively handling object removal and chain-reaction movement of remaining objects without the need for rescanning. TRAN-D is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world sequences, and it consistently demonstrated robust improvements over existing GS-based state-of-the-art methods. In comparison with baselines, TRAN-D reduces the mean absolute error by over 39% for the synthetic TRansPose sequences. Furthermore, despite being updated using only one image, TRAN-D reaches a d < 2.5 cm accuracy of 48.46%, over 1.5 times that of baselines, which uses six images.

Geometrically consistent matchings are crucial for many downstream applications, such as texture transfer or statistical shape modelling. Yet, in practice, geometric consistency is often overlooked, or only achieved under severely limiting assumptions (e.g. a good initialisation). In this work, we propose a novel formalism for computing globally optimal and geometrically consistent matchings between 3D shapes which is scalable in practice. Our key idea is to represent the surface of the source shape as a collection of cyclic graphs, which are then consistently matched to the target shape. Mathematically, we construct a hyper product graph (between source and target shape), and then cast 3D shape matching as a minimum-cost circulation flow problem in this hyper graph, which yields global geometrically consistent matchings between both shapes. We empirically show that our formalism is efficiently solvable and that it leads to high-quality results. Our code is publicly available",

Previous works have shown the existence of an ideal negative prompt that can maximize the odds of the positive prompt. In this work, we explore relations between negative prompting and classifier-free guidance (CFG) to develop a sampling procedure, Adaptive Negative Sampling Without External Resources (ANSWER), that accounts for both positive and negative conditions from a single prompt. This leverages the internal understanding of negation by the diffusion model to increase the odds of generating images faithful to the prompt. ANSWER is a training-free technique, applicable to any model that supports CFG, and allows for negative grounding of image concepts without an explicit negative prompts, which are lossy and incomplete. Experiments show that adding ANSWER to existing DMs outperforms the baselines on multiple benchmarks and is preferred by humans 2x more over the other methods",

In this work, we introduce AlignGuard, a method for safety alignment of T2I models. We enable the application of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for safety purposes in T2I models by synthetically generating a dataset of harmful and safe image-text pairs, which we call CoProV2. Using a custom DPO strategy and this dataset, we train safety experts, in the form of low-rank adaptation (LoRA) matrices, able to guide the generation process away from specific safety-related concepts. Then, we merge the experts into a single LoRA using a novel merging strategy for optimal scaling performance. This expert-based approach enables scalability, allowing us to remove 7 times more harmful concepts from T2I models compared to baselines. AlignGuard consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art on many benchmarks and establishes new practices for safety alignment in T2I networks",

In this paper, we propose the Function-centric Bayesian Network (FBN) for the zero-shot ObjectNav task. FBN is designed to uncover the functions that observed objects afford individually or collaboratively with other objects, as well as the functional semantics contained within the observed scenes. The probabilistic directed edges in FBN describe the object-function and scene-function relationships, which are derived by prompting LLMs with the proposed CounterfactCoT. Leveraging FBN with Bayesian inference, the probability of each function group and probability map of goal occurrence are computed. Then the waypoint is selected based on obtained probability map. Experiments on MP3D and HM3D demonstrate that FBN effectively captures object-scene-function relationships and improves zero-shot ObjectNav performance",

Existing approaches often fail (i) to pre-serve multiple objects with fidelity, (ii) maintain semanticalignment with prompts, or (iii) provide explicit control overscene composition. To overcome these challenges, the pro-posed method employs an N-channel ControlNet that inte-grates (i) object preservation with size and placement ag-nosticism, color and detail retention, and artifact elimi-nation, (ii) high-resolution, semantically consistent back-grounds with accurate shadows, lighting, and prompt ad-herence, and (iii) explicit user control over background lay-outs and lighting conditions.

    "abstract": "Seam cutting has shown significant effectiveness in the composition phase of image stitching, particularly for scenarios involving parallax. However, conventional implementations typically position seam-cutting as a downstream process contingent upon successful image alignment. This approach inherently assumes the existence of locally aligned regions where visually plausible seams can be established. Current alignment methods frequently fail to satisfy this prerequisite in large parallax scenarios despite considerable research efforts dedicated to improving alignment accuracy. In this paper, we propose an alignment-compensation paradigm that dissociates seam quality from initial alignment accuracy by integrating a Local Patch Alignment Module (LPAM) into the seam-cutting pipeline. Concretely, given the aligned images with an estimated initial seam, our method first identifies low-quality pixels along the seam through a seam quality assessment, then performs localized SIFT-flow alignment on the critical patches enclosing these pixels. Finally, we recomposite the aligned patches using adaptive seam-cutting and merge them into the original aligned images to generate the final mosaic. Comprehensive experiments on large parallax stitching datasets demonstrate that LPAM significantly enhances stitching quality while maintaining computational efficiency.

With experimental analysis, we find that this paradigm results in a highly challenging assumption for efficient scenarios: Image pixel features should not vary for the same category in different images. To address this dilemma, we propose a coupled dual-branch offset learning paradigm that explicitly learns feature and class offsets to dynamically refine both class representations and spatial image features. Based on the proposed paradigm, we construct an efficient semantic segmentation network, OffSeg.

Previous works primarily rely on integrated control models that take the perceptions and states of both arms as inputs to directly predict their actions. However, we think bimanual manipulation involves not only coordinated tasks but also various uncoordinated tasks that do not require explicit cooperation during execution, such as grasping objects with the closest hand, which integrated control frameworks ignore to consider due to their enforced cooperation in the early inputs. In this paper, we propose a novel decoupled interaction framework that considers the characteristics of different tasks in bimanual manipulation. The key insight of our framework is to assign an independent model to each arm to enhance the learning of uncoordinated tasks, while introducing a selective interaction module that adaptively learns weights from its own arm to improve the learning of coordinated tasks. Extensive experiments on seven tasks in the RoboTwin dataset demonstrate that: (1) Our framework achieves outstanding performance, with a 23.5% boost over the SOTA method. (2) Our framework is flexible and can be seamlessly integrated into existing methods. (3) Our framework can be effectively extended to multi-agent manipulation tasks, achieving a 28% boost over the integrated control SOTA.

Currently, mainstream Agent-based methods use external tools to assist a single MLLM in answering long video questions.

In order to better address long video tasks, we introduce LVAgent, the first framework enabling multi-round dynamic collaboration of MLLM agents in long video understanding. Our method consists of four key steps: 1) Selection: We pre-select appropriate agents from the model library to form optimal agent teams based on different tasks. 2) Perception: We design an effective retrieval scheme for long videos, improving the coverage of critical temporal segments while maintaining computational efficiency. 3) Action: Agents answer long video questions and exchange reasons. 4) Reflection: We evaluate each agent's performance in each round of discussion and optimize the agent team for dynamic collaboration. The agents iteratively refine their answers by multi-round dynamical collaboration of MLLM agents. LVAgent is the first agent system method that outperforms all closed-source models (like GPT-4o) and open-source models (like InternVL-2.5 and Qwen2-VL) in the long video understanding tasks.

To animate the 3D head, our key discovery is that simple cross-attention to an expression code is already sufficient. Finally, we increase robustness by feeding input images with different expressions to our model during training, enabling the reconstruction of 3D head avatars from inconsistent inputs, e.g., an imperfect phone capture with accidental movement, or frames from a monocular video. We compare Avat3r with current state-of-the-art methods for few-input and single-input scenarios, and find that our method has a competitive advantage in both tasks. Finally, we demonstrate the wide applicability of our proposed model, creating 3D head avatars from images of different sources, smartphone captures, single images, and even out-of-domain inputs like antique busts",

This task presents challenges due to the significant one-to-many mapping between audio and visual content, further complicated by the scarcity of large-scale public datasets and high computational demands. We propose a lightweight framework that utilizes 2D full-body skeletons as an efficient auxiliary condition to bridge audio signals with visual outputs. Our approach introduces a diffusion model conditioned on fine-grained audio segments and a skeleton extracted from the speaker's reference image, predicting skeletal motions through skeleton-audio feature fusion to ensure strict audio coordination and body shape consistency. The generated skeletons are then fed into an off-the-shelf human video generation model with the speaker's reference image to synthesize high-fidelity videos. To democratize research, we present CSG-405--the first public dataset with 405 hours of high-resolution videos across 71 speech types, annotated with 2D skeletons and diverse speaker demographics.

Specifically, we introduce a text-driven pseudo-input preparation strategy that significantly increases the diversity of clothing regions within the generated person pseudo-samples. This encourages the generator to focus on variations in these areas and improves the model's generalization capability. Within the generator itself, we develop a gated manipulation mechanism to prevent weight forgetting and reduce training costs. Furthermore, we incorporate a texture-aware injection module to explicitly integrate human-perceptible clothing texture information into the generation process. During inference, we propose a refining conditional inference strategy that mitigates the randomness introduced by Gaussian noise.

Inspired by neuroscientific findings demonstrating that humans maintain and dynamically update fine-grained cognitive states during object search tasks in novel environments, we propose CogNav, a framework designed to mimic this cognitive process using large language models. Specifically, we model the cognitive process using a finite state machine comprising fine-grained cognitive states, ranging from exploration to identification. Transitions between states are determined by a large language model based on a dynamically constructed heterogeneous cognitive map, which contains spatial and semantic information about the scene being explored.

To bridge this gap, we propose MonoMVSNet, a novel monocular feature and depth guided MVS network that integrates powerful priors from a monocular foundation model into multi-view geometry. Firstly, the monocular feature of the reference view is integrated into source view features by the attention mechanism with a newly designed cross-view position encoding. Then, the monocular depth of the reference view is aligned to dynamically update the depth candidates for edge regions during the sampling procedure. Finally, a relative consistency loss is further designed based on the monocular depth to supervise the depth prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MonoMVSNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DTU and Tanks-and-Temples datasets, ranking first on the Tanks-and-Temples Intermediate and Advanced benchmarks.

However, most existing fusion models lack controllability, making it difficult to customize the fused output according to user preferences. To address this challenge, we propose a novel weakly-supervised, instance-level controllable fusion model that adaptively highlights user-specified instances based on input text. Our model consists of two stages: pseudo-label generation and fusion network training. In the first stage, guided by observed multimodal manifold priors, we leverage text and manifold similarity as joint supervisory signals to train text-to-image response network (TIRN) in a weakly-supervised manner, enabling it to identify referenced semantic-level objects from instance segmentation outputs. To align text and image features in TIRN, we propose a multimodal feature alignment module (MFA), using manifold similarity to guide attention weight assignment for precise correspondence between image patches and text embeddings. Moreover, we employ spatial positional relationships to accurately select the referenced instances from multiple semantic-level objects. In the second stage, the fusion network takes source images and text as input, using the generated pseudo-labels for supervision to apply distinct fusion strategies for target and non-target regions.

    "title": "Unbiased Missing-modality Multimodal Learning",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recovering missing modalities in multimodal learning has recently been approached using diffusion models to synthesize absent data conditioned on available modalities. However, existing methods often suffer from modality generation bias: while certain modalities are generated with high fidelity, others--such as video--remain challenging due to intrinsic modality gaps, leading to imbalanced training. To address this issue, we propose MD^2N (Multi-stage Duplex Diffusion Network), a novel framework for unbiased missing-modality recovery. MD^2N introduces a modality transfer module within a duplex diffusion architecture, enabling bidirectional generation between available and missing modalities through three stages: (1) global structure generation, (2) modality transfer, and (3) local cross-modal refinement. By training with duplex diffusion, both available and missing modalities generate each other in an intersecting manner, effectively achieving a balanced generation state.Extensive experiments demonstrate that MD^2N significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 4% improvement over IMDer on the CMU-MOSEI dataset.

    "abstract": "Text to Motion aims to generate human motions from texts. Existing settings rely on limited Action Texts that include action labels (e.g., \"walk, bend\"), which limits flexibility and practicability in scenarios difficult to describe directly. This paper extends limited Action Texts to arbitrary ones. Scene texts without explicit action labels can enhance the practicality of models in complex and diverse industries such as virtual human interaction, robot behavior generation, and film production, while also supporting the exploration of potential implicit behavior patterns. However, newly introduced Scene Texts may yield multiple reasonable output results, causing significant challenges in existing data, framework, and evaluation.To address this practical issue, we first create a new dataset, HumanML3D++, by extending texts of the largest existing dataset, HumanML3D. Secondly, we propose a simple yet effective framework that extracts action instructions from arbitrary texts and subsequently generates motions. Furthermore, we also benchmark this new setting with multi-solution metrics to address the inadequacies of existing single-solution metrics. Extensive experiments indicate that Text to Motion in this realistic setting is challenging, fostering new research in this practical direction.

    "abstract": "Language-guided Affordance Segmentation (LASO) aims to identify actionable object regions based on text instructions. At the core of its practicality is learning generalizable affordance knowledge that captures functional regions across diverse objects. However, current LASO solutions struggle to extend learned affordances to object categories that are not encountered during training. Scrutinizing these designs, we identify limited generalizability on unseen categories, stemming from (1) underutilized generalizable patterns in the intermediate layers of both 3D and text backbones, which impedes the formation of robust affordance knowledge, and (2) the inability to handle substantial variability in affordance regions across object categories due to a lack of structural knowledge of the target region.Towards this, we introduce a GeneraLized frAmework on uNseen CategoriEs (GLANCE), incorporating two key components: a cross-modal connector that links intermediate stages of the text and 3D backbones to enrich pointwise embeddings with affordance concepts, and a VLM-guided query generator that provides affordance priors by extracting a few 3D key points based on the intra-view reliability and cross-view consistency of their multi-view segmentation masks. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that GLANCE outperforms state-of-the-art methods (SoTAs), with notable improvements in generalization to unseen categories.

However, most existing high-resolution MLLMs rely on a cropping-based approach to process images, which leads to fragmented visual encoding and a sharp increase in redundant tokens. To tackle these issues, we propose the FALCON model. FALCON introduces a novel visual register technique to simultaneously: 1) Eliminate redundant tokens at the stage of visual encoding. To directly address the visual redundancy present in the output of vision encoder, we propose a Register-based Representation Compacting (ReCompact) mechanism. This mechanism introduces a set of learnable visual registers designed to adaptively aggregate essential information while discarding redundancy. It enables the encoder to produce a more compact visual representation with a minimal number of output tokens, thus eliminating the need for an additional compression module. 2) Ensure continuity in visual encoding. To address the potential encoding errors caused by fragmented visual inputs, we develop a Register Interactive Attention (ReAtten) module. This module facilitates effective and efficient information exchange across sub-images by enabling interactions between visual registers. It ensures the continuity of visual semantics throughout the encoding. We conduct comprehensive experiments with FALCON on high-resolution benchmarks across a wide range of scenarios.

Experimental results show that, at the same model scale, VRL achieves a 24% absolute improvement over prior state-of-the-art methods while using 95% less data and a smaller model. Furthermore, compared to human-labeled attributes, the features learned by VRL exhibit a 20% absolute gain when used for downstream classification tasks",

Besides, local visual representations are continuously injected into the model to maximize the exploitation of the dynamic properties inherent in videos.

When the degradation process is known, the recovery problem can be formulated as an inverse problem, and in a Bayesian context, the goal is to sample a clean reconstruction given the degraded observation. Recently, modern pretrained diffusion models have been used for image restoration by modifying their sampling procedure to account for the degradation process. However, these methods often rely on certain approximations that can lead to significant errors and compromised sample quality. In this paper, we propose a simple modification to existing diffusion-based restoration methods that exploits the frequency structure of the reverse diffusion process. Specifically, our approach, denoted as Frequency Guided Posterior Sampling (FGPS), introduces a time-varying low-pass filter in the frequency domain of the measurements, progressively incorporating higher frequencies during the restoration process. We provide the first rigorous analysis of the approximation error of FGPS for linear inverse problems under distributional assumptions on the space of natural images, demonstrating cases where previous works can fail dramatically. On real-world data, we develop an adaptive curriculum for our method's frequency schedule based on the underlying data distribution.

However, current benchmarks often exhibit biases towards common actions like walking or standing, neglecting the critical need for identifying abnormal behaviors in real-world scenarios.

To enable the training and evaluation of this new task, we construct a large-scale image-text Pedestrian Anomaly Behavior (PAB) benchmark, featuring a broad spectrum of actions, e.g., running, performing, playing soccer, and the corresponding anomalies, e.g., lying, being hit, and falling of the same identity. The training set of PAB comprises 1,013,605 synthesized image-text pairs of both normalities and anomalies, while the test set includes 1,978 real-world image-text pairs. To validate the potential of PAB, we introduce a cross-modal pose-aware framework, which integrates human pose patterns with identity-based hard negative pair sampling. Extensive experiments on the proposed benchmark show that synthetic training data facilitates the fine-grained behavior retrieval, and the proposed pose-aware method arrives at 84.93% recall@1 accuracy, surpassing other competitive methods",

While scaling visual tokenizers improves image reconstruction quality, it often degrades downstream generation quality--a challenge not adequately addressed in existing literature. To address this, we introduce GigaTok, the first approach to simultaneously improve image reconstruction, generation, and representation learning when scaling visual tokenizers. We identify the growing complexity of latent space as the key factor behind the reconstruction vs. generation dilemma. To mitigate this, we propose semantic regularization, which aligns tokenizer features with semantically consistent features from a pre-trained visual encoder. This constraint prevents excessive latent space complexity during scaling, yielding consistent improvements in both reconstruction and downstream autoregressive generation. Building on semantic regularization, we explore three key practices for scaling tokenizers: (1) using 1D tokenizers for better scalability, (2) prioritizing decoder scaling when expanding both encoder and decoder, and (3) employing entropy loss to stabilize training for billion-scale tokenizers.

Recent works show that when trained from scratch, recurrent models achieve better results than feedforward models in these tasks. However, when leveraging self-supervised pre-trained weights, feedforward models can outperform their recurrent counterparts. Current self-supervised learning (SSL) methods for event-based pre-training largely mimic RGB image-based approaches. They pre-train feedforward models on raw events within a short time interval, ignoring the temporal information of events. In this work, we introduce TESPEC, a self-supervised pre-training framework tailored for learning spatio-temporal information. TESPEC is well-suited for recurrent models, as it is the first framework to leverage long event sequences during pre-training. TESPEC employs the masked image modeling paradigm with a new reconstruction target. We design a novel method to accumulate events into pseudo grayscale videos containing high-level semantic information about the underlying scene, which is robust to sensor noise and reduces motion blur. Reconstructing this target thus requires the model to reason about long-term history of events.

Our training exclusively utilizes multi-view consistency self-supervision without any form of semantic or geometric ground truth. Given a single input image, SceneDINO infers the 3D geometry and expressive 3D DINO features in a feed-forward manner. Through a novel 3D feature distillation approach, we obtain unsupervised 3D semantics. In both 3D and 2D unsupervised scene understanding, SceneDINO reaches state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy. Linear probing our 3D features matches the segmentation accuracy of a current supervised SSC approach.

Despite its wide range of applications, CLIP's latent space is known to fail at handling complex visual-textual interactions. Recent works attempt to address its shortcomings with data-centric or algorithmic approaches. But what if the problem is more fundamental, and lies in the geometry of CLIP? Toward this end, we rigorously analyze CLIP's latent space properties, and prove that no CLIP-like joint embedding space exists which can correctly do any two of the following at the same time: 1. represent basic descriptions and image content, 2. represent attribute binding, 3. represent spatial location and relationships, 4. represent negation. Informed by this analysis, we propose Dense Cosine Similarity Maps (DCSMs) as a principled and interpretable scoring method for CLIP-like models, which solves the fundamental limitations of CLIP by retaining the semantic topology of the image patches and text tokens. This method improves upon the performance of classical CLIP-like joint encoder models on a wide array of benchmarks. We share our code and data here: https://github.com/Raphoo/DCSM_Ideal_CLIP",

LaneDiffusion innovatively employs diffusion models to generate lane centerline priors at the Bird's Eye View (BEV) feature level, instead of directly predicting vectorized centerlines. Our method integrates a Lane Prior Injection Module (LPIM) and a Lane Prior Diffusion Module (LPDM) to effectively construct diffusion targets and manage the diffusion process.

Existing federated domain generalization (FDG) methods based on prompt learning typically learn soft prompts from training samples, replacing manually designed prompts to enhance the generalization ability of federated models.

We propose a novel and effective method from a generative perspective for handling FDG tasks, namely federated domain generalization with domain-specific soft prompts generation (FedDSPG). Specifically, during training, we introduce domain-specific soft prompts (DSPs) for each domain and integrate content and domain knowledge into the generative model among clients.

Our motivation stems from the observation that existing fusion strategies are constrained by their inability to simultaneously achieve efficiency, long-range modeling, and retaining complete scene information. Inspired by recent advances in state-space models (SSMs) and linear attention, we leverage their linear complexity and long-range modeling capabilities to address these challenges. However, this is non-trivial since our experiments reveal that simply adopting efficient linear-complexity methods does not necessarily yield improvements and may even degrade performance. We attribute this degradation to the loss of height information during multi-modal alignment, leading to deviations in sequence order. To resolve this, we propose height-fidelity LiDAR encoding that preserves precise height information through voxel compression in continuous space, thereby enhancing camera-LiDAR alignment. Subsequently, we introduce the Hybrid Mamba Block, which leverages the enriched height-informed features to conduct local and global contextual learning. By integrating these components, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with the top-tire NDS score of 75.0 on the nuScenes validation benchmark, even surpassing methods that utilize high-resolution inputs.

The key of TF-OVSS is to improve the local spatial representation of CLIP by leveraging self-correlation maps, thus preserving its zero-sample capability and achieving open understanding. However, most TF-OVSS methods utilize the Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) mechanism to generate self-correlation maps, neglecting the diversity among multiple heads. In this paper, we explore the diversity of MHSA, revealing that the contributions of single-head attention to the final results are varied and redundant. To address this issue, we introduce DIH-CLIP, a training-free CLIP model for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. Specifically, we propose a Selective Head Attention (SHA) to replace the traditional MHSA in CLIP, which contains two key designs: (1) evaluating the diversity of multi-head attention via calculating information entropy scores of per head attention map and removing the redundant attention head with threshold; (2) transferring the local representation of single-head attention to the global CLIP feature to enhance the local spatial representation capability of CLIP.

We then introduce several strategies to enhance text association and video understanding within the prototypes, along with an orthogonal objective to ensure that the prototypes capture a diverse range of content. To keep the prototypes searchable via text queries while accurately encoding video contexts, we implement cross- and uni-modal reconstruction tasks. The cross-modal reconstruction task aligns the prototypes with textual features within a shared space, while the uni-modal reconstruction task preserves all video contexts during encoding.

Previous research demonstrates that incorporating diffusion-based measurements, such as reconstruction error, can enhance the generalizability of detectors.

Aleatoric uncertainty, arising from inherent data noise, creates ambiguity that impedes accurate detection of generated images. As it reflects random variations within the data (e.g., noise in natural textures), it does not help distinguish generated images. In contrast, epistemic uncertainty, which represents the model's lack of knowledge about unfamiliar patterns, supports detection. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Diffusion Epistemic Uncertainty with Asymmetric Learning (DEUA), for detecting diffusion-generated images. We introduce Diffusion Epistemic Uncertainty (DEU) estimation via the Laplace approximation to assess the proximity of data to the manifold of diffusion-generated samples.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Bimanual manipulation is crucial in robotics, enabling complex tasks in industrial automation and household services. However, it poses significant challenges due to the high-dimensional action space and intricate coordination requirements. While video prediction has been recently studied for representation learning and control, leveraging its ability to capture rich dynamic and behavioral information, its potential for enhancing bimanual coordination remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified diffusion-based framework for the joint optimization of video and action prediction. Specifically, we propose a multi-frame latent prediction strategy that encodes future states in a compressed latent space, preserving task-relevant features. Furthermore, we introduce a unidirectional attention mechanism where video prediction is conditioned on the action, but action prediction remains independent of video prediction. This design allows us to omit video prediction during inference, significantly enhancing efficiency. Experiments on two simulated benchmarks and a real-world setting demonstrate a significant improvement in the success rate over the strong baseline ACT using our method, achieving a 24.9% increase on ALOHA, an 11.1% increase on RoboTwin, and a 32.5% increase in real-world experiments.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Visual grounding (VG) is the capability to identify the specific regions in an image associated with a particular text description. In medical imaging, VG enhances interpretability by highlighting relevant pathological features corresponding to textual descriptions, improving model transparency and trustworthiness for wider adoption of deep learning models in clinical practice. Current models struggle to associate textual descriptions with disease regions due to inefficient attention mechanisms and a lack of fine-grained token representations. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate two key observations. First, current VLMs assign high norms to background tokens, diverting the model's attention from regions of disease. Second, the global tokens used for cross-modal learning are not representative of local disease tokens. This hampers identifying correlations between the text and disease tokens. To address this, we introduce simple, yet effective Disease-Aware Prompting (DAP) process, which uses the explainability map of a VLM to identify the appropriate image features. This simple strategy amplifies disease-relevant regions while suppressing background interference. Without any additional pixel-level annotations, DAP improves visual grounding accuracy by 20.74% compared to state-of-the-art methods across three major chest X-ray datasets",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Driven by the \"scale-is-everything\" paradigm, modern machine learning increasingly demands ever-larger datasets and models, yielding prohibitive computational and storage requirements. Dataset distillation mitigates this by compressing an original dataset into a small set of synthetic samples, while preserving its full utility. Yet, existing methods either maximize performance under fixed storage budgets or pursue suitable synthetic data representations for redundancy removal, without jointly optimizing both objectives. In this work, we propose a joint rate-utility optimization method for dataset distillation. We parameterize synthetic samples as optimizable latent codes decoded by extremely lightweight networks. We estimate the Shannon entropy of quantized latents as the rate measure and plug any existing distillation loss as the utility measure, trading them off via a Lagrange multiplier. To enable fair, cross-method comparisons, we introduce bits per class (bpc), a precise storage metric that accounts for sample, label, and decoder parameter costs. On CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-128, our method achieves up to 170xgreater compression than standard distillation at comparable accuracy. Across diverse bpc budgets, distillation losses, and backbone architectures, our approach consistently establishes better rate-utility trade-offs",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The widespread availability of off-the-shelf machine learning models poses a challenge: which model, of the many available candidates, should be chosen for a given data analysis task? This question of model selection is traditionally answered by collecting and annotating a validation dataset---a costly and time-intensive process. We propose a method for active model selection, using predictions from candidate models to prioritize the labeling of test data points that efficiently differentiate the best candidate. Our method, CODA, performs consensus-driven active model selection by modeling relationships between classifiers, categories, and data points within a probabilistic framework. The framework uses the consensus and disagreement between models in the candidate pool to guide the label acquisition process, and Bayesian inference to update beliefs about which model is best as more information is collected. We validate our approach by curating a collection of 26 benchmark tasks capturing a range of model selection scenarios.CODA outperforms existing methods for active model selection significantly, reducing the annotation effort required to discover the best model by upwards of 70% compared to the previous state-of-the-art.

    "abstract": "Humans possess an exceptional ability to imagine 4D scenes, encompassing both motion and 3D geometry, from a single still image. This ability is rooted in our accumulated observations of similar scenes and an intuitive understanding of physics. In this paper, we aim to replicate this capacity in neural networks, specifically focusing on natural fluid imagery. Existing methods for this task typically employ simplistic 2D motion estimators to animate the image, leading to motion predictions that often defy physical principles, resulting in unrealistic animations. Our approach introduces a novel method for generating 4D scenes with physics-consistent animation from a single image. We propose the use of a physics-informed neural network that predicts motion for each surface point, guided by a loss term derived from fundamental physical principles, including the Navier-Stokes equations. To capture appearance, we predict feature-based 3D Gaussians from the input image and its estimated depth, which are then animated using the predicted motions and rendered from any desired camera perspective. Experimental results highlight the effectiveness of our method in producing physically plausible animations, showcasing significant performance improvements over existing methods.

Many existing methods have made excellent strides in improving image brightness and enhancing texture details. However, these approaches often lead to overexposure in certain regions when dealing with unevenly illuminated images, resulting in the loss of original information within the images. To address this issue, we propose a Bezier surface constraint (BSCNet) method based on task decoupling to enhance low-light images with uneven brightness. Specifically, we design a diffusion model with a branch structure that separates the enhancement process into brightness adjustment and color restoration, enabling independent control over brightness uniformity. Additionally, we use Bezier surfaces as a learning target to impose smoothness constraints on the image, thereby addressing the issue of uneven brightness in the enhanced image. To counteract potential detail loss introduced by Bezier surfaces, we introduce a spatial-frequency reconstruction module based on the Fourier transform to enhance fine-grained texture information.

Therefore, automated long animation colorization based on the video generation model has significant research value. Existing studies are limited to short-term colorization. These studies adopt a local paradigm, fusing overlapping features to achieve smooth transitions between local segments. However, the local paradigm neglects global information, failing to maintain long-term color consistency. In this study, we argue that ideal long-term color consistency can be achieved through a dynamic global-local paradigm, i.e., dynamically extracting global color consistent features relevant to the current generation. Specifically, we propose LongAnimation, a novel framework, which mainly includes a SketchDiT, a Dynamic Global-Local Memory (DGLM), and a Color Consistency Reward. The SketchDiT captures hybrid reference features to support the DGLM module. The DGLM module employs a long video understanding model to dynamically compress global historical features and adaptively fuse them with the current generation features. To refine the color consistency, we introduce a Color Consistency Reward. During inference, we propose a color consistency fusion to smooth the video segment transition.

To further increase throughput and efficiency, we combine visual token merge with linear RNN models by reordering the visual tokens by their sizes in ascending order.

We identify several key challenges: 1) The weights of Mamba-based blocks in ViMs contain numerous outliers, significantly amplifying quantization errors. 2) When applied to ViMs, the latest VQ methods suffer from excessive memory consumption, lengthy calibration procedures, and suboptimal performance in the search for optimal codewords. In this paper, we propose ViM-VQ, an efficient post-training vector quantization method tailored for ViMs. ViM-VQ consists of two innovative components: 1) a fast convex combination optimization algorithm that efficiently updates both the convex combinations and the convex hulls to search for optimal codewords, and 2) an incremental vector quantization strategy that incrementally confirms optimal codewords to mitigate truncation errors. Experimental results demonstrate that ViM-VQ achieves state-of-the-art performance in low-bit quantization across various visual tasks",

Existing approaches either enhance low-light images without considering normal illumination scenarios, leading to poor generalization, or are tailored to specific tasks. We propose TorchAdapt, a realtime adaptive feature enhancement framework that generalizes robustly across varying illumination conditions without degrading performance in well-lit scenarios. TorchAdapt consists of two complementary modules: the Torch module enhances semantic features beneficial for downstream tasks, while the Adapt module dynamically modulates these enhancements based on input content. Leveraging a novel light-agnostic learning strategy, TorchAdapt aligns feature representations of enhanced and well-lit images to produce powerful illumination-invariant features. Extensive experiments on multiple high-level vision tasks, including object detection, face detection, instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and video object detection, demonstrate that TorchAdapt consistently outperforms state-of-the-art lowlight enhancement and task-specific methods in both lowlight and light-agnostic settings. TorchAdapt thus provides a unified, flexible solution for robust visual perception across diverse lighting conditions",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Given a source image, personalized text-to-image generation produces images preserving the identity and appearance while following the text prompts. Existing methods heavily rely on test-time optimization to achieve this customization. Although some recent works are dedicated to zero-shot personalization, they still require re-training when applied to different text-to-image diffusion models. In this paper, we instead propose a model-agnostic personalized method termed UniversalBooth. At the heart of our approach lies a novel cross-attention mechanism, where different blocks in the same diffusion scale share common square transformation matrices of key and value. In this way, the image encoder is decoupled from the diffusion architecture while maintaining its effectiveness. Moreover, the cross-attention performs hierarchically: the holistic attention first captures the global semantics of user inputs for textual combination with editing prompts, and the fine-grained attention divides the holistic attention scores for various local patches to enhance appearance consistency. To improve the performance when deployed on unseen diffusion models, we further devise an optimal transport prior to the model and encourage the attention scores allocated by cross-attention to fulfill the optimal transport constraint. Experiments demonstrate that our personalized generation model can be generalized to unseen text-to-image diffusion models with a wide spectrum of architectures and functionalities without any additional optimization, while other methods cannot. Meanwhile, it achieves comparable zero-shot personalization performance on seen architectures with existing works",

We systematically clarify the performance gap between VLMs using pre-trained vision encoders, discrete tokenizers, and minimalist visual layers from scratch, deeply excavating the under-examined characteristics of encoder-free VLMs. We develop efficient strategies for encoder-free VLMs that rival mainstream encoder-based ones. After an in-depth investigation, we launch EVEv2.0, a new and improved family of encoder-free VLMs. We show that: (i) Properly decomposing and hierarchically associating vision and language within a unified model reduces interference between modalities. (ii) A well-designed training strategy enables effective optimization for encoder-free VLMs. Through extensive evaluation, our EVEv2.0 represents a thorough study for developing a decoder-only architecture across modalities, demonstrating superior data efficiency and strong vision-reasoning capability.

Yet, to fully realize its potential, an effective online trajectory evaluation is indispensable to ensure safety. By forecasting the future outcomes of a given trajectory, trajectory evaluation becomes much more effective. This goal can be achieved by employing a world model to capture environmental dynamics and predict future states. Therefore, we propose an end-to-end driving framework **WoTE**, which leverages a BEV **Wo**rld model to predict future BEV states for **T**rajectory **E**valuation. The proposed BEV world model is latency-efficient compared to image-level world models and can be seamlessly supervised using off-the-shelf BEV-space traffic simulators.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Generating high fidelity video from brain activity is an important milestone in brain decoding research. Previous works were mostly based on functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), whose low temporal resolution confines the ability of faithfully reflecting rapid brain activity, motivating us to turn to high temporal resolution brain signals like electroencephalography (EEG). However, EEG-to-video is challenging due to the complexity and nonstationarity of EEG signals and the scarcity of data annotations. Addressing these issues, we present **EEGMirror**. Firstly, we adopt neural quantization for converting nonstationary raw EEG signals into robust discrete representation. Afterwards, a masked self-supervision method with montage-agnostic position embedding (MAPE) is introduced. By MAPE, EEGMirror can process EEG data with various montages (number and position of channels) and thus can flexibly leverage different EEG datasets to acquire an effective EEG encoder, mitigating the lack of well-annotated EEG data. Next, multimodal contrastive learning is applied to align brain modality with dynamic changes and semantic information. Lastly, a fine-tuned inflated Stable Diffusion model is adopted to reconstruct video stimuli guided by visual and semantic information decoded from EEG signals. We show that EEGMirror outperforms the state-of-the-art performance in both semantic (82.1% vs 79.8%) and pixel (0.261 vs 0.256) levels. An exhaustive ablation study is also conducted to analyze our framework. Code: https://github.com/XuanhaoLiu/EEGMirror",

Built upon video diffusion models, Edit360 enables user-specific editing from arbitrary viewpoints while ensuring structural coherence across all views. The framework selects anchor views for 2D modifications and propagates edits across the entire 360-degree range. To achieve this, Edit360 introduces a novel Anchor-View Editing Propagation mechanism, which effectively aligns and merges multi-view information within the latent and attention spaces of diffusion models. The resulting edited multi-view sequences facilitate the reconstruction of high-quality 3D assets, enabling customizable 3D content creation",

    "abstract": "Large-scale pre-training technology has achieved remarkable performance in diversified object re-identification (Re-ID) downstream tasks. Nevertheless, to our best knowledge, the pre-training model specifically for vehicle Re-ID, which focuses on tackling the challenge of multi-view variations, has not been fully investigated. In this paper, we first leverage a diffusion model to build a large-scale vehicle Re-ID benchmark dataset, dubbed \"DiffVERI\", containing over 1700K images from abundant multi-view annotations. In terms of this dataset, we further present VehicleMAE, a novel masked image modeling pre-training paradigm that learns view-invariant representations by performing mutual-distillation in a self-supervised manner. To be specific, the pipeline of VehicleMAE unfolds two core modules, i.e., view-asymmetry masked image modeling (VMIM) and past-to-present mutual-distillation (PPMD). Technically, VMIM consists of two homogeneous masked autoencoders (MAE) that simultaneously reconstruct the RGB pixels and multi-view semantic information of the specific vehicle body region via paired asymmetric mask sampling strategies. To progressively distill the knowledge of the model itself, PPMD considers the two MAEs in the current epoch and the previous one as the student models and the teacher models, respectively, which leverages the knowledge learned by the current student and the historical teacher for mutual feature-level distillation. Extensive experimental results have verified that the proposed pre-training paradigm on DiffVERI gains compelling downstream task performance for vehicle Re-ID",

Our work addresses these challenges through a structured two-stage planning-assembly framework. For planning, we introduce a dual layout diffusion guidance approach to bridge semantic reasoning and geometric controllability. Our approach uniquely integrates LLMs' open-vocabulary reasoning with Graph Diffusion Models' (GDM) geometric precision by incorporating multi-level self-consistency scores over scene graph structures and layout bounding box parameters. This fusion enables fine-grained control over scene composition while ensuring physical plausibility and faithful prompt interpretation. For assembly, we propose a layout-guided optimization technique for scene refinement. We effectively incorporate layout priors obtained during the planning stage into a Stable Diffusion (SD)-based refinement process that jointly optimizes camera trajectories and scene splats. This layout-aware joint optimization, constrained by multi-view consistency, produces visually compelling immersive scenes that are structurally coherent and controllable",
