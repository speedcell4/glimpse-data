    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Chirality information (i.e. information that allows distinguishing left from right) is ubiquitous for various data modes in computer vision, including images, videos, point clouds, and meshes. While chirality has been extensively studied in the image domain, its exploration in shape analysis (such as point clouds and meshes) remains underdeveloped. Although many shape vertex descriptors have shown appealing properties (e.g. robustness to rigid-body transformations), they are often not able to disambiguate between left and right symmetric parts. Considering the ubiquity of chirality information in different shape analysis problems and the lack of chirality-aware features within current shape descriptors, developing a chirality feature extractor becomes necessary and urgent. Based on the recent Diff3F framework, we propose an unsupervised chirality feature extraction pipeline to decorate shape vertices with chirality-aware information, extracted from 2D foundation models. We evaluated the extracted chirality features through quantitative and qualitative experiments across diverse datasets. Results from downstream tasks including left-right disentanglement, shape matching, and part segmentation demonstrate their effectiveness and practical utility.

    "title": "Efficient Adaptation of Pre-trained Vision Transformer underpinned by Approximately Orthogonal Fine-Tuning Strategy",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "A prevalent approach in Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViT) involves freezing the majority of the backbone parameters and solely learning low-rank adaptation weight matrices to accommodate downstream tasks. These low-rank matrices are commonly derived through the multiplication structure of down-projection and up-projection matrices, exemplified by methods such as LoRA and Adapter. In this study, we observe an approximate orthogonality among any two row or column vectors within any weight matrix of the backbone parameters; however, this property is absent in the vectors of the down/up-projection matrices. Approximate orthogonality implies a reduction in the upper bound of the model's generalization error, signifying that the model possesses enhanced generalization capability. If the fine-tuned down/up-projection matrices were to exhibit this same property as the pre-trained backbone matrices, could the generalization capability of fine-tuned ViTs be further augmented? To address this question, we propose an Approximately Orthogonal Fine-Tuning (AOFT) strategy for representing the low-rank weight matrices. This strategy employs a single learnable vector to generate a set of approximately orthogonal vectors, which form the down/up-projection matrices, thereby aligning the properties of these matrices with those of the backbone. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance across a range of downstream image classification tasks, confirming the efficacy of the enhanced generalization capability embedded in the down/up-projection matrices.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Speech-driven methods for portraits are figuratively known as \"Talkers\" because of their capability to synthesize speaking mouth shapes and facial movements. Especially with the rapid development of the Text-to-Image (T2I) models, AI-Generated Talking Heads (AGTHs) have gradually become an emerging digital human media. However, challenges persist regarding the quality of these talkers and AGTHs they generate, and comprehensive studies addressing these issues remain limited. To address this gap, this paper presents the largest AGTH quality assessment dataset THQA-10K to date, which selects 12 prominent T2I models and 14 advanced talkers to generate AGTHs for 14 prompts. After excluding instances where AGTH generation is unsuccessful, the THQA-10K dataset contains 10,457 AGTHs, which provides rich material for AGTH quality assessment. Then, volunteers are recruited to subjectively rate the AGTHs and give the corresponding distortion categories. In our analysis for subjective experimental results, we evaluate the performance of talkers in terms of generalizability and quality, and also expose the distortions of existing AGTHs. Finally, an objective quality assessment method based on the first frame, Y-T slice and tone-lip consistency is proposed. Experimental results show that this method can achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in AGTH quality assessment. The work is released at https://github.com/zyj-2000/Talker",

The development of a layer-aware framework faces a significant data scarcity challenge due to the commercial sensitivity of professional animation assets. To address the limitation, we propose a data curation pipeline featuring Automated Element Segmentation and Motion-based Hierarchical Merging. Through quantitative and qualitative comparisons and user study, we demonstrate that LayerAnimate outperforms current methods in terms of animation quality, control precision, and usability, making it an effective tool for both professional animators and amateur enthusiasts.

    "abstract": "Advances in Earth observation (EO) foundation models have unlocked the potential of big satellite data to learn generic representations from space, benefiting a wide range of downstream applications crucial to our planet. However, most existing efforts remain limited to fixed spectral sensors, focus solely on the Earth's surface, and overlook valuable metadata beyond imagery. In this work, we take a step towards next-generation EO foundation models with three key components: 1) Copernicus-Pretrain, a massive-scale pretraining dataset that integrates 18.7M aligned images from all major Copernicus Sentinel missions, spanning from the Earth's surface to its atmosphere; 2) Copernicus-FM, a unified foundation model capable of processing any spectral or non-spectral sensor modality using extended dynamic hypernetworks and flexible metadata encoding; and 3) Copernicus-Bench, a systematic evaluation benchmark with 15 hierarchical downstream tasks ranging from preprocessing to specialized applications for each Sentinel mission. Our dataset, model, and benchmark greatly improve the scalability, versatility, and multimodal adaptability of EO foundation models, while also creating new opportunities to connect EO, weather, and climate research.

We propose the ROADWork dataset to learn to recognize, observe, analyze, and drive through work zones. State-of-the-art foundation models fail when applied to work zones. Fine-tuning models on our dataset significantly improves perception and navigation in work zones. With ROADWork, we discover new work zone images with higher precision (+32.5%) at a much higher rate (12.8x) around the world. Open-vocabulary methods fail too, whereas fine-tuned detectors improve performance (+32.2 AP).Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle to describe work zones, but fine-tuning substantially improves performance (+36.7 SPICE). Beyond fine-tuning, we show the value of simple techniques. Video label propagation provides additional gains (+2.6 AP) for instance segmentation. While reading work zone signs, composing a detector and text spotter via crop-scaling improves performance (+14.2% 1-NED). Composing work zone detections to provide context further reduces hallucinations (+3.9 SPICE) in VLMs. We predict navigational goals and compute drivable paths from work zone videos. Incorporating road work semantics ensures 53.6% goals have angular error (AE) < 0.5 (+9.9%) and 75.3% pathways have AE < 0.5 (+8.1%)",

In this paper, we propose a novel framework for IOD that leverages a decoupled gradient alignment technique on top of the specially proposed pseudo-labeling strategy. Our method employs a Gaussian Mixture Model to accurately estimate pseudo-labels of previously learned objects in current training images, effectively functioning as a knowledge-replay mechanism. This strategy reinforces prior knowledge retention and prevents the misclassification of unannotated foreground objects from earlier classes as background. Furthermore, we introduce an adaptive gradient decomposition and alignment method to maintain model stability while facilitating positive knowledge transfer. By aligning gradients from both old and new classes, our approach preserves previously learned knowledge while enhancing plasticity for new tasks. Extensive experiments on two IOD benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving superior performances to state-of-the-art methods",

    "abstract": "Polyp segmentation is vital for early colorectal cancer detection, yet traditional fully supervised methods struggle with morphological variability and domain shifts, requiring frequent retraining. Additionally, reliance on large-scale annotations is a major bottleneck due to the time-consuming and error-prone nature of polyp boundary labeling. Recently, vision foundation models like Segment Anything Model (SAM) have demonstrated strong generalizability and fine-grained boundary detection with sparse prompts, effectively addressing key polyp segmentation challenges. However, SAM's prompt-dependent nature limits automation in medical applications, since manually inputting prompts for each image is labor-intensive and time-consuming. We propose OP-SAM, a One-shot Polyp segmentation framework based on SAM that automatically generates prompts from a single annotated image, ensuring accurate and generalizable segmentation without additional annotation burdens. Our method introduces Correlation-based Prior Generation (CPG) for semantic label transfer and Scale-cascaded Prior Fusion (SPF) to adapt to polyp size variations as well as filter out noisy transfers. Instead of dumping all prompts at once, we devise Euclidean Prompt Evolution (EPE) for iterative prompt refinement, progressively enhancing segmentation quality. Extensive evaluations across five datasets validate OP-SAM's effectiveness. Notably, on Kvasir, it achieves 76.93% IoU, surpassing the state-of-the-art by 11.44%",

    "abstract": "Machine learning classification models trained with empirical risk minimization (ERM) often inadvertently rely on spurious correlations. When absent in the test data, these unintended associations between non-target attributes and target labels lead to poor generalization. This paper addresses this problem from a model optimization perspective and proposes a novel method, Gradient Extrapolation for Debiased Representation Learning (GERNE), designed to learn debiased representations in both known and unknown attribute training cases. GERNE uses two distinct batches with different amounts of spurious correlations and defines the target gradient as a linear extrapolation of the gradients computed from each batch's loss. Our analysis shows that when the extrapolated gradient points toward the batch gradient with fewer spurious correlations, it effectively guides training toward learning a debiased model. GERNE serves as a general framework for debiasing, encompassing ERM and Resampling methods as special cases. We derive the theoretical upper and lower bounds of the extrapolation factor employed by GERNE. By tuning this factor, GERNE can adapt to maximize either Group-Balanced Accuracy (GBA) or Worst-Group Accuracy (WGA). We validate GERNE on five vision and one NLP benchmarks, demonstrating competitive and often superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

We introduce PILOT, a programmatic imitation learning approach that predicts a driver's eye movements based on a set of rule-based conditions. These conditions--derived from driving operations and traffic flow characteristics--define how gaze shifts occur. They are initially identified through incremental synthesis, a heuristic search method, and then refined via L-BFGS, a numerical optimization technique. These human-readable rules enable us to understand drivers' eye movement patterns and make efficient and explainable predictions. We also propose DATAD, a dataset that covers 12 types of autonomous driving takeover scenarios, collected from 60 participants and comprising approximately 600,000 frames of gaze point data. Compared to existing eye-tracking datasets, DATAD includes additional driving metrics and surrounding traffic flow characteristics, providing richer contextual information for modeling gaze behavior. Experimental evaluations of PILOT on DATAD demonstrate superior accuracy and faster prediction speeds compared to four baseline models. Specifically, PILOT reduces the MSE of predicted trajectories by 38.59% to 88.02% and improves the accuracy of gaze object predictions by 6.90% to 55.06%.

In this study, we propose a highly-consistent data synthesis pipeline to tackle these challenges. This pipeline harnesses the intrinsic in-context generation capabilities of diffusion transformers and generates high-consistent multi-subject paired data. Additionally, we introduce UNO, a multi-subject driven customization architecture based on a diffusion transformer. UNO incorporates a progressive cross-modal alignment training paradigm that progresses from simpler single-subject conditioning to more complex multi-subject conditioning. Along with this, a universal rotary position embedding (UnoPE) adjusts the position indices.

Existing MHFL methods face significant limitations when it comes to transferring global knowledge to clients as a result of sharing only partial homogeneous model parameters or calculating distance loss, leading to inferior model generalization. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel model-heterogeneous Federated learning method with Representation Angle Learning (FedRAL). It consists of three innovative designs: (1) We first introduce representation angle learning into MHFL. Specifically, we embed a homogeneous square matrix into the local heterogeneous model of each client, which learns the angle information of local representations. These homogeneous representation angle square matrices are aggregated on the server to fuse representation angle knowledge shared by clients for enhancing the generalization of local representations. (2) As different clients might have heterogeneous system resources, we propose an adaptive diagonal sparsification strategy to reduce the numbers of the parameters of representation angle square matrices uploaded to the server, to improve FL communication efficiency. (3) To enable the effective fusion of sparsified homogeneous local representation angle square matrices, we design an element-wise weighted aggregation approach. Experiments on 4 benchmark datasets under 2 types of non-IID divisions over 6 state-of-the-art baselines demonstrate that FedRAL achieves the best performance.

    "abstract": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made significant progress in recent years but are also prone to hallucination issues. They exhibit more hallucinations in longer, free-form responses, often attributed to accumulated uncertainties. In this paper, we ask: Does increased hallucination result solely from length-induced errors, or is there a deeper underlying mechanism? After a series of preliminary experiments and findings, we suggest that the risk of hallucinations is not caused by length itself but by the increased reliance on context for coherence and completeness in longer responses. Building on these insights, we propose a novel \"induce-detect-suppress\" framework that actively induces hallucinations through deliberately designed contexts, leverages induced instances for early detection of high-risk cases, and ultimately suppresses potential object-level hallucinations during actual decoding. Our approach achieves consistent, significant improvements across all benchmarks, demonstrating its efficacy. The strong detection and improved hallucination mitigation not only validate our framework but, more importantly, re-validate our hypothesis on context. Rather than solely pursuing performance gains, this study aims to provide new insights and serves as a first step toward a deeper exploration of hallucinations in LVLMs' longer responses",

We propose a novel method, Retrieval and Reasoning for Personalization (R2P), leveraging internal knowledge of VLMs. First, we leverage VLMs to extract the concept fingerprint, i.e., key attributes uniquely defining the concept within its semantic class. When a query arrives, the most similar fingerprints are retrieved and scored via chain of thought reasoning. To reduce the risk of hallucinations, the scores are validated through cross-modal verification at the attribute level:in case of a discrepancy between the scores, R2P refines the concept association viapairwise multimodal matching, where the retrieved fingerprints and their images aredirectly compared with the query.We validate R2P on two publicly available benchmarks and a newly introduced dataset, Personal Concepts with Visual Ambiguity (PerVA), for concept identification highlighting challenges in visual ambiguity. R2P consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on various downstream tasks across all benchmarks",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in video diffusion models enable the generation of photorealistic videos with impressive 3D consistency and temporal coherence. However, the extent to which these AI-generated videos simulate the 3D visual world remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce Learned 3D Evaluation (L3DE), an objective, quantifiable, and interpretable method for assessing AI-generated videos' ability to simulate the real world in terms of 3D visual qualities and consistencies, without requiring manually labeled defects or quality annotations. Instead of relying on 3D reconstruction, which is prone to failure with in-the-wild videos, L3DE employs a 3D convolutional network, trained on monocular 3D cues of motion, depth, and appearance, to distinguish real from synthetic videos. Confidence scores from L3DE quantify the gap between real and synthetic videos in terms of 3D visual coherence, while a gradient-based visualization pinpoints unrealistic regions, improving interpretability. We validate L3DE through extensive experiments, demonstrating strong alignment with 3D reconstruction quality and human judgments. Our evaluations on leading generative models (e.g., Sora, MiniMax, and Kling) reveal persistent simulation gaps and subtle inconsistencies. Beyond generative video assessment, L3DE extends to broader applications: benchmarking video generation models, serving as a deepfake detector, and enhancing video synthesis by inpainting flagged inconsistencies",

    "title": "Rethinking Detecting Salient and Camouflaged Objects in Unconstrained Scenes",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "While the human visual system employs distinct mechanisms to perceive salient and camouflaged objects, existing models struggle to disentangle these tasks. Specifically, salient object detection (SOD) models frequently misclassify camouflaged objects as salient, while camouflaged object detection (COD) models conversely misinterpret salient objects as camouflaged. We hypothesize that this can be attributed to two factors: (i) the specific annotation paradigm of current SOD and COD datasets, and (ii) the lack of explicit aspect relationship modeling in current models. Prevalent SOD/COD datasets enforce a mutual exclusivity constraint, assuming scenes contain either salient or camouflaged objects, which poorly aligns with the real world. Furthermore, current SOD/COD methods are primarily designed for these highly constrained datasets and lack explicit modeling of the relationship between salient and camouflaged objects. In this paper, to promote the development of unconstrained salient and camouflaged object detection, we construct a large-scale dataset, USC12K, which features comprehensive labels and four different scenes that cover all possible logical existence scenarios of both salient and camouflaged objects. To explicitly model the relationship between salient and camouflaged objects, we propose a model called USCNet, which introduces two distinct prompt query mechanisms for modeling inter-sample and intra-sample aspect relationships. Additionally, to assess the model's ability to distinguish between salient and camouflaged objects, we design an evaluation metric called CSCS. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance across all scenes in various metrics. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/ssecv/USCNet",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In large-scale scene reconstruction using 3D Gaussian splatting, it is common to partition the scene into multiple smaller regions and reconstruct them individually. However, existing division methods are occlusion-agnostic, meaning that each region may contain areas with severe occlusions. As a result, the cameras within those regions are less correlated, leading to a low average contribution to the overall reconstruction. In this paper, we propose an occlusion-aware scene division strategy that clusters training cameras based on their positions and co-visibilities to acquire multiple regions. Cameras in such regions exhibit stronger correlations and a higher average contribution, facilitating high-quality scene reconstruction. We further propose a region-based rendering technique to accelerate large scene rendering, which culls Gaussians invisible to the region where the viewpoint is located. Such a technique significantly speeds up the rendering without compromising quality. Extensive experiments on multiple large scenes show that our method achieves superior reconstruction results with faster rendering speeds compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches.

    "abstract": "Mathematical problems in real-world scenarios are often presented in a purely vision-form, where textual problem statement and accompanying math figures, e.g., geometry figures and functional graphs, are integrated into a single image. This vision-form problem-solving task requires precise comprehension and reasoning on both textual and graphical elements in the images, posing significant challenge to current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which process text and math figures in isolation. In this work, we propose VisionMath, the first exploration for vision-form mathematical problem-solving model, which employs a three-stage progressive multimodal reasoning alignment strategy to systematically enhance task-specific capabilities. Building upon a LLM proficient in unimodal mathematical reasoning, VisionMath first establishes foundational OCR capabilities through capturing rendered mathematical problem images. Subsequently, the model develops comprehensive understanding of figure structures and properties via learning from figure descriptions and mathematical educational videos. Finally, the model's reasoning capacity is activated using carefully constructed visual-form problem-solving datasets VisionMath-IT with chain-of-thought annotations.

With the rapid advancement of RGB-D sensors, unsupervised point cloud registration methods based on RGB-D sequences have demonstrated excellent performance. However, existing methods struggle in scenes with low overlap and photometric inconsistency. Low overlap results in numerous correspondence outliers, while photometric inconsistency hinders the model's ability to extract discriminative features. To address these challenges, we first propose the Overlapping Constraint for Inliers Detection (OCID) module, which filters and optimizes the initial correspondence set using an overlappping constraint. This module robustly selects reliable correspondences within the overlapping region while maintaining a balance between accuracy and efficiency. Additionally, we introduce a novel scene representation, 3DGS, which integrates both geometric and texture information, making it particularly well-suited for RGB-D registration tasks. Building on this, we propose the Gaussian Rendering for Photometric Adaptation (GRPA) module, which refines the geometric transformation and enhances the model's adaptability to scenes with inconsistent photometric information.

To address these limitations, we propose CWNet (Causal Wavelet Network), a novel architecture that leverages wavelet transforms for causal reasoning. Specifically, our approach comprises two key components: 1) Inspired by the concept of intervention in causality, we adopt a causal reasoning perspective to reveal the underlying causal relationships in low-light enhancement. From a global perspective, we employ a metric learning strategy to ensure causal embeddings adhere to causal principles, separating them from non-causal confounding factors while focusing on the invariance of causal factors. At the local level, we introduce an instance-level CLIP semantic loss to precisely maintain causal factor consistency. 2) Based on our causal analysis, we present a wavelet transform-based backbone network that effectively optimizes the recovery of frequency information, ensuring precise enhancement tailored to the specific attributes of wavelet transforms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CWNet significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets, showcasing its robust performance across diverse scenes.

The red-teaming VLM analyzes prompt-image pairs based on evaluation results, provides feedback and modification strategies to enhance adversarial effectiveness while preserving safety constraints, and iteratively improves prompts.

OpenAI's recent model, O1, showcased impressive capabilities in solving complex problems by utilizing extensive reasoning chains. This prompts an important question: can robot models achieve better performance in multi-task, complex environments by reviewing prior observations and then providing task-specific reasoning to guide action prediction?In this paper, we introduce Chain-of-Affordance (CoA-VLA), a novel approach to scaling robot models by incorporating reasoning in the format of sequential robot affordances to facilitate task completion. Specifically, we prompt the model to consider the following four types of affordances before taking action: (1) object affordance-- what object to manipulate and where it is; (2) grasp affordance -- the specific object part to grasp; (3) spatial affordance -- the optimal space to place the object; and (4) movement affordance-- the collision-free path for movement. We further transform each affordance into two prompting formats: visual affordance and textual affordance. We introduce a novel vision-language co-injection module that integrates this knowledge into the policy network. This allows the robot to leverage essential contextual information during action inference, resulting in improved precision and robustness. Our experiments demonstrate that CoA-VLA outperforms state-of-the-art robot foundation models, including OpenVLA and Octo, on a variety of tasks.

A significant limitation of these methods is their slow sampling speed when using VDMs. In this paper, we present FVGen, a novel framework that addresses this challenge by enabling fast novel view synthesis using VDMs in as few as 4 sampling steps.

    "abstract": "Open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding is indispensable for embodied agents. Recent works leverage pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) for object segmentation and project them to point clouds to build 3D maps. Despite progress, a point cloud is a set of unordered coordinates that requires substantial storage space and can not directly convey occupancy information or spatial relation, making existing methods inefficient for downstream tasks, e.g., path planning and complex text-based object retrieval. To address these issues, we propose Octree-Graph, a novel scene representation for open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding. Specifically, a Chronological Group-wise Segment Merging (CGSM) strategy and an Instance Feature Aggregation (IFA) algorithm are first designed to get 3D instances and corresponding semantic features. Subsequently, an adaptive-octree structure is developed that stores semantics and depicts the occupancy of an object adjustably according to its shape. Finally, the Octree-Graph is constructed where each adaptive-octree acts as a graph node, and edges describe the spatial relations among nodes. Extensive experiments on various tasks are conducted on several widely-used datasets, demonstrating the versatility and effectiveness of our method.

FlexGen tackles the challenges of controllable multi-view synthesis through additional conditioning on 3D-aware text annotations. We utilize the strong reasoning capabilities of GPT-4V to generate 3D-aware text annotations. By analyzing four orthogonal views of an object arranged as tiled multi-view images, GPT-4V can produce text annotations that include 3D-aware information with spatial relationship. By integrating the control signal with proposed adaptive dual-control module, our model can generate multi-view images that correspond to the specified text. FlexGen supports multiple controllable capabilities, allowing users to modify text prompts to generate reasonable and corresponding unseen parts. Additionally, users can influence attributes such as appearance and material properties, including metallic and roughness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach offers enhanced multiple controllability, marking a significant advancement over existing multi-view diffusion models.

Adopting diffusion models for the first time in video summarization, our proposed method, SummDiff, dynamically adapts to visual contexts and generates multiple candidate summaries conditioned on the input video. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SummDiff not only achieves the state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks but also produces summaries that closely align with individual annotator preferences.

While closely related to diffusion models, it provides a more general perspective on generative modeling.Although inverse problem solving has been extensively explored using diffusion models, it has not been rigorously examined within the broader context of flow models. Therefore, here we extend the diffusion inverse solvers (DIS)-- which perform posterior sampling by combining a denoising diffusion prior with an likelihood gradient--into the flow framework. Specifically, by driving the flow-version of Tweedie's formula, we decompose the flow ODE into two components: one for clean image estimation and the other for noise estimation.By integrating the likelihood gradient and stochastic noise into each component, respectively, we demonstrate that posterior sampling for inverse problem solving can be effectively achieved using flows. Our proposed solver, Flow-Driven Posterior Sampling (FlowDPS), can also be seamlessly integrated into a latent flow model with a transformer architecture.

However, the task is challenging due to limited visibility of body parts in first-person views and the sparseness of sensory data, with only a single device placed on the head. To address these challenges, we introduce Head2Body, a novel framework for body pose estimation that effectively combines IMU and visual data. First, we introduce a pre-trained IMU encoder, trained on over 1,700 hours of head-IMU data from wearable eyeglasses, to better capture detailed temporal motion cues given limited labeled egocentric pose data. For visual processing, we leverage large vision-language models (LVLMs) to segment body parts that appear sporadically in video frames to improve visual feature extraction. To better guide the pose generation process with sparse signals from only head-mounted devices, we incorporates a Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to represent poses as discrete tokens, which capture high-frequency motion patterns and provide a more structured representation of body pose. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, yielding 6-13% gains over state-of-the-art baselines on four datasets: AMASS, KinPoly, GIMO, and EgoExo4D.

Instead, this study introduces LoopTrans, a novel closed-loop framework that not only transfers knowledge from exocentric to egocentric but also transfers back to enhance exocentric knowledge extraction. Within LoopTrans, several innovative mechanisms are introduced, including unified cross-modal localization and denoising knowledge distillation, to bridge domain gaps between object-centered egocentric and interaction-centered exocentric images while enhancing knowledge transfer.

However, as LLMs grow in size, the memory demands for backpropagation become increasingly prohibitive. Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization methods offer a memory-efficient alternative by using forward passes to estimate gradients, but the variance of gradient estimates typically scales linearly with the model's parameter dimension--a significant issue for LLMs. In this paper, we propose the random Subspace Zeroth-order (SubZero) optimization to address the challenges posed by LLMs' high dimensionality. We introduce a low-rank perturbation tailored for LLMs that significantly reduces memory consumption while improving performance. Additionally, we prove that our gradient estimation closely approximates the backpropagation gradient, exhibits lower variance than traditional ZO methods, and ensures convergence when combined with SGD. Experimental results show that SubZero enhances fine-tuning performance and achieves faster convergence compared to standard ZO approaches like MeZO across various language modeling tasks.

Despite progress in same-domain composition, cross-domain composition remains under-explored. The main challenges are the stochastic nature of diffusion models and the style gap between input images, leading to failures and artifacts. Additionally, heavy reliance on text prompts limits practical applications. This paper presents the first cross-domain image composition method that does not require text prompts, allowing natural stylization and seamless compositions. Our method is efficient and robust, preserving the diffusion prior, as it involves minor steps for backward inversion and forward denoising without training the diffuser. Our method also uses a simple multilayer perceptron network to integrate CLIP features from foreground and background, manipulating diffusion with a local cross-attention strategy. It effectively preserves foreground content while enabling stable stylization without a pre-stylization network. Finally, we create a benchmark dataset with diverse contents and styles for fair evaluation, addressing the lack of testing datasets for cross-domain image composition. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, significantly improving the LPIPS score by 30.5% and the CSD metric by 18.1%.

Conventional deep learning methods assume perfect pixel-wise alignment and rely on per-pixel reconstruction losses, leading to spectral distortion, double edges, and blurring when misalignment is present. To address this, we propose PAN-Crafter, a modality-consistent alignment framework that explicitly mitigates the misalignment gap between PAN and MS modalities. At its core, Modality-Adaptive Reconstruction (MARs) enables a single network to jointly reconstruct HRMS and PAN images, leveraging PAN's high-frequency details as auxiliary self-supervision. Additionally, we introduce Cross-Modality Alignment-Aware Attention (CM3A), a novel mechanism that bidirectionally aligns MS texture to PAN structure and vice versa, enabling adaptive feature refinement across modalities. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our PAN-Crafter outperforms the most recent state-of-the-art method in all metrics, even with 50.11xfaster inference time and 0.63xthe memory size.

As most datasets have been seen by the CLIP model, the resultant setting can be termed as partially transductive. To solve this, we propose a pipeline that uses an unlearning technique to obtain true inductive baselines. In this new inductive setting, methods show a significant drop in performance (-55% on average among 13 baselines with multiple datasets). We validate the unlearning technique using oracle baselines. An improved few-shot classification technique is proposed that consistently obtains state-of-the-art performance over 13 other recent baseline methods on a comprehensive analysis with 5880 experiments - varying the datasets, differing number of few-shot examples, unlearning setting, and with different seeds.

Specifically, 1) the embeddings derived from commonly used foundation models exhibit discrepancies with the optimal embeddings required for feature matching; 2) lacking an effective mechanism to leverage the single-image understanding ability into cross-image understanding. A significant consequence of the misalignment is they struggle when addressing multi-instance feature matching problems. To address this, we introduce a simple but effective framework, called IMD (Image feature Matching with a pre-trained Diffusion model) with two parts: 1) Unlike the dominant solutions employing contrastive-learning based foundation models that emphasize global semantics, we integrate the generative-based diffusion models to effectively capture instance-level details. 2) We leverage the prompt mechanism in generative model as a natural tunnel, propose a novel cross-image interaction prompting module to facilitate bidirectional information interaction between image pairs. To more accurately measure the misalignment, we propose a new benchmark called IMIM, which focuses on multi-instance scenarios. Our proposed IMD establishes a new state-of-the-art in commonly evaluated benchmarks, and the superior improvement 12% in IMIM indicates our method efficiently mitigates the misalignment",

    "abstract": "Anticipating and recognizing surgical workflows are critical for intelligent surgical assistance systems. However, existing methods rely on deterministic decision-making, struggling to generalize across the large anatomical and procedural variations inherent in real-world surgeries. In this paper, we introduce an innovative framework that incorporates stochastic modeling through a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) into conventional deterministic learning for surgical workflow analysis. At the heart of our approach is a collaborative co-training paradigm: the DDPM branch captures procedural uncertainties to enrich feature representations, while the task branch focuses on predicting surgical phases and instrument usage. Theoretically, we demonstrate that this mutual refinement mechanism benefits both branches: the DDPM reduces prediction errors in uncertain scenarios, and the task branch directs the DDPM toward clinically meaningful representations. Notably, the DDPM branch is discarded during inference, enabling real-time predictions without sacrificing accuracy. Experiments on the Cholec80 dataset show that for the anticipation task, our method achieves a 16% reduction in eMAE compared to state-of-the-art approaches, and for phase recognition, it improves the Jaccard score by 1.0%. Additionally, on the AutoLaparo dataset, our method achieves a 1.5% improvement in the Jaccard score for phase recognition, while also exhibiting robust generalization to patient-specific variations.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a novel benchmark, GSOT3D, that aims at facilitating development of generic 3D single object tracking (SOT) in the wild. Specifically, GSOT3D offers 620 sequences with 123K frames, and covers a wide selection of 54 object categories. Each sequence is offered with multiple modalities, including the point cloud (PC), RGB image, and depth. This allows GSOT3D to support various 3D tracking tasks, such as single-modal 3D SOT on PC and multi-modal 3D SOT on RGB-PC or RGB-D, and thus greatly broadens research directions for 3D object tracking. To provide high-quality per-frame 3D annotations, all sequences are labeled manually with multiple rounds of meticulous inspection and refinement. To our best knowledge, GSOT3D is the largest benchmark dedicated to various generic 3D object tracking tasks. To understand how existing 3D trackers perform and to provide comparisons for future research on GSOT3D, we assess eight representative point cloud-based tracking models. Our evaluation results exhibit that these models heavily degrade on GSOT3D, and more efforts are required for robust and generic 3D object tracking. Besides, to encourage future research, we present a simple yet effective generic 3D tracker, named PROT3D, that localizes the target object via a progressive spatial-temporal network and outperforms all current solutions by a large margin. By releasing GSOT3D, we expect to advance further 3D tracking in future research and applications.

UnZipLoRA ensures that the resulting LoRAs are compatible, i.e., they can be seamlessly combined using direct addition. UnZipLoRA enables independent manipulation and recontextualization of subject and style, including generating variations of each, applying the extracted style to new subjects, and recombining them to reconstruct the original image or create novel variations. To address the challenge of subject and style entanglement, UnZipLoRA employs a novel prompt separation technique, as well as column and block separation strategies to accurately preserve the characteristics of subject and style, and ensure compatibility between the learned LoRAs.

However, sensor synchronization challenges often compromise data availability, particularly in video settings where shortages can be temporal. Despite its importance, this area remains underexplored. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study on tracker performance with temporally incomplete multimodal data. Unsurprisingly, under such a circumstance, existing trackers exhibit significant performance degradation, as their rigid architectures lack the adaptability needed to effectively handle missing modalities.To address these limitations, we propose a flexible framework for robust multimodal tracking. We venture that a tracker should dynamically activate computational units based on missing data rates. This is achieved through a novel Heterogeneous Mixture-of-Experts fusion mechanism with adaptive complexity, coupled with a video-level masking strategy that ensures both temporal consistency and spatial completeness -- critical for effective video tracking. Surprisingly, our model not only adapts to varying missing rates but also adjusts to scene complexity. Extensive experiments show that our model achieves SOTA performance across 9 benchmarks, excelling in both conventional complete and missing modality settings.

    "abstract": "Large vision-language models such as CLIP have made significant strides in zero-shot anomaly detection through prompt engineering. However, most existing methods typically process each test image individually, ignoring the practical rarity of abnormal patches in real-world scenarios. Although some batch-based approaches exploit the rarity by processing multiple samples concurrently, they generally introduce unacceptable latency for real-time applications. To mitigate these limitations, we propose RareCLIP, a novel online zero-shot anomaly detection framework that enables sequential image processing in real-time without requiring prior knowledge of the target domain. RareCLIP capitalizes on the zero-shot capabilities of CLIP and integrates a dynamic test-time rarity estimation mechanism. A key innovation of our framework is the introduction of a prototype patch feature memory bank, which aggregates representative features from historical observations and continuously updates their corresponding rarity measures. For each incoming image patch, RareCLIP computes a rarity score by aggregating the rarity measures of its nearest neighbors within the memory bank. Moreover, we introduce a prototype sampling strategy based on dissimilarity to enhance computational efficiency, as well as a similarity calibration strategy to enhance the robustness of rarity estimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RareCLIP attains state-of-the-art performance with 98.2% image-level AUROC on MVTec AD and 94.4% on VisA, while achieving a latency of 59.4 ms.

However, fine-tuning VFM to parse various adverse scenes (e.g., fog, snow, night) is particularly challenging, as these samples are difficult to collect. Using easy-to-acquire clear scenes as the source domain is a feasible solution, but a huge domain gap exists between clear and adverse scenes due to their dramatically different appearances. To address this challenge, this paper proposes AdaDCP, a VFM adapter with discrete cosine prior. The innovation originates from the observation that, the frequency components from a VFM exhibit either variant or invariant properties on adverse weather conditions after discrete cosine transform. Technically, the weather-invariant property learning preceives most of the scene content that is invariant to the adverse condition. The weather-variant property learning, in contrast, perceives the weather-specific information from different types of adverse conditions. Finally, the weather-invariant property alignment implicitly enforces the weather-variant components to incorporate the weather-invariant information, therefore mitigating the clear-to-adverse domain gap.

The pipeline consists of (i) a content-aware offset estimator that leverages content information for lightweight correlation volume encoding and decoding; (ii) a locally consistent match rectifier robust to large global initial errors; (iii) a locally consistent upsampler that yields fewer artifacts around depth-discontinuous edges.

Attention mechanisms in modern restoration transformers undermine this property, adversely impacting both training convergence and generalization. To alleviate this issue, we propose two key strategies for incorporating translation equivariance: slide indexing and component stacking. Slide indexing maintains operator responses at fixed positions, with sliding window attention being a notable example, while component stacking enables the arrangement of translation-equivariant operators in parallel or sequentially, thereby building complex architectures while preserving translation equivariance. However, these strategies still create a dilemma in model design between the high computational cost of self-attention and the fixed receptive field associated with sliding window attention. To address this, we develop an adaptive sliding indexing mechanism to efficiently select key-value pairs for each query, which are then concatenated in parallel with globally aggregated key-value pairs.

Training models for this purpose requires large amounts of labeled image data with precise pose and shape annotations. However, capturing such data requires the use of multi-view or marker-based motion-capture systems, which are impractical to adapt to wild animals in situ and impossible to scale across a comprehensive set of animal species. Some have attempted to address the challenge of procuring training data by pseudo-labeling individual real-world images through manual 2D annotation, followed by 3D-parameter optimization to those labels. While this approach may produce silhouette-aligned samples, the obtained pose and shape parameters are often implausible due to the ill-posed nature of the monocular fitting problem. Sidestepping real-world ambiguity, others have designed complex synthetic-data-generation pipelines leveraging game engines and collections of artist-designed 3D assets. Such engines yield perfect ground-truth labels but are often lacking in visual realism and require considerable manual effort to adapt to new species or environments.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) possess encompassing capabilities that can process diverse language-related tasks. However, finetuning on LLMs will diminish this general skills and continual finetuning will further cause severe degradation on accumulated knowledge. Recently, Continual Learning (CL) in Large Language Models (LLMs) arises which aims to continually adapt the LLMs to new tasks while maintaining previously learned knowledge and inheriting general skills. Existing techniques either leverage previous data to replay, leading to extra computational costs, or utilize a single parameter-efficient module to learn the downstream task, constraining new knowledge absorption with interference between different tasks. Toward these issues, this paper proposes Analytic Subspace Routing(Any-SSR) to address these challenges. For each task, we isolate the learning within a subspace of deep layers' features via low-rank adaptation, eliminating knowledge interference between different tasks. Additionally, we propose an analytic routing mechanism to properly utilize knowledge learned in different subspaces. Our approach employs Recursive Least Squares to train a multi-task router model, allowing the router to dynamically adapt to incoming data without requiring access to historical data. Also, the router effectively assigns the current task to an appropriate subspace and has a non-forgetting property of previously learned tasks with a solid theoretical guarantee.

With the RapVerse dataset, we investigate the extent to which scaling autoregressive multimodal transformers across language, audio, and motion can enhance the coherent and realistic generation of vocals and whole-body human motions. For modality unification, a vector-quantized variational autoencoder is employed to encode whole-body motion sequences into discrete motion tokens, while a vocal-to-unit model is leveraged to obtain quantized audio tokens preserving content, prosodic information and singer identity. By jointly performing transformer modeling on these three modalities in a unified way, our framework ensures a seamless and realistic blend of vocals and human motions.

While existing methods focus on detecting face retouching, how to accurately recover the original faces from the retouched ones has yet to be answered. This paper introduces Face Retouching Restoration (FRR), a novel computer vision task aimed at restoring original faces from their retouched counterparts. FRR differs from traditional image restoration tasks by addressing the complex retouching operations with various types and degrees, which focuses more on the restoration of the low-frequency information of the faces. To tackle this challenge, we propose MoFRR, Mixture of Diffusion Models for FRR. Inspired by DeepSeek's expert isolation strategy, the MoFRR uses sparse activation of specialized experts handling distinct retouching types and the engagement of a shared expert dealing with universal retouching traces. Each specialized expert follows a dual-branch structure with a DDIM-based low-frequency branch guided by an Iterative Distortion Evaluation Module (IDEM) and a Cross-Attention-based High-Frequency branch (HFCAM) for detail refinement. Extensive experiments on a newly constructed face retouching dataset, RetouchingFFHQ++, demonstrate the effectiveness of MoFRR for FRR",

    "title": "SFUOD: Source-Free Unknown Object Detection",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Source-free object detection adapts a detector pre-trained on a source domain to an unlabeled target domain without requiring access to labeled source data. While this setting is practical as it eliminates the need for the source dataset during domain adaptation, it operates under the restrictive assumption that only pre-defined objects from the source domain exist in the target domain. This closed-set setting prevents the detector from detecting undefined objects. To ease this assumption, we propose Source-Free Unknown Object Detection (SFUOD), a novel scenario which enables the detector to not only recognize known objects but also detect undefined objects as unknown objects. To this end, we propose CollaPAUL (Collaborative tuning and Principal Axis-based Unknown Labeling), a novel framework for SFUOD. Collaborative tuning enhances knowledge adaptation by integrating target-dependent knowledge from the auxiliary encoder with source-dependent knowledge from the pre-trained detector through a cross-domain attention mechanism. Additionally, principal axis-based unknown labeling assigns pseudo-labels to unknown objects by estimating objectness via principal axes projection and confidence scores from model predictions. The proposed CollaPAUL achieves state-of-the-art performances on SFUOD benchmarks, and extensive experiments validate its effectiveness. The code will be released after the review",

    "title": "UniEgoMotion: A Unified Model for Egocentric Motion Reconstruction, Forecasting, and Generation",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Egocentric human motion generation and forecasting with scene-context is crucial for enhancing AR/VR experiences, improving human-robot interaction, advancing assistive technologies, and enabling adaptive healthcare solutions by accurately predicting and simulating movement from a first-person perspective. However, existing methods primarily focus on third-person motion synthesis with structured 3D scene contexts, limiting their effectiveness in real-world egocentric settings where limited field of view, frequent occlusions, and dynamic cameras hinder scene perception. To bridge this gap, we introduce Egocentric Motion Generation and Egocentric Motion Forecasting, two novel tasks that utilize first-person images for scene-aware motion synthesis without relying on explicit 3D scene. We propose UniEgoMotion, a unified conditional motion diffusion model with a novel head-centric motion representation tailored for egocentric devices. UniEgoMotion's simple yet effective design supports egocentric motion reconstruction, forecasting, and generation from first-person visual inputs in a unified framework. Unlike previous works that overlook scene semantics, our model effectively extracts image-based scene context to infer plausible 3D motion. To facilitate training, we introduce EE4D-Motion, a large-scale dataset derived from EgoExo4D, augmented with pseudo-ground-truth 3D motion annotations. UniEgoMotion achieves state-of-the-art performance in egocentric motion reconstruction and is the first to generate motion from a single egocentric image. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our unified framework, setting a new benchmark for egocentric motion modeling and unlocking new possibilities for egocentric applications",
