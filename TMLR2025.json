    "abstract": "Despite the strong capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to acquire knowledge from their training corpora, the memorization of sensitive information in the corpora such as copyrighted, biased, and private content has led to ethical and legal concerns. In response to these challenges, unlearning has emerged as a potential remedy for LLMs affected by problematic training data. However, previous unlearning techniques are either not applicable to black-box LLMs due to required access to model internal weights, or violate data protection principles by retaining sensitive data for inference-time correction. We propose $\\delta$-unlearning, an offset unlearning framework for black-box LLMs. Instead of tuning the black-box LLM itself, $\\delta$-unlearning learns the logit offset needed for unlearning by contrasting the logits from a pair of smaller models. Experiments demonstrate that $\\delta$-unlearning can effectively unlearn target data while maintaining similar or even stronger performance on general out-of-forget-scope tasks. $\\delta$-unlearning also effectively incorporates different unlearning algorithms, making our approach a versatile solution to adapting various existing unlearning algorithms to black-box LLMs",

    "title": "Rethinking MUSHRA: Addressing Modern Challenges in Text-to-Speech Evaluation",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Despite rapid advancements in TTS models, a consistent and robust human evaluation framework is still lacking. For example, MOS tests fail to differentiate between similar models, and CMOS's pairwise comparisons are time-intensive. The MUSHRA test is a promising alternative for evaluating multiple TTS systems simultaneously, but in this work we show that its reliance on matching human reference speech unduly penalises the scores of modern TTS systems that can exceed human speech quality. More specifically, we conduct a comprehensive assessment of the MUSHRA test, focusing on its sensitivity to factors such as rater variability, listener fatigue, and reference bias. Based on our extensive evaluation involving 492 human listeners across Hindi and Tamil we identify two primary shortcomings: (i) reference-matching bias, where raters are unduly influenced by the human reference, and (ii) judgement ambiguity, arising from a lack of clear fine-grained guidelines. To address these issues, we propose two refined variants of the MUSHRA test. The first variant enables fairer ratings for synthesized samples that surpass human reference quality. The second variant reduces ambiguity, as indicated by the relatively lower variance across raters. By combining these approaches, we achieve both more reliable and more fine-grained assessments. We also release MANGO, a massive dataset of 246,000 human ratings, the first-of-its-kind collection for Indian languages, aiding in analyzing human preferences and developing automatic metrics for evaluating TTS systems",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have been observed to perform well on a wide range of downstream tasks when fine-tuned on domain-specific data. However, such data may not be readily available in many applications, motivating zero-shot or few-shot approaches using existing domain or task adjacent (fine-tuned) models, which we call DAFT. While several fine-tuned models for various tasks are available, finding one appropriate DAFT model for a given task is often not straight forward. In this paper, we explore different utilization techniques of these existing DAFT models for data-scarce problems, i.e., tasks for which data is not available or limited. We observe that for zero-shot problems, ensembling of DAFT models provides an accuracy performance close to that of the single best model. With few-shot problems (few data from target domain available), this performance can be improved further by picking or putting more weights to the DAFT models that are expected to perform better on the target task",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Aligning large-scale commercial models with user intent is crucial to preventing harmful outputs. Current methods rely on human supervision but become impractical as model complexity increases. When models surpass human knowledge, providing accurate feedback becomes challenging and inefficient. A novel solution proposed recently is using a weaker model to supervise a stronger model. This concept leverages the ability of weaker models to perform evaluations, thereby reducing the workload on human supervisors. Previous work has shown the effectiveness of weak-to-strong generalization in the context of language-only models. Extending this concept to vision-language models leverages these insights, adapting the proven benefits to a multi-modal context. In our study, we explore weak-to-strong generalization for CLIP-based classification. We propose a method, \\emph{class prototype learning} (CPL), which aims to enhance the classification capabilities of the CLIP model, by learning more representative prototypes for each category. Our findings indicate that, despite using a simple loss function under weak supervision, CPL yields robust improvements in targeted scenarios, particularly when pretraining is limited. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach is effective under these settings, achieving a 3.67\\% improvement over strong baseline methods",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Despite dropout's ubiquity in machine learning, its effectiveness as a form of data augmentation remains under-explored. We address two key questions: (i) When is dropout effective as an augmentation strategy? (ii) Is dropout uniquely effective under these conditions? To explore these questions, we propose Deep Augmentation, a network- and modality-agnostic method that applies dropout or PCA transformations to targeted layers in neural networks. Through extensive experiments on contrastive learning tasks in NLP, computer vision, and graph learning, we find that uniformly applying dropout across layers does not consistently improve performance. Instead, dropout proves most beneficial in deeper layers and can be matched by alternative augmentations (e.g., PCA). We also show that a stop-gradient operation is critical for ensuring dropout functions effectively as an augmentation, and that performance trends invert when moving from contrastive tasks to supervised tasks. Our analysis suggests that Deep Augmentation helps mitigate inter-layer co-adaptation---a notable issue in self-supervised learning due to the absence of labeled data. Drawing on these insights, we outline a procedure for selecting the optimal augmentation layer and demonstrate that Deep Augmentation can outperform traditional input-level augmentations. This simple yet powerful approach can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of architectures and modalities, yielding notable gains in both performance and generalization",

To this end, we try to bridge this gap and thoroughly evaluate the theoretical properties and practical performance of 24 deterministic and probabilistic company fundamentals forecasting models on real company data. We observe that deep learning models provide superior forecasting performance to classical models, in particular when considering uncertainty estimation. To validate the findings, we compare them to human analyst expectations and find that their accuracy is comparable to the automatic forecasts. We further show how these high-quality forecasts can benefit automated stock allocation.

    "title": "Studying Exploration in RL: An Optimal Transport Analysis of Occupancy Measure Trajectories",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The rising successes of RL are propelled by combining smart algorithmic strategies and deep architectures to optimize the distribution of returns and visitations over the state-action space. A quantitative framework to compare the learning processes of these eclectic RL algorithms is currently absent but desired in practice. We address this gap by representing the learning process of an RL algorithm as a sequence of policies generated during training, and then studying the policy trajectory induced in the manifold of state-action occupancy measures. Using an optimal transport-based metric, we measure the length of the paths induced by the policy sequence yielded by an RL algorithm between an initial policy and a final optimal policy. Hence, we first define the Effort of Sequential Learning (ESL). ESL quantifies the relative distance that an RL algorithm travels compared to the shortest path from the initial to the optimal policy. Furthermore, we connect the dynamics of policies in the occupancy measure space and regret (another metric to understand the suboptimality of an RL algorithm), by defining the Optimal Movement Ratio (OMR). OMR assesses the fraction of movements in the occupancy measure space that effectively reduce an analogue of regret. Finally, we derive approximation guarantees to estimate ESL and OMR with a finite number of samples and without access to an optimal policy. Through empirical analyses across various environments and algorithms, we demonstrate that ESL and OMR provide insights into the exploration processes of RL algorithms and the hardness of different tasks in discrete and continuous MDPs",

    "title": "LASP: Linear Attention Sequence Parallelism",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Sequence parallelism (SP) serves as a prevalent strategy to handle long sequences that exceed the memory limit of a single device. However, for linear sequence modeling methods like linear attention, existing SP approaches do not take advantage of their right-product-first feature, resulting in sub-optimal communication efficiency and usability. In this paper, we introduce Linear Attention Sequence Parallelism (LASP), an efficient SP approach designed for linear attention-based transformer models. Specifically, we design an efficient point-to-point ring-style communication mechanism to leverage the right-product kernel trick of linear attention, which sharply decreases the communication overhead, comparing with existing SP methods. We enhance the computation efficiency of LASP by performing kernel fusion and intermediate state caching, making the implementation of LASP hardware-friendly on GPUs. Furthermore, we meticulously ensure the compatibility of sequence-level LASP with all types of batch-level data parallel methods, which is vital for distributed training on large clusters with very-long sequences. We also discuss the generalization of LASP on other linear sequence modeling methods. Extensive experiments on linear attention-based models are conducted with varying sequence lengths from 2K to 4096K. LASP scales sequence length up to 4096K on 128 GPUs, which is 8$\\times$ longer than existing SP methods. Code is available at: \\url{https://github.com/OpenNLPLab/LASP}",

    "title": "MOORL: A Framework for Integrating Offline-Online Reinforcement Learning",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Sample efficiency and exploration remain critical challenges in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), particularly in complex domains. Offline RL, which enables agents to learn optimal policies from static, pre-collected datasets, has emerged as a promising alternative. However, offline RL is constrained by issues such as out-of-distribution (OOD) actions that limit policy performance and generalization. To overcome these limitations, we propose Meta Offline-Online Reinforcement Learning (MOORL), a hybrid framework that unifies offline and online RL for efficient and scalable learning. While previous hybrid methods rely on extensive design choices and added complexity to utilize offline data effectively, MOORL introduces a meta-policy that seamlessly adapts across offline and online trajectories. This enables the agent to leverage offline data for robust initialization while utilizing online interactions to drive efficient exploration. Importantly, MOORL addresses the key challenges of hybrid RL in terms of being design-free. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that the hybrid approach enhances exploration by effectively combining the complementary strengths of offline and online data. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MOORL learns a stable Q-function without relying on extensive design choices. Extensive experiments on 28 tasks from the D4RL and V-D4RL benchmarks validate its effectiveness, showing consistent improvements over state-of-the-art offline and hybrid RL baselines. With minimal computational overhead, MOORL achieves strong performance, underscoring its potential for practical applications in real-world scenarios",

    "title": "How far away are truly hyperparameter-free learning algorithms?",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Despite major advances in methodology, hyperparameter tuning remains a crucial (and expensive) part of the development of machine learning systems. Even ignoring architectural choices, deep neural networks have a large number of optimization and regularization hyperparameters that need to be tuned carefully per workload in order to obtain the best results. In a perfect world, training algorithms would not require workload-specific hyperparameter tuning, but would instead have default settings that performed well across many workloads. Recently, there has been a growing literature on optimization methods which attempt to reduce the number of hyperparameters---particularly the learning rate and its accompanying schedule. Given these developments, how far away is the dream of neural network training algorithms that completely obviate the need for painful tuning? In this paper, we evaluate the potential of learning-rate-free methods as components of hyperparameter-free methods. We freeze their (non-learning rate) hyperparameters to default values, and score their performance using the recently-proposed AlgoPerf: Training Algorithms benchmark. We found that literature-supplied default settings performed poorly on the benchmark, so we performed a search for hyperparameter configurations that performed well across all workloads simultaneously. The best \"algoperf-calibrated\" learning-rate-free methods had much improved performance but still lagged slightly behind a similarly calibrated NadamW baseline in overall benchmark score. Our results suggest that there is still much room for improvement for learning-rate-free methods, and that testing against a strong, workload-agnostic baseline is important to improve hyperparameter reduction techniques",

    "abstract": "Most prior work on the convergence of gradient descent (GD) for overparameterized neural networks relies on strong assumptions on the step size (infinitesimal), the hidden-layer width (infinite), or the initialization (large, spectral, balanced). Recent efforts to relax these assumptions focus on two-layer linear networks trained with the squared loss. In this work, we derive a linear convergence rate for training two-layer linear neural networks with GD for general losses and under relaxed assumptions on the step size, width, and initialization. A key challenge in deriving this result is that classical ingredients for deriving convergence rates for nonconvex problems, such as the Polyak-Łojasiewicz (PL) condition and Descent Lemma, do not hold globally for overparameterized neural networks. Here, we prove that these two conditions hold locally with local constants that depend on the weights. Then, we provide bounds on these local constants, which depend on the initialization of the weights, the current loss, and the global PL and smoothness constants of the non-overparameterized model. Based on these bounds, we derive a linear convergence rate for GD. Our convergence analysis not only improves upon prior results but also suggests a better choice for the step size, as verified through our numerical experiments",

Feature extractor stacking (FES) is a state-of-the-art CDFSL method that maintains a collection of source domain feature extractors instead of a single universal extractor. FES uses stacked generalisation to build an ensemble from extractor snapshots saved during target domain fine-tuning. It outperforms several contemporary universal model-based CDFSL methods in the Meta-Dataset benchmark. However, it incurs higher storage cost because it saves a snapshot for every fine-tuning iteration for every extractor. In this work, we propose a bidirectional snapshot selection strategy for FES, leveraging its cross-validation process and the ordered nature of its snapshots, and demonstrate that a 95% snapshot reduction can be achieved while retaining the same level of accuracy",

In addition, we also successfully replaced the set of structural encodings previously used in the discrete graph diffusion model with a single random-walk-based encoding, providing a simple and principled way to boost the model's expressive power. Empirically, we show that integrating continuous time leads to significant improvements across various metrics over state-of-the-art discrete-state diffusion models on a large set of molecular and non-molecular benchmark datasets.

    "abstract": "Label noise is ubiquitous in real-world datasets, posing significant challenges to machine learning models. While self-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms have empirically demonstrated effectiveness in learning noisy labels, the theoretical understanding of their effectiveness remains underexplored. In this paper, we present a theoretical framework to understand how SSL methods enhance learning with noisy labels, especially for the instance-dependent label noise. We reveal that the uniform and compact cluster structures induced by contrastive SSL play a crucial role in mitigating the adverse effects of label noise. Specifically, we theoretically show that a classifier trained on SSL-learned representations significantly outperforms one trained using traditional supervised learning methods. This results from two key merits of SSL representations over label noise: 1. Uniform Noise Distribution: Label noise becomes uniformly distributed over SSL representations with respect to the true class labels, rather than the noisy ones, leading to an easier learning task. 2. Enhanced Cluster Structure: SSL enhances the formation of well-separated and compact categorical clusters, increasing inter-class distances while tightening intra-class clusters. We further theoretically justify the benefits of training a classifier on such structured representations, demonstrating that it encourages the classifier trained on noisy data to be aligned with the optimal classifier. Extensive experiments validate the robustness of SSL representations in combating label noise, confirming the practical values of our theoretical findings",

The discrete nature of tabular medical code data in EHRs poses challenges for high-quality data generation, especially for continuous diffusion models. To this end, we introduce a novel tabular EHR generation method, EHR-D3PM, which enables both unconditional and conditional generation using the discrete diffusion model. Our experiments demonstrate that EHR-D3PM significantly outperforms existing generative baselines on comprehensive fidelity and utility metrics while maintaining less attribute and membership vulnerability risks.

    "abstract": "Learning useful representations for continuous-time dynamic graphs (CTDGs) is challenging, due to the concurrent need to span long node interaction histories and grasp nuanced temporal details. In particular, two problems emerge: (1) Encoding longer histories requires more computational resources, making it crucial for CTDG models to maintain low computational complexity to ensure efficiency; (2) Meanwhile, more powerful models are needed to identify and select the most critical temporal information within the extended context provided by longer histories. To address these problems, we propose a CTDG representation learning model named DyGMamba, originating from the popular Mamba state space model (SSM). DyGMamba first leverages a node-level SSM to encode the sequence of historical node interactions. Another time-level SSM is then employed to exploit the temporal patterns hidden in the historical graph, where its output is used to dynamically select the critical information from the interaction history. We validate DyGMamba experimentally on the dynamic link prediction task. The results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art in most cases. DyGMamba also maintains high efficiency in terms of computational resources, making it possible to capture long temporal dependencies with a limited computation budget",

    "abstract": "Conducting experiments to estimate total effects can be challenging due to cost, ethical concerns, or practical limitations. As an alternative, researchers often rely on causal graphs to determine whether these effects can be identified from observational data. Identifying total effects in fully specified causal graphs has received considerable attention, with Pearl's front-door criterion enabling the identification of total effects in the presence of latent confounding even when no variable set is sufficient for adjustment. However, specifying a complete causal graph is challenging in many domains. Extending these identifiability results to partially specified graphs is crucial, particularly in dynamic systems where causal relationships evolve over time. This paper addresses the challenge of identifying total effects using a specific and well-known partially specified graph in dynamic systems called a summary causal graph, which does not specify the temporal lag between causal relations and can contain cycles. In particular, this paper presents sufficient graphical conditions for identifying total effects from observational data, even in the presence of cycles and latent confounding, and when no variable set is sufficient for adjustment",

    "abstract": "Causal approaches to post-hoc explainability for black-box prediction models (e.g., deep neural networks trained on image pixel data) have become increasingly popular. However, existing approaches have two important shortcomings: (i) the \"explanatory units\" are micro-level inputs into the relevant prediction model, e.g., image pixels, rather than interpretable macro-level features that are more useful for understanding how to possibly change the algorithm's behavior, and (ii) existing approaches assume there exists no unmeasured confounding between features and target model predictions, which fails to hold when the explanatory units are macro-level variables. Our focus is on the important setting where the analyst has no access to the inner workings of the target prediction algorithm, rather only the ability to query the output of the model in response to a particular input. To provide causal explanations in such a setting, we propose to learn causal graphical representations that allow for arbitrary unmeasured confounding among features. We demonstrate the resulting graph can differentiate between interpretable features that causally influence model predictions versus those that are merely associated with model predictions due to confounding. Our approach is motivated by a counterfactual theory of causal explanation wherein good explanations point to factors that are \"difference-makers\" in an interventionist sense",

    "title": "Investigating the Effects of Fairness Interventions Using Pointwise Representational Similarity",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) algorithms can often exhibit discriminatory behavior, negatively affecting certain populations across protected groups. To address this, numerous debiasing methods, and consequently evaluation measures, have been proposed. Current evaluation measures for debiasing methods suffer from two main limitations: (1) they primarily provide a global estimate of unfairness, failing to provide a more fine-grained analysis, and (2) they predominantly analyze the model output on a specific task, failing to generalize the findings to other tasks. In this work, we introduce Pointwise Normalized Kernel Alignment (PNKA), a pointwise representational similarity measure that addresses these limitations by measuring how debiasing measures affect the intermediate representations of individuals. On tabular data, the use of PNKA reveals previously unknown insights: while group fairness predominantly influences a small subset of the population, maintaining high representational similarity for the majority, individual fairness constraints uniformly impact representations across the entire population, altering nearly every data point. We show that by evaluating representations using PNKA, we can reliably predict the behavior of ML models trained on these representations. Moreover, applying PNKA to language embeddings shows that existing debiasing methods may not perform as intended, failing to remove biases from stereotypical words and sentences. Our findings suggest that current evaluation measures for debiasing methods are insufficient, highlighting the need for a deeper understanding of the effects of debiasing methods, and show how pointwise representational similarity metrics can help with fairness audits",

    "title": "Statistical Error Bounds for GANs with Nonlinear Objective Functionals",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are unsupervised learning methods for training a generator distribution to produce samples that approximate those drawn from a target distribution. Many such methods can be formulated as minimization of a metric or divergence between probability distributions. Recent works have derived statistical error bounds for GANs that are based on integral probability metrics (IPMs), e.g., WGAN which is based on the 1-Wasserstein metric. In general, IPMs are defined by optimizing a linear functional (difference of expectations) over a space of discriminators. A much larger class of GANs, which we here call $(f,\\Gamma)$-GANs, can be constructed using $f$-divergences (e.g., Jensen-Shannon, KL, or $\\alpha$-divergences) together with a regularizing discriminator space $\\Gamma$ (e.g., $1$-Lipschitz functions). These GANs have nonlinear objective functions, depending on the choice of $f$, and have been shown to exhibit improved performance in a number of applications. In this work we derive statistical error bounds for $(f,\\Gamma)$-GANs for general classes of $f$ and $\\Gamma$ in the form of finite-sample concentration inequalities. These results prove the statistical consistency of $(f,\\Gamma)$-GANs and reduce to the known results for IPM-GANs in the appropriate limit. Our results use novel Rademacher complexity bounds which provide new insight into the performance of IPM-GANs for distributions with unbounded support and have application to statistical learning tasks beyond GANs",

For any finite training set, this score function can be evaluated in closed form, but the resulting SGM memorizes its training data and does not generate novel samples. In practice, one approximates the score by training a neural network via score-matching. The error in this approximation promotes generalization, but neural SGMs are costly to train and sample, and the effective regularization this error provides is not well-understood theoretically. In this work, we instead explicitly smooth the closed-form score to obtain an SGM that generates novel samples without training. We analyze our model and propose an efficient nearest-neighbor-based estimator of its score function. Using this estimator, our method achieves competitive sampling times while running on consumer-grade CPUs",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We revisit the reduction of learning in adversarial Markov decision processes [MDPs] to adversarial learning based on $Q$--values; this reduction has been considered in a number of recent articles as one building block to perform policy optimization. Namely, we first consider and extend this reduction in an ideal setting where an oracle provides value functions: it may involve any adversarial learning strategy (not just exponential weights) and it may be based indifferently on $Q$--values or on advantage functions. We then present two extensions: on the one hand, convergence of the last iterate for a vast class of adversarial learning strategies (again, not just exponential weights), satisfying a property called monotonicity of weights; on the other hand, stronger regret criteria for learning in MDPs, inherited from the stronger regret criteria of adversarial learning called strongly adaptive regret and tracking regret. Third, we demonstrate how adversarial learning, also referred to as aggregation of experts, relates to aggregation (orchestration) of expert policies: we obtain stronger forms of performance guarantees in this setting than existing ones, via yet another, simple reduction. Finally, we discuss the impact of the reduction of learning in adversarial MDPs to adversarial learning in the practical scenarios where transition kernels are unknown and value functions must be learned. In particular, we review the literature and note that many strategies for policy optimization feature a policy-improvement step based on exponential weights with estimated $Q$--values. Our main message is that this step may be replaced by the application of any adversarial learning strategy on estimated $Q$--values or on estimated advantage functions. We leave the empirical evaluation of these twists for future research",

This allows the model to abstain from making predictions for samples with high uncertainty. We propose cost-based and coverage-based methods for classification with abstention in node classification settings using GNNs. We perform experiments using our method on standard citation network datasets Cora, CiteSeer, PubMed and ogbn-arxiv.

    "abstract": "Learning a world model for model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents can significantly improve the sample efficiency by learning policies in imagination. However, building a world model for Multi-Agent RL (MARL) can be particularly challenging due to the scalability issue across different number of agents in a centralized architecture, and also the non-stationarity issue in a decentralized architecture stemming from the inter-dependency among agents. To address both challenges, we propose a novel world model for MARL that learns decentralized local dynamics for scalability, combined with a centralized representation aggregation from all agents. We cast the dynamics learning as an auto-regressive sequence modeling problem over discrete tokens by leveraging the expressive Transformer architecture, in order to model complex local dynamics across different agents and provide accurate and consistent long-term imaginations. As the first pioneering Transformer-based world model for multi-agent systems, we introduce a Perceiver Transformer as an effective solution to enable centralized representation aggregation within this context.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "For a widely-studied data model and general loss and sample-hardening functions we prove that the losses of Supervised Contrastive Learning (SCL), Hard-SCL (HSCL), and Unsupervised Contrastive Learning (UCL) are minimized by representations that exhibit Neural-Collapse (NC), i.e., the class means form an Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) and data from the same class are mapped to the same representation. We also prove that for any representation mapping, the HSCL and Hard-UCL (HUCL) losses are lower bounded by the corresponding SCL and UCL losses. In contrast to existing literature, our theoretical results for SCL do not require class-conditional independence of augmented views and work for a general loss function class that includes the widely used InfoNCE loss function. Moreover, our proofs are simpler, compact, and transparent. Similar to existing literature, our theoretical claims also hold for the practical scenario where batching is used for optimization. We empirically demonstrate, for the first time, that Adam optimization (with batching) of HSCL and HUCL losses with random initialization and suitable hardness levels can indeed converge to the NC-geometry if we incorporate unit-ball or unit-sphere feature normalization. Without incorporating hard-negatives or feature normalization, however, the representations learned via Adam suffer from Dimensional-Collapse (DC) and fail to attain the NC-geometry. These results exemplify the role of hard-negative sampling in contrastive representation learning and we conclude with several open theoretical problems for future work.

    "abstract": "\\textbf{AI agents} plan and execute interactions in open-ended environments. For example, OpenAI's Operator can use a web browser to do product comparisons and buy online goods. To facilitate beneficial interactions and mitigate harmful ones, much research focuses on directly modifying agent behaviour. For example, developers can train agents to follow user instructions. This focus on direct modifications is useful, but insufficient. We will also need external protocols and systems that shape how agents interact with institutions and other actors. For instance, agents will need more efficient protocols to communicate with each other and form agreements. In addition, attributing an agent's actions to a particular human or other legal entity can help to establish trust, and also disincentivize misuse. Given this motivation, we propose the concept of \\textbf{agent infrastructure}: technical systems and shared protocols external to agents that are designed to mediate and influence their interactions with and impacts on their environments. Just as the Internet relies on protocols like HTTPS, our work argues that agent infrastructure will be similarly indispensable to ecosystems of agents. We identify three functions for agent infrastructure: 1) attributing actions, properties, and other information to specific agents, their users, or other actors; 2) shaping agents' interactions; and 3) detecting and remedying harmful actions from agents. We provide an incomplete catalog of research directions for such functions. For each direction, we include analysis of use cases, infrastructure adoption, relationships to existing (internet) infrastructure, limitations, and open questions. Making progress on agent infrastructure can prepare society for the adoption of more advanced agents",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Group equivariance is a strong inductive bias useful in a wide range of deep learning tasks. However, constructing efficient equivariant networks for general groups and domains is difficult. Recent work by Finzi et al. directly solves the equivariance constraint for arbitrary matrix groups to obtain equivariant MLPs (EMLPs). But this method does not scale well and scaling is crucial in deep learning. Here, we introduce Group Representation Networks (G-RepsNets), a lightweight equivariant network for arbitrary matrix groups with features represented using tensor polynomials. The key insight in our design is that using tensor representations in the hidden layers of a neural network along with simple inexpensive tensor operations leads to scalable equivariant networks. Further, these networks are universal approximators of functions equivariant to orthogonal groups. We find G-RepsNet to be competitive to EMLP on several tasks with group symmetries such as $O(5)$, $O(1, 3)$, and $O(3)$ with scalars, vectors, and second-order tensors as data types. On image classification tasks, we find that G-RepsNet using second-order representations is competitive and often even outperforms sophisticated state-of-the-art equivariant models such as GCNNs and $E(2)$-CNNs. To further illustrate the generality of our approach, we show that G-RepsNet is competitive to G-FNO and EGNN on N-body predictions and solving PDEs respectively, while being efficient",

Our approach, FedPFT (FL with Parametric Feature Transfer), involves clients learning and transferring parametric models for features extracted from frozen foundation models in a single round. Parametric models are then used to generate synthetic features at the server to train a classifier head. We evaluate FedPFT across eight vision datasets using three vision foundation models. Our findings demonstrate that FedPFT is agnostic to data heterogeneity and network topology and it enhances the communication-accuracy frontier up to 7.8\\%.

    "abstract": "Structural topology optimization plays a crucial role in engineering by determining the optimal material layout within a design space to maximize performance under given constraints. We introduce Neural Implicit Topology Optimization (NITO), a deep learning regression approach to accelerate topology optimization tasks. We demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art diffusion models, NITO generates structures that are under 15% as structurally sub-optimal and does so ten times faster. Furthermore, we show that NITO is entirely resolution-free and domain-agnostic, offering a more scalable solution than the current fixed-resolution and domain-specific diffusion models. To achieve this state-of-the-art performance, NITO combines three key innovations. First, we introduce the Boundary Point Order-Invariant MLP (BPOM), which represents loads and supports in a sparse and domain-agnostic manner, allowing NITO to train on variable conditioning, domain shapes, and mesh resolutions. Second, we adopt a neural implicit field representation, which allows NITO to synthesize topologies of any shape or resolution. Finally, we propose an inference-time refinement step using a few steps of gradient-based optimization to enable NITO to achieve results comparable to direct optimization methods. These three innovations empower NITO with a precision and versatility that is currently unparalleled among competing deep learning approaches for topology optimization.

To alleviate the issue of distribution shift arising due to the small amount of expert data, recent works incorporate large numbers of auxiliary demonstrations alongside the expert data. However, the performance of these approaches rely on assumptions about the quality and composition of the auxiliary data, and they are rarely successful when those assumptions do not hold. To address this limitation, we propose Robust Offline Imitation from Diverse Auxiliary Data (ROIDA). ROIDA first identifies high-quality transitions from the entire auxiliary dataset using a learned reward function. These high-reward samples are combined with the expert demonstrations for weighted behavioral cloning. For lower-quality samples, ROIDA applies temporal difference learning to steer the policy towards high-reward states, improving long-term returns. This two-pronged approach enables our framework to effectively leverage both high and low-quality data without any assumptions. Extensive experiments validate that ROIDA achieves robust and consistent performance across multiple auxiliary datasets with diverse ratios of expert and non-expert demonstrations. ROIDA effectively leverages unlabeled auxiliary data, outperforming prior methods reliant on specific data assumptions",

    "title": "Noise-free Loss Gradients: A Surprisingly Effective Baseline for Coreset Selection",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The exponential rise in size and complexity of deep learning models and datasets have resulted in a considerable demand for computational resources. Coreset selection is one of the methods to alleviate this rising demand. The goal is to select a subset from a large dataset to train a model that performs almost at par with the one trained on the large dataset while reducing computational time and resource requirements. Existing approaches either attempt to identify remarkable samples (e.g., Forgetting, Adversarial Deepfool, EL2N, etc.) that stand out from the rest or solve complex optimization (e.g., submodular maximization, OMP) problems to compose the coresets. This paper proposes a novel and intuitive approach to efficiently select a coreset based on the similarity of loss gradients. Our method works on the hypothesis that gradients of samples belonging to a given class will point in similar directions during the early training phase. Samples with most neighbours that produce similar gradient directions, in other words, that produce noise-free gradients, will represent that class. Through extensive experimentation, we have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach in out-performing state-of-the-art coreset selection algorithms on a range of benchmark datasets from CIFAR-10 to ImageNet with architectures of varied complexity (ResNet-18, ResNet-50, VGG-16, ViT).We have also demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach in Generative Modelling by implementing coreset selection to reduce training time for various GAN models (DCGAN, MSGAN, SAGAN, SNGAN) for different datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Tiny ImageNet) while not impacting the performance metrics significantly.

    "abstract": "Preferential Bayesian optimization (PBO) is a framework for optimizing a decision-maker's latent preferences over available design choices. While real-world problems often involve multiple conflicting objectives, existing PBO methods assume that preferences can be encoded by a single objective function. For instance, in the customization of robotic assistive devices, technicians aim to maximize user comfort while minimizing energy consumption to extend battery life. Likewise, in autonomous driving policy design, stakeholders must evaluate safety and performance trade-offs before committing to a policy. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first framework for PBO with multiple objectives. Within this framework, we propose dueling scalarized Thompson sampling (DSTS), a multi-objective generalization of the popular dueling Thompson sampling algorithm, which may also be of independent interest beyond our setting. We evaluate DSTS across four synthetic test functions and two simulated tasks—exoskeleton personalization and driving policy design—demonstrating that it outperforms several benchmarks. Finally, we prove that DSTS is asymptotically consistent. Along the way, we provide, to our knowledge, the first convergence guarantee for dueling Thompson sampling in single-objective PBO",

Motivated by AdamW, we propose a novel framework for Adam-family methods with decoupled weight decay. Within our framework, the estimators for the first-order and second-order moments of stochastic subgradients are updated independently of the weight decay term. Under mild assumptions and with non-diminishing stepsizes for updating the primary optimization variables, we establish the convergence properties of our proposed framework. In addition, we show that our proposed framework encompasses a wide variety of well-known Adam-family methods, hence offering convergence guarantees for these methods in the training of nonsmooth neural networks. More importantly, compared to the existing results on the choices of the parameters for the moment terms in Adam, we show that our proposed framework provides more flexibility for these parameters. As a practical application of our proposed framework, we propose a novel Adam-family method named Adam with Decoupled Weight Decay (AdamD), and establish its convergence properties under mild conditions.

Well-established methods for optimizing such measurements include principal component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA) and compressed sensing (CS) based on random projections, all of which rely on axis- or subspace-aligned statistical characterization of the signal source. However, many naturally occurring signals, including photographic images, contain richer statistical structure. To exploit such structure, we introduce a general method for obtaining an optimized set of linear measurements for efficient image reconstruction, where the signal statistics are expressed by the prior implicit in a neural network trained to perform denoising (known as a ``diffusion model''). We demonstrate that the optimal measurements derived for two natural image datasets differ from those of PCA, ICA, or CS, and result in substantially lower mean squared reconstruction error. Interestingly, the marginal distributions of the measurement values are asymmetrical (skewed), substantially more so than those of previous methods. We also find that optimizing with respect to perceptual loss, as quantified by structural similarity (SSIM), leads to measurements different from those obtained when optimizing for MSE. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating the specific statistical regularities of natural signals when designing effective linear measurements",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Predicting simple function classes has been widely used as a testbed for developing theory and understanding of the trained Transformer's in-context learning (ICL) ability. In this paper, we revisit the training of Transformers on linear regression tasks, and different from all the existing literature, we consider a bi-objective prediction task of predicting both the conditional expectation $\\mathbb{E}[Y|X]$ and the conditional variance Var$(Y|X)$. This additional uncertainty quantification objective provides a handle to (i) better design out-of-distribution experiments to distinguish ICL from in-weight learning (IWL) and (ii) make a better separation between the algorithms with and without using the prior information of the training distribution. Theoretically, we show that the trained Transformer reaches near Bayes optimum, suggesting the usage of the information of the training distribution. Our method can be extended to other cases. Specifically, with the Transformer's context window $S$, we prove a generalization bound of $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{\\min\\{S, T\\}/(n T)})$ on $n$ tasks with sequences of length $T$, providing sharper analysis compared to previous results of $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{1/n})$. Empirically, we illustrate that while the trained Transformer behaves as the Bayes-optimal solution as a natural consequence of supervised training in distribution, it does not necessarily perform a Bayesian inference when facing task shifts, in contrast to the \\textit{equivalence} between these two proposed in many existing literature. We also demonstrate the trained Transformer's ICL ability over covariate shift and prompt-length shift and interpret them as a generalization over a meta distribution",

Recently, MuZero-style algorithms, leveraging the value equivalence principle and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), have achieved superhuman performance in various domains. However, these methods struggle to scale in heterogeneous scenarios with diverse dependencies and task variability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce UniZero, a novel approach that employs a transformer-based world model to effectively learn a shared latent space. By concurrently predicting latent dynamics and decision-oriented quantities conditioned on the learned latent history, UniZero enables joint optimization of the long-horizon world model and policy, facilitating broader and more efficient planning in the latent space. We show that UniZero significantly outperforms existing baselines in benchmarks that require long-term memory. Additionally, UniZero demonstrates superior scalability in multitask learning experiments conducted on Atari benchmarks. In standard single-task RL settings, such as Atari and DMControl, UniZero matches or even surpasses the performance of current state-of-the-art methods. Finally, extensive ablation studies and visual analyses validate the effectiveness and scalability of UniZero's design choices.

Building on this success, efforts have been made to adapt these image-based visual-language models, such as CLIP, for videos extending their zero-shot capabilities to the video domain. While these adaptations have shown promising results, they come at a significant computational cost and struggle with effectively modeling the temporal aspects inherent to the video domain. In this study, we present Efficient Zero-Shot Action Recognition with Temporal Token Learning(T2L), a simple and efficient adaptation of CLIP that addresses these challenges. T2L leverages Temporal Token Learning (TTL) for seamless temporal adaptation, requiring no fundamental changes to the core CLIP architecture while preserving its remarkable generalization abilities. TTL relies on temporal feature diversity (TFD), a novel learning objective, which guides TTL to focus on capturing motion, thereby enhancing its learning capabilities from videos. We perform extensive experiments on nine different benchmark datasets, thoroughly evaluating T2L for zero-shot learning and base-to-novel video action recognition, and also demonstrating its potential for few-shot generalization. Impressively, with merely 5.2 million learnable parameters, T2L can be efficiently trained on a single GPU (with 25x less learnable parameters, 3x reduction in GFLOPs, and 4x improvement in throughput when compared with prior best model), outperforming existing approaches in several evaluations",

In domains such as autonomous driving, developing highly accurate predictions for object motions is essential. This paper addresses the key challenge of enabling fine-grained control over object motion in the context of driving video synthesis. To accomplish this, we 1) employ a distinct, specialized model to forecast the trajectories of object bounding boxes, 2) adapt and enhance a separate video diffusion network to create video content conditioned on these high-quality trajectory forecasts, and 3) we are able to exert precise control over object position/movements using bounding boxes in both 2D and 3D spaces.

The algorithm can be used for both probabilistic and deterministic multi-step forecasting, making it applicable for estimation and generation tasks. Evaluations against various baselines, including temporal graph neural network (TGNN) models and classical Kalman filters, demonstrate that mspace performs comparably to the state-of-the-art and even surpasses them on some datasets. Importantly, mspace demonstrates consistent performance across datasets with varying training sizes, a notable advantage over TGNN models that require abundant training samples to effectively learn the spatiotemporal trends in the data. Therefore, employing mspace is advantageous in scenarios where the training sample availability is limited. Additionally, we establish theoretical bounds on multi-step forecasting error of mspace and show that it scales linearly with the number of forecast steps $q$ as $\\mathcal{O}(q)$. For an asymptotically large number of nodes $n$, and timesteps $T$, the computational complexity of mspace grows linearly with both \\$n\\$ and \\$T\\$, i.e., $\\mathcal{O}(nT)$, while its space complexity remains constant $\\mathcal{O}(1)$. We compare the performance of various mspace variants against ten recent TGNN baselines and two classical baselines, ARIMA and the Kalman filter, across ten real-world datasets.

    "abstract": "In practical statistical causal discovery (SCD), embedding domain expert knowledge as constraints into the algorithm is important for reasonable causal models reflecting the broad knowledge of domain experts, despite the challenges in the systematic acquisition of background knowledge. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a novel method for causal inference, in which SCD and knowledge-based causal inference (KBCI) with a large language model (LLM) are synthesized through ``statistical causal prompting (SCP)'' for LLMs and prior knowledge augmentation for SCD. The experiments in this work have revealed that the results of LLM-KBCI and SCD augmented with LLM-KBCI approach the ground truths, more than the SCD result without prior knowledge. These experiments have also revealed that the SCD result can be further improved if the LLM undergoes SCP. Furthermore, with an unpublished real-world dataset, we have demonstrated that the background knowledge provided by the LLM can improve the SCD on this dataset, even if this dataset has never been included in the training data of the LLM. For future practical application of this proposed method across important domains such as healthcare, we also thoroughly discuss the limitations, risks of critical errors, expected improvement of techniques around LLMs, and realistic integration of expert checks of the results into this automatic process, with SCP simulations under various conditions both in successful and failure scenarios. The careful and appropriate application of the proposed approach in this work, with improvement and customization for each domain, can thus address challenges such as dataset biases and limitations, illustrating the potential of LLMs to improve data-driven causal inference across diverse scientific domains.

Current Test-Time Adaptation methods operate under closed-set assumptions or batch processing, differing from the real-world open-set scenarios.

    "abstract": "Grokking is an intriguing phenomenon of delayed generalization, where neural networks initially memorize training data with perfect accuracy but exhibit poor generalization, subsequently transitioning to a generalizing solution with continued training. While factors such as weight norms and sparsity have been proposed to explain this delayed generalization, the influence of network structure remains underexplored. In this work, we link the grokking phenomenon to the lottery ticket hypothesis to investigate the impact of internal network structures. We demonstrate that utilizing lottery tickets obtained during the generalizing phase (termed grokked tickets) significantly reduces delayed generalization across various tasks, including multiple modular arithmetic operations, polynomial regression, sparse parity, and MNIST classification. Through controlled experiments, we show that the mitigation of delayed generalization is not due solely to reduced weight norms or increased sparsity, but rather to the discovery of good subnetworks. Furthermore, we find that grokked tickets exhibit periodic weight patterns and undergo rapid structural changes that coincide with improvements in generalization. Additionally, pruning techniques like the edge-popup algorithm can identify these effective structures without modifying the weights, thereby transforming memorizing networks into generalizing ones. These results underscore the novel insight that structural exploration plays a pivotal role in understanding grokking",

In this paper, we propose Variational Potential (VAPO) Flow Bayes, a new energy-based generative framework that eliminates the need for implicit MCMC sampling and does not rely on auxiliary networks or cooperative training. VAPO learns an energy-parameterized potential flow by constructing a flow-driven density homotopy that is matched to the data distribution through a variational loss minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the flow-driven and marginal homotopies. This principled formulation enables robust and efficient generative modeling while preserving the interpretability of EBMs. Experimental results on image generation, interpolation, out-of-distribution detection, and compositional generation confirm the effectiveness of VAPO, showing that our method performs competitively with existing approaches in terms of sample quality and versatility across diverse generative modeling tasks",

This trifecta of human thought has remained elusive in modern intelligent machines. In this work, we investigate whether slot representations extracted from visual scenes serve as appropriate compositional abstractions for grounding and reasoning. We present the Neural Slot Interpreter (NSI), which learns to ground object semantics in slots. At the core of NSI is a nested schema that uses simple syntax rules to organize the object semantics of a scene into object-centric schema primitives. Then, the NSI metric learns to ground primitives into slots through a structured contrastive learning objective that reasons over the intermodal alignment. Experiments with a bi-modal object-property and scene retrieval task demonstrate the grounding efficacy and interpretability of correspondences learned by NSI. From a scene representation standpoint, we find that emergent NSI slots that move beyond the image grid by binding to spatial objects facilitate improved visual grounding compared to conventional bounding-box-based approaches. From a data efficiency standpoint, we empirically validate that NSI learns more generalizable representations from a fixed amount of annotation data than the traditional approach. We also show that the grounded slots surpass unsupervised slots in real-world object discovery and scale with scene complexity. Finally, we investigate the downstream efficacy of the grounded slots. Vision Transformers trained on grounding-aware NSI tokenizers using as few as ten tokens outperform patch-based tokens on challenging few-shot classification tasks",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Label smoothing loss is a widely adopted technique to mitigate overfitting in deep neural networks. This paper studies label smoothing from the perspective of Neural Collapse (NC), a powerful empirical and theoretical framework which characterizes model behavior during the terminal phase of training. We first show empirically that models trained with label smoothing converge faster to neural collapse solutions and attain a stronger level of neural collapse compared to those trained with cross-entropy loss. Furthermore, we show that at the same level of NC1, models under label smoothing loss exhibit intensified NC2. These findings provide valuable insights into the impact of label smoothing on model performance and calibration. Then, leveraging the unconstrained feature model, we derive closed-form solutions for the global minimizers under both label smoothing and cross-entropy losses. We show that models trained with label smoothing have a lower conditioning number and, therefore, theoretically converge faster. Our study, combining empirical evidence and theoretical results, not only provides nuanced insights into the differences between label smoothing and cross-entropy losses, but also serves as an example of how the powerful neural collapse framework can be used to improve our understanding of DNNs",

    "abstract": "The Lurie network is a novel and unifying time-invariant neural ODE. Many existing continuous-time models, including recurrent neural networks and neural oscillators, are special cases of the Lurie network in this context. Mild constraints on the weights and biases of the Lurie network are derived to ensure a generalised concept of stability is guaranteed. This generalised stability measure is that of k-contraction which permits global convergence to a point, line or plane in the neural state-space. This includes global convergence to one of multiple equilibrium points or limit cycles as observed in many dynamical systems including associative and working memory. Weights and biases of the Lurie network, which satisfy the k-contraction constraints, are encoded through unconstrained parametrisations. The novel stability results and parametrisations provide a toolset for training over the space of k-contracting Lurie network's using standard optimisation algorithms. These results are also leveraged to construct and train a graph Lurie network satisfying the same convergence properties. Empirical results show the improvement in prediction accuracy, generalisation and robustness on a range of simulated dynamical systems, when the graph structure and k-contraction conditions are introduced. These results also compare favourably against other well known stability-constrained models and an unconstrained neural ODE",

    "title": "LocalFormer: Mitigating Over-Globalising in Transformers on Graphs with Localised Training",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "As Transformers become more popular for graph machine learning, a significant issue has recently been observed. Their global attention mechanisms tend to overemphasize distant vertices, leading to the phenomenon of ``over-globalising.'' This phenomenon often results in the dilution of essential local information, particularly in graphs where local neighbourhoods carry significant predictive power. Existing methods often struggle with rigidity in their local processing, where tightly coupled operations limit flexibility and adaptability in diverse graph structures. Additionally, these methods can overlook critical structural nuances, resulting in an incomplete integration of local and global contexts. This paper addresses these issues by proposing LocalFormer, a novel framework, to effectively localise a transformer model by integrating a distinct local module and a complementary module that integrates global information. The local module focuses on capturing and preserving fine-grained, neighbourhood-specific patterns, ensuring that the model maintains sensitivity to critical local structures. In contrast, the complementary module dynamically integrates broader context without overshadowing the localised information, offering a balanced approach to feature aggregation across different scales of the graph. Through collaborative and warm-up training strategies, these modules work synergistically to mitigate the adverse effects of over-globalising, leading to improved empirical performance. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of LocalFormer compared to state-of-the-art baselines on vertex-classification tasks",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Numerous studies have recently focused on incorporating different variations of equivariance in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). In particular, rotation-equivariance has gathered significant attention due to its relevance in many applications related to medical imaging, microscopic imaging, satellite imaging, industrial tasks, etc. While prior research has primarily focused on enhancing classification tasks with rotation equivariant CNNs, their impact on more complex architectures, such as U-Net for image segmentation, remains scarcely explored. Indeed, previous work interested in integrating rotation-equivariance into U-Net architecture have focused on solving specific applications with a limited scope. In contrast, this paper aims to provide a more exhaustive evaluation of rotation equivariant U-Net for image segmentation across a broader range of tasks. We benchmark their effectiveness against standard U-Net architectures, assessing improvements in terms of performance and sustainability (i.e., computational cost). Our evaluation focuses on datasets whose orientation of objects of interest is arbitrary in the image (e.g., Kvasir-SEG), but also on more standard segmentation datasets (such as COCO-Stuff) as to explore the wider applicability of rotation equivariance beyond tasks undoubtedly concerned by rotation equivariance. The main contribution of this work is to provide insights into the trade-offs and advantages of integrating rotation equivariance for segmentation tasks",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "How can we train graph-based models to recognize unseen classes while keeping labeling costs low? Graph open-set learning (GOL) and out-of-distribution (OOD) detection aim to address this challenge by training models that can accurately classify known, in-distribution (ID) classes while identifying and handling previously unseen classes during inference. It is critical for high-stakes, real-world applications where models frequently encounter unexpected data, including finance, security, and healthcare. However, current GOL methods assume access to a large number of labeled ID samples, which is unrealistic for large-scale graphs due to high annotation costs. In this paper, we propose LEGO-Learn (Label-Efficient Graph Open-set Learning), a novel framework that addresses open-set node classification on graphs within a given label budget by selecting the most informative ID nodes. LEGO-Learn employs a GNN-based filter to identify and exclude potential OOD nodes and then selects highly informative ID nodes for labeling using the K-Medoids algorithm. To prevent the filter from discarding valuable ID examples, we introduce a classifier that differentiates between the $C$ known ID classes and an additional class representing OOD nodes (hence, a $C+1$ classifier). This classifier utilizes a weighted cross-entropy loss to balance the removal of OOD nodes while retaining informative ID nodes. Experimental results on four real-world datasets demonstrate that LEGO-Learn significantly outperforms leading methods, achieving up to a $6.62\\%$ improvement in ID classification accuracy and a $7.49\\%$ increase in AUROC for OOD detection",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In high-stakes environments where uncertainties abound, set-valued prediction offers a cautious and robust mechanism by presenting multiple potential labels as the prediction for each test instance to mitigate the potential risk associated with prediction errors. Yet, integrating this paradigm with out-of-distribution (OOD) detection remains scarcely explored in such settings as online learning with bandit feedback. The bandit feedback mechanism informs the learner about the correctness of the pulled arm/action instead of the explicit ground truth label, leaving the true class label unknown when an incorrect action is taken. To address this challenge, we introduce BanditGPS which conducts set-valued prediction with OOD detection in the bandit feedback setting, using an estimation to the ground truth of class labels. BanditGPS achieves three objectives: render small/informative prediction sets, enhance the OOD detection performance, and control the recall for all normal classes to meet prescribed requirements. Our approach is characterized by the loss function, which trades off between high OOD detection and small prediction sets. Theoretically, we prove that the convergence rate of the regret is $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/2})$. The empirical results further show that BanditGPS effectively controls the recalls with promising performances on OOD detection and informative prediction",

To achieve this, we adjust the noise level (equivalently, number of diffusion iterations) to ensure the generated image retains low-level and background features from the source image while representing the target category, resulting in a hard negative sample for the source category. We further automate and enhance $\\texttt{GeNIe}$ by adaptively adjusting the noise level selection on a per image basis (coined as $\\texttt{GeNIe-Ada}$), leading to further performance improvements.

To overcome such ambiguity, Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) is leveraged as a planning abstraction that enables precise and formal state descriptions. With PDDL, we can generate a symbolic world model where classic searching algorithms, such as A*, can be seamlessly applied to find optimal plans. However, directly generating PDDL domains with current LLMs remains an open challenge due to the lack of PDDL training data. To address this challenge, we propose to scale up the test-time computation of LLMs to enhance their PDDL reasoning capabilities, thereby enabling the generation of high-quality PDDL domains. Specifically, we introduce a simple yet effective algorithm, which first employs a Best-of-N sampling approach to improve the quality of the initial solution and then refines the solution in a fine-grained manner with verbalized machine learning. Our method outperforms o1-mini by a considerable margin in the generation of PDDL domains, achieving over 50% success rate on two tasks (i.e., generating PDDL domains from natural language description or PDDL problems). This is done without requiring additional training. By taking advantage of PDDL as state abstraction, our method is able to outperform the current state-of-the-art methods on almost all competition-level planning tasks",

However, different nodes may relate to a node-level property with a different granularity of its local neighborhood, and using the same level of smoothing for all nodes can be detrimental to their classification. In this work, we challenge the common fact that a single GNN layer can classify all nodes of a graph by training GNNs with a distinct personalized layer for each node. Inspired by metric learning, we propose a novel algorithm, MetSelect, to select the optimal representation layer to classify each node. In particular, we identify a prototype representation of each class in a transformed GNN layer and then, classify using the layer where the distance is smallest to a class prototype after normalizing with that layer's variance. Results on 10 datasets and 3 different GNNs show that we significantly improve the node classification accuracy of GNNs in a plug-and-play manner. We also find that using variable layers for prediction enables GNNs to be deeper and more robust to poisoning attacks.

However, Euclidean embeddings not only suffer from inefficient packing and limited separation—due to their polynomial volume growth—but are also prone to codebook collapse, where only a small subset of codebook vectors are effectively utilized. To address these limitations, we introduce HyperVQ, a novel approach that formulates VQ as a hyperbolic Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR) problem, leveraging the exponential volume growth in hyperbolic space to mitigate collapse and improve cluster separability. Additionally, HyperVQ represents codebook vectors as geometric representatives of hyperbolic decision hyperplanes, encouraging disentangled and robust latent representations.

However, these conversion techniques incur a large number of time steps, and consequently, high spiking activity. In this paper, we propose a novel ANN-to-SNN conversion framework, that incurs an exponentially lower number of time steps compared to that required in the existing conversion approaches. Our framework modifies the standard integrate-and-fire (IF) neuron model used in SNNs with no change in computational complexity and shifts the bias term of each batch normalization (BN) layer in the trained ANN. To reduce spiking activity, we propose training the source ANN with a fine-grained $\\ell_1$ regularizer with surrogate gradients that encourages high spike sparsity in the converted SNN. Our proposed framework thus yields lossless SNNs with low latency, low compute energy, thanks to the low time steps and high spike sparsity, and high test accuracy, for example, $75.12$% with only $4$ time steps on the ImageNet dataset.

These components are integrated to learn an agent-scene aware embedding, enabling the model to learn spatial dynamics and forecast the future trajectory of pedestrians. The model is designed to produce both deterministic and stochastic outcomes, with the stochastic predictions being generated by incorporating a Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder (CVAE). ASTRA also proposes a simple yet effective weighted penalty loss function, which helps to yield predictions that outperform a wide array of state-of-the-art deterministic and generative models. ASTRA demonstrates an average improvement of 27%/10% in deterministic/stochastic settings on the ETH-UCY dataset, and 26% improvement on the PIE dataset, respectively, along with seven times fewer parameters than the existing state-of-the-art model (see Figure 1). Additionally, the model's versatility allows it to generalize across different perspectives, such as Bird's Eye View (BEV) and Ego-Vehicle View (EVV)",

    "abstract": "Offline reinforcement learning (RL) learns policies from a fixed dataset, but often requires large amounts of data. The challenge arises when labeled datasets are expensive, especially when rewards have to be provided by human labelers for large datasets. In contrast, unlabelled data tends to be less expensive. This situation highlights the importance of finding effective ways to use unlabelled data in offline RL, especially when labelled data is limited or expensive to obtain. In this paper, we present the algorithm to utilize the unlabeled data in the offline RL method with kernel function approximation and give the theoretical guarantee. We present various eigenvalue decay conditions of $\\mathcal{H}_k$ which determine the complexity of the algorithm. In summary, our work provides a promising approach for exploiting the advantages offered by unlabeled data in offline RL, whilst maintaining theoretical assurances",

We model gradient updates as a probabilistic model and utilize stochastic variational inference (SVI) to derive an efficient and effective update rule.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We consider the problem of finite-horizon sequential experimental design to solve multi-objective optimization (MOO) of expensive black-box objective functions. This problem arises in many real-world applications, including materials design, where we have a small resource budget to make and evaluate candidate materials in the lab. We solve this problem using the framework of Bayesian optimization (BO) and propose the first set of non-myopic methods for MOO problems. Prior work on non-myopic BO for single-objective problems relies on the Bellman optimality principle to handle the lookahead reasoning process. However, this principle does not hold for most MOO problems because the reward function needs to satisfy some conditions: scalar variable, monotonicity, and additivity. We address this challenge by using hypervolume improvement (HVI) as our scalarization approach, which allows us to use a lower-bound on the Bellman equation to approximate the finite-horizon using a batch expected hypervolume improvement (EHVI) acquisition function (AF) for MOO. Our formulation naturally allows us to use other improvement-based scalarizations and compare their efficacy to HVI. We derive three non-myopic AFs for MOBO: 1) the Nested AF, which is based on the exact computation of the lower bound, 2) the Joint AF, which is a lower bound on the nested AF, and 3) the BINOM AF, which is a fast and approximate variant based on batch multi-objective acquisition functions. Our experiments on multiple diverse real-world MO problems demonstrate that our non-myopic AFs substantially improve performance over the existing myopic AFs for MOBO",

    "abstract": "Continual learning (CL) in large language models (LLMs) is an evolving domain that focuses on developing efficient and sustainable training strategies to adapt models to emerging knowledge and achieve robustness in dynamic environments. Our primary emphasis is on continual domain-adaptive pretraining, a process designed to equip LLMs with the ability to integrate new information from various domains while retaining previously learned knowledge. Since existing works concentrate mostly on continual fine-tuning for a limited selection of downstream tasks or training domains, we introduce a new benchmark designed to measure the adaptability of LLMs to changing pretraining data landscapes. We further examine the impact of model size on learning efficacy and forgetting, as well as how the progression and similarity of emerging domains affect the knowledge transfer within these models. Our findings uncover several key insights: (i) continual pretraining consistently improves <1.5B models studied in this work and is also superior to domain adaptation, (ii) larger models always achieve better perplexity than smaller ones when continually pretrained on the same corpus, (iii) smaller models are particularly sensitive to continual pretraining, showing the most significant rates of both learning and forgetting, (iv) continual pretraining boosts downstream task performance of GPT-2 family, (v) continual pretraining enables LLMs to specialize better when the sequence of domains shows semantic similarity while randomizing training domains leads to better transfer and final performance otherwise. We posit that our research establishes a new benchmark for CL in LLMs, providing a more realistic evaluation of knowledge retention and transfer across diverse domains",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Many peer-review venues are using algorithms to assign submissions to reviewers. The crux of such automated approaches is the notion of the \"similarity score'' — a numerical estimate of the expertise of a reviewer in reviewing a paper — and many algorithms have been proposed to compute these scores. However, these algorithms have not been subjected to a principled comparison, making it difficult for stakeholders to choose the algorithm in an evidence-based manner. The key challenge in comparing existing algorithms and developing better algorithms is the lack of the publicly available gold-standard data that would be needed to perform reproducible research. We address this challenge by collecting a novel dataset of similarity scores that we release to the research community. Our dataset consists of 477 self-reported expertise scores provided by 58 researchers who evaluated their expertise in reviewing papers they have read previously. We use this data to compare several popular algorithms currently employed in computer science conferences and come up with recommendations for stakeholders. Our four main findings are: - All algorithms make a non-trivial amount of error. For the task of ordering two papers in terms of their relevance for a reviewer, the error rates range from 12%-30% in easy cases to 36%-43% in hard cases, thereby highlighting the vital need for more research on the similarity-computation problem. - Most specialized algorithms are designed to work with titles and abstracts of papers, and in this regime the Specter2 algorithm performs best. - The classical TF-IDF algorithm which can use full texts of papers is on par with Specter2 that uses only titles and abstracts. - The performance of off-the-shelf LLMs is worse than the specialized algorithms.

Methods based on intrinsic rewards have been proven to enhance exploration efficiency in multi-agent scenarios effectively. However, these methods are plagued by instability during training and biases in exploration direction. To address these challenges, we propose Farsighted Self-Direction (FSD), a novel model-free method that utilizes a long-term exploration bonus to achieve coordinated exploration. Since prediction error against individual Q-values indicates a potential bonus for committed exploration, it is taken into account in action selection to directly guide the coordinated exploration. Further, we also use clipped double Q-learning to reduce noise in prediction error. We validate the method on didactic examples and demonstrate the outperformance of our method on challenging StarCraft II micromanagement tasks",

    "title": "Semantic-Syntactic Discrepancy in Images (SSDI): Learning Meaning and Order of Features from Natural Images",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Despite considerable progress in image classification tasks, classification models seem unaffected by the images that significantly deviate from those that appear natural to human eyes. Specifically, while human perception can easily identify abnormal appearances or compositions in images, classification models overlook any alterations in the arrangement of object parts as long as they are present in any order, even if unnatural. Hence, this work exposes the vulnerability of having semantic and syntactic discrepancy in images (SSDI) in the form of corruptions that remove or shuffle image patches or present images in the form of puzzles. To address this vulnerability, we propose the concept of \"image grammar\", comprising \"image semantics\" and \"image syntax\". Image semantics pertains to the interpretation of parts or patches within an image, whereas image syntax refers to the arrangement of these parts to form a coherent object. We present a semi-supervised two-stage method for learning the image grammar of visual elements and environments solely from natural images. While the first stage learns the semantic meaning of individual object parts, the second stage learns how their relative arrangement constitutes an entire object. The efficacy of the proposed approach is then demonstrated by achieving SSDI detection rates ranging from 70% to 90% on corruptions generated from CelebA and SUN-RGBD datasets.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In Reinforcement Learning (RL), it is commonly assumed that an immediate reward signal is generated for each action taken by the agent, helping the agent maximize cumulative rewards to obtain the optimal policy. However, in many real-world scenarios, designing immediate reward signals is difficult; instead, agents receive a single reward that is contingent upon a partial sequence or a complete trajectory. In this work, we define this challenging problem as RL from Bagged Reward (RLBR), where sequences of data are treated as bags with non-Markovian bagged rewards, leading to the formulation of Bagged Reward Markov Decision Processes (BRMDPs). Theoretically, we demonstrate that RLBR can be addressed by solving a standard MDP with properly redistributed bagged rewards allocated to each instance within a bag. Empirically, we find that reward redistribution becomes more challenging as the bag length increases, due to reduced informational granularity. Existing reward redistribution methods are insufficient to address these challenges. Therefore, we propose a novel reward redistribution method equipped with a bidirectional attention mechanism, enabling the accurate interpretation of contextual nuances and temporal dependencies within each bag. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing approaches",

    "abstract": "Differentiable Neural Architecture Search methods efficiently find high-accuracy architectures using gradient-based optimization in a continuous domain, saving computational resources. Mixed-precision search helps optimize precision within a fixed architecture. However, applying it to a NAS-generated network does not assure optimal performance as the optimized quantized architecture may not emerge from a standalone NAS method. In light of these considerations, this paper introduces ∇QDARTS, a novel approach that combines differentiable NAS with mixed-precision search for both weight and activation. ∇QDARTS aims to identify the optimal mixed-precision neural architecture capable of achieving remarkable accuracy while operating with minimal computational requirements in a single-shot, end-to-end differentiable framework, obviating the need for pretraining and proxy methods. Compared to fp32, ∇QDARTS shows impressive performance on CIFAR10 with (2,4) bit precision, reducing bit operations by 160× with a slight 1.57% accuracy drop. Increasing the capacity enables ∇QDARTS to match fp32 accuracy while reducing bit operations by 18×. For the ImageNet dataset, with just (2,4) bit precision, ∇QDARTS outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as APQ, SPOS, OQA, and MNAS by 2.3%, 2.9%, 0.3%, and 2.7% in terms of accuracy. By incorporating (2,4,8) bit precision, ∇QDARTS further minimizes the accuracy drop to 1% compared to fp32, alongside a substantial reduction of 17× in required bit operations and 2.6× in memory footprint. In terms of bit-operation (memory footprint) ∇QDARTS excels over APQ, SPOS, OQA, and MNAS with similar accuracy by 2.3× (12×), 2.4× (3×), 13% (6.2×), 3.4× (37%), for bit-operation (memory footprint), respectively. ∇QDARTS enhances the overall search and training efficiency, achieving a 3.1× and 1.54× improvement over APQ and OQA, respectively",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely deployed in various real-world applications. However, most GNNs are black-box models that lack explanations. One strategy to explain GNNs is through counterfactual explanation, which aims to find minimum perturbations on input graphs that change the GNN predictions. Existing works on GNN counterfactual explanations primarily concentrate on the local-level perspective (i.e., generating counterfactuals for each individual graph), which suffers from information overload and lacks insights into the broader cross-graph relationships. To address such issues, we propose GlobalGCE, a novel global-level graph counterfactual explanation method. GlobalGCE aims to identify a collection of subgraph mapping rules as counterfactual explanations for the target GNN. According to these rules, substituting certain significant subgraphs with their counterfactual subgraphs will change the GNN prediction to the desired class for most graphs (i.e., maximum coverage). Methodologically, we design a significant subgraph generator and a counterfactual subgraph autoencoder in our GlobalGCE, where the subgraphs and the rules can be effectively generated. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our GlobalGCE compared to existing baselines. Our code can be found at \\url{https://github.com/YinhanHe123/GlobalGCE}",

Additionally, we introduce a new learning target by using latent variables, rather than the conventional approach of predicting the original input $x_0$ or source error $\\epsilon_0$. In speech synthesis, using $x_0$ or $\\epsilon_0$ often leads to large prediction errors in the early stages of the denoising process, causing distortion in the recovered speech. Our method mitigates this issue and, through extensive evaluation, demonstrates the generation of high-fidelity speech in competitive time, outperforming current state-of-the-art techniques.

A very common assumption is that the pre-activations are Gaussian. Although this convenient *Gaussian hypothesis* can be justified when the number of neurons per layer tends to infinity, it is challenged by both theoretical and experimental work for finite-width neural networks. Our main contribution is to construct a family of pairs of activation functions and initialization distributions that ensure that the pre-activations remain Gaussian throughout the network depth, even in narrow neural networks, under the assumption that the pre-activations are independent. In the process, we discover a set of constraints that a neural network should satisfy to ensure Gaussian pre-activations. In addition, we provide a critical review of the claims of the Edge of Chaos line of work and construct a non-asymptotic Edge of Chaos analysis. We also propose a unified view on the propagation of pre-activations, encompassing the framework of several well-known initialization procedures. More generally, our work provides a principled framework for addressing the much-debated question: is it desirable to initialize the training of a neural network whose pre-activations are guaranteed to be Gaussian?

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The expansion of neural network sizes and the enhanced resolution of modern image sensors result in heightened memory and power demands to process modern computer vision models. In order to deploy these models in extremely resource-constrained edge devices, it is crucial to reduce their peak memory, which is the maximum memory consumed during the execution of a model. A naive approach to reducing peak memory is aggressive down-sampling of feature maps via pooling with large stride, which often results in unacceptable degradation in network performance. To mitigate this problem, we propose residual encoded distillation (ReDistill) for peak memory reduction in a teacher-student framework, in which a student network with less memory is derived from the teacher network using aggressive pooling. We apply our distillation method to multiple problems in computer vision, including image classification and diffusion-based image generation. For image classification, our method yields 4x-5x theoretical peak memory reduction with less degradation in accuracy for most CNN-based architectures. For diffusion-based image generation, our proposed distillation method yields a denoising network with 4x lower theoretical peak memory while maintaining decent diversity and fidelity for image generation. Experiments demonstrate our method's superior performance compared to other feature-based and response-based distillation methods when applied to the same student network.

    "abstract": "In Gaussian graphical model selection, noise-corrupted samples present significant challenges. It is known that even minimal amounts of noise can obscure the underlying structure, leading to fundamental identifiability issues. A recent line of work addressing this \"robust model selection\" problem narrows its focus to tree-structured graphical models. Even within this specific class of models, exact structure recovery is shown to be impossible. However, several algorithms have been developed that are known to provably recover the underlying tree-structure up to an (unavoidable) equivalence class. In this paper, we extend these results beyond tree-structured graphs. We first characterize the equivalence class up to which general graphs can be recovered in the presence of noise. Despite the inherent ambiguity (which we prove is unavoidable), the structure that can be recovered reveals local clustering information and global connectivity patterns in the underlying model. Such information is useful in a range of real-world problems, including power grids, social networks, protein-protein interactions, and neural structures. We then propose an algorithm which provably recovers the underlying graph up to the identified ambiguity. We further provide finite sample guarantees in the high-dimensional regime for our algorithm and validate our results through numerical simulations",

    "abstract": "Causal discovery, the task of inferring causal structure from data, has the potential to uncover mechanistic insights from biological experiments, especially those involving perturbations. However, causal discovery algorithms over larger sets of variables tend to be brittle against misspecification or when data are limited. For example, single-cell transcriptomics measures thousands of genes, but the nature of their relationships is not known, and there may be as few as tens of cells per intervention setting. To mitigate these challenges, we propose a foundation model-inspired approach: a supervised model trained on large-scale, synthetic data to predict causal graphs from summary statistics — like the outputs of classical causal discovery algorithms run over subsets of variables and other statistical hints like inverse covariance. Our approach is enabled by the observation that typical errors in the outputs of a discovery algorithm remain comparable across datasets. Theoretically, we show that the model architecture is well-specified, in the sense that it can recover a causal graph consistent with graphs over subsets. Empirically, we train the model to be robust to misspecification and distribution shift using diverse datasets. Experiments on biological and synthetic data confirm that this model generalizes well beyond its training set, runs on graphs with hundreds of variables in seconds, and can be easily adapted to different underlying data assumptions",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning and Generative Flow Networks, known as GFlowNets, present an exciting possibility for neural networks to model distributions across various data structures. In this paper, we broaden their applicability to data structures consisting of optimal solutions for a combinatorial problem. Concretely, we propose using Q-learning and various policy gradient methods, as well as GFlowNets to learn the distribution of optimal solutions for kidney exchange problems (KEPs). This could provide a useful tool for decision-making authorities, policymakers and clinicians, as it offers them multiple optimal or near-optimal solutions, and provides a complementary landscape to their traditional integer programming-based toolbox for promoting fairness and societal benefits. Our reinforcement learning-based framework trained on KEP instances provides an effective addition to computationally expensive exact approaches, notably mixed-integer programming. Our experiments thoroughly evaluate the quality of the solution sets sampled from the trained neural networks in terms of optimality, their scalability when dealing with real-sized KEP instances, and their capability to generate a diverse pool of solutions. We also cover the use of their efficient solution generation capabilities to improve fairness and simulate the evolution of the KEP pool in a dynamic setting. Our contribution is thus: 1) methodological, as it introduces a novel setting for reinforcement learning in addition to GFlowNets, 2) implementational, as it delves beyond the theory and details how to use conditional information, and 3) of practical significance, as it considers a specific combinatorial problem in the healthcare domain",

    "abstract": "Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) reduces the cost of real-environment sampling by generating synthetic trajectories (called rollouts) from a learned dynamics model. However, choosing the length of the rollouts poses two dilemmas: (1) Longer rollouts better preserve on-policy training but amplify model bias, indicating the need for an intermediate horizon to mitigate distribution shift (i.e., the gap between on-policy and past off-policy samples). (2) Moreover, a longer model rollout may reduce value estimation bias but raise the variance of policy gradients due to backpropagation through multiple steps, implying another intermediate horizon for stable gradient estimates. However, these two optimal horizons may differ. To resolve this conflict, we propose Double Horizon Model-Based Policy Optimization (DHMBPO), which divides the rollout procedure into a long ``distribution rollout'' (DR) and a short ``training rollout'' (TR). The DR generates on-policy state samples for mitigating distribution shift. In contrast, the short TR leverages differentiable transitions to offer accurate value gradient estimation with stable gradient updates, thereby requiring fewer updates and reducing overall runtime. We demonstrate that the double-horizon approach effectively balances distribution shift, model bias, and gradient instability, and surpasses existing MBRL methods on continuous-control benchmarks in terms of both sample efficiency and runtime",

    "abstract": "Time series~(TS) modeling is essential in dynamic systems like weather prediction and anomaly detection. Recent studies utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) for TS modeling, leveraging their powerful pattern recognition capabilities. These methods primarily position LLMs as the predictive backbone, often omitting the mathematical modeling within traditional TS models, such as periodicity. However, disregarding the potential of LLMs also overlooks their pattern recognition capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce \\textit{LLM-TS Integrator}, a novel framework that effectively integrates the capabilities of LLMs into traditional TS modeling. Central to this integration is our \\textit{mutual information} module. The core of this \\textit{mutual information} module is a traditional TS model enhanced with LLM-derived insights for improved predictive abilities. This enhancement is achieved by maximizing the mutual information between traditional model's TS representations and LLM's textual representation counterparts, bridging the two modalities. Moreover, we recognize that samples vary in importance for two losses: traditional prediction and mutual information maximization. To address this variability, we introduce the \\textit{sample reweighting} module to improve information utilization. This module assigns dual weights to each sample: one for prediction loss and another for mutual information loss, dynamically optimizing these weights via bi-level optimization. Our method achieves state-of-the-art or comparable performance across five mainstream TS tasks, including short-term and long-term forecasting, imputation, classification, and anomaly detection.

In this context, graph Laplacian-based MvRL methods have demonstrated remarkable success in representing multi-view data. However, these methods often struggle with generalization to new data and face challenges with scalability. Moreover, in many practical scenarios, multi-view data is contaminated by noise or outliers. In such cases, modern deep-learning-based MvRL approaches that rely on alignment or contrastive objectives present degraded performance in downstream tasks, as they may impose incorrect consistency between clear and corrupted data sources. We introduce *SpecRaGE*, a novel fusion-based framework that integrates the strengths of graph Laplacian methods with the power of deep learning to overcome these challenges. SpecRage uses neural networks to learn parametric mapping that approximates a joint diagonalization of graph Laplacians. This solution bypasses the need for alignment while enabling generalizable and scalable learning of informative and meaningful representations. Moreover, it incorporates a meta-learning fusion module that dynamically adapts to data quality, ensuring robustness against outliers and noisy views. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that SpecRaGE outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios with data contamination, paving the way for more reliable and efficient multi-view learning.

Our approach leverages freely available unlabeled data in the wild, which naturally captures environmental test-time OOD distributions under both covariate and semantic shifts. To effectively utilize such data, we propose selectively acquiring human feedback to label a small subset of informative samples. These labeled samples are then used to train both a multi-class classifier and an OOD detector. By incorporating human feedback, our method significantly improves model robustness and precision in handling OOD scenarios.

    "abstract": "Continual learning (CL) aims to train a model on a sequence of tasks (i.e., a CL scenario) while balancing the trade-off between plasticity (learning new tasks) and stability (retaining prior knowledge). The dominantly adopted conventional evaluation protocol for CL algorithms selects the best hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, mini-batch size, regularization strengths, etc.) within a given scenario and then evaluates the algorithms using these hyperparameters in the same scenario. However, this protocol has significant shortcomings: it overestimates the CL capacity of algorithms and relies on unrealistic hyperparameter tuning, which is not feasible for real-world applications. From the fundamental principles of evaluation in machine learning, we argue that the evaluation of CL algorithms should focus on assessing the generalizability of their CL capacity to unseen scenarios. Based on this, we propose the Generalizable Two-phase Evaluation Protocol (GTEP) consisting of hyperparameter tuning and evaluation phases. Both phases share the same scenario configuration (e.g., number of tasks) but are generated from different datasets. Hyperparameters of CL algorithms are tuned in the first phase and applied in the second phase to evaluate the algorithms. We apply this protocol to class-incremental learning, both with and without pretrained models. Across more than 8,000 experiments, our results show that most state-of-the-art algorithms fail to replicate their reported performance, highlighting that their CL capacity has been significantly overestimated in the conventional evaluation protocol",

This enables us to give analytical time-course solutions to certain two-layer bias-free (leaky) ReLU networks outside the lazy learning regime. While deep bias-free ReLU networks are more expressive than their two-layer counterparts, they still share a number of similarities with deep linear networks.

But there are still serious impediments in Imitation Learning from Observation (ILfO) with pretrained models. This study identifies two primary obstacles: the Embodiment Knowledge Barrier (EKB) and the Demonstration Knowledge Barrier (DKB). The EKB emerges due to the pretrained models' limitations in handling novel observations, which leads to inaccurate action inference. Conversely, the DKB stems from the reliance on limited demonstration datasets, restricting the model's adaptability across diverse scenarios. We propose separate solutions to overcome each barrier and apply them to Action Inference by Maximising Evidence (AIME), a state-of-the-art algorithm. This new algorithm, AIME-NoB, integrates online interactions and a data-driven regulariser to mitigate the EKB. Additionally, it uses a surrogate reward function to broaden the policy's supported states, addressing the DKB. Our experiments on vision-based control tasks from the DeepMind Control Suite and MetaWorld benchmarks show that AIME-NoB significantly improves sample efficiency and converged performance, presenting a robust framework for overcoming the challenges in ILfO with pretrained models.

Independently, it has been shown that successful magnitude pruning masks for deep neural nets emerge early in training and remain stable thereafter. In this work, we study these two phenomena jointly and show that they are connected: We develop a methodology to measure the similarity between arbitrary parameter masks and Hessian eigenspaces via Grassmannian metrics. We identify *overlap* as the most useful such metric due to its interpretability and stability. To compute *overlap*, we develop a matrix-free algorithm based on sketched SVDs that allows us to compute over 1000 Hessian eigenpairs for nets with over 10M parameters --an unprecedented scale by several orders of magnitude. Our experiments reveal an *overlap* between magnitude parameter masks and top Hessian eigenspaces consistently higher than chance-level, and that this effect gets accentuated for larger network sizes. This result indicates that *top Hessian eigenvectors tend to be concentrated around larger parameters*, or equivalently, that *larger parameters tend to align with directions of larger loss curvature*.

Yet these matrices require gradients or even Hessians of the log-likelihood, excluding the purely data-driven setting and many problems of simulation-based inference. We propose a framework, derived from score-matching, to extend gradient-based dimension reduction to problems where gradients are unavailable. Specifically, we formulate an objective function to directly learn the score ratio function needed to compute the diagnostic matrices, propose a tailored parameterization for the score ratio network, and introduce regularization methods that capitalize on the hypothesized low-dimensional structure. We also introduce a novel algorithm to iteratively identify the low-dimensional reduced basis vectors more accurately with limited data based on eigenvalue deflation methods.

The theoretical works that study NC are typically based on simplified unconstrained features models (UFMs) that mask any effect of the data on the extent of collapse. To address this limitation of UFMs, this paper explores the possibility of analyzing NC1 using kernels associated with shallow NNs. We begin by formulating an NC1 metric as a function of the kernel. Then, we specialize it to the NN Gaussian Process kernel (NNGP) and the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), associated with wide networks at initialization and during gradient-based training with a small learning rate, respectively. As a key result, we show that the NTK does not represent more collapsed features than the NNGP for Gaussian data of arbitrary dimensions. This showcases the limitations of data-independent kernels such as NTK in approximating the NC behavior of NNs. As an alternative to NTK, we then empirically explore a recently proposed data-aware Gaussian Process kernel, which generalizes NNGP to model feature learning. We show that this kernel yields lower NC1 than NNGP but may not follow the trends of the shallow NN. Our study demonstrates that adaptivity to data may allow kernel-based analysis of NC, though further advancements in this area are still needed. A nice byproduct of our study is showing both theoretically and empirically that the choice of nonlinear activation function affects NC1 (with ERF yielding lower values than ReLU)",

    "title": "ComPEFT: Compression for Communicating Parameter Efficient Updates via Sparsification and Quantization",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) enables creation of specialized language models for diverse tasks, resulting in numerous expert modules. In many practical use cases, these expert PEFT modules are integrated into a single model that answers arbitrary queries by routing queries to different experts. However, only a few experts can be kept in GPU memory due to memory constraints. Consequently, expert modules are frequently loaded and offloaded between CPU/GPU memory or disk storage. This frequent swapping dramatically increases communication overhead, leading unacceptable latency and degrading user experience. The large size of modern PEFT modules further exacerbates this latency. For example, QLoRA experts for 65B LLaMA are 3.2GB, making swapping a major communication bottleneck, particularly in memory-constrained environments. To address these issues, we present ComPEFT (compressed PEFT), a novel method for compressing fine-tuning residuals (task vectors) of PEFT models. Reducing expert PEFT module size effectively addresses both memory and communication limitations, facilitating faster swapping and enabling a higher density of experts within a given memory footprint. ComPEFT employs sparsification and ternary quantization to reduce PEFT module size without any additional training while preserving or enhancing model performance. Extensive evaluation across T5, T0, and LLaMA-based models with 200M − 65B parameters, ComPEFT achieves compression ratios of 8x − 50x. Specifically, we show that ComPEFT improves with scale – stronger models exhibit higher compressibility and better performance. We show ComPEFT applied to LLaMA − 65B outperforms QLoRA by 4.16% on MMLU with a 26x storage size reduction. Additionally, compressed experts produced by ComPEFT maintain few-shot compositional generalization capabilities, facilitate efficient communication and computation, and exhibit enhanced performance when merged. Lastly, we provide an analysis of different method components, compare ComPEFT with other PEFT methods, and test its efficacy for compressing full finetuning residual",

    "title": "MaxCutBench: Revisiting and Benchmarking Graph Neural Networks for Maximum Cut",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recently, there has been much work on designing general heuristics for graph-based, combinatorial optimization problems via the incorporation of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn distribution-specific solution structures. However, there is a lack of consistency in evaluating these heuristics in terms of the baselines and instances chosen, making it difficult to assess the relative performance of the algorithms. In this paper, we introduce \\textbf{MaxCutBench}—an open-source benchmark suite dedicated to the NP-hard Maximum Cut problem. The suite offers a unified interface for $16$ algorithms, both traditional and machine-learning-based. Using our benchmark, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the implemented algorithms on a carefully selected set of hard instances from diverse graph datasets. Our main finding is that classical local search heuristics can outperform several highly cited learning-based approaches, including S2V-DQN (Khalil et al., 2017), ECO-DQN (Barrett et al., 2020), among others, in terms of objective value, generalization, inference time, and scalability. Additionally, we find that the performance of ECO-DQN either remains the same or improves when the GNN is replaced by simple linear regression. We hope our benchmark will contribute to the efforts of the community to standardize the evaluation of learned heuristics for combinatorial optimization.

CoDe is a blockwise sampling method applied during intermediate denoising steps, allowing for alignment with downstream rewards. Our experiments demonstrate that, despite its simplicity, CoDe offers a favorable trade-off between reward alignment, prompt instruction following, and inference cost, achieving a competitive performance against the state-of-the-art baselines}.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Dense subgraph discovery (DSD) is a key graph mining primitive with myriad applications including finding densely connected communities which are diverse in their vertex composition. In such a context, it is desirable to extract a dense subgraph that provides fair representation of the diverse subgroups that constitute the vertex set while incurring a small loss in terms of subgraph density. Existing methods for promoting fairness in DSD have important limitations - the associated formulations are NP-hard in the worst case and they do not provide flexible notions of fairness, making it non-trivial to analyze the inherent trade-off between density and fairness. In this paper, we introduce two tractable formulations for fair DSD, each offering a different notion of fairness. Our methods provide a structured and flexible approach to incorporate fairness, accommodating varying fairness levels. We introduce the fairness-induced relative loss in subgraph density as a price of fairness measure to quantify the associated trade-off. We are the first to study such a notion in the context of detecting fair dense subgraphs. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our methods not only match but frequently outperform existing solutions, sometimes incurring even less than half the subgraph density loss compared to prior art, while achieving the target fairness levels. Importantly, they excel in scenarios that previous methods fail to adequately handle, i.e., those with extreme subgroup imbalances, highlighting their effectiveness in extracting fair and dense solutions",

    "abstract": "One of the most common approaches for self-supervised representation learning is defining pre-text tasks to learn data representations. Existing works determine pre-text tasks in a \"task-agnostic'' way, without considering the forthcoming downstream tasks. This offers an advantage of broad applicability across tasks, but can also lead to a mismatch between task objectives, potentially degrading performance on downstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce TST-LLM, a framework that effectively reduces this mismatch when the natural language-based description of the downstream task is given without any ground-truth labels. TST-LLM instructs the LLM to use the downstream task's description and meta-information of data to discover features relevant to the target task. These discovered features are then treated as ground-truth labels to define \"target-specific'' pre-text tasks. TST-LLM consistently outperforms contemporary baselines, such as STUNT and LFR, with win ratios of 95% and 81%, when applied to 22 benchmark tabular datasets, including binary and multi-class classification, and regression tasks",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Molecular representation learning is central to molecular property prediction, which is a vital component in drug discovery. Existing methods, which mainly focus on the atom-level molecular graphs, often find it challenging to directly model the relation between fragment (substructure) and function of molecules, largely due to insufficient fragment priors. In this work, we propose a molecular self-supervised learning framework \\textbf{FragFormer}, which aims to learn the representation of fragments and their contextual relationships. Given the prior that an atom can be part of multiple functional groups, we develop $k$-\\textbf{D}egree \\textbf{Ove}rlapping fragmentation (\\textbf{DOVE}), which generates overlapping fragment graph by employing the iterative line graph. Besides, DOVE can preserve the connection information during the fragmentation phase compared to non-overlapping fragmentation. In the pre-training stage, we design a \\textit{nested masked fragment prediction} objective, to capture the hierarchical nature of fragments, namely that larger fragments can encompass multiple smaller ones. Based on FragFormer, we introduce a simple yet efficient \\textit{fragment-level} interpretation method \\textbf{FragCAM} for the molecular property prediction results with greater accuracy. Moreover, thanks to the fragment modeling, our model is more capable of processing large molecule, such as peptides, and capturing the long-range interactions inside molecules. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on eight out of eleven molecular property prediction datasets on PharmaBench. On long-range biological benchmark with peptide data, FragFormer can beat strong baselines by a clear margin, which shows the model's potential to generalize to larger molecules. Finally, we demonstrate that our model can effectively identify decisive fragments for prediction results on a real-world dataset\\footnote{Our code is available at \\url{https://github.com/wjxts/FragFormer/}}",

The result shows that there exists a case in which the no resampling/reweighting situation gives the best feature learning performance irrespectively of the choice of losses or classifiers, supporting recent findings in~\\citet{kang2019decoupling,cao2019learning}. It is also revealed that the key of the result is the symmetry of the loss and the problem setting.

Previous studies in time series continual learning often propose models that require buffering long sequences, potentially restricting the responsiveness of the inference system. Moreover, these models are typically designed for regularly sampled data, an unrealistic assumption in real-world scenarios. This paper introduces ODEStream, a novel buffer-free continual learning framework that incorporates a temporal isolation layer to capture temporal dependencies within the data. Simultaneously, it leverages the capability of neural ordinary differential equations to process irregular sequences and generate a continuous data representation, enabling seamless adaptation to changing dynamics in a data streaming scenario. Our approach focuses on learning how the dynamics and distribution of historical data change over time, facilitating direct processing of streaming sequences. Evaluations on benchmark real-world datasets demonstrate that ODEStream outperforms the state-of-the-art online learning and streaming analysis baseline models, providing accurate predictions over extended periods while minimising performance degradation over time by learning how the sequence dynamics change.

To address this challenge, in this paper, we introduce Amphibian - a gradient-based meta-learner that learns to scale the direction of gradient descent to achieve the desired balance between fast learning and continual learning. For this purpose, using only the current batch of data, Amphibian minimizes a meta-objective that encourages alignments of gradients among given data samples along selected basis directions in the gradient space. From this objective, it learns a diagonal scale matrix in each layer that accumulates the history of such gradient alignments. Using these scale matrices Amphibian updates the model online only in the directions having positive cumulative gradient alignments among the data observed so far. With evaluation on standard continual image classification benchmarks, we show that such meta-learned scaled gradient descent in Amphibian achieves better accuracy in online continual learning than relevant baselines while enabling fast learning with less data and few-shot knowledge transfer to new tasks. We also introduce Amphibian-$\\beta$ a unified and principled framework for analyzing and understanding the fast learning and continual learning dynamics.

However, the large inter-individual variability in brain characteristics has constrained most studies to train models on one participant at a time. This limitation hampers the training of deep learning models, which typically requires very large datasets. Here, we propose to boost brain decoding of videos and static images across participants by aligning brain responses of training and left-out participants. Evaluated on a retrieval task, compared to the anatomically-aligned baseline, our method halves the median rank in out-of-subject setups. It also outperforms classical within-subject approaches when fewer than 100 minutes of data is available for the tested participant. Furthermore, we show that our alignment framework handles multiple subjects, which improves accuracy upon classical single-subject approaches. Finally, we show that this method aligns neural representations in accordance with brain anatomy. Overall, this study lays the foundations for leveraging extensive neuroimaging datasets and enhancing the decoding of individual brains when a limited amount of brain-imaging data is available",

Remarkably, these models exhibit this capacity across various query mechanisms. For example, we zero-shot prompt an LLM to output a numerical importance score for a feature (e.g., ``blood pressure'') in predicting an outcome of interest (e.g., ``heart failure''), with no additional context. In particular, we find that the latest models, such as GPT-4, can consistently identify the most predictive features regardless of the query mechanism and across various prompting strategies. We illustrate these findings through extensive experiments on real-world data, where we show that LLM-based feature selection consistently achieves strong performance competitive with data-driven methods such as the LASSO, despite never having looked at the downstream training data. Our findings suggest that LLMs may be useful not only for selecting the best features for training \\textit{but also for deciding which features to collect in the first place}.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Offline model-based optimization (MBO) aims to maximize a black-box objective function using only an offline dataset of designs and scores. These tasks span various domains, such as robotics, material design, and protein and molecular engineering. A common approach involves training a surrogate model using existing designs and their corresponding scores, and then generating new designs through gradient-based updates with respect to the surrogate model. This method suffers from the out-of-distribution issue, where the surrogate model may erroneously predict high scores for unseen designs. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel method, Design Editing for Offline Model-based Optimization} (DEMO), which leverages a diffusion prior to calibrate overly optimized designs. DEMO first generates pseudo design candidates by performing gradient ascent with respect to a surrogate model. While these pseudo design candidates contain information beyond the offline dataset, they might be invalid or have erroneously high predicted scores. Therefore, to address this challenge while utilizing the information provided by pseudo design candidates, we propose an editing process to refine these pseudo design candidates. We introduce noise to the pseudo design candidates and subsequently denoise them with a diffusion prior trained on the offline dataset, ensuring they align with the distribution of valid designs. Empirical evaluations on seven offline MBO tasks show that, with properly tuned hyperparamters, DEMO's score is competitive with the best previously reported scores in the literature",

    "abstract": "As large pre-trained image-processing neural networks are being embedded in autonomous agents such as self-driving cars or robots, the question arises of how such systems can communicate with each other about the surrounding world, despite their different architectures and training regimes. As a first step in this direction, we systematically explore the task of referential communication in a community of heterogeneous state-of-the-art pre-trained visual networks, showing that they can develop, in a self-supervised way, a shared protocol to refer to a target object among a set of candidates. This shared protocol can also be used, to some extent, to communicate about previously unseen object categories of different granularity. Moreover, a visual network that was not initially part of an existing community can learn the community's protocol with remarkable ease. Finally, we study, both qualitatively and quantitatively, the properties of the emergent protocol, providing some evidence that it is capturing high-level semantic features of objects",

    "title": "MemLLM: Finetuning LLMs to Use Explicit Read-Write Memory",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "While current large language models (LLMs) perform well on many knowledge-related tasks, they are limited by relying on their parameters as an implicit storage mechanism. As a result, they struggle with memorizing rare events and with updating their memory as facts change over time. In addition, the uninterpretable nature of parametric memory makes it challenging to prevent hallucination. Model editing and augmenting LLMs with parameters specialized for memory are only partial solutions. In this paper, we introduce MemLLM, a novel method of enhancing LLMs by integrating a structured and explicit read-and-write memory module. MemLLM tackles the aforementioned challenges by enabling dynamic interaction with the memory and improving the LLM's capabilities in using stored knowledge. Our experiments indicate that MemLLM enhances the LLM's performance and interpretability, in language modeling in general and knowledge-intensive tasks in particular. We see MemLLM as an important step towards making LLMs more grounded and factual through memory augmentation. The project repository is publicly available at: https://github.com/amodaresi/MemLLM",

    "abstract": "Non-conjugate Gaussian processes (NCGPs) define a flexible probabilistic framework to model categorical, ordinal and continuous data, and are widely used in practice. However, exact inference in NCGPs is prohibitively expensive for large datasets, thus requiring approximations in practice. The approximation error adversely impacts the reliability of the model and is not accounted for in the uncertainty of the prediction. We introduce a family of iterative methods that explicitly model this error. They are uniquely suited to parallel modern computing hardware, efficiently recycle computations, and compress information to reduce both the time and memory requirements for NCGPs. As we demonstrate on large-scale classification problems, our method significantly accelerates posterior inference compared to competitive baselines by trading off reduced computation for increased uncertainty",

    "abstract": "Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models encode the structural information of knowledge graphs to predicting new links. Effective training of these models requires distinguishing between positive and negative samples with high precision. Although prior research has shown that improving the quality of negative samples can significantly enhance model accuracy, identifying high-quality negative samples remains a challenging problem. This paper theoretically investigates the condition under which negative samples lead to optimal KG embedding and identifies a sufficient condition for an effective negative sample distribution. Based on this theoretical foundation, we propose \\textbf{E}mbedding \\textbf{MU}tation (\\textsc{EMU}), a novel framework that \\emph{generates} negative samples satisfying this condition, in contrast to conventional methods that focus on \\emph{identifying} challenging negative samples within the training data. Importantly, the simplicity of \\textsc{EMU} ensures seamless integration with existing KGE models and negative sampling methods. To evaluate its efficacy, we conducted comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets. The results consistently demonstrate significant improvements in link prediction performance across various KGE models and negative sampling methods. Notably, \\textsc{EMU} enables performance improvements comparable to those achieved by models with embedding dimension five times larger.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we develop SE3Set, an SE(3) equivariant hypergraph neural network architecture tailored for advanced molecular representation learning. Hypergraphs are not merely an extension of traditional graphs; they are pivotal for modeling high-order relationships, a capability that conventional equivariant graph-based methods lack due to their inherent limitations in representing intricate many-body interactions. To achieve this, we first construct hypergraphs by proposing a new fragmentation method that considers both chemical and three-dimensional spatial information of the molecular system. We then design SE3Set, which incorporates equivariance into the hypergraph neural network. This ensures that the learned molecular representations are invariant to spatial transformations, thereby providing robustness essential for the accurate prediction of molecular properties. SE3Set has shown performance on par with state-of-the-art (SOTA) models for small molecule datasets like QM9 and MD17. It demonstrates outstanding performance on the MD22 dataset, achieving a remarkable ~20\\% improvement in accuracy across all molecules. Furthermore, on the OE62 dataset, SE3Set outperforms all short-range models. We also conducted a detailed analysis of OE62, highlighting the prevalence of complex many-body interactions in large molecules. This exceptional performance of SE3Set across diverse molecular structures underscores its transformative potential in computational chemistry, offering a route to more accurate and physically nuanced modeling.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Estimating the test performance of a model, possibly under distribution shift, without having access to the ground-truth labels is a challenging, yet very important problem for the safe deployment of machine learning algorithms in the wild. Existing works mostly rely on information from either the outputs or the extracted features of neural networks to estimate a score that correlates with the ground-truth test accuracy. In this paper, we investigate -- both empirically and theoretically -- how the information provided by the gradients can be predictive of the ground-truth test accuracy even under distribution shifts. More specifically, we use the norm of classification-layer gradients, backpropagated from the cross-entropy loss after only one gradient step over test data. Our intuition is that these gradients should be of higher magnitude when the model generalizes poorly. We provide the theoretical insights behind our approach and the key ingredients that ensure its empirical success.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Precise estimation of downstream performance in large language models (LLMs) prior to training is essential for guiding their development process. Scaling laws analysis utilizes the statistics of a series of significantly smaller sampling language models (LMs) to predict the performance of the target LLM. For downstream performance prediction, the critical challenge lies in the emergent abilities in LLMs that occur beyond task-specific computational thresholds. In this work, we focus on the pre-training loss as a more computation-efficient metric for performance estimation. Our two-stage approach FLP consists of first estimating a function that maps computational resources (e.g., FLOPs) to the pre-training Loss using a series of sampling models, followed by mapping the pre-training loss to downstream task Performance after the critical \"emergent phase\". In our experiments, this FLP solution accurately predicts the performance of LLMs with 7B and 13B parameters using a series of sampling LMs up to 3B, achieving error margins of 5% and 10%, respectively, and significantly outperforming the FLOPs-to-Performance approach. Further, we present FLP-M, a fundamental approach for performance prediction that addresses the practical need to integrate datasets from multiple sources during pre-training, specifically blending general corpus with code data to accurately represent the common necessity. FLP-M extends the power law analytical function to predict domain-specific pre-training loss based on FLOPs across data sources, and employs a two-layer neural network to model the non-linear relationship between multiple domain-specific loss and downstream performance. By utilizing a 3B LLM trained on a specific ratio and a series of smaller sampling LMs, FLP-M can effectively forecast the performance of 3B and 7B LLMs across various data mixtures for most benchmarks within 10% error margins",

    "abstract": "Tokenized speech modeling has significantly advanced zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) capabilities. The most de facto approach involves a dual-stage process: text-to-semantic (T2S) followed by semantic-to-acoustic (S2A) generation. Several auto-regressive (AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) methods have been explored in literature for both the stages. While AR models achieve state-of-the-art performance, its token-by-token generation causes inference inefficiencies, while NAR methods while being more efficient, require explicit alignment for upsampling intermediate representations, which constrains the model's capability for more natural prosody. To overcome these issues, we propose an **E**fficient **D**ual-stage **M**asked **TTS** (EDM-TTS) model that employs an alignment-free masked generative approach for the T2S stage that overcomes the constrains of an explicit aligner, while retaining the efficiency of NAR methods.

Our evaluations demonstrated not only the superior inference efficiency of EDM-TTS, but also its state-of-the-art high-quality zero-shot speech quality, naturalness and speaker similarity",

While there exists research on the formal verification of neural networks, there is no work verifying the robustness of generic graph convolutional network architectures with uncertainty in the node features and in the graph structure over multiple message-passing steps.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) attract broad interest in neuromorphic computing but suffer the problem of being difficult to optimize. Concurrently, pre-trained models (PTMs) have become a foundation for developing and applying artificial intelligence. Therefore, it is expected that pre-trained SNNs can alleviate the optimization difficulty of training from scratch. However, with a lot of PTMs available in the model hubs, effectively selecting the most appropriate PTM for a given task remains a significant challenge, often necessitating exhaustive fine-tuning and grid-searching. While several solutions to this challenge have been proposed for the mainstream artificial neural network (ANNs), aimed at developing efficient methods to assess the transferability of PTMs on target tasks, the realm of SNNs remains unexplored. The currently most used transferability assessment method for ANNs predicts transferability in a Bayesian perspective. Feature maps extracted by the PTM backbone on the target task are used to calculate the maximum model evidence as the indicator of transferability. However, ANNs and SNNs differ in architecture, rendering the existing Bayesian method incompatible with SNNs. To solve this problem, this paper introduces a novel approach to using the feature maps averaged over the time domain to calculate maximum evidence. Our proposed $\\textbf{M}$aximum $\\textbf{E}$vidence method with $\\textbf{A}$veraged $\\textbf{F}$eatures (MEAF) demonstrates effectiveness for SNNs. Additionally, the current algorithm calculates maximum evidence in an iterative way. To accelerate the selection of PTMs, an approximation method is proposed to avoid iteration in the calculation of maximum evidence, significantly reducing time consumption. It is shown through experiment that the proposed MEAF method is effective for the transferability assessment of SNNs. MEAF outperforms information theory-based assessment methods such as LEEP and NCE, which can directly adapt to SNNs on neuromorphic datasets, underscoring its potential to streamline PTM selection and application in the realm of SNNs",

    "abstract": "Reward comparisons are vital for evaluating differences in agent behaviors induced by a set of reward functions. Most conventional techniques utilize the input reward functions to learn optimized policies, which are then used to compare agent behaviors. However, learning these policies can be computationally expensive and can also raise safety concerns. Direct reward comparison techniques obviate policy learning but suffer from transition sparsity, where only a small subset of transitions are sampled due to data collection challenges and feasibility constraints. Existing state-of-the-art direct reward comparison methods are ill-suited for these sparse conditions since they require high transition coverage, where the majority of transitions from a given coverage distribution are sampled. When this requirement is not satisfied, a distribution mismatch between sampled and expected transitions can occur, leading to significant errors. This paper introduces the Sparsity Resilient Reward Distance (SRRD) pseudometric, designed to eliminate the need for high transition coverage by accommodating diverse sample distributions, which are common under transition sparsity. We provide theoretical justification for SRRD's robustness and conduct experiments to demonstrate its practical efficacy across multiple domains",

However, the intricate acyclicity constraint still challenges the efficient exploration of the vast space of DAGs in existing methods. In this study, we introduce ALIAS (reinforced dAg Learning wIthout Acyclicity conStraints), a novel approach to causal discovery powered by the RL machinery. Our method features an efficient policy for generating DAGs in just a single step with an optimal quadratic complexity, fueled by a novel parametrization of DAGs that directly translates a continuous space to the space of all DAGs, bypassing the need for explicitly enforcing acyclicity constraints. This approach enables us to navigate the search space more effectively by utilizing policy gradient methods and established scoring functions. In addition, we provide compelling empirical evidence for the strong performance of ALIAS in comparison with state-of-the-arts in causal discovery over increasingly difficult experiment conditions on both synthetic and real datasets.

    "title": "Federated Spectral Graph Transformers Meet Neural Ordinary Differential Equations for Non-IID Graphs",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Graph Neural Network (GNN) research is rapidly advancing due to GNNs' capacity to learn distributed representations from graph-structured data. However, centralizing large volumes of real-world graph data for GNN training is often impractical due to privacy concerns, regulatory restrictions, and commercial competition. Federated learning (FL), a distributed learning paradigm, offers a solution by preserving data privacy with collaborative model training. Despite progress in training huge vision and language models, federated learning for GNNs remains underexplored. To address this challenge, we present a novel method for federated learning on GNNs based on spectral GNNs equipped with neural ordinary differential equations (ODE) for better information capture, showing promising results across both homophilic and heterophilic graphs. Our approach effectively handles non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data, while also achieving performance comparable to existing methods that only operate on IID data. It is designed to be privacy-preserving and bandwidth-optimized, making it suitable for real-world applications such as social network analysis, recommendation systems, and fraud detection, which often involve complex, non-IID, and heterophilic graph structures. Our results in the area of federated learning on non-IID heterophilic graphs demonstrate significant improvements, while also achieving better performance on homophilic graphs. This work highlights the potential of federated learning in diverse and challenging graph settings",

    "title": "ResiDual Transformer Alignment with Spectral Decomposition",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "When examined through the lens of their residual streams, a puzzling property emerges in transformer networks: residual contributions (e.g., attention heads) sometimes specialize in specific tasks or input attributes. In this paper, we analyze this phenomenon in vision transformers, focusing on the spectral geometry of residuals, and explore its implications for modality alignment in vision-language models. First, we link it to the intrinsically low-dimensional structure of visual head representations, zooming into their principal components and showing that they encode specialized roles across a wide variety of input data distributions. Then, we analyze the effect of head specialization in multimodal models, focusing on how improved alignment between text and specialized heads impacts zero-shot classification performance. This specialization-performance link consistently holds across diverse pre-training data, network sizes, and objectives, demonstrating a powerful new mechanism for boosting zero-shot classification through targeted alignment. Ultimately, we translate these insights into actionable terms by introducing ResiDual, a technique for spectral alignment of the residual stream. Much like panning for gold, it lets the noise from irrelevant unit principal components (i.e., attributes) wash away to amplify task-relevant ones. Remarkably, this dual perspective on modality alignment yields fine-tuning level performance on different data distributions while modelling an extremely interpretable and parameter-efficient transformation, as we extensively show on 70 pre-trained network-dataset combinations (7 models, 10 datasets)",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Determining the appropriate rank in Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is a critical challenge that often requires extensive parameter tuning and domain-specific knowledge. Traditional methods for rank determination focus on identifying a single optimal rank, which may not capture the complex structure inherent in real-world datasets. In this study, we introduce a novel approach called Residual Sensitivity to Intial Conditions (RSIC) that suggests potentially multiple ranks of interest by analyzing the sensitivity of the relative residuals (e.g., relative reconstruction error) to different initializations. By computing the Mean Coordinatewise Interquartile Range (MCI) of the residuals across multiple random initializations, our method identifies regions where the NMF solutions are less sensitive to initial conditions and potentially more meaningful. We evaluate RSIC on a diverse set of datasets, including single-cell gene expression data, image data, and text data, and compare it against current state-of-the-art rank determination methods. Our experiments demonstrate that RSIC effectively identifies relevant ranks consistent with the underlying structure of the data, outperforming traditional methods in scenarios where they are computationally infeasible or less accurate. This approach provides a more scalable and generalizable solution for rank determination in NMF that does not rely on domain-specific knowledge or assumptions",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Masked Autoencoder (MAE) is a notable method for self-supervised pretraining in visual representation learning. It operates by randomly masking image patches and reconstructing these masked patches using the unmasked ones. A key limitation of MAE lies in its disregard for the varying informativeness of different patches, as it uniformly selects patches to mask. To overcome this, some approaches propose masking based on patch informativeness. However, these methods often do not consider the specific requirements of downstream tasks, potentially leading to suboptimal representations for these tasks. In response, we introduce the Multi-level Optimized Mask Autoencoder (MLO-MAE), a novel framework that leverages end-to-end feedback from downstream tasks to learn an optimal masking strategy during pretraining. Our experimental findings highlight MLO-MAE's significant advancements in visual representation learning. Compared to existing methods, it demonstrates remarkable improvements across diverse datasets and tasks, showcasing its adaptability and efficiency.

    "abstract": "Multi-agent path planning is important in both multi-agent path finding and multi-agent reinforcement learning areas. However, continual group-wise multi-agent path planning that requires the agents to perform as a team to pursue high team scores instead of individually is less studied. To address this problem, we propose a novel graph potential field-based neural network (GPFNN), which models a valid potential field map for path planning. Our GPFNN unfolds the T-step iterative optimization of the potential field maps as a T-layer feedforward neural network. Thus, a deeper GPFNN leads to more precise potential field maps without the over-smoothing issue. A potential field map inherently provides a monotonic potential flow from any source node to the target nodes to construct the optimal path (w.r.t. the potential decay), equipping our GPFNN with an elegant planning ability. Moreover, we incorporate dynamically updated boundary conditions into our GPFNN to address group-wise multi-agent path planning that supports both static targets and dynamic moving targets. Empirically, experiments on three different-sized mazes (up to $1025 \\times 1025$ sized mazes) with up to 1,000 agents demonstrate the planning ability of our GPFNN to handle both static and dynamic moving targets. Experiments on extensive graph node classification tasks on six graph datasets (up to millions of nodes) demonstrate the learning ability of our GPFNN",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In this work, we examine the impact of inter-patch dependencies in the decoder of masked autoencoders (MAE) on representation learning. We decompose the decoding mechanism for masked reconstruction into self-attention between mask tokens and cross-attention between masked and visible tokens. Our findings reveal that MAE reconstructs coherent images from visible patches not through interactions between patches in the decoder but by learning a global representation within the encoder. This discovery leads us to propose a simple visual pretraining framework: cross-attention masked autoencoders (CrossMAE). This framework employs only cross-attention in the decoder to independently read out reconstructions for a small subset of masked patches from encoder outputs. This approach achieves comparable or superior performance to traditional MAE across models ranging from ViT-S to ViT-H and significantly reduces computational requirements. By its design, CrossMAE challenges the necessity of interaction between mask tokens for effective masked pretraining. Code and models are publicly available: https://crossmae.github.io/",

We present the first comprehensive evaluation of these models on the fundamental tasks of planning and scheduling. Previous research attempted to use LLMs' expressive generation capabilities to solve these problems, but met with only limited success. We fill in the gaps in this literature by testing a larger suite of state-of-the-art LLMs on a set of large benchmarks, and then use this as a baseline to evaluate o1-preview and o1-mini. We see that while they can offer significant accuracy improvements over LLMs, this single metric is misleading and incomplete, as LRM queries demand large and unpredictable costs and take significant amounts of time to complete. We provide a case study demonstrating that, at those same price points, other methods of inference time scaling can do just as well. We also show that, contrary to OpenAI's injunctions, o1's performance can be improved further by embedding it in compound systems that separately, but complementarily, scale inference time further. Finally, while the paper is focused on o1, we provide similar evaluations of a more recent (and open-weight) LRM -- DeepSeek R1",

Hence, it is essential for computer vision systems to reflect and exploit this compositionality to achieve robust and generalizable scene understanding. While major strides have been made toward the development of general-purpose, multimodal generative models, including both text-to-image models and multimodal vision-language models, it remains unclear whether these systems are capable of accurately generating and interpreting scenes involving the composition of multiple objects and relations. In this work, we present an evaluation of the compositional visual processing capabilities in the current generation of text-to-image (DALL-E 3) and multimodal vision-language models (GPT-4V, GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 3.5, QWEN2-VL-72B, and InternVL2.5-38B), and compare the performance of these systems to human participants. The results suggest that these systems display some ability to solve compositional and relational tasks, showing notable improvements over the previous generation of multimodal models, but with performance nevertheless well below the level of human participants, particularly for more complex scenes involving many (>5) objects and multiple relations. These results highlight the need for further progress toward compositional understanding of visual scenes",

WANN also exhibits superior generalization on imbalanced data compared to both Adaptive-NNs (ANN) and fixed k-NNs.

However, in many settings where both satisfaction and optimality conditions are present, LTL is insufficient to capture both. Instead, LTL-constrained policy optimization, where the goal is to optimize a scalar reward under LTL constraints, is needed. This constrained optimization problem proves difficult in deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) settings, where learned policies often ignore the LTL constraint due to the sparse nature of LTL satisfaction. To alleviate the sparsity issue, we introduce Cycle Experience Replay (CyclER), a novel reward shaping technique that exploits the underlying structure of the LTL constraint to guide a policy towards satisfaction by encouraging partial behaviors compliant with the constraint. We provide a theoretical guarantee that optimizing CyclER will achieve policies that satisfy the LTL constraint with near-optimal probability. We evaluate CyclER in three continuous control domains. Our experimental results show that optimizing CyclER in tandem with the existing scalar reward outperforms existing reward-shaping methods at finding performant LTL-satisfying policies",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Meta-learning is an effective method to handle imbalanced and noisy-label learning, but it generally depends on a clean validation set. Unfortunately, this validation set has poor scalability when the number of classes increases, as traditionally these samples need to be randomly selected, manually labelled and balanced-distributed. This problem therefore has motivated the development of meta-learning methods to automatically select validation samples that are likely to have clean labels and balanced class distribution. Unfortunately, a common missing point of existing meta-learning methods for noisy label learning is the lack of consideration for data informativeness when constructing the validation set. The construction of an informative validation set requires hard samples, i.e., samples that the model has low confident prediction, but these samples are more likely to be noisy, which can degrade the meta reweighting process. Therefore, the balance between sample informativeness and cleanness is an important criteria for validation set optimization. In this paper, we propose new criteria to characterise the utility of such meta-learning validation sets, based on: 1) sample informativeness; 2) balanced class distribution; and 3) label cleanliness. We also introduce a new imbalanced noisy-label meta-learning (INOLML) algorithm that auto- matically builds a validation set by maximising such utility criteria.

Unlike previous works that employ an open-loop approach via pre-defined prompts to generate new data using either a language model or human expertise, we develop an automated closed-loop system that involves two feedback mechanisms. The first mechanism uses feedback from a given supervised model to find adversarial prompts that result in generated images that maximize the model's loss and, consequently, expose its vulnerabilities. While these adversarial prompts generate training examples curated for improving the given model, they are not curated for a specific target distribution of interest, which can be inefficient. Therefore, we introduce the second feedback mechanism that can optionally guide the generation process towards a desirable target distribution. We call the method combining these two mechanisms Guided Adversarial Prompts. The proposed closed-loop system allows us to control the training data generation for a given model and target image distribution. We evaluate on different tasks, datasets, and architectures, with different types of distribution shifts (corruptions, spurious correlations, unseen domains) and illustrate the advantages of the proposed feedback mechanisms compared to open-loop approaches",

    "abstract": "Stochastic heavy ball momentum (SHB) is commonly used to train machine learning models, and often provides empirical improvements over stochastic gradient descent. By primarily focusing on strongly-convex quadratics, we aim to better understand the theoretical advantage of SHB and subsequently improve the method. For strongly-convex quadratics, Kidambi et al. (2018) show that SHB (with a mini-batch of size $1$) cannot attain accelerated convergence, and hence has no theoretical benefit over SGD. They conjecture that the practical gain of SHB is a by-product of using larger mini-batches. We first substantiate this claim by showing that SHB can attain an accelerated rate when the mini-batch size is larger than a threshold $b^*$ that depends on the condition number $\\kappa$. Specifically, we prove that with the same step-size and momentum parameters as in the deterministic setting, SHB with a sufficiently large mini-batch size results in an $O\\left(\\exp(-\\frac{T}{\\sqrt{\\kappa}}) + \\sigma \\right)$ convergence when measuring the distance to the optimal solution in the $\\ell_2$ norm, where $T$ is the number of iterations and $\\sigma^2$ is the variance in the stochastic gradients. We prove a lower-bound which demonstrates that a $\\kappa$ dependence in $b^*$ is necessary. To ensure convergence to the minimizer, we design a noise-adaptive multi-stage algorithm that results in an $O\\left(\\exp\\left(-\\frac{T}{\\sqrt{\\kappa}}\\right) + \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{T}}\\right)$ rate when measuring the distance to the optimal solution in the $\\ell_2$ norm.

For instance, the learning fails when the underlying distribution is actually a mixture of distributions with contradictory labels. Learning also fails if there is a shift between train and test distributions. Standard neural network architectures like MLPs or CNNs are not equipped to handle this. In this article, we propose a simple activation function, quantile activation (QAct), that addresses this problem without significantly increasing computational costs. The core idea is to \"adapt\" the outputs of each neuron to its context distribution. The proposed quantile activation (QAct) outputs the relative quantile position of neuron activations within their context distribution, diverging from the direct numerical outputs common in traditional networks. A specific case of the above failure mode is when there is an inherent distribution shift, i.e the test distribution differs slightly from the train distribution. We validate the proposed activation function under covariate shifts, using datasets designed to test robustness against distortions. Our results demonstrate significantly better generalisation across distortions compared to conventional classifiers and other adaptive methods, across various architectures. Although this paper presents a proof of concept, we find that this approach unexpectedly outperforms DINOv2 (small), despite DINOv2 being trained with a much larger network and dataset",

    "title": "GOTHAM: Graph Class Incremental Learning Framework under Weak Supervision",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Graphs are growing rapidly and so are the number of different categories associated with it. Applications like e-commerce, healthcare, recommendation systems, and various social media platforms are rapidly moving towards graph representation of data due to their ability to capture both structural and attribute information. One crucial task in graph analysis is node classification, where unlabeled nodes are categorized into predefined classes. In practice, novel classes appear incrementally sometimes with just a few labels (seen classes) or even without any labels (unseen classes), either because they are new or haven't been explored much. Traditional methods assume abundant labeled data for training, which isn't always feasible. We investigate a broader objective: Graph Class Incremental Learning under Weak Supervision (GCL), addressing this challenge by meta-training on base classes with limited labeled instances. During the incremental streams, novel classes can have few-shot or zero-shot representation. Our proposed framework GOTHAM efficiently accommodates these unlabeled nodes by finding the closest prototype representation, serving as class representatives in the attribute space. For Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs), our framework additionally incorporates semantic information to enhance the representation. By employing teacher-student knowledge distillation to mitigate forgetting, GOTHAM achieves promising results across various tasks. Experiments on datasets such as Cora-ML, Amazon, and OBGN-Arxiv showcase the effectiveness of our approach in handling evolving graph data under limited supervision",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recent advancements in zero-shot video diffusion models have shown promise for text-driven video editing, but challenges remain in achieving high temporal consistency. To address this, we introduce Video-3DGS, a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based video refiner designed to enhance temporal consistency in zero-shot video editors. Our approach utilizes a two-stage 3D Gaussian optimizing process tailored for editing dynamic monocular videos. In the first stage, Video-3DGS employs an improved version of COLMAP, referred to as MC-COLMAP, which processes original videos using a Masked and Clipped approach. For each video clip, MC-COLMAP generates the point clouds for dynamic foreground objects and complex backgrounds. These point clouds are utilized to initialize two sets of 3D Gaussians (Frg-3DGS and Bkg-3DGS) aiming to represent foreground and background views. Both foreground and background views are then merged with a 2D learnable parameter map to reconstruct full views. In the second stage, we leverage the reconstruction ability developed in the first stage to impose the temporal constraints on the video diffusion model. This approach ensures the temporal consistency in the edited videos while maintaining high fidelity to the editing text prompt. We further propose a recursive and ensembled refinement by revisiting the denoising step and guidance scale used in video diffusion process with Video-3DGS. To demonstrate the efficacy of Video-3DGS on both stages, we conduct extensive experiments across two related tasks: Video Reconstruction and Video Editing. Video-3DGS trained with 3k iterations significantly improves video reconstruction quality (+3 PSNR, +7 PSNR increase) and training efficiency (×1.9, ×4.5 times faster) over NeRF-based and 3DGS-based state-of-art methods on DAVIS dataset, respectively. Moreover, it enhances video editing by ensuring temporal consistency across 58 dynamic monocular videos",

Trend filtering is a nonparametric regression technique that has gained popularity for its simple formulation and local adaptability. Bayesian adaptations of trend filtering have been proposed as an alternative method, while they often rely on computationally intensive sampling-based methods for posterior inference. We propose an empirical Bayes trend filtering (EBTF) that leverages shrinkage priors, estimated through an empirical Bayes procedure by maximizing the marginal likelihood. To address the computational challenges posed by large datasets, we implement a variational inference algorithm for posterior computation, ensuring scalability and efficiency. Our framework is flexible, allowing the incorporation of various shrinkage priors, and optimizes the level of smoothness directly from the data. We also discuss alternative formulations of the EBTF model, along with their pros and cons. We demonstrate the performance of our EBTF method through comprehensive simulations and real-world data applications, highlighting its ability to maintain computational efficiency while providing accurate trend estimation",

In this paper, we introduce a post-processing method for multi-output models, such as the ones used for multi-task/multi-class classification and representation learning, to enhance a model's distributional parity, a task-agnostic fairness measure. Existing methods for achieving distributional parity rely on the (inverse) cumulative density function of a model's output, restricting their applicability to single-output models. Extending previous works, we propose to employ optimal transport mappings to move a model's outputs across different groups towards their empirical Wasserstein barycenter. An approximation technique is applied to reduce the complexity of computing the exact barycenter and a kernel regression method is proposed to extend this process to out-of-sample data. Our empirical studies evaluate the proposed approach against various baselines on multi-task/multi-class classification and representation learning tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Open Domain Generalization (ODG) addresses the challenges posed by domain and category shifts between labeled training sources and unlabeled target domains. Current state-of-the-art methods struggle with the limitations of traditional CNN backbones, leading to reduced generalization and increased error rates in detecting target open samples without prior knowledge. Additionally, recent CLIP-based prompt learning approaches fail to distinguish between known and unknown classes effectively, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose MetaPrompt, which leverages the semantic strengths of the vision-language model CLIP and the ''learning-to-learn'' capabilities of Meta-Learning to achieve robust generalization across domain and category shifts. Our framework introduces three key innovations: First, we approach ODG as a multi-class classification problem that includes both known and novel categories, designing novel prompts capable of detecting unknown class samples across multiple domains. These prompts are trained using Meta-Learning with momentum updates, enabling smooth and accurate differentiation between known and unknown classes. Second, we introduce a novel domain-agnostic semantic attention-based prompt alongside domain-focused prompts to enhance robustness in classifying unknown classes across various domains. Finally, we incorporate an unsupervised contrastive loss during episodic Meta-Training, which reinforces the boundaries in the metric space between known and unknown classes, thereby enhancing ''unknown'' class awareness in the prompts. MetaPrompt has demonstrated its superiority through extensive testing on diverse datasets, excelling in both closed and open-set DG scenarios and consistently outperforming existing solutions",

    "abstract": "Large-scale machine learning (ML) models are increasingly being used in critical domains like education, lending, recruitment, healthcare, criminal justice, etc. However, the training, deployment, and utilization of these models demand substantial computational resources. To decrease computation and memory costs, machine learning models with sparse weight matrices are widely used in the literature. Among sparse models, those with special sparse structures (e.g., models with block-wise sparse weight matrices) fit better with the hardware accelerators and can decrease the memory and computation costs during the inference. Unfortunately, while there are several efficient training methods, none of them are designed to train a block-wise sparse model efficiently. As a result, the current methods for training block-wise sparse models start with full and dense models leading to inefficient training. In this work, we focus on training models with \\textit{block-wise sparse matrices} and propose an efficient training algorithm to decrease both computation and memory costs during training and inference. In addition, we will show that our proposed method enables us to efficiently find the right block size for the sparsity pattern during the training process. Our extensive empirical and theoretical analyses show that our algorithms can decrease the computation and memory costs significantly without a performance drop compared to baselines",

CoACT consists of three key components: (i) asynchronous contrastive tuning, which learns new classes by including LoRA modules in the pre-trained encoder while enforcing consistency between two asynchronous encoders; (ii) controlled fine-tuning, which facilitates effective tuning of a subset of the foundation model; and (iii) consistency-guided incremental tuning, which enforces additional regularization during later sessions to reduce forgetting of the learned classes. We evaluate our proposed solution on Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) as well as a new and more challenging setup called Few-Shot Class-Incremental Tuning (FSCIT), which facilitates the continual tuning of vision foundation models to learn new classes with only a few samples per class. Unlike traditional FSCIL, FSCIT does not require a large in-distribution base session for initial fully supervised training prior to the incremental few-shot sessions. We conduct extensive evaluations across 16 diverse datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of CoACT in both FSCIL and FSCIT setups. CoACT outperforms existing methods by up to 5.02% in FSCIL and up to 12.51% in FSCIT for individual datasets, with an average improvement of 2.47%.

    "abstract": "Literature reviews are an essential component of scientific research, but they remain time-intensive and challenging to write, especially due to the recent influx of research papers. This paper explores the zero-shot abilities of recent Large Language Models (LLMs) in assisting with the writing of literature reviews based on an abstract. We decompose the task into two components: (1) Retrieving related works given a query abstract and (2) Writing a literature review based on the retrieved results. We analyze how effective LLMs are for both components. For retrieval, we introduce a novel two-step search strategy that first uses an LLM to extract meaningful keywords from the abstract of a paper and then retrieves potentially relevant papers by querying an external knowledge base. Additionally, we study a prompting-based re-ranking mechanism with attribution and show that re-ranking doubles the normalized recall compared to naive search methods while providing insights into the LLM's decision-making process. In the generation phase, we propose a two-step approach that first outlines a plan for the review and then executes steps in the plan to generate the actual review. To evaluate different LLM-based literature review methods, we create test sets from arXiv papers using a protocol designed for rolling use with newly released LLMs to avoid test set contamination in zero-shot evaluations. We release this evaluation protocol to promote additional research and development in this regard. Our empirical results suggest that LLMs show promising potential for writing literature reviews when the task is decomposed into smaller components of retrieval and planning. Particularly, we find that combining keyword-based and document-embedding-based search improves precision and recall during retrieval by 10% and 30%, respectively, compared to using either of the methods in isolation. Further, we demonstrate that our planning-based approach achieves higher-quality reviews by minimizing hallucinated references in the generated review by 18-26% compared to existing simpler LLM-based generation methods.

To address this limitation, we present DeformTime, a neural network architecture that attempts to capture correlated temporal patterns from the input space, and hence, improve forecasting accuracy. It deploys two core operations performed by deformable attention blocks (DABs): learning dependencies across variables from different time steps (variable DAB), and preserving temporal dependencies in data from previous time steps (temporal DAB). Input data transformation is explicitly designed to enhance learning from the deformed series of information while passing through a DAB. We conduct extensive experiments on 6 MTS data sets, using previously established benchmarks as well as challenging infectious disease modelling tasks with more exogenous variables. The results demonstrate that DeformTime improves accuracy against previous competitive methods across the vast majority of MTS forecasting tasks, reducing the mean absolute error by 7.2% on average.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) addresses the challenge of learning a label prediction function for an unlabeled target domain by leveraging both the labeled data from multiple source domains and the unlabeled data from the target domain. Conventional MSDA approaches often rely on covariate shift or conditional shift paradigms, which assume a consistent label distribution across domains. However, this assumption proves limiting in practical scenarios where label distributions do vary across domains, diminishing its applicability in real-world settings. For example, animals from different regions exhibit diverse characteristics due to varying diets and genetics. Motivated by this, we propose a novel paradigm called latent covariate shift (LCS), which introduces significantly greater variability and adaptability across domains. Notably, it provides a theoretical assurance for recovering the latent cause of the label variable, which we refer to as the latent content variable. Within this new paradigm, we present an intricate causal generative model by introducing latent noises across domains, along with a latent content variable and a latent style variable to achieve more nuanced rendering of observational data. We demonstrate that the latent content variable can be identified up to block identifiability due to its versatile yet distinct causal structure. We anchor our theoretical insights into a novel MSDA method, which learns the label distribution conditioned on the identifiable latent content variable, thereby accommodating more substantial distribution shifts.

We initialize policies with VLMs by using them as promptable representations: embeddings that encode semantic features of visual observations based on the VLM's internal knowledge and reasoning capabilities, as elicited through prompts that provide task context and auxiliary information. We evaluate our approach on visually-complex, long horizon RL tasks in Minecraft and robot navigation in Habitat. We find that our policies trained on embeddings from off-the-shelf, general-purpose VLMs outperform equivalent policies trained on generic, non-promptable image embeddings. We also find our approach outperforms instruction-following methods and performs comparably to domain-specific embeddings.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We study the fundamental optimization principles of self-attention, the defining mechanism of transformers, by analyzing the implicit bias of gradient-based optimizers in training a self-attention layer with a linear decoder in binary classification. Building on prior studies in linear logistic regression, recent findings demonstrate that the key-query matrix $W_t$ from gradient-descent (GD) converges in direction towards $W_{mm}$, which maximizes the margin between optimal and non-optimal tokens across sequences. However, this convergence is local, dependent on initial conditions, only holds asymptotically as the number of iterations increases, and leaves questions about the potential benefits of adaptive step-size rules unaddressed. To bridge this gap, we first establish scenarios for which convergence is provably global. We then analyze two adaptive step-size strategies: normalized GD and Polyak step-size, demonstrating finite-time convergence rates for $W_t$ to $W_{mm}$, and quantifying the sparsification rate of the attention map. These findings not only show that these strategies can accelerate parameter convergence over standard GD in a non-convex setting but also deepen the understanding of the implicit bias in self-attention, linking it more closely to the phenomena observed in linear logistic regression despite its intricate non-convex nature",

    "title": "Decomposing The Dark Matter of Sparse Autoencoders",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are a promising technique for decomposing language model activations into interpretable linear features. However, current SAEs fall short of completely explaining model performance, resulting in ``dark matter'': unexplained variance in activations. This work investigates dark matter as an object of study in its own right. Surprisingly, we find that much of SAE dark matter---about half of the error vector itself and $>90\\% $ of its norm---can be linearly predicted from the initial activation vector. Additionally, we find that the scaling behavior of SAE error norms at a per token level is remarkably predictable: larger SAEs mostly struggle to reconstruct the same contexts as smaller SAEs. We build on the linear representation hypothesis to propose models of activations that might lead to these observations, including postulating a new type of ``introduced error''; these insights imply that the part of the SAE error vector that cannot be linearly predicted (``nonlinear'' error) might be fundamentally different from the linearly predictable component. To validate this hypothesis, we empirically analyze nonlinear SAE error and show that 1) it contains fewer not yet learned features, 2) SAEs trained on it are quantitatively worse, 3) it helps predict SAE per-token scaling behavior, and 4) it is responsible for a proportional amount of the downstream increase in cross entropy loss when SAE activations are inserted into the model. Finally, we examine two methods to reduce nonlinear SAE error: inference time gradient pursuit, which leads to a very slight decrease in nonlinear error, and linear transformations from earlier layer SAE outputs, which leads to a larger reduction",

    "abstract": "Forecasting the change in the distribution of viral variants is crucial for therapeutic design and disease surveillance. This task poses significant modeling challenges due to the sharp differences in virus distributions across sub-populations (e.g., countries) and their dynamic interactions. Existing machine learning approaches that model the variant distribution as a whole are incapable of making location-specific predictions and ignore transmissions that shape the viral landscape. In this paper, we propose a sub-population specific protein evolution model, which predicts the time-resolved distributions of viral proteins in different locations. The algorithm explicitly models the transmission rates between sub-populations and learns their interdependence from data. The change in protein distributions across all sub-populations is defined through a linear ordinary differential equation (ODE) parametrized by transmission rates. Solving this ODE yields the likelihood of a given protein occurring in particular sub-populations. Multi-year evaluation on both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A/H3N2 demonstrates that our model outperforms baselines in accurately predicting distributions of viral proteins across continents and countries. We also find that the transmission rates learned from data are consistent with the transmission pathways discovered by retrospective phylogenetic analysis",

    "abstract": "Applying learning-based approaches to long-horizon sequential decision-making tasks requires a human teacher to carefully craft reward functions or curate demonstrations to elicit desired behaviors. To simplify this, we first introduce an alternative form of task-specification, Illustrated Landmark Graph (ILG), that represents the task as a directed graph where each vertex corresponds to a region of the state space (a landmark), and each edge represents an easier to achieve sub-task. A landmark in the ILG is conveyed to the agent through a few illustrative examples grounded in the agent's observation space. Second, we propose ILG-Learn, a human in the loop algorithm that interleaves planning over the ILG and sub-task policy learning. ILG-Learn adaptively plans through the ILG by relying on the human teacher's feedback to estimate the success rates of learned policies. We conduct experiments on long-horizon block stacking and point maze navigation tasks, and find that our approach achieves considerably higher success rates (~ 50% improvement) compared to hierarchical reinforcement learning and imitation learning baselines. Additionally, we highlight how the flexibility of the ILG specification allows the agent to learn a sequence of sub-tasks that is better suited to its limited capabilities",

In this work, we propose gradient-ascent algorithms to compute the leader's optimal incentive design, despite the lack of knowledge about the follower's reward function. First, we formulate the incentive design problem as a bi-level optimization problem and demonstrate that, by the softmax temporal consistency between the follower's policy and value function, the bi-level optimization problem can be reduced to single-level optimization, for which a gradient-based algorithm can be developed to optimize the leader's objective. We establish several key properties of incentive design in MDPs and prove the convergence of the proposed gradient-based method. Next, we show that the gradient terms can be estimated from observations of the follower's best response policy, enabling the use of a stochastic gradient-ascent algorithm to compute a locally optimal incentive design without knowing or learning the follower's reward function. Finally, we analyze the conditions under which an incentive design remains optimal for two different rewards which are policy invariant.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "High sample complexity hampers the successful application of reinforcement learning methods, especially in real-world problems where simulating complex dynamics is computationally demanding. Influence-based abstraction (IBA) was proposed to mitigate this issue by breaking down the global model of large-scale distributed systems, such as traffic control problems, into small local sub-models. Each local model includes only a few state variables and a representation of the influence exerted by the external portion of the system. This approach allows converting a complex simulator into local lightweight simulators, enabling more effective applications of planning and reinforcement learning methods. However, the effectiveness of IBA critically depends on the ability to accurately approximate the influence of each local model. While there are a few examples showing promising results in benchmark problems, the question of whether this approach is feasible in more practical scenarios remains open. In this work, we take steps towards addressing this question by conducting an extensive empirical study of learning models for influence approximations in various realistic domains, and evaluating how these models generalize over long horizons. We find that learning the influence is often a manageable learning task, even for complex and large systems. Additionally, we demonstrate the efficacy of the approximation models for long-horizon problems. By using short trajectories, we can learn accurate influence approximations for much longer horizons",

    "abstract": "To comply with AI and data regulations, the need to forget private or copyrighted information from trained machine learning models is increasingly important. The key challenge in unlearning is forgetting the necessary data in a timely manner, while preserving model performance. In this work, we address the zero-shot unlearning scenario, whereby an unlearning algorithm must be able to remove data given only a trained model and the data to be forgotten. We explore unlearning from an information theoretic perspective, connecting the influence of a sample to the information gain a model receives by observing it. From this, we derive a simple but principled zero-shot unlearning method based on the geometry of the model. Our approach takes the form of minimising the gradient of a learned function with respect to a small neighbourhood around a target forget point. This induces a smoothing effect, causing forgetting by moving the boundary of the classifier. We explore the intuition behind why this approach can jointly unlearn forget samples while preserving general model performance through a series of low-dimensional experiments. We perform extensive empirical evaluation of our method over a range of contemporary benchmarks, verifying that our method is competitive with state-of-the-art performance under the strict constraints of zero-shot unlearning",

This situation is reminiscent of what has been observed in cortical sensory areas, where neuronal ensembles are suggested to serve as the functional building blocks for perception and action.

Furthermore, PNO requires minimal adjustment to existing architectures, shows improved performance for most probabilistic prediction tasks, and leads to well-calibrated predictive distributions and adequate uncertainty representations even for long dynamical trajectories.

However, due to their combinatorial nature, mixed-integer linear programs (MILPs) can be difficult to solve, rendering them often unsuitable for time-critical online applications. To address this challenge, we develop a data-driven approach for constructing surrogate optimization models in the form of linear programs (LPs) that can be solved much more efficiently than the corresponding MILPs. We train these surrogate LPs in a decision-focused manner such that for different model inputs, they achieve the same or close to the same optimal solutions as the original MILPs. One key advantage of the proposed method is that it allows the incorporation of all of the original MILP's linear constraints, which significantly increases the likelihood of obtaining feasible predicted solutions. Results from two computational case studies indicate that this decision-focused surrogate modeling approach is highly data-efficient and provides very accurate predictions of the optimal solutions. In these examples, the resulting surrogate LPs outperform state-of-the-art neural-network-based optimization proxies",

We introduce a benchmark (LongICLBench) for long in-context learning in extreme-label classification using six datasets with 28 to 174 classes and input lengths from 2K to 50K tokens.

However, they struggle with more challenging task like Discovery with 174 labels, suggesting a gap in their ability to process long, context-rich sequences. Further analysis reveals a bias towards labels presented later in the sequence and a need for improved reasoning over multiple pieces of information.

To mitigate this issue, we propose four different methods that utilize meta-data from various environments. These approaches are novel in that they adapt meta-learning methods to accommodate the time-varying setting.

We propose an MDP framework, \\emph{Directed Acyclic Markov Decision Process} (DAMDP) that formalises this problem, and we develop algorithms to perform planning and learning. Crucially, DAMDPs retain many of the benefits of MDPs, as we can show that Dynamic Programming can find the optimal policy in known DAMDPs. We also demonstrate how to perform Reinforcement Learning in DAMDPs when the transition probabilities and the reward function are unknown. To this end, we derive a posterior sampling-based algorithm that is able to leverage the graph structure to boost learning efficiency. Moreover, we obtain a theoretical bound on the Bayesian regret for this algorithm, which directly shows the efficiency gain from considering the graph structure.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Learning with Errors (LWE) is a hard math problem underlying recently standardized post-quantum cryptography (PQC) systems for key exchange and digital signatures. Prior work proposed new machine learning (ML)-based attacks on LWE problems with small, sparse secrets, but these attacks require millions of LWE samples to train on and take days to recover secrets. We propose three key methods---better preprocessing, angular embeddings and model pre-training---to improve these attacks, speeding up preprocessing by $25\\times$ and improving model sample efficiency by $10\\times$. We demonstrate for the first time that pre-training improves and reduces the cost of ML attacks on LWE. Our architecture improvements enable scaling to larger-dimension LWE problems: this work is the first instance of ML attacks recovering sparse binary secrets in dimension $n=1024$, the smallest dimension used in practice for homomorphic encryption applications of LWE where sparse binary secrets are proposed, albeit for larger modulus $q$. Our ML-based approach is the only attack which has successfully recovered secrets for these parameters",

    "title": "What's Left After Distillation? How Knowledge Transfer Impacts Fairness and Bias",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Knowledge Distillation is a commonly used Deep Neural Network (DNN) compression method, which often maintains overall generalization performance. However, we show that even for balanced image classification datasets, such as CIFAR-100, Tiny ImageNet and ImageNet, as many as 41% of the classes are statistically significantly affected by distillation when comparing class-wise accuracy (i.e. class bias) between a teacher/distilled student or distilled student/non-distilled student model. Changes in class bias are not necessarily an undesirable outcome when considered outside of the context of a model's usage. Using two common fairness metrics, Demographic Parity Difference (DPD) and Equalized Odds Difference (EOD) on models trained with the CelebA, Trifeature, and HateXplain datasets, our results suggest that increasing the distillation temperature improves the distilled student model's fairness, and the distilled student fairness can even surpass the fairness of the teacher model at high temperatures. Additionally, we examine individual fairness, ensuring similar instances receive similar predictions. Our results confirm that higher temperatures also improve the distilled student model's individual fairness. This study highlights the uneven effects of distillation on certain classes and its potentially significant role in fairness, emphasizing that caution is warranted when using distilled models for sensitive application domains",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is a rapidly growing research field that has achieved outstanding results across a variety of challenging cooperation tasks. However, existing MARL algorithms typically overlook the concurrent updates of teammate agents. An agent always learns from the data that it cooperates with one set of (current) teammates, but then practices with another set of (updated) teammates. This phenomenon, termed as ``teammate delay'', leads to a discrepancy between the agent's learning objective and the actual evaluation scenario, which can degrade learning stability and efficiency. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by introducing a lookahead strategy that enables agents to learn to cooperate with predicted future teammates, allowing the explicit awareness of concurrent teammate updates. This lookahead strategy is designed to seamlessly integrate with existing policy-gradient-based MARL methods, enhancing their performance without significant modifications to their underlying structures. The extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, showing that the lookahead strategy can enhance the cooperation learning efficiency and achieve superior performance over the state-of-the-art MARL algorithms",

    "abstract": "Efficiently training a multi-task neural solver for various combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) has been less studied so far. Naive application of conventional multi-task learning approaches often falls short in delivering a high-quality, unified neural solver. This deficiency primarily stems from the significant computational demands and a lack of adequate consideration for the complexities inherent in COPs. In this paper, we propose a general and efficient training paradigm to deliver a unified combinarotial multi-task neural solver. To this end, we resort to the theoretical loss decomposition for multiple tasks under an encoder-decoder framework, which enables more efficient training via proper bandit task-sampling algorithms through an intra-task influence matrix. By employing theoretically grounded approximations, our method significantly enhances overall performance, regardless of whether it is within constrained training budgets, across equivalent training epochs, or in terms of generalization capabilities, when compared to conventional training schedules. On the real-world datasets of TSPLib and CVRPLib, our method also achieved the best results compared to single task learning and multi-task learning approaches. Additionally, the influence matrix provides empirical evidence supporting common practices in the field of learning to optimize, further substantiating the effectiveness of our approach.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Graph Transformers (GTs) have recently demonstrated strong capabilities for capturing complex relationships in graph-structured data using global self-attention mechanisms. On the other hand, their high memory requirements during inference remain a challenge for practical deployment. In this study, we investigate the existence of strong lottery tickets (SLTs) — subnetworks within randomly initialized neural networks that can attain competitive accuracy without weight training — in GTs. Previous studies have explored SLTs in message-passing neural networks (MPNNs), showing that SLTs not only exist in MPNNs but also help mitigate over-smoothing problems and improve robustness. However, the potential of SLTs in GTs remains unexplored. With GTs having 4.5$\\times$ more parameters than MPNNs, SLTs hold even greater application value in this context. We find that fixed random weights with a traditional SLT search method cannot adapt to imbalances of features in GTs, leading to highly biased attention that destabilizes model performance. To overcome this issue and efficiently search for SLTs, we introduce a novel approach called Adaptive Scaling. We empirically confirm the existence of SLTs within GTs and demonstrate their versatility through extensive experiments across different GT architectures, including NodeFormer, GRIT, and GraphGPS. Our findings demonstrate that SLTs achieve comparable accuracy while reducing memory usage by 2--32$\\times$, effectively generalize to out-of-distribution data, and enhance robustness against adversarial perturbations. This work highlights that SLTs offer a resource-efficient approach to improving the scalability, efficiency, and robustness of GTs, with broad implications for applications involving graph data",

    "title": "FRAP: Faithful and Realistic Text-to-Image Generation with Adaptive Prompt Weighting",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating high-quality images given a text prompt. However, ensuring the prompt-image alignment remains a considerable challenge, i.e., generating images that faithfully align with the prompt's semantics. Recent works attempt to improve the faithfulness by optimizing the latent code, which potentially could cause the latent code to go out-of-distribution and thus produce unrealistic images. In this paper, we propose FRAP, a simple, yet effective approach based on adaptively adjusting the per-token prompt weights to improve prompt-image alignment and authenticity of the generated images. We design an online algorithm to adaptively update each token's weight coefficient, which is achieved by minimizing a unified objective function that encourages object presence and the binding of object-modifier pairs. Through extensive evaluations, we show FRAP generates images with significantly higher prompt-image alignment to prompts from complex datasets, while having a lower average latency compared to recent latent code optimization methods, e.g., 4 seconds faster than D&B on the COCO-Subject dataset. Furthermore, through visual comparisons and evaluation of the CLIP-IQA-Real metric, we show that FRAP not only improves prompt-image alignment but also generates more authentic images with realistic appearances. We also explore combining FRAP with prompt rewriting LLM to recover their degraded prompt-image alignment, where we observe improvements in both prompt-image alignment and image quality.

    "abstract": "Multi-task learning (MTL) is a machine learning paradigm that aims to improve the generalization performance of a model on multiple related tasks by training it simultaneously on those tasks. Unlike MTL, where the model has instant access to the training data of all tasks, continual learning (CL) involves adapting to new sequentially arriving tasks over time without forgetting the previously acquired knowledge. Despite the wide practical adoption of CL and MTL and extensive literature on both areas, there remains a gap in the theoretical understanding of these methods when used with overparameterized models such as deep neural networks. This paper studies the overparameterized linear models as a proxy for more complex models. We develop theoretical results describing the effect of various system parameters on the model's performance in an MTL setup. Specifically, we study the impact of model size, dataset size, and task similarity on the generalization error and knowledge transfer. Additionally, we present theoretical results to characterize the performance of replay-based CL models. Our results reveal the impact of buffer size and model capacity on the forgetting rate in a CL setup and help shed light on some of the state-of-the-art CL methods. Finally, through extensive empirical evaluations, we demonstrate that our theoretical findings are also applicable to deep neural networks, offering valuable guidance for designing MTL and CL models in practice",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a pivotal framework for the development of effective global models (global FL) or personalized models (personalized FL) across clients with heterogeneous, non-iid data distribution. A key challenge in FL is client drift, where data heterogeneity impedes the aggregation of scattered knowledge. Recent studies have tackled the client drift issue by identifying significant divergence in the last linear (classifier) layer. To mitigate this divergence, strategies such as freezing the classifier weights and aligning the feature extractor accordingly have proven effective. Although the local alignment between classifier and feature extractor has been studied as a crucial factor in FL, we observe that it may lead the model to overemphasize the observed classes and underestimate the unobserved classes within each client. Therefore, our goals are twofold: (1) improving local alignment and (2) maintaining the representation of unseen class samples, ensuring that the solution seamlessly incorporates knowledge from individual clients, thus enhancing performance in both global and personalized FL. To achieve this, we introduce a novel algorithm named FedDr+, which empowers local model alignment using dot-regression loss. FedDr+ freezes the classifier as a simplex ETF to align the features and improves aggregated global models by employing a feature distillation mechanism to retain information about unseen/missing classes. Our empirical results demonstrate that FedDr+ not only outperforms methods with a frozen classifier but also surpasses other state-of-the-art approaches, ensuring robust performance across diverse data distributions",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising architecture for sequence modeling, providing an alternative to Transformers by replacing expensive self-attention with linear recurrences. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective trick to enhance SSMs within given computational budgets by sparsifying them. Our intuition is that tokens in SSMs are highly redundant due to gradual recurrent updates, and dense recurrence operations block the delivery of past information. In particular, we observe that upper layers of SSMs tend to be more redundant as they encode global information, while lower layers encode local information. Motivated by this, we introduce Simba, a hierarchical sparsification method for SSMs based on token pruning. Simba sparsifies upper layers more than lower layers, encouraging the upper layers to behave like highways. To achieve this, we propose a novel token pruning criterion for SSMs, measuring the global impact of tokens on the final output by accumulating local recurrences. We demonstrate that Simba outperforms the baseline model, Mamba, with the same FLOPS in various natural language tasks. Moreover, we illustrate the effect of highways, showing that Simba not only enhances efficiency but also improves the information flow across long sequences.

To that end, we propose a joint conditional reverse diffusion process with learned scores for the noise and signal-generating distribution. We demonstrate strong performance gains across various inverse problems with structured noise, outperforming competitive baselines using normalizing flows, adversarial networks and various posterior sampling methods for diffusion models.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Adversarial training is arguably the most popular way to provide empirical robustness against specific adversarial examples. While variants based on multi-step attacks incur significant computational overhead, single-step variants are vulnerable to a failure mode known as catastrophic overfitting, which hinders their practical utility for large perturbations. A parallel line of work, certified training, has focused on producing networks amenable to formal guarantees of robustness against any possible attack. However, the wide gap between the best-performing empirical and certified defenses has severely limited the applicability of the latter. Inspired by recent developments in certified training, which rely on a combination of adversarial attacks with network over-approximations, and by the connections between local linearity and catastrophic overfitting, we present experimental evidence on the practical utility and limitations of using certified training towards empirical robustness. We show that, when tuned for the purpose, a recent certified training algorithm can prevent catastrophic overfitting on single-step attacks, and that it can bridge the gap to multi-step baselines under appropriate experimental settings. Finally, we present a conceptually simple regularizer for network over-approximations that can achieve similar effects while markedly reducing runtime",

Training these models demands significantly larger datasets and computational resources compared to text-only LLMs. To address the scaling challenges, we introduce Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT), a sparse multi-modal transformer architecture that significantly reduces pretraining computational costs. MoT decouples non-embedding parameters of the model by modality -- including feed-forward networks, attention matrices, and layer normalization -- enabling modality-specific processing with global self-attention over the full input sequence. We evaluate MoT across multiple settings and model scales. In the Chameleon 7B setting (autoregressive text-and-image generation), MoT matches the dense baseline's performance using only 55.8% of the FLOPs. When extended to include speech, MoT reaches speech performance comparable to the dense baseline with only 37.2% of the FLOPs. In the Transfusion setting, where text and image are trained with different objectives, a 7B MoT model matches the image modality performance of the dense baseline with one third of the FLOPs, and a 760M MoT model outperforms a 1.4B dense baseline across key image generation metrics. System profiling further highlights MoT's practical benefits, achieving dense baseline image quality in 47.2% of the wall-clock time and text quality in 75.6% of the wall-clock time (measured on AWS p4de.24xlarge instances with NVIDIA A100 GPUs)",

Next, we show that, for SGD with the Armijo-line-search learning rate, the number of steps needed for nonconvex optimization is a monotone decreasing convex function of the batch size; that is, the number of steps needed for nonconvex optimization decreases as the batch size increases. Furthermore, we show that the stochastic first-order oracle (SFO) complexity, which is the stochastic gradient computation cost, is a convex function of the batch size; that is, there exists a critical batch size that minimizes the SFO complexity.

Our approach utilizes randomness as in RP trees while adapting to the underlying cluster structure of the dataset to create well-balanced and meaningful partitions. Experimental evaluations on real world datasets demonstrate improvements over RP trees and other tree based methods for NNS while maintaining efficient construction time. In addition, we show theoretically and empirically that *ClusterTree* finds partitions which are superior to those found by RP trees in preserving the cluster structure of the input dataset",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "High quality explanations of neural networks (NNs) should exhibit two key properties. Completeness ensures that they accurately reflect a network's function and interpretability makes them understandable to humans. Many existing methods provide explanations of individual neurons within a network. In this work we provide evidence that for AlexNet pretrained on ImageNet, neuron-based explanation methods sacrifice both completeness and interpretability compared to activation principal components. Neurons are a poor basis for AlexNet embeddings because they don't account for the distributed nature of these representations. By examining two quantitative measures of completeness and conducting a user study to measure interpretability, we show the most important principal components provide more complete and interpretable explanations than the most important neurons. Much of the activation variance may be explained by examining relatively few high-variance PCs, as opposed to studying every neuron. These principal components also strongly affect network function, and are significantly more interpretable than neurons. Our findings suggest that explanation methods for networks like AlexNet should avoid using neurons as a basis for embeddings and instead choose a basis, such as principal components, which accounts for the high dimensional and distributed nature of a network's internal representations.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Semi-supervised object detection (SSOD) based on pseudo-labeling significantly reduces dependence on large labeled datasets by effectively leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data. However, real-world applications of SSOD often face critical challenges, including class imbalance, label noise, and labeling errors. We present an in-depth analysis of SSOD under real-world conditions, uncovering causes of suboptimal pseudo-labeling and key trade-offs between label quality and quantity. Based on our findings, we propose four building blocks that can be seamlessly integrated into an SSOD framework. Rare Class Collage (RCC): a data augmentation method that enhances the representation of rare classes by creating collages of rare objects. Rare Class Focus (RCF): a stratified batch sampling strategy that ensures a more balanced representation of all classes during training. Ground Truth Label Correction (GLC): a label refinement method that identifies and corrects false, missing, and noisy ground truth labels by leveraging the consistency of teacher model predictions. Pseudo-Label Selection (PLS): a selection method for removing low-quality pseudo-labeled images, guided by a novel metric estimating the missing detection rate while accounting for class rarity. We validate our methods through comprehensive experiments on autonomous driving datasets, resulting in up to 6% increase in SSOD performance. Overall, our investigation and novel, data-centric, and broadly applicable building blocks enable robust and effective SSOD in complex, real-world scenarios.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "This work investigates whether time series of natural phenomena can be understood as being generated by sequences of latent states which are ordered in systematic and regular ways. We focus on clinical time series and ask whether clinical measurements can be interpreted as being generated by meaningful physiological states whose succession follows systematic principles. Uncovering the underlying compositional structure will allow us to create synthetic data to alleviate the notorious problem of sparse and low-resource data settings in clinical time series forecasting, and deepen our understanding of clinical data. We start by conceptualizing compositionality for time series as a property of the data generation process, and then study data-driven procedures that can reconstruct the elementary states and composition rules of this process. We evaluate the success of this methods using two empirical tests originating from a domain adaptation perspective. Both tests infer the similarity of the original time series distribution and the synthetic time series distribution from the similarity of expected risk of time series forecasting models trained and tested on original and synthesized data in specific ways. Our experimental results show that the test set performance achieved by training on compositionally synthesized data is comparable to training on original clinical time series data, and that evaluation of models on compositionally synthesized test data shows similar results to evaluating on original test data. In both experiments, performance based on compositionally synthesized data by far surpasses that based on synthetic data that were created by randomization-based data augmentation. An additional downstream evaluation of the prediction task of sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores shows significant performance gains when model training is entirely based on compositionally synthesized data compared to training on original data, with improvements increasing with the size of the synthesized training set",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), aligning source and target domains improves the predictive performance of learned models on the target domain. A common methodological improvement in alignment methods is to divide the domains and align sub-domains instead. These sub-domain-based algorithms have demonstrated great empirical success but lack theoretical support. In this work, we establish a rigorous theoretical understanding of the advantages of these methods that have the potential to enhance their overall impact on the field. Our theory uncovers that sub-domain-based methods optimize an error bound that is at least as strong as non-sub-domain-based error bounds and is empirically verified to be much stronger. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that when the marginal weights of sub-domains shift between source and target tasks, the performance of these methods may be compromised. We therefore implement an algorithm to robustify sub-domain alignment for domain adaptation under sub-domain shift, offering a valuable adaptation strategy for future sub-domain-based methods. Empirical experiments across various benchmarks validate our theoretical insights, prove the necessity for the proposed adaptation strategy, and demonstrate the algorithm's competitiveness in handling label shift",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Machine learning models are increasingly adopted to monitor network traffic and detect intrusions. In this work, we introduce SAFE-NID, a novel machine learning approach for real-time packet-level traffic monitoring and intrusion detection that includes a safeguard to detect zero day attacks as out-of-distribution inputs. Unlike traditional models, which falter against zero-day attacks and concept drift, SAFE-NID leverages a lightweight encoder-only transformer architecture combined with a novel normalizing flows-based safeguard. This safeguard not only quantifies uncertainty but also identifies out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs, enabling robust performance in dynamic threat landscapes. Our generative model learns class-conditional representations of the internal features of the deep neural network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by converting publicly available network flow-level intrusion datasets into packet-level ones. We release the labeled packet-level versions of these datasets with over 50 million packets each and describe the challenges in creating these datasets. We withhold from the training data certain attack categories to simulate zero-day attacks. Existing deep learning models, which achieve an accuracy of over 99% when detecting known attacks, only correctly classify 1% of the novel attacks. Our proposed transformer architecture with normalizing flows model safeguard achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of over 0.97 in detecting these novel inputs, outperforming existing combinations of neural architectures and model safeguards. The additional latency in processing each packet by the safeguard is a small fraction of the overall inference task. This dramatic improvement in detecting zero-day attacks and distribution shifts emphasizes SAFE-NID's novelty and utility as a reliable and efficient safety monitoring tool for real-world network intrusion detection",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Supervised classification traditionally assumes that training and testing samples are drawn from the same underlying distribution. However, practical scenarios are often affected by distribution shifts, such as covariate and label shifts. Most existing techniques for correcting distribution shifts are based on a reweighted approach that weights training samples, assigning lower relevance to the samples that are unlikely at testing. However, these methods may achieve poor performance when the weights obtained take large values at certain training samples. In addition, in multi-source cases, existing methods do not exploit complementary information among sources, and equally combine sources for all instances. In this paper, we establish a unified learning framework for distribution shift adaptation. We present a double-weighting approach to deal with distribution shifts, considering weight functions associated with both training and testing samples. For the multi-source case, the presented methods assign source-dependent weights for training and testing samples, where weights are obtained jointly using information from all sources. We also present generalization bounds for the proposed methods that show a significant increase in the effective sample size compared with existing approaches. Empirically, the proposed methods achieve enhanced classification performance in both synthetic and empirical experiments",

Current methods frame this as maximizing the distilled classification accuracy for a budget of K distilled images-per-class, where K is a positive integer. In this paper, we push the boundaries of dataset distillation, compressing the dataset into less than an image-per-class. It is important to realize that the meaningful quantity is not the number of distilled images-per-class but the number of distilled pixels-per-dataset. We therefore, propose Poster Dataset Distillation (PoDD), a new approach that distills the entire original dataset into a single poster. The poster approach motivates new technical solutions for creating training images and learnable labels. Our method can achieve comparable or better performance with less than an image-per-class compared to existing methods that use one image-per-class. Specifically, our method establishes a new state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and CUB200 on the well established 1 IPC benchmark, while using as little as 0.3 images-per-class",

The present comprehensive analysis aims to aid machine learning practitioners in selecting the most suitable backbone for their specific problem. We systematically evaluated multiple lightweight, pre-trained backbones under consistent training settings across a variety of domains spanning natural, medical, deep space, and remote sensing images. We found that even though attention-based architectures are gaining popularity, they tend to perform poorly compared to CNNs when fine-tuned on small amounts of domain-specific data. We also observed that certain CNN architectures consistently perform better than others when controlled for network size.

Traditional methods rely on the use of LSTM, GRU networks, and even Transformer architectures for the prediction of spatio-temporal series. This study proposes a viable alternative for predicting these trajectories using only GNSS positions. It considers this spatio-temporal problem as a natural language processing problem. The latitude/longitude coordinates of AIS messages are transformed into cell identifiers using the H3 index. Thanks to the pseudo-octal representation, it becomes easier for language models to learn the spatial hierarchy of the H3 index. The method is qualitatively compared to a classical Kalman filter and quantitatively to Seq2Seq and TrAISformer models. The Fréchet distance is introduced as the main evaluation metric for these comparisons. We show that it is possible to predict ship trajectories quite precisely up to 8 hours ahead with 30 minutes of context, using solely GNSS positions, without relying on any additional information such as speed, course, or external conditions — unlike many traditional methods. We demonstrate that this alternative works well enough to predict trajectories worldwide",

Specifically, we meta-learn how to perform global updates given an update from local SGD iterations. Our results demonstrate that learned optimizers can substantially outperform local SGD and its sophisticated variants while maintaining their communication efficiency.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Scaling large language models has driven remarkable advancements across various domains, yet the continual increase in model size presents significant challenges for real-world deployment. The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture offers a promising solution by dynamically selecting and activating only a subset of experts during inference, thus substantially reducing computational costs while preserving high performance. Despite these benefits, MoE introduces new inefficiencies, such as excessive parameters and communication overhead. In this work, we present a holistic study of compression techniques for Mixture of Experts to enhance both efficiency and scalability. While recent efforts have focused on Expert Trimming, which reduces the number of experts, these approaches still suffer from considerable communication and computational costs. To address this, we propose more aggressive strategies, such as Layer Drop, which removes entire MoE layers, and Block Drop, which eliminates transformer blocks. Surprisingly, these aggressive pruning techniques not only preserve model performance but also substantially improve computation and memory efficiency. Furthermore, beyond Expert Trimming, we also introduce Expert Slimming, which compresses individual experts to further boost performance and can be seamlessly integrated with Expert Trimming. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods—Layer Drop and Block Drop—along with the comprehensive recipe that integrates Expert Slimming and Expert Trimming, achieving a 6.05× speedup with 77.1% reduced memory usage while maintaining over 92% of performance on Mixtral-8×7B.

The study aims to develop a robust regression model that can generalize across domains by training on $60$~ second labeled sequences of $1$~Hz surface drilling data to predict the SSI. The model is tested in wells that are different from those used during training. To fine-tune the model architecture, a grid search approach is employed to optimize key hyperparameters. A comparative analysis of the Adversarial Domain Generalization (ADG), Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) and baseline models is presented, along with an evaluation of the effectiveness of transfer learning (TL) in improving model performance. The ADG and IRM models achieve performance improvements of $10\\%$ and $8\\%$, respectively, over the baseline model. Most importantly, severe events are detected $60\\%$ of the time, against $20\\%$ for the baseline model. Overall, the results indicate that both ADG and IRM models surpass the baseline, with the ADG model exhibiting a slight advantage over the IRM model.

Additionally, motivated by practical situations, we assume that we accurately know a small number of correspondences between the rows of the measurement matrix and the measurement vector. We propose a tractable estimator, based on a modified form of the \\textsc{Lasso}, to estimate the regression vector, and we derive theoretical error bounds for the estimate. This is unlike previous approaches to unlabelled compressed sensing, which either do not produce theoretical bounds or which produce bounds for intractable estimators. We show that our algorithm outperforms a hard thresholding pursuit (\\textsc{Htp}) approach and an $\\ell_1$-norm estimator used to solve a similar problem across diverse regimes. We also propose a modified \\textsc{Htp} based estimator which has superior properties to the baseline \\textsc{Htp} estimator. Lastly, we show an application of unlabelled compressed sensing in image registration, demonstrating the utility of a few known point correspondences",

    "title": "A unifying framework for generalised Bayesian online learning in non-stationary environments",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We propose a unifying framework for methods that perform probabilistic online learning in non-stationary environments. We call the framework BONE, which stands for generalised (B)ayesian (O)nline learning in (N)on-stationary (E)nvironments. BONE provides a common structure to tackle a variety of problems, including online continual learning, prequential forecasting, and contextual bandits. The framework requires specifying three modelling choices: (i) a model for measurements (e.g., a neural network), (ii) an auxiliary process to model non-stationarity (e.g., the time since the last changepoint), and (iii) a conditional prior over model parameters (e.g., a multivariate Gaussian). The framework also requires two algorithmic choices, which we use to carry out approximate inference under this framework: (i) an algorithm to estimate beliefs (posterior distribution) about the model parameters given the auxiliary variable, and (ii) an algorithm to estimate beliefs about the auxiliary variable. We show how the modularity of our framework allows for many existing methods to be reinterpreted as instances of BONE, and it allows us to propose new methods. We compare experimentally existing methods with our proposed new method on several datasets, providing insights into the situations that make each method more suitable for a specific task. We provide a Jax open source library to facilitate the adoption of this framework",

We propose a novel model formulation and training procedure based on the variational autoencoder (VAE) framework for modeling time-series as a neural SDE. Unlike existing algorithms training neural SDEs as VAEs, our proposed algorithm only necessitates a Gaussian prior of the initial state of the latent stochastic process, rather than a Wiener process prior on the entire latent stochastic process. We develop two methodologies for modeling and estimating change points in time-series data with distribution shifts. Our iterative algorithm alternates between updating neural SDE parameters and updating the change points based on either a maximum likelihood-based approach or a change point detection algorithm using the sequential likelihood ratio test. We also discuss theoretical implications of the proposed change point detection scheme. Finally, we present an empirical evaluation that demonstrates the expressive power of our proposed model, showing that it can effectively model both classical parametric SDEs and some real datasets with distribution shifts",

We present SlogGP, a new surrogate model that incorporates bound information and adapts the Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition function accordingly. Empirical results on a variety of benchmarks demonstrate the benefit of taking prior information about the optimal value into account, and that the proposed approach significantly outperforms existing techniques. Furthermore, we notice that even in the absence of prior information on the bound, the proposed SlogGP surrogate model still performs better than the standard GP model in most cases, which we explain by its larger expressiveness",

    "abstract": "In supervised machine learning, privileged information (PI) is information that is unavailable at inference, but is accessible during training time. Research on learning using privileged information (LUPI) aims to transfer the knowledge captured in PI onto a model that can perform inference without PI. It seems that this extra bit of information ought to make the resulting model better. However, finding conclusive theoretical or empirical evidence that supports the ability to transfer knowledge using PI has been challenging. In this paper, we critically examine the assumptions underlying existing theoretical analyses and argue that there is little theoretical justification for when LUPI should work. We analyze two main LUPI methods - generalized distillation and marginalization with weight sharing - and reveal that apparent improvements in empirical risk may not directly result from PI. Instead, these improvements often stem from dataset anomalies or modifications in model design misguidedly attributed to PI. Our experiments for a wide variety of application domains further demonstrate that state-of-the-art LUPI approaches fail to effectively transfer knowledge from PI. Thus, we advocate for practitioners to exercise caution when working with PI to avoid unintended inductive biases",

    "abstract": "The aim in many sciences is to understand the mechanisms that underlie the observed distribution of variables, starting from a set of initial hypotheses. Causal discovery allows us to infer mechanisms as sets of cause and effect relationships in a generalized way---without necessarily tailoring to a specific domain. Causal discovery algorithms search over a structured hypothesis space, defined by the set of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG), to find the graph that best explains the data. For high-dimensional problems, however, this search becomes intractable and scalable algorithms for causal discovery are needed to bridge the gap. In this paper, we define a novel causal graph partition that allows for divide-and-conquer causal discovery with theoretical guarantees under the Maximal Ancestral Graph (MAG) class. We leverage the idea of a superstructure---a set of learned or existing candidate hypotheses---to partition the search space. We prove under certain assumptions that learning with a causal graph partition always yields the Markov Equivalence Class of the true causal graph. We show our algorithm achieves comparable accuracy and a faster time to solution for biologically-tuned synthetic networks and networks up to ${10^4}$ variables. This makes our method applicable to gene regulatory network inference and other domains with high-dimensional structured hypothesis spaces",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as a novel paradigm for function approximation by leveraging univariate spline-based decompositions inspired by the Kolmogorov–Arnold theorem. Despite their theoretical appeal---particularly the potential for inducing smoother decision boundaries and lower effective Lipschitz constants---their adversarial robustness remains largely unexplored. In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive evaluation of KAN robustness in adversarial settings, focusing on both fully connected (FCKANs) and convolutional (CKANs) instantiations for image classification tasks. Across a wide range of benchmark datasets (MNIST, FashionMNIST, KMNIST, CIFAR-10, SVHN, and a subset of ImageNet), we compare KANs against conventional architectures using an extensive suite of attacks, including white-box methods (FGSM, PGD, C\\&W, MIM), black-box approaches (Square Attack, SimBA, NES), and ensemble attacks (AutoAttack). Our experiments reveal that while small- and medium-scale KANs are not consistently more robust than their standard counterparts, large-scale KANs exhibit markedly enhanced resilience against adversarial perturbations. An ablation study further demonstrates that critical hyperparameters---such as number of knots and spline order---significantly influence robustness. Moreover, adversarial training experiments confirm the inherent safety advantages of KAN-based architectures. Overall, our findings provide novel insights into the adversarial behavior of KANs and lay a rigorous foundation for future research on robust, interpretable network designs",

We release the training dataset, notably containing a French split with manually curated, high-quality, and varied data sources. To assess performance outside of English, we craft a novel benchmark, FrenchBench, consisting of an array of classification and generation tasks, covering various orthogonal aspects of model performance in the French Language. Additionally, rooted in transparency and to foster further Large Language Model research, we release codebases, and dozens of checkpoints across various model sizes, training data distributions, and training steps, as well as fine-tuned Chat models, and strong translation models. We evaluate our model through the FMTI framework, and validate 81 % of the transparency criteria, far beyond the scores of even most open initiatives.

    "abstract": "Understanding the convergence landscape of multi-agent learning is a fundamental problem of great practical relevance in many applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning. While it is known that learning dynamics converge to Nash equilibrium in potential games, the behavior of dynamics in many important classes of games that do not admit a potential is poorly understood. To measure how ``close'' a game is to being potential, we consider a distance function, that we call ``potentialness'', and which relies on a strategic decomposition of games introduced by Candogan et al. (2011). We introduce a numerical framework enabling the computation of this metric, which we use to calculate the degree of ``potentialness'' in generic matrix games, as well as (non-generic) games that are important in economic applications, namely auctions and contests. Understanding learning in the latter games has become increasingly important due to the wide-spread automation of bidding and pricing with no-regret learning algorithms. We empirically show that potentialness decreases and concentrates with an increasing number of agents or actions; in addition, potentialness turns out to be a good predictor for the existence of pure Nash equilibria and the convergence of no-regret learning algorithms in matrix games. In particular, we observe that potentialness is very low for complete-information models of the all-pay auction where no pure Nash equilibrium exists, and much higher for Tullock contests, first-, and second-price auctions, explaining the success of learning in the latter. In the incomplete-information version of the all-pay auction, a pure Bayes-Nash equilibrium exists and it can be learned with gradient-based algorithms. Potentialness nicely characterizes these differences to the complete-information version",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Subsampling is commonly used to mitigate costs associated with data acquisition, such as time or energy requirements, motivating the development of algorithms for estimating the fully-sampled signal of interest $x$ from partially observed measurements $y$. In maximum- entropy sampling, one selects measurement locations that are expected to have the highest entropy, so as to minimize uncertainty about $x$. This approach relies on an accurate model of the posterior distribution over future measurements, given the measurements observed so far. Recently, diffusion models have been shown to produce high-quality posterior samples of high-dimensional signals using guided diffusion. In this work, we propose Active Diffusion Subsampling (ADS), a method for designing intelligent subsampling masks using guided dif- fusion in which the model tracks a distribution of beliefs over the true state of $x$ throughout the reverse diffusion process, progressively decreasing its uncertainty by actively choosing to acquire measurements with maximum expected entropy, ultimately producing the pos- terior distribution $p(x | y)$. ADS can be applied using pre-trained diffusion models for any subsampling rate, and does not require task-specific retraining – just the specification of a measurement model. Furthermore, the maximum entropy sampling policy employed by ADS is interpretable, enhancing transparency relative to existing methods using black-box policies. Experimentally, we show that through designing informative subsampling masks, ADS significantly improves reconstruction quality compared to fixed sampling strategies on the MNIST and CelebA datasets, as measured by standard image quality metrics, includ- ing PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS. Furthermore, on the task of Magnetic Resonance Imaging acceleration, we find that ADS performs competitively with existing supervised methods in reconstruction quality while using a more interpretable acquisition scheme design procedure.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides in complex tasks, yet their widespread adoption is impeded by substantial computational demands. With hundreds of billion parameters, transformer-based LLMs necessitate months of pretraining across a high-end GPU cluster. However, this paper reveals a compelling finding: transformers exhibit considerable redundancy in pretraining computations, which motivates our proposed solution, Mixed Sparsity Training (MST), an efficient pretraining method that can reduce about $75$% of Floating Point Operations (FLOPs) while maintaining performance. MST integrates dynamic sparse training (DST) with Sparsity Variation (SV) and Hybrid Sparse Attention (HSA) during pretraining, involving three distinct phases: warm-up, ultra-sparsification, and restoration. The warm-up phase transforms the dense model into a sparse one, and the restoration phase reinstates connections. Throughout these phases, the model is trained with a dynamically evolving sparse topology and an HSA mechanism to maintain performance and minimize training FLOPs concurrently. Our experiment on GPT-2 showcases a FLOP reduction of $4\\times$ without compromising performance",

While RNNs and SSMs (e.g., Mamba) have been empirically more successful than rule-based systems based on $n$-gram models, a rigorous theoretical explanation for this success has not yet been developed, as it is unclear how these models encode the combinatorial rules that govern the next-word prediction task. In this paper, we construct state space language models that can solve the next-word prediction task for languages generated from $n$-gram rules, thereby showing that the former are more expressive. Our proof shows how SSMs can encode $n$-gram rules using new theoretical results on their memorization capacity, and demonstrates how their context window can be controlled by restricting the spectrum of the state transition matrix. We conduct experiments with a small dataset generated from $n$-gram rules to show how our framework can be applied to SSMs and RNNs obtained through gradient-based optimization",

While existing approaches unlearn information from complete or partial access to the training data, this access can be limited over time due to privacy regulations.

To fill this gap, we propose a novel task we call One-Shot Unlearning of Personal Identities (1-SHUI) that evaluates unlearning models when the training data is not available. We focus on unlearning identity data, which is specifically relevant due to current regulations requiring personal data deletion after training. To cope with data absence, we expect users to provide a portraiting picture to aid unlearning. We design requests on CelebA, CelebA-HQ, and MUFAC with different unlearning set sizes to evaluate applicable methods in 1-SHUI. Moreover, we propose MetaUnlearn, an effective method that meta-learns to forget identities from a single image.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Optimizing deep learning algorithms currently requires slow, manual derivation, potentially leaving much performance untapped. Methods like FlashAttention have achieved a x6 performance improvement over native PyTorch by avoiding unnecessary data transfers, but required three iterations over three years to be developed. Automated compiled methods have consistently lagged behind. This paper extends Neural Circuit Diagrams for deep learning models to consider resource usage and the distribution of tasks across a GPU hierarchy. We show how diagrams can use simple relabellings to derive high-level streaming and tiling optimization strategies along with performance models. We show how this high-level performance model allows the effects of quantization and multi-level GPU hierarchies to be readily considered. We develop a methodology for representing intermediate-level pseudocode with diagrams, allowing hardware-aware algorithms to be derived step-by-step. Finally, we show how our methodology can be used to better understand existing techniques like FlashAttention. This work uses a theoretical framework to link assumptions about GPU behaviour to claims about performance. We aim to lay the groundwork for a scientific approach to GPU optimization where experiments can address clear hypotheses rather than post-hoc rationalizations",

    "title": "Out of Spuriousity: Improving Robustness to Spurious Correlations without Group Annotations",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Machine learning models are known to learn spurious correlations, i.e., features that have strong correlations with class labels but no causal relationship. Relying on these correlations leads to poor performance in data groups that do not contain these correlations, and poor generalization. Approaches to mitigate spurious correlations either rely on the availability of group annotations or require access to different model checkpoints to approximate these group annotations. We propose PruSC, a method for extracting a spurious-free subnetwork from a dense network. PruSC does not require prior knowledge of the spurious correlations and is able to mitigate the effect of multiple spurious attributes. Specifically, we observe that ERM training leads to clusters in representation space that are induced by spurious correlations. We then define a supervised contrastive loss to extract a subnetwork that distorts such clusters, forcing the model to learn only class-specific clusters, rather than attribute-class specific clusters. Our method outperforms all annotation-free methods, achieves worst-group accuracy competitive with methods that require annotations and can mitigate the effect of multiple spurious correlations. Our results show that in a fully trained dense network, there exists a subnetwork that uses only invariant features in classification tasks, thereby eliminating the influence of spurious features",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The expected cost (EC) is one of the main classification metrics introduced in statistical and machine learning books. It is based on the assumption that, for a given application of interest, each decision made by the system has a corresponding cost which depends on the true class of the sample. An evaluation metric can then be defined by taking the expectation of the cost over the data. Two special cases of the EC are widely used in the machine learning literature: the error rate (one minus the accuracy) and the balanced error rate (one minus the balanced accuracy or unweighted average recall). Other instances of the EC can be useful for applications in which some types of errors are more severe than others, or when the prior probabilities of the classes differ between the evaluation data and the use-case scenario. Surprisingly, the general form for the EC is rarely used in the machine learning literature. Instead, alternative ad-hoc metrics like the F-beta score and the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) are used for many applications. In this work, we argue that the EC is superior to these alternative metrics, being more general, interpretable, and adaptable to any application scenario. We provide both theoretically-motivated discussions as well as examples to illustrate the behavior of the different metrics",

    "abstract": "Natural gradients have been widely studied from both theoretical and empirical perspectives, and it is commonly believed that natural gradients have advantages over standard (Euclidean) gradients in capturing the intrinsic geometric structure of the underlying function space and being invariant under reparameterization. However, for function optimization, a fundamental theoretical issue regarding the existence of natural gradients on the function space remains underexplored. We address this issue by providing a geometric perspective and mathematical framework for studying both natural gradient and standard gradient that is more complete than existing studies. The key tool that unifies natural gradient and standard gradient is a generalized form of the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), which we name the Generalized Tangent Kernel (GTK). Using a novel orthonormality property of GTK, we show that for a fixed parameterization, GTK determines a Riemannian metric on the entire function space which makes the standard gradient as \"natural\" as the natural gradient in capturing the intrinsic structure of the parameterized function space. Many aspects of this approach relate to RKHS theory. For the practical side of this theory paper, we showcase that our framework motivates new solutions to the non-immersion/degenerate case of natural gradient and leads to new families of natural/standard gradient descent methods",

This strategy is grounded in the hypothesis that concentrating on harder patches yields a more robust feature representation, as evidenced by the improved performance on downstream tasks. Our method also presents a feature-level knowledge distillation technique designed to guide the prediction of geometric complexity, which utilizes a comprehensive context from feature-level information.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Preference optimization, particularly through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), has achieved significant success in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) to adhere to human intentions. Unlike offline alignment with a fixed dataset, online feedback collection from humans or AI on model generations typically leads to more capable reward models and better-aligned LLMs through an iterative process. However, achieving a globally accurate reward model requires systematic exploration to generate diverse responses that span the vast space of natural language. Random sampling from standard reward-maximizing LLMs alone is insufficient to fulfill this requirement. To address this issue, we propose a bilevel objective optimistically biased towards potentially high-reward responses to actively explore out-of-distribution regions. By solving the inner-level problem with the reparameterized reward function, the resulting algorithm, named Self-Exploring Language Models (SELM), eliminates the need for a separate RM and iteratively updates the LLM with a straightforward objective. Compared to Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), the SELM objective reduces indiscriminate favor of unseen extrapolations and enhances exploration efficiency. Our experimental results demonstrate that when fine-tuned on Zephyr-7B-SFT and Llama-3-8B-Instruct models, SELM significantly boosts the performance on instruction-following benchmarks such as MT-Bench and AlpacaEval 2.0, as well as various standard academic benchmarks in different settings",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Counterfactual fairness is a fundamental principle in machine learning that allows the analysis of the effects of sensitive attributes in each individual decision by integrating the knowledge of causal graphs. An issue in dealing with counterfactual fairness is that unfair causal effects are often context-specific, influenced by religious, cultural, and national differences, making it difficult to create a universally applicable model. This leads to the challenge of dealing with frequent adaptation to changes in fairness assessments when localizing a model. Thus, applicability across a variety of models and efficiency becomes necessary to meet this challenge. We propose the first efficient post-process approach to achieve path-specific counterfactual fairness by adjusting a model's outputs based on a given causal graph. This approach is model-agnostic, prioritizing on flexibility and generalizability to deliver robust results across various domains and model architectures. By means of the mathematical tools in cooperative game, the Möbius inversion formula and dividends, we demonstrate that our post-process approach can be executed efficiently. We empirically show that proposed algorithm outperforms existing in-process approaches for path-specific counterfactual fairness and a post-process approach for counterfactual fairness",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In recent years, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the de facto tool for learning node and graph representations. Most GNNs typically consist of a sequence of neighborhood aggregation (a.k.a., message-passing) layers, within which the representation of each node is updated based on those of its neighbors. The most expressive message-passing GNNs can be obtained through the use of the sum aggregator and of MLPs for feature transformation, thanks to their universal approximation capabilities. However, the limitations of MLPs recently motivated the introduction of another family of universal approximators, called Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) which rely on a different representation theorem. In this work, we compare the performance of KANs against that of MLPs on graph learning tasks. We implement three new KAN-based GNN layers, inspired respectively by the GCN, GAT and GIN layers. We evaluate two different implementations of KANs using two distinct base families of functions, namely B-splines and radial basis functions. We perform extensive experiments on node classification, link prediction, graph classification and graph regression datasets. Our results indicate that KANs are on-par with or better than MLPs on all tasks studied in this paper. We also show that the size and training speed of RBF-based KANs is only marginally higher than for MLPs, making them viable alternatives. Code available at https://github.com/RomanBresson/KAGNN",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Continual Federated Learning (CFL) is essential for enabling real-world applications where multiple decentralized clients adaptively learn from continuous data streams. A significant challenge in CFL is mitigating catastrophic forgetting, where models lose previously acquired knowledge when learning new information. Existing approaches often face difficulties due to the constraints of device storage capacities and the heterogeneous nature of data distributions among clients. While some CFL algorithms have addressed these challenges, they frequently rely on unrealistic assumptions about the availability of task boundaries (i.e., knowing when new tasks begin). To address these limitations, we introduce Fed-A-GEM, a federated adaptation of the A-GEM method, which employs a buffer-based gradient projection approach. Fed-A-GEM alleviates catastrophic forgetting by leveraging local buffer samples and aggregated buffer gradients, thus preserving knowledge across multiple clients. Our method is combined with existing CFL techniques, enhancing their performance in the CFL context. Our experiments on standard benchmarks show consistent performance improvements across diverse scenarios. For example, in a task-incremental learning scenario using the CIFAR-100 dataset, our method can increase the accuracy by up to 27%.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Foundation models are increasingly consequential yet extremely opaque. To characterize the status quo, the Foundation Model Transparency Index was launched in October 2023 to measure the transparency of leading foundation model developers. The October 2023 Index (v1.0) assessed 10 major foundation model developers (e.g. OpenAI, Google) on 100 transparency indicators (e.g. does the developer disclose the wages it pays for data labor?). At the time, developers publicly disclosed very limited information with the average score being 37 out of 100. To understand how the status quo has changed, we conduct a follow-up study (v1.1) after 6 months: we score 14 developers against the same 100 indicators. While in v1.0 we searched for publicly available information, in v1.1 developers submit reports on the 100 transparency indicators, potentially including information that was not previously public. We find that developers now score 58 out of 100 on average, a 21 point improvement over v1.0. Much of this increase is driven by developers disclosing information during the v1.1 process: on average, developers disclosed information related to 16.6 indicators that was not previously public. We observe regions of sustained (i.e. across v1.0 and v1.1) and systemic (i.e. across most or all developers) opacity such as on copyright status, data access, data labor, and downstream impact. We publish transparency reports for each developer that consolidate information disclosures: these reports are based on the information disclosed to us via developers. Our findings demonstrate that transparency can be improved in this nascent ecosystem, the Foundation Model Transparency Index likely contributes to these improvements, and policymakers should consider interventions in areas where transparency has not improved",

    "title": "How to Leverage Predictive Uncertainty Estimates for Reducing Catastrophic Forgetting in Online Continual Learning",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Many real-world applications require machine-learning models to be able to deal with non-stationary data distributions and thus learn autonomously over an extended period of time, often in an online setting. One of the main challenges in this scenario is the so-called catastrophic forgetting (CF) for which the learning model tends to focus on the most recent tasks while experiencing predictive degradation on older ones. In the online setting, the most effective solutions employ a fixed-size memory buffer to store old samples used for replay when training on new tasks. Many approaches have been presented to tackle this problem and conflicting strategies are proposed to populate the memory. Are the easiest-to-forget or the easiest-to-remember samples more effective in combating CF? Furthermore, it is not clear how predictive uncertainty information for memory management can be leveraged in the most effective manner. Starting from the intuition that predictive uncertainty provides an idea of the samples' location in the decision space, this work presents an in-depth analysis of different uncertainty estimates and strategies for populating the memory. The investigation provides a better understanding of the characteristics data points should have for alleviating CF. Then, we propose an alternative method for estimating predictive uncertainty via the generalised variance induced by the negative log-likelihood. Finally, we demonstrate that the use of predictive uncertainty measures helps in reducing CF in different settings",

On the other hand, necessary conditions on the required sample sizes for both skeleton and CPDAG recovery are also derived in terms of information-theoretic lower bounds, which match the respective sufficient conditions and thereby give a sharp characterization of the difficulty of these tasks. We also consider the problem of inverse correlation matrix estimation under the linear polytree models, and establish the estimation error bound in terms of the dimension and the total number of v-structures. We also consider an extension of group linear polytree models, in which each node represents a group of variables.

    "abstract": "Generating tabular data under differential privacy (DP) protection ensures theoretical privacy guarantees but poses challenges for training machine learning models, primarily due to the need to capture complex structures under noisy supervision signals. Recently, pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) -- even those at the scale of GPT-2 -- have demonstrated great potential in synthesizing tabular data. However, their applications under DP constraints remain largely unexplored. In this work, we address this gap by applying DP techniques to the generation of synthetic tabular data. Our findings shows that LLMs face difficulties in generating coherent text when fine-tuned with DP, as privacy budgets are inefficiently allocated to non-private elements like table structures. To overcome this, we propose DP-2Stage, a two-stage fine-tuning framework for differentially private tabular data generation. The first stage involves non-private fine-tuning on a pseudo dataset, followed by DP fine-tuning on a private dataset. Our empirical results show that this approach improves performance across various settings and metrics compared to directly fine-tuned LLMs in DP contexts.

Improving the calibration of classifiers is crucial for enhancing the trustworthiness and interpretability of machine learning models, especially in sensitive decision-making scenarios. Although various calibration (error) estimators exist in the current literature, there is a lack of guidance on selecting the appropriate estimator and tuning its hyperparameters. By leveraging the bilinear structure of squared calibration errors, we reformulate calibration estimation as a regression problem with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) input pairs. This reformulation allows us to quantify the performance of different estimators even for the most challenging calibration criterion, known as canonical calibration. Our approach advocates for a training-validation-testing pipeline when estimating a calibration error on an evaluation dataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our pipeline by optimizing existing calibration estimators and comparing them with novel kernel ridge regression-based estimators on standard image classification tasks",

However, the training process of RL is far from automatic, requiring extensive human effort to reset the agent and environments. To tackle the challenging reset-free setting, we first demonstrate the superiority of model-based (MB) RL methods in such setting, showing that a straightforward adaptation of MBRL can outperform all the prior state-of-the-art methods while requiring less supervision. We then identify limitations inherent to this direct extension and propose a solution called model-based reset-free (MoReFree) agent, which further enhances the performance. MoReFree adapts two key mechanisms, exploration and policy learning, to handle reset-free tasks by prioritizing task-relevant states. It exhibits superior data-efficiency across various reset-free tasks without access to environmental reward or demonstrations while significantly outperforming privileged baselines that require supervision.

    "abstract": "This paper provides the first tight convergence analyses for RMSProp and Adam for non-convex optimization under the most relaxed assumptions of coordinate-wise generalized smoothness and affine noise variance. RMSProp is firstly analyzed, which is a special case of Adam with adaptive learning rates but without first-order momentum. Specifically, to solve the challenges due to the dependence among adaptive update, unbounded gradient estimate and Lipschitz constant, we demonstrate that the first-order term in the descent lemma converges and its denominator is upper bounded by a function of gradient norm. Based on this result, we show that RMSProp with proper hyperparameters converges to an $\\epsilon$-stationary point with an iteration complexity of $\\mathcal O(\\epsilon^{-4})$. We then generalize our analysis to Adam, where the additional challenge is due to a mismatch between the gradient and the first-order momentum. We develop a new upper bound on the first-order term in the descent lemma, which is also a function of the gradient norm. We show that Adam with proper hyperparameters converges to an $\\epsilon$-stationary point with an iteration complexity of $\\mathcal O(\\epsilon^{-4})$. Our complexity results for both RMSProp and Adam match with the complexity lower bound established in Arjevani et al. (2023)",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "While spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising neurally-inspired model of computation, they are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. We present the first study that draws inspiration from neural homeostasis to design a threshold-adapting leaky integrate-and-fire (TA-LIF) neuron model and utilize TA-LIF neurons to construct the adversarially robust homeostatic SNNs (HoSNNs) for improved robustness. The TA-LIF model incorporates a self-stabilizing dynamic thresholding mechanism, offering a local feedback control solution to the minimization of each neuron's membrane potential error caused by adversarial disturbance. Theoretical analysis demonstrates favorable dynamic properties of TA-LIF neurons in terms of the bounded-input bounded-output stability and suppressed time growth of membrane potential error, underscoring their superior robustness compared with the standard LIF neurons. When trained with weak FGSM attacks (\\(\\epsilon = 2/255\\)), our HoSNNs significantly outperform conventionally trained LIF-based SNNs across multiple datasets. Furthermore, under significantly stronger PGD7 attacks (\\(\\epsilon = 8/255\\)), HoSNN achieves notable improvements in accuracy, increasing from 30.90% to 74.91% on FashionMNIST, 0.44% to 36.82% on SVHN, 0.54% to 43.33% on CIFAR10, and 0.04% to 16.66% on CIFAR100",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recently, significant attention has been given to the idea of viewing relational databases as heterogeneous graphs, enabling the application of graph neural network (GNN) technology for predictive tasks. However, existing GNN methods struggle with the complexity of the heterogeneous graphs induced by databases with numerous tables and relations. Traditional approaches either consider all possible relational meta-paths, thus failing to scale with the number of relations, or rely on domain experts to identify relevant meta-paths. A recent solution does manage to learn informative meta-paths without expert supervision, but assumes that a node's class depends solely on the existence of a meta-path occurrence. In this work, we present a self-explainable heterogeneous GNN for relational data, that supports models in which class membership depends on aggregate information obtained from multiple occurrences of a meta-path. Experimental results show that in the context of relational databases, our approach effectively identifies informative meta-paths that faithfully capture the model's reasoning mechanisms. It significantly outperforms existing methods in both synthetic and real-world scenarios",

    "abstract": "Encountered frequently in time series data, missing values can significantly impede time-series analysis. With the progression of deep learning, advanced imputation models delve into the temporal dependencies inherent in time series data, showcasing remarkable performance. This positions them as intuitive selections for time series imputation tasks which assume ``Miss Completely at Random''. Nonetheless, long-interval consecutive missing values may obstruct the model's ability to grasp long-term temporal dependencies, consequently hampering the efficacy of imputation performance. To tackle this challenge, we propose Long Short-term Imputer (LSTI) to impute consecutive missing values with different length of intervals. Long-term Imputer is designed using the idea of bi-directional autoregression. A forward prediction model and a backward prediction model are trained with a consistency regularization, which is designed to capture long-time dependency and can adapt to long-interval consecutive missing values. Short-term Imputer is designed to capture short-time dependency and can impute the short-interval consecutive missing values effectively. A meta-weighting network is then proposed to take advantage of the strengths of two imputers. As a result, LSTI can impute consecutive missing values with different intervals effectively. Experiments demonstrate that our approach, on average, reduces the error by 57.4% compared to state-of-the-art deep models across five datasets",

Using these theoretical insights into evolution of gradients, we design a specialized metric that integrates both gradients to detect the transition from fitting to collapse.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel diffusion-based method for learning representations from categorical data. Conditional diffusion models have demonstrated their potential to extract meaningful representations from input samples. However, they often struggle to yield versatile, general-purpose information, limiting their adaptability to unforeseen tasks. To address this, we propose a cycle conditioning approach for diffusion models, designed to capture expressive information from conditioning samples. However, cycle conditioning alone can be insufficient. Diffusion models may ignore conditioning samples that vary across training iterations, an issue that occurs within cycle conditioning. To counter this limitation, we introduce additional \"spelling\" information to guide the conditioning process, ensuring that the conditioning sample remains influential during denoising. While this supervision enhances the generalizability of extracted representations, it is constrained by the sparse nature of spelling information in categorical data, leading to sparse latent conditions. This sparsity reduces the robustness of the extracted representations for downstream tasks or as effective guidance in the diffusion process. To overcome this challenge, we propose a linear navigation strategy within the latent space of conditioning samples, allowing dense representations to be extracted even with sparse supervision.

    "abstract": "Using AI to write formal proofs for mathematical problems is a challenging task that has seen some advancements in recent years. Automated systems such as Lean can verify the correctness of proofs written in formal language, yet writing the proofs in formal language can be challenging for humans and machines. The miniF2F benchmark has 20 IMO problems in its test set, yet formal proofs are available only for 6 of these problems (3 of which are only written by mathematicians). The model with best accuracy can only prove 2 of these 20 IMO problems, from 1950s and 60s, while its training set is a secret. In this work, we write complete, original formal proofs for the remaining IMO problems in Lean along with 3 extra problems from IMO 2022 and 2023. This effort expands the availability of proof currently in the public domain by creating 5,880 lines of Lean proof. The goal of the paper is to pave the way for developing AI models that can automatically write the formal proofs for all the IMO problems in miniF2F and beyond by providing an evaluation benchmark. In this pursuit, we devise a method to decompose the proofs of these problems into their building blocks, constructing a dataset of 1,329 lemmas with more than 40k lines of Lean code. These lemmas are not trivial, yet they are approachable, providing the opportunity to evaluate and diagnose the failures and successes of AI models.

This strategy accelerates class discovery and learning, even under constrained annotation budgets.

While graph machine learning holds great promise across various domains, the design of effective pretext tasks for self-supervised graph representation learning remains challenging. Contrastive learning, a popular approach in graph self-supervised learning, leverages positive and negative pairs to compute a contrastive loss function. However, current graph contrastive learning methods often struggle to fully use structural patterns and node similarities. To address these issues, we present a new method called Fused Gromov-Wasserstein Subgraph Contrastive Learning (FOSSIL). Our method integrates node-level and subgraph-level contrastive learning, seamlessly combining a standard node-level contrastive loss with the Fused Gromov-Wasserstein distance. This combination helps our method capture both node features and graph structure together. Importantly, our approach works well with both homophilic and heterophilic graphs and can dynamically create views for generating positive and negative pairs. Through extensive experiments on benchmark graph datasets, we show that FOSSIL outperforms or achieves competitive performance compared to current state-of-the-art methods",

However, most existing prompt optimization methods only focus on the task-level performance, overlooking the importance of query-preferred prompts, which leads to suboptimal performances. Additionally, these methods rely heavily on frequent interactions with LLMs to obtain feedback for guiding the optimization process, incurring substantial redundant interaction costs. In this paper, we introduce Query-dependent Prompt Optimization ($\\textbf{QPO}$), which leverages multi-loop offline reinforcement learning to iteratively fine-tune a small pretrained language model to generate optimal prompts tailored to the input queries, thus significantly improving the prompting effect on the large target LLM. We derive insights from offline prompting demonstration data, which already exists in large quantities as a by-product of benchmarking diverse prompts on open-sourced tasks, thereby circumventing the expenses of online interactions. Furthermore, we continuously augment the offline dataset with the generated prompts in each loop, as the prompts from the fine-tuned model are supposed to outperform the source prompts in the original dataset. These iterative loops bootstrap the model towards generating optimal prompts.

In this paper, utilizing metric learning, we tackle two fundamental issues of class-incremental learning (class-IL), inter-task confusion and catastrophic forgetting, which have not been fully addressed yet in the literature. To mitigate the inter-task confusion, we propose an innovative loss by utilizing the centroids of previously learned classes as negatives and current data samples as positives in the embedding space, which reduces overlaps between the classes of the current and past tasks in the embedding space. To combat catastrophic forgetting, we also propose that the past trained model is stored and re-used for generating past data samples for only one previous task. Based on this, we further propose a novel knowledge distillation approach utilizing inter-class embedding clusters, intra-class embedding clusters, and mean square embedding distances.

We first observe a positive correlation between the effectiveness of attacks and the internal behaviors of the models. For instance, attacks tend to be less effective when models pay more attention to system prompts designed to ensure LLM safety alignment. Building on this discovery, we introduce an enhanced method that manipulates models' attention scores to facilitate LLM jailbreaking, which we term AttnGCG. Empirically, AttnGCG shows consistent improvements in attack efficacy across diverse LLMs, achieving an average increase of ~7% in the Llama-2 series and ~10% in the Gemma series. Our strategy also demonstrates robust attack transferability against both unseen harmful goals and black-box LLMs like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.

The node embeddings are obtained by calculating the mean of the attribute-specific node embeddings.The encoding operation can be repeated multiple times to capture complex patterns. The attribute-wise message-passing networks are shared across all graphs, allowing knowledge transfer between different graphs.The probabilities of edges are estimated by the Euclidian distance between node embeddings.

    "abstract": "Out-of-distribution generalization is a common problem that expects the model to perform well in the different distributions even far from the train data. A popular approach to addressing this issue is invariant learning (IL), in which the model is compiled to focus on invariant features instead of spurious features by adding strong constraints during training. However, there are some potential pitfalls of strong invariant constraints. Due to the limited number of diverse environments and over-regularization in the feature space, it may lead to a loss of important details in the invariant features while alleviating the spurious correlations, namely the over-invariance, which can also degrade the generalization performance. We theoretically define the over-invariance and observe that this issue occurs in various classic IL methods. To alleviate this issue, we propose a simple approach Diverse Invariant Learning (DivIL) by adding the unsupervised contrastive learning and the random masking mechanism compensatory for the invariant constraints, which can be applied to various IL methods. Furthermore, we conduct experiments across multiple modalities across 12 datasets and 6 classic models, verifying our over-invariance insight and the effectiveness of our DivIL framework.

Cross-attention is essential in the initial phase but almost irrelevant thereafter. Self-attention, however, initially plays a minor role but becomes increasingly important in the second phase. These findings yield a simple and training-free method called TGATE which efficiently generates images by caching and reusing attention outputs at scheduled time steps.

    "title": "TACO Vision Models Can Be Efficiently Specialized via Few-Shot Task-Aware Compression",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recent vision architectures and self-supervised training methods have enabled training computer vision models that are extremely accurate, but come with massive computational costs. In settings such as identifying species in camera traps in the field, users have limited resources, and may fine-tune a pretrained model on (often limited) data from a small set of specific categories of interest. Such users may still wish to make use of highly-accurate large models, but are often constrained by the computational cost. To address this, we ask: can we quickly compress generalist models into accurate and efficient specialists given a small amount of data? Towards this goal, we propose a simple and versatile technique, which we call Few-Shot Task-Aware COmpression (TACO). Given a general-purpose model pretrained on a broad task, such as classification on ImageNet or iNaturalist datasets with thousands of categories, TACO produces a much smaller model that is accurate on specialized tasks, such as classifying across vehicle types or animal species, based only on a few examples from each target class. The method is based on two key insights - 1) a powerful specialization effect for data-aware compression, which we showcase for the first time; 2) a dedicated finetuning procedure with knowledge distillation, which prevents overfitting even in scenarios where data is very scarce. Specifically, TACO is applied in few-shot fashion, i.e. only a few task-specific samples are used for compression, and the procedure has low computational overhead. We validate this approach experimentally using highly-accurate ResNet, ViT/DeiT, and ConvNeXt models, originally trained on ImageNet and iNaturalist datasets, which we specialize and compress to a diverse set of ``downstream'' subtasks, with notable computational speedups on both CPU and GPU",

They proved that the gradient descent converges to a globally optimal solution at a linear convergence rate for the quadratic loss function. This paper shows that this fact still holds for DEQs with any general activation that has bounded first and second derivatives. Since the new activation function is generally non-homogeneous, bounding the least eigenvalue of the Gram matrix of the equilibrium point is particularly challenging. To accomplish this task, we need to create a novel population Gram matrix and develop a new form of dual activation with Hermite polynomial expansion",

    "title": "Stability-Aware Training of Machine Learning Force Fields with Differentiable Boltzmann Estimators",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Machine learning force fields (MLFFs) are an attractive alternative to ab-initio methods for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. However, they can produce unstable simulations, limiting their ability to model phenomena occurring over longer timescales and compromising the quality of estimated observables. To address these challenges, we present Stability-Aware Boltzmann Estimator (StABlE) Training, a multi-modal training procedure which leverages joint supervision from reference quantum-mechanical calculations and system observables. StABlE Training iteratively runs many MD simulations in parallel to seek out unstable regions, and corrects the instabilities via supervision with a reference observable. We achieve efficient end-to-end automatic differentiation through MD simulations using our Boltzmann Estimator, a generalization of implicit differentiation techniques to a broader class of stochastic algorithms. Unlike existing techniques based on active learning, our approach requires no additional ab-initio energy and forces calculations to correct instabilities. We demonstrate our methodology across organic molecules, tetrapeptides, and condensed phase systems, using three modern MLFF architectures. StABlE-trained models achieve significant improvements in simulation stability, data efficiency, and agreement with reference observables. Crucially, the stability improvements cannot be matched by simply reducing the simulation timestep, meaning that StABlE Training effectively allows for larger timesteps in MD simulations. By incorporating observables into the training process alongside first-principles calculations, StABlE Training can be viewed as a general semi-empirical framework applicable across MLFF architectures and systems. This makes it a powerful tool for training stable and accurate MLFFs, particularly in the absence of large reference datasets.

    "abstract": "In this paper we propose a new iterative algorithm to solve the fair PCA (FPCA) problem. We start with the max-min fair PCA formulation originally proposed in \\cite{samadi1} and derive a simple and efficient iterative algorithm which is based on the minorization-maximization (MM) approach. The proposed algorithm relies on the relaxation of a semi-orthogonality constraint which is proved to be tight at every iteration of the algorithm. The vanilla version of the proposed algorithm requires solving a semi-definite program (SDP) at every iteration, which can be further simplified to a quadratic program by formulating the dual of the surrogate maximization problem. We also propose two important reformulations of the fair PCA problem: a) fair robust PCA - which can handle outliers in the data, and b) fair sparse PCA - which can enforce sparsity on the estimated fair principal components. The proposed algorithms are computationally efficient and monotonically increase their respective design objectives at every iteration. An added feature of the proposed algorithms is that they do not require the selection of any hyperparameter (except for the fair sparse PCA case where a penalty parameter that controls the sparsity has to be chosen by the user). We numerically compare the performance of the proposed methods with two of the state-of-the-art approaches on synthetic data sets and real-life data sets",

Producers, in turn, often create content that is likely to be recommended to users and have users engage with it. To do so, producers try to align their content with the preferences of their targeted user base. In this work, we explore the equilibrium behavior of producers who are interested in maximizing user engagement. We study two variants of the content-serving rule for the platform's recommender system, and provide a structural characterization of producer behavior at equilibrium: namely, each producer chooses to focus on a single embedded feature. We further show that specialization, defined as different producers optimizing for distinct types of content, naturally emerges from the competition among producers trying to maximize user engagement. We provide a heuristic for computing equilibria of our engagement game, and evaluate it experimentally. We highlight i) the performance and convergence of our heuristic, ii) the degree of producer specialization, and iii) the impact of the content-serving rule on producer and user utilities at equilibrium and provide guidance on how to set the content-serving rule",

    "abstract": "Mesh-free Lagrangian methods are widely used for simulating fluids, solids, and their complex interactions due to their ability to handle large deformations and topological changes. These physics simulators, however, require substantial computational resources for accurate simulations. To address these issues, deep learning emulators promise faster and scalable simulations, yet they often remain expensive and difficult to train, limiting their practical use. Inspired by the Material Point Method (MPM), we present NeuralMPM, a neural framework for particle-based emulation. NeuralMPM interpolates Lagrangian particles onto a fixed-size grid, computes updates on grid nodes using image-to-image neural networks, and interpolates back to the particles. Similarly to MPM, NeuralMPM benefits from the regular voxelized representation to simplify the computation of the state dynamics, while avoiding the drawbacks of mesh-based Eulerian methods. We demonstrate the advantages of NeuralMPM on 6 datasets, including fluid dynamics and fluid-solid interactions simulated with MPM and Smoothed Particles Hydrodynamics (SPH). Compared to GNS and DMCF, NeuralMPM reduces training time from 10 days to 15 hours, memory consumption by 10x-100x, and increases inference speed by 5x-10x, while achieving comparable or superior long-term accuracy, making it a promising approach for practical forward and inverse problems.

Moreover, we demonstrate that this attack evades detection by neural networks trained to flag classical adversarial examples. Therefore, we train more general models capable of identifying a broader spectrum of attacks, including classical black-box attacks designed for images, black-box attacks driven by classical optimization, and no-box attacks. By integrating these attack detection capabilities with fake detectors, we develop more robust and effective fake detection systems",

    "abstract": "Motivated by the progress of large language models (LLMs), we introduce the framework of verbalized machine learning (VML). In contrast to conventional machine learning (ML) models that are typically optimized over a continuous parameter space, VML constrains the parameter space to be human-interpretable natural language. Such a constraint leads to a new perspective of function approximation, where an LLM with a text prompt can be viewed as a function parameterized by the text prompt. Guided by this perspective, we revisit classical ML problems, such as regression and classification, and find that these problems can be solved by an LLM-parameterized learner and optimizer. The major advantages of VML include (1) easy encoding of inductive bias: prior knowledge about the problem and hypothesis class can be encoded in natural language and fed into the LLM-parameterized learner; (2) automatic model class selection: the optimizer can automatically select a model class based on data and verbalized prior knowledge, and it can update the model class during training; and (3) interpretable learner updates: the LLM-parameterized optimizer can provide explanations for why an update is performed. We empirically verify the effectiveness of VML, and hope that VML can serve as a stepping stone to stronger interpretability",

In this paper, we address the problem of learning stochastic policies with continuous actions from the viewpoint of counterfactual risk minimization (CRM). While the CRM framework is appealing and well studied for discrete actions, the continuous action case raises new challenges about modelization, optimization, and~offline model selection with real data which turns out to be particularly challenging. Our paper contributes to these three aspects of the CRM estimation pipeline. First, we introduce a modelling strategy based on a joint kernel embedding of contexts and actions, which overcomes the shortcomings of previous discretization approaches. Second, we empirically show that the optimization aspect of counterfactual learning is important, and we demonstrate the benefits of proximal point algorithms and smooth estimators. Finally, we propose an evaluation protocol for offline policies in real-world logged systems, which is challenging since policies cannot be replayed on test data, and we release a new large-scale dataset along with multiple synthetic, yet realistic, evaluation setups",

Gaussian process quadratures are numerical integration methods where Gaussian processes are used as functional priors for the integrands to capture the uncertainty arising from the sparse function evaluations. Quantum computers have emerged as potential replacements for classical computers, offering exponential reductions in the computational complexity of machine learning tasks. In this paper, we combine Gaussian process quadrature and quantum computing by proposing a quantum low-rank Gaussian process quadrature method based on a Hilbert space approximation of the Gaussian process kernel and enhancing the quadrature using a quantum circuit. The method combines the quantum phase estimation algorithm with the quantum principal component analysis technique to extract information up to a desired rank. Then, Hadamard and SWAP tests are implemented to find the expected value and variance that determines the quadrature. We use numerical simulations of a quantum computer to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.

The goal is to select centers from the target, such that the target clustering cost given the additional source centers is minimized. We consider private STC, in which the source dataset is private and should only be used under the constraint of differential privacy. This is motivated by scenarios in which the existing centers are private, for instance because they represent individuals in a social network. We derive lower bounds for the private STC objective, illustrating the theoretical limitations on worst-case guarantees for this setting. We then present a differentially private algorithm with asymptotically advantageous results under a data-dependent analysis, in which the guarantee depends on properties of the dataset, as well as more practical variants.

    "abstract": "Model-based reinforcement learning uses a learned dynamics model to imagine actions and select those with the best expected outcomes. An experience replay buffer collects the outcomes of all actions executed in the environment, which is then used to iteratively train the dynamics model. However, as the complexity and scale of tasks increase, training times and memory requirements can grow drastically without necessarily retaining useful experiences. Continual learning proposes a more realistic scenario where tasks are learned in sequence, and the replay buffer can help mitigate catastrophic forgetting. However, it is not realistic to expect the buffer to infinitely grow as the sequence advances. Furthermore, storing every single experience executed in the environment does not necessarily provide a more accurate model. We argue that the replay buffer needs to have the minimal necessary size to retain relevant experiences that cover both common and rare states. Therefore, we propose using an uncertainty-based replay buffer filtering to enable an effective implementation of continual learning agents using model-based reinforcement learning. We show that the combination of the proposed strategies leads to reduced training times, smaller replay buffer size, and less catastrophic forgetting, all while maintaining performance",

Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a popular offline alignment method that trains a policy directly on preference data without the need to train a reward model or apply reinforcement learning. However, the empirical evidence suggests that DPO typically assigns implicit rewards that overfit, and trend towards infinite magnitude. This frequently leads to degenerate policies, sometimes causing even the probabilities of the preferred generations to go to zero. In this work, we analyze this phenomenon and use distillation to get a better proxy for the true preference distribution over generation pairs: we train the LM such that its induced implicit reward, i.e., the scaled log-likelihood ratio of the model to the reference model, matches an explicit reward model trained on the preference data. Moreover, to account for uncertainty in the reward model we are distilling from, we optimize against a family of reward models that, as a whole, is likely to include at least one reasonable proxy for the preference distribution. Our results show that distilling from such a family of reward models leads to improved robustness to distribution shift in preference annotations, while preserving the simple supervised nature of DPO",

We find through our experiments that SimPLR with scale-aware attention is plain and simple architecture, yet competitive with multi-scale vision transformer alternatives.

Many state-of-the-art solutions use weight regularization to adjust parameter distributions, prevent overfitting, and support generalization of DNNs. None of the existing regularization techniques have ever exploited a typical distribution of numerical datasets with respect to the first non-zero (or significant) digit, called Benford's Law (BL). In this paper, we show that the deviation of the significant digit distribution of the DNN weights from BL is closely related to the generalization of the DNN. In particular, when the DNN is presented with limited training data. To take advantage of this finding, we use BL to target the weight regularization of DNNs. Extensive experiments are performed on image, table, and speech data, considering convolutional (CNN) and Transformer-based neural network architectures with varying numbers of parameters. We show that the performance of DNNs is improved by minimizing the distance between the significant digit distributions of the DNN weights and the BL distribution along with L2 regularization. The improvements depend on the network architecture and how it deals with limited data. However, the proposed penalty term improves consistently and some CNN-based architectures gain up to $15\\%$ test accuracy over the default training scheme with L2 regularization on subsets of CIFAR 100",

    "title": "Evaluating the Robustness of Analogical Reasoning in Large Language Models",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have performed well on several reasoning benchmarks, including ones that test analogical reasoning abilities. However, there is debate on the extent to which they are performing general abstract reasoning versus employing shortcuts or other non-robust processes, such as ones that overly rely on similarity to what has been seen in their training data. Here we investigate the robustness of analogy-making abilities previously claimed for LLMs on three of four domains studied by Webb et al. (2023): letter-string analogies, digit matrices, and story analogies. For each of these domains we test humans and GPT models on robustness to variants of the original analogy problems—versions that test the same abstract reasoning abilities but that are likely dissimilar from tasks in the pre-training data. The performance of a system that uses robust abstract reasoning should not decline substantially on these variants. On simple letter-string analogies, we find that while the performance of humans remains high for two types of variants we tested, the GPT models' performance declines sharply. This pattern is less pronounced as the complexity of these analogy problems is increased, as both humans and GPT models perform poorly on both the original and variant problems requiring more complex analogies. On digit-matrix problems, we find a similar pattern but only on one out of the two types of variants we tested. Lastly, we assess the robustness of humans and GPT models on story-based analogy problems, finding that, unlike humans, the performance of GPT models are susceptible to answer-order effects, and that GPT models also may be more sensitive than humans to paraphrasing. This work provides evidence that, despite previously reported successes of LLMs on zero-shot analogical reasoning, these models often lack the robustness of zero-shot human analogy- making, exhibiting brittleness on most of the variations we tested. More generally, this work points to the importance of carefully evaluating AI systems not only for accuracy but also robustness when testing their cognitive capabilities.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Probabilistic representation spaces convey information about a dataset and are shaped by factors such as the training data, network architecture, and loss function. Comparing the information content of such spaces is crucial for understanding the learning process, yet most existing methods assume point-based representations, neglecting the distributional nature of probabilistic spaces. To address this gap, we propose two information-theoretic measures to compare general probabilistic representation spaces by extending classic methods to compare the information content of hard clustering assignments. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight method of estimation that is based on fingerprinting a representation space with a sample of the dataset, designed for scenarios where the communicated information is limited to a few bits. We demonstrate the utility of these measures in three case studies. First, in the context of unsupervised disentanglement, we identify recurring information fragments within individual latent dimensions of VAE and InfoGAN ensembles. Second, we compare the full latent spaces of models and reveal consistent information content across datasets and methods, despite variability during training. Finally, we leverage the differentiability of our measures to perform model fusion, synthesizing the information content of weak learners into a single, coherent representation. Across these applications, the direct comparison of information content offers a natural basis for characterizing the processing of information",

    "title": "Adapt then Unlearn: Exploring Parameter Space Semantics for Unlearning in Generative Adversarial Networks",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Owing to the growing concerns about privacy and regulatory compliance, it is desirable to regulate the output of generative models. To that end, the objective of this work is to prevent the generation of outputs containing undesired features from a pre-trained Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) where the underlying training data set is inaccessible. Our approach is inspired by the observation that the parameter space of GANs exhibits meaningful directions that can be leveraged to suppress specific undesired features. However, such directions usually result in the degradation of the quality of generated samples. Our proposed two-stage method, known as 'Adapt-then-Unlearn,' excels at unlearning such undesirable features while also maintaining the quality of generated samples. In the initial stage, we adapt a pre-trained GAN on a set of negative samples (containing undesired features) provided by the user. Subsequently, we train the original pre-trained GAN using positive samples, along with a repulsion regularizer. This regularizer encourages the learned model parameters to move away from the parameters of the adapted model (first stage) while not degrading the generation quality. We provide theoretical insights into the proposed method. To the best of our knowledge, our approach stands as the first method addressing unlearning within the realm of high-fidelity GANs (such as StyleGAN). We validate the effectiveness of our method through comprehensive experiments, encompassing both class-level unlearning on the MNIST and AFHQ dataset and feature-level unlearning tasks on the CelebA-HQ dataset.

    "abstract": "Due to their capacity to generate novel and high-quality samples, diffusion models have attracted significant research interest in recent years. Notably, the typical training objective of diffusion models, i.e., denoising score matching, has a closed-form optimal solution that can only generate training-data replicating samples. This indicates that a memorization behavior is theoretically expected, which contradicts the common generalization ability of state-of-the-art diffusion models, and thus calls for a deeper understanding. Looking into this, we first observe that memorization behaviors tend to occur on smaller-sized datasets, which motivates our definition of effective model memorization (EMM), a metric measuring the maximum size of training data at which a model approximates its theoretical optimum. Then, we quantify the impact of the influential factors on these memorization behaviors in terms of EMM, focusing primarily on data distribution, model configuration, and training procedure. Besides comprehensive empirical results identifying the influential factors, we surprisingly find that conditioning training data on uninformative random labels can significantly trigger the memorization in diffusion models. Our study holds practical significance for diffusion model users and offers clues to theoretical research in deep generative models",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Random projection is a simple yet effective technique for dimension reduction, widely used in various machine learning tasks. Following the projection step, quantization is often applied to further reduce the complexity of projected data. In general, quantized projections are expected to approximately preserve the pairwise distances between the original data points, to avoid significant performance degradation in subsequent tasks. While this distance preservation property has been investigated for Gaussian matrices, our work further extends the analysis to hardware-friendly $\\{0,1\\}$-binary matrices, particularly focusing on cases where the projections are quantized into two types of low bit-width codes: $\\{0,1\\}$-binary codes and $\\{0,\\pm1\\}$-ternary codes. It is found that the distance preservation property tends to be better maintained, when the binary projection matrices exhibit sparse structures. This is validated through classification and clustering experiments, where extremely sparse binary matrices, with only one nonzero entry per column, achieve superior or comparable performance to other denser binary matrices and Gaussian matrices. This presents an opportunity to significantly reduce the computational and storage complexity of the quantized random projection model, without compromising, and potentially even improving its performance",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Optimal decision-making under partial observability requires reasoning about the uncertainty of the environment's hidden state. However, most reinforcement learning architectures handle partial observability with sequence models that have no internal mechanism to incorporate uncertainty in their hidden state representation, such as recurrent neural networks, deterministic state-space models and transformers. Inspired by advances in probabilistic world models for reinforcement learning, we propose a standalone Kalman filter layer that performs closed-form Gaussian inference in linear state-space models and train it end-to-end within a model-free architecture to maximize returns. Similar to efficient linear recurrent layers, the Kalman filter layer processes sequential data using a parallel scan, which scales logarithmically with the sequence length. By design, Kalman filter layers are a drop-in replacement for other recurrent layers in standard model-free architectures, but importantly they include an explicit mechanism for probabilistic filtering of the latent state representation. Experiments in a wide variety of tasks with partial observability show that Kalman filter layers excel in problems where uncertainty reasoning is key for decision-making, outperforming other stateful models",

This framework is extended to disentangle dynamic states from underlying static factors of variation, represented as time-invariant variables in the latent space. We train the model using maximum likelihood estimation with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) in an end-to-end manner.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Estimating the response to an intervention with an associated dose conditional on a unit's covariates, the \"conditional-average dose response\" (CADR), is a relevant task in a variety of domains, from healthcare to business, economics, and beyond. Estimating such a response is challenging for several reasons: Firstly, it typically needs to be estimated from observational data, which can be confounded and negatively affect the performance of intervention response estimators used for counterfactual inference. Secondly, the continuity of the dose prevents the adoption of approaches used to estimate responses to binary-valued interventions. That is why the machine learning (ML) community has proposed several tailored CADR estimators. Yet, the proposal of most of these methods requires strong assumptions on the distribution of data and the assignment of interventions, which go beyond the standard assumptions in causal inference. Whereas previous works have so far focused on smooth shifts in covariate distributions across doses, in this work, we will study estimating CADR from clustered data and where different doses are assigned to different segments of a population. On a novel benchmarking dataset, we show the impacts of clustered data on model performance. Additionally, we propose an estimator, CBRNet, that enables the application of representation balancing for CADR estimation through clustering the covariate space and a novel loss function. CBRNet learns cluster-agnostic and hence dose-agnostic covariate representations through representation balancing for unbiased CADR inference. We run extensive experiments to illustrate the workings of our method and compare it with the state of the art in ML for CADR estimation",

Deep learning (DL) has shown promise in forecasting the effects of such mutations but is hindered by two primary constraints. First, the structures of mutant proteins are often elusive to acquire. Secondly, PPI takes place dynamically, which is rarely integrated into the DL architecture design. To address these obstacles, we present a novel framework named Refine-PPI with two key enhancements. First, we introduce a structure refinement module trained by a mask mutation modeling (MMM) task on available wild-type structures, which is then transferred to hallucinate the inaccessible mutant structures. Second, we employ a new kind of geometric network, called the probability density cloud network (PDC-Net), to capture 3D dynamic variations and encode the atomic uncertainty associated with PPI. Comprehensive experiments on SKEMPI.v2 substantiate the superiority of Refine-PPI over all existing tools for predicting free energy change. These findings underscore the effectiveness of our hallucination strategy and the PDC module in addressing the absence of mutant protein structure and modeling geometric uncertainty",

Spectral augmentation, which involves modifying a graph's spectral properties such as eigenvalues or eigenvectors, is widely believed to enhance model performance. However, an intriguing paradox emerges, as methods grounded in seemingly conflicting assumptions regarding the spectral domain demonstrate notable enhancements in learning performance. Through extensive empirical studies, we find that simple edge perturbations - random edge dropping for node-level and random edge adding for graph-level self-supervised learning - consistently yield comparable or superior performance while being significantly more computationally efficient. This suggests that the computational overhead of sophisticated spectral augmentations may not justify their practical benefits.

    "abstract": "Over the past decade, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have transformed graph representation learning. In the widely adopted message-passing GNN framework, nodes refine their representations by aggregating information from neighboring nodes iteratively. While GNNs excel in various domains, recent theoretical studies have raised concerns about their capabilities. GNNs aim to address various graph-related tasks by utilizing such node representations, however, this one-size-fits-all approach proves suboptimal for diverse tasks. Motivated by these observations, we conduct empirical tests to compare the performance of current GNN models with more conventional and direct methods in link prediction tasks. Introducing our model, PROXI, which leverages proximity information of node pairs in both graph and attribute spaces, we find that standard machine learning (ML) models perform competitively, even outperforming cutting-edge GNN models when applied to these proximity metrics derived from node neighborhoods and attributes. This holds true across both homophilic and heterophilic networks, as well as small and large benchmark datasets, including those from the Open Graph Benchmark (OGB). Moreover, we show that augmenting traditional GNNs with PROXI significantly boosts their link prediction performance. Our empirical findings corroborate the previously mentioned theoretical observations and imply that there exists ample room for enhancement in current GNN models to reach their potential",

    "abstract": "Recent findings suggest that the consecutive layers of ReLU neural networks can be understood geometrically as space folding transformations of the input space, revealing patterns of self-similarity. In this paper, we present the first quantitative analysis of this space folding phenomenon in ReLU neural networks. Our approach focuses on examining how straight paths in the Euclidean input space are mapped to their counterparts in the Hamming activation space. In this process, the convexity of straight lines is generally lost, giving rise to non-convex folding behavior. To quantify this effect, we introduce a novel measure based on range metrics, similar to those used in the study of random walks, and provide the proof for the equivalence of convexity notions between the input and activation spaces. Furthermore, we provide empirical analysis on a geometrical analysis benchmark (CantorNet) as well as an image classification benchmark (MNIST). Our work advances the understanding of the activation space in ReLU neural networks by leveraging the phenomena of geometric folding, providing valuable insights on how these models process input information",

    "title": "Improving Consistency in Large Language Models through Chain of Guidance",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Consistency is a fundamental dimension of trustworthiness in Large Language Models (LLMs). For humans to be able to trust LLM-based applications, their outputs should be consistent when prompted with inputs that carry the same meaning or intent. Despite this need, there is no known mechanism to control and guide LLMs to be more consistent at inference time. In this paper, we introduce a novel alignment strategy to maximize semantic consistency in LLM outputs. Our proposal is based on \\textbf{Chain of Guidance} (CoG), a multistep prompting technique that generates highly consistent outputs from LLMs. For closed-book question-answering (Q\\&A) tasks, when compared to direct prompting, the outputs generated using CoG show improved consistency. While other approaches like template-based responses and majority voting may offer alternative paths to consistency, our work focuses on exploring the potential of guided prompting. We use synthetic data sets comprised of consistent input-output pairs to fine-tune LLMs to produce consistent {\\it and} correct outputs. Our fine-tuned models are more than twice as consistent compared to base models and show strong generalization capabilities by producing consistent outputs over datasets not used in the fine-tuning process.

    "title": "Evaluation of Best-of-N Sampling Strategies for Language Model Alignment",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Best-of-N (BoN) sampling with a reward model has been shown to be an effective strategy for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences at the time of decoding. BoN sampling is susceptible to a problem known as reward hacking. Since the reward model is an imperfect proxy for the true objective, an excessive focus on optimizing its value can lead to a compromise of its performance on the true objective. Previous work proposes Regularized BoN sampling (RBoN), a BoN sampling with regularization to the objective, and shows that it outperforms BoN sampling so that it mitigates reward hacking and empirically (Jinnai et al., 2024). However, Jinnai et al. (2024) introduce RBoN based on a heuristic and they lack the analysis of why such regularization strategy improves the performance of BoN sampling. The aim of this study is to analyze the effect of BoN sampling on regularization strategies. Using the regularization strategies corresponds to robust optimization, which maximizes the worst case over a set of possible perturbations in the proxy reward. Although the theoretical guarantees are not directly applicable to RBoN, RBoN corresponds to a practical implementation. This paper proposes an extension of the RBoN framework, called Stochastic RBoN sampling (SRBoN), which is a theoretically guaranteed approach to worst-case RBoN in proxy reward. We then perform an empirical evaluation using the AlpacaFarm and Anthropic's hh-rlhf datasets to evaluate which factors of the regularization strategies contribute to the improvement of the true proxy reward. In addition, we also propose another simple RBoN method, the Sentence Length Regularized BoN, which has a better performance in the experiment as compared to the previous methods",

    "abstract": "We study inferring 3D object-centric scene representations from a single image. While recent methods have shown potential in unsupervised 3D object discovery, they are limited in generalizing to unseen spatial configurations. This limitation stems from the lack of translation invariance in their 3D object representations. Previous 3D object discovery methods entangle objects' intrinsic attributes like shape and appearance with their 3D locations. This entanglement hinders learning generalizable 3D object representations. To tackle this bottleneck, we propose the unsupervised discovery of Object-Centric neural Fields (uOCF), which integrates translation invariance into the object representation. To allow learning object-centric representations from limited real-world images, we further introduce an object prior learning method that transfers object-centric prior knowledge from a synthetic dataset. To evaluate our approach, we collect four new datasets, including two real kitchen environments. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly improves generalization and sample efficiency and enables unsupervised 3D object discovery in real scenes. Notably, uOCF demonstrates zero-shot generalization to unseen objects from a single real image.

This regression performance can be explained in part due to LLM embeddings over numeric data inherently preserving Lipschitz continuity over the feature space.

In this case, explicit estimates are provided for the associated optimization problem, i.e. score approximation, while these are combined with the corresponding sampling estimates. As a result, we obtain the best known upper bound estimates in terms of key quantities of interest, such as the dimension and rates of convergence, for the Wasserstein-2 distance between the data distribution (Gaussian with unknown mean) and our sampling algorithm. Beyond the motivating example and in order to allow for the use of a diverse range of stochastic optimizers, we present our results using an $L^2$-accurate score estimation assumption, which crucially is formed under an expectation with respect to the stochastic optimizer and our novel auxiliary process that uses only known information. This approach yields the best known convergence rate for our sampling algorithm",

We propose an algorithmic framework that, under suitable assumptions, is guaranteed to provide mixed-binary solutions. Moreover, the generality of the method allows to safely use existing continuous bilevel solvers within the proposed framework. We evaluate the performance of our approach for two specific machine learning problems, i.e., the estimation of the group-sparsity structure in regression problems and the data distillation problem.

Experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets demonstrate that DemP outperforms existing dense-to-sparse structured pruning methods, achieving better accuracy-sparsity tradeoffs while speeding up training up to 3.56$\\times$.

A significant level of personalization is required for highly heterogeneous clients but can be challenging to achieve, especially when clients' datasets are small. We introduce PAC-PFL for PFL of probabilistic models. PAC-PFL infers a shared hyper-posterior and treats each client's posterior inference as the personalization step. Unlike previous PFL algorithms, PAC-PFL does not regularize all personalized models towards a single shared model, thereby greatly enhancing its personalization flexibility. By establishing and minimizing a PAC-Bayesian generalization bound on the average true loss of clients, PAC-PFL effectively mitigates overfitting even in data-poor scenarios. Additionally, PAC-PFL provides generalization bounds for new clients joining later. PAC-PFL achieves accurate and well-calibrated predictions, as supported by our experiments",

Although existing methods have shown great performance in generating entire graphs for graph-level learning tasks, no graph diffusion models have been developed to generate synthetic graph structures, that is, synthetic nodes and associated edges within a given graph, for node-level learning tasks. Inspired by the research in the computer vision literature using synthetic data for enhanced performance, we propose Diffusion on Graph (DoG), which generates synthetic graph structures to boost the performance of GNNs. The synthetic graph structures generated by DoG are combined with the original graph to form an augmented graph for the training of node-level learning tasks, such as node classification and graph contrastive learning (GCL). To improve the efficiency of the generation process, a Bi-Level Neighbor Map Decoder (BLND) is introduced in DoG. To mitigate the adverse effect of the noise introduced by the synthetic graph structures, a low-rank regularization method is proposed for the training of graph neural networks (GNNs) on the augmented graphs. Extensive experiments on various graph datasets for semi-supervised node classification and graph contrastive learning have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of DoG with low-rank regularization.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Intrinsic Image Decomposition (IID) is a challenging inverse problem that seeks to decompose a natural image into its underlying intrinsic components such as albedo and shading. While recent image decomposition methods rely on learning-based priors on these components, they often suffer from component cross-contamination owing to joint training of priors; or from Sim-to-Real gap since the priors trained on synthetic data are kept frozen during the inference on real images. In this work, we propose to solve the intrinsic image decomposition problem using a bank of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) as priors where each GAN is independently trained only on a single intrinsic component, providing stronger and more disentangled priors. At the core of our approach is the idea that the latent space of a GAN is a well-suited optimization domain to solve inverse problems. Given an input image, we propose to jointly invert the latent codes of a set of GANs and combine their outputs to reproduce the input. Contrary to all existing GAN inversion methods that are limited to inverting only a single GAN, our proposed approach, JoIN, is able to jointly invert multiple GANs using only a single image as supervision while still maintaining distribution priors of each intrinsic component. We show that our approach is modular, allowing various forward imaging models, and that it can successfully decompose both synthetic and real images. Further, taking inspiration from existing GAN inversion approaches, we allow for careful fine-tuning of the generator priors during the inference on real images. This way, our method is able to achieve excellent generalization on real images even though it uses only synthetic data to train the GAN priors. We demonstrate the success of our approach through exhaustive qualitative and quantitative evaluations and ablation studies on various datasets",

    "abstract": "Robust statistics aims to compute quantities to represent data where a fraction of it may be arbitrarily corrupted. The most essential statistic is the mean, and in recent years, there has been a flurry of theoretical advancement for efficiently estimating the mean in high dimensions on corrupted data. While several algorithms have been proposed that achieve near-optimal error, they all rely on large data size requirements as a function of dimension. In this paper, we perform an extensive experimentation over various mean estimation techniques where data size might not meet this requirement due to the high-dimensional setting. For data with inliers generated from a Gaussian with known covariance, we find experimentally that several robust mean estimation techniques can practically improve upon the sample mean, with the quantum entropy scaling approach from Dong \\etal (NeurIPS 2019) performing consistently the best. However, this consistent improvement is conditioned on a couple of simple modifications to how the steps to prune outliers work in the high-dimension low-data setting, and when the inliers deviate significantly from Gaussianity. In fact, with these modifications, they are typically able to achieve roughly the same error as taking the sample mean of the uncorrupted inlier data, even with very low data size. In addition to controlled experiments on synthetic data, we also explore these methods on large language models, deep pretrained image models, and non-contextual word embedding models that do not necessarily have an inherent Gaussian distribution. Yet, in these settings, a mean point of a set of embedded objects is a desirable quantity to learn, and the data exhibits the high-dimension low-data setting studied in this paper. We show both the challenges of achieving this goal, and that our updated robust mean estimation methods can provide significant improvement over using just the sample mean. We additionally publish a library of Python implementations of robust mean estimation algorithms, allowing practitioners and researchers to apply these techniques and to perform further experimentation",

    "abstract": "Concept-based explanations translate the internal representations of deep learning models into a language that humans are familiar with: concepts. One popular method for finding concepts is Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs), which are learnt using a probe dataset of concept exemplars. In this work, we investigate three properties of CAVs: (1) inconsistency across layers, (2) entanglement with other concepts, and (3) spatial dependency. Each property provides both challenges and opportunities in interpreting models. We introduce tools designed to detect the presence of these properties, provide insight into how each property can lead to misleading explanations, and provide recommendations to mitigate their impact. To demonstrate practical applications, we apply our recommendations to a melanoma classification task, showing how entanglement can lead to uninterpretable results and that the choice of negative probe set can have a substantial impact on the meaning of a CAV. Further, we show that understanding these properties can be used to our advantage. For example, we introduce spatially dependent CAVs to test if a model is translation invariant with respect to a specific concept and class.

    "title": "What Makes ImageNet Look Unlike LAION",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "ImageNet was famously created by querying several image search engines such as Flickr. What if we recreated ImageNet instead by searching the massive LAION dataset based on image captions alone? In this work, we carry out this counterfactual investigation. We find that the resulting ImageNet recreation, which we call LAIONet, looks distinctly unlike the original. Specifically, the intra-class similarity of images in the original ImageNet is dramatically higher than it is for LAIONet. Consequently, models trained on ImageNet perform significantly worse on LAIONet. We propose a rigorous explanation for the discrepancy in terms of a subtle, yet important, difference in two plausible causal data-generating processes for the respective datasets, that we support with systematic experimentation. In a nutshell, searching based on an image caption alone creates an information bottleneck that mitigates the selection bias otherwise present in image-based filtering. Our explanation formalizes a long-held intuition in the community that ImageNet images are stereotypical, unnatural, and overly simple representations of the class category. At the same time, it provides a simple and actionable takeaway for future dataset creation efforts",

While motorized bionic limbs show promise, their effectiveness depends on replicating the dynamic coordination of human movement across diverse environments. In this paper, we introduce a model for human behavior in the context of bionic prosthesis control. Our approach leverages human locomotion demonstrations to learn the synergistic coupling of the lower limbs, enabling the prediction of the kinematic behavior of a missing limb during tasks such as walking, climbing inclines, and stairs. We propose a multitasking, continually adaptive model that anticipates and refines movements over time. At the core of our method is a technique which we call the multitask prospective rehearsal, that anticipates and synthesizes future movements based on the previous prediction and employs a corrective mechanism for subsequent predictions. Our evolving architecture merges lightweight, task-specific modules on a shared backbone, ensuring both specificity and scalability. We validate our model through experiments on real-world human gait datasets, including transtibial amputees, across a wide range of locomotion tasks.

To overcome this lack of expressivity in the existing algorithms, we introduce Riemannian versions of two state-of-the-art techniques, namely t-SNE and Multidimensional Scaling. Therefore, we are able to reduce a set of $c \\times c$ SPD matrices into a set of $2 \\times 2$ SPD matrices in order to capture the curvature information and avoid any distortion induced by flattening the representation in an Euclidean setup. Moreover, our approaches pave the way for targeting more general dimensionality reduction applications while preserving the geometry of the data. We performed experiments on controlled synthetic dataset to ensure that the low-dimensional representation preserves the geometric properties of both SPD Gaussians and geodesics.

Most existing methods for generating saliency maps rely on reference labels, restricting their use to supervised tasks. EigenCAM is the only notable label-independent alternative, leveraging Singular Value Decomposition to generate saliency maps applicable across CNN models, but it does not fully exploit the tensorial structure of feature maps. In this work, we introduce the Tucker Saliency Map (TSM) method, which applies Tucker tensor decomposition to better capture the inherent structure of feature maps, producing more accurate singular vectors and values. These are used to generate high-fidelity saliency maps, effectively highlighting objects of interest in the input. We further extend EigenCAM and TSM into multivector variants—Multivec-EigenCAM and Multivector Tucker Saliency Maps (MTSM)—which utilize all singular vectors and values, further improving saliency map quality. Quantitative evaluations on supervised classification models demonstrate that TSM, Multivec-EigenCAM, and MTSM achieve competitive performance with label-dependent methods. Moreover, TSM enhances interpretability by approximately $50\\%$ over EigenCAM for both supervised and self-supervised models. Multivec-EigenCAM and MTSM further advance state-of-the-art interpretability performance on self-supervised models, with MTSM achieving the best results",

In light of recent research on algorithm discovery, in this work, we would like to answer this question: is it possible to parametrize the algorithm space for lattice reduction problem with neural networks and find an algorithm without supervised data? Our strategy is to use equivariant and invariant parametrizations and train in a self-supervised way. We design a deep neural model outputting factorized unimodular matrices and train it in a self-supervised manner by penalizing non-orthogonal lattice bases. We incorporate the symmetries of lattice reduction into the model by making it invariant to isometries and scaling of the ambient space and equivariant with respect to the hyperocrahedral group permuting and flipping the lattice basis elements. We show that this approach yields an algorithm with comparable complexity and performance to the LLL algorithm on a set of benchmarks.

    "abstract": "Remaining useful life (RUL) prediction is crucial in predictive maintenance. Recently, deep learning forecasting methods, especially Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNNs), have achieved remarkable performance in RUL prediction. Most existing ST-GNNs require searching for the graph structure before utilizing GNNs to learn spatial graph representation, and they necessitate a temporal model such as LSTM to leverage the temporal dependencies in a fixed lookback window. However, such an approach has several limitations. Firstly, it demands substantial computational resources to learn graph structures for the time series data. Secondly, independently learning spatial and temporal information disregards their inherent correlation, and thirdly, capturing information within a fixed lookback window ignores long-term dependencies across the entire time series. To mitigate the issues above, instead of treating the data within the lookback window as a sequence of graphs in ST-GNN methods, we regard it as a complete graph and employ a Fourier Graph Neural Network (FGN) to learn the spatiotemporal information within this graph in the frequency space. Additionally, we create training and test graphs with varying sizes of lookback windows, enabling the model to learn both short-term and long-term dependencies and provide multiple predictions for ensemble averaging. We also consider scenarios where sensor signals exhibit multiple operation conditions and design a sequence decomposition plugin to denoise input signals, aiming to enhance the performance of FGN. We evaluate the proposed model on two benchmark datasets, demonstrating its superior performance on the RUL prediction task compared to state-of-the-art approaches",

While automatic augmentation has demonstrated success in image classification tasks, its application to time-series problems, particularly in long-term forecasting, has received comparatively less attention. To address this gap, we introduce a time-series automatic augmentation approach named TSAA, which is both efficient and easy to implement. The solution involves tackling the associated bilevel optimization problem through a two-step process: initially training a non-augmented model for a limited number of epochs, followed by an iterative split procedure. During this iterative process, we alternate between identifying a robust augmentation policy through Bayesian optimization and refining the model while discarding suboptimal runs. Extensive evaluations on challenging univariate and multivariate forecasting benchmark problems demonstrate that TSAA consistently outperforms several robust baselines, suggesting its potential integration into prediction pipelines.

Despite significant progress with learning-based approaches, existing methods still face challenges when the overlapping region between the two point clouds is small. In this paper, we propose an adaptive multi-step refinement network that refines the registration quality at each step by leveraging the information from the preceding step. To achieve this, we introduce a training procedure and a refinement network. Firstly, to adapt the network to the current step, we utilize a generalized one-way attention mechanism, which prioritizes the last step's estimated overlapping region, and we condition the network on step indices. Secondly, instead of training the network to map either random transformations or a fixed pre-trained model's estimations to the ground truth, we train it on transformations with varying registration qualities, ranging from accurate to inaccurate, thereby enhancing the network's adaptiveness and robustness. Despite its conceptual simplicity, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the 3DMatch/3DLoMatch and KITTI benchmarks.

    "title": "On the Regularization of Learnable Embeddings for Time Series Forecasting",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In forecasting multiple time series, accounting for the individual features of each sequence can be challenging. To address this, modern deep learning methods for time series analysis combine a shared (global) model with local layers, specific to each time series, often implemented as learnable embeddings. Ideally, these local embeddings should encode meaningful representations of the unique dynamics of each sequence. However, when these are learned end-to-end as parameters of a forecasting model, they may end up acting as mere sequence identifiers. Shared processing blocks may then become reliant on such identifiers, limiting their transferability to new contexts. In this paper, we address this issue by investigating methods to regularize the learning of local learnable embeddings for time series processing. Specifically, we perform the first extensive empirical study on the subject and show how such regularizations consistently improve performance in widely adopted architectures. Furthermore, we show that methods attempting to prevent the co-adaptation of local and global parameters by means of embeddings perturbation are particularly effective in this context. In this regard, we include in the comparison several perturbation-based regularization methods, going as far as periodically resetting the embeddings during training. The obtained results provide an important contribution to understanding the interplay between learnable local parameters and shared processing layers: a key challenge in modern time series processing models and a step toward developing effective foundation models for time series",

    "title": "DELTA: Dual Consistency Delving with Topological Uncertainty for Active Graph Domain Adaptation",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Graph domain adaptation has recently enabled knowledge transfer across different graphs. However, without the semantic information on target graphs, the performance on target graphs is still far from satisfactory. To address the issue, we study the problem of active graph domain adaptation, which selects a small quantitative of informative nodes on the target graph for extra annotation. This problem is highly challenging due to the complicated topological relationships and the distribution discrepancy across graphs. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Dual Consistency Delving with Topological Uncertainty (DELTA) for active graph domain adaptation. Our DELTA consists of an edge-oriented graph subnetwork and a path-oriented graph subnetwork, which can explore topological semantics from complementary perspectives. In particular, our edge-oriented graph subnetwork utilizes the message passing mechanism to learn neighborhood information, while our path-oriented graph subnetwork explores high-order relationships from substructures. To jointly learn from two subnetworks, we roughly select informative candidate nodes with the consideration of consistency across two subnetworks. Then, we aggregate local semantics from its K-hop subgraph based on node degrees for topological uncertainty estimation. To overcome potential distribution shifts, we compare target nodes and their corresponding source nodes for discrepancy scores as an additional component for fine selection. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that DELTA outperforms various state-of-the-art approaches.

    "abstract": "Extending context window sizes allows large language models (LLMs) to process longer sequences and handle more complex tasks. Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) has become the de facto standard due to its relative positional encoding properties that benefit long-context training. However, we observe that using RoPE with BFloat16 format results in numerical issues, causing it to deviate from its intended relative positional encoding, especially in long-context scenarios. This issue arises from BFloat16's limited precision and accumulates as context length increases, with the first token contributing significantly to this problem. Despite its limitations, BFloat16 remains desirable for its computational efficiency, particularly given the substantial memory overhead required to extend the context window. To improve long-context training under BFloat16, we develop AnchorAttention, a plug-and-play attention method that enhances long-context capabilities, and speeds up training. AnchorAttention reduces unnecessary attention computations, maintains semantic coherence, and boosts computational efficiency by treating the first token as a shared anchor with a consistent position ID, making it visible to all documents within the training context. Experiments on three types of LLMs demonstrate that AnchorAttention significantly improves long-context performance and reduces training time by over 50\\% compared to standard full attention mechanisms, while preserving the original LLM's capabilities on general tasks",

This approach has been shown to deliver state-of-the-art performance in a wide range of image restoration problems involving Gaussian and mild Poisson noise. With extreme computer vision applications in mind, this paper presents the first PnP denoising diffusion method for photon-starved imaging problems. These problems arise in new quantum-enhanced imaging systems that exploit the particle nature of light to exceed the limitations of classical imaging. The problems involve highly challenging noise statistics, such as binomial, geometric, and low-intensity Poisson noise, which are difficult because of high uncertainty about the solution and because the models exhibit poor regularity properties (e.g., exploding scores, constraints).

Thus the pretraining and fine-tuning paradigm has been proposed to mitigate the label cost issue. Subsequently, the gap between the pretext tasks and downstream tasks has spurred the development of graph prompt learning which inserts a set of graph prompts into the original graph data with minimal parameters while preserving competitive performance. However, the current exploratory works are still limited since they all concentrate on learning fixed task-specific prompts which may not generalize well across the diverse instances that the task comprises. To tackle this challenge, we introduce Instance-Aware Graph Prompt Learning (IA-GPL) in this paper, aiming to generate distinct prompts tailored to different input instances. The process involves generating intermediate prompts for each instance using a lightweight architecture, quantizing these prompts through trainable codebook vectors, and employing the exponential moving average technique to ensure stable training.

    "abstract": "Randomly initialized dense networks contain subnetworks that achieve high accuracy without weight learning—strong lottery tickets (SLTs). Recently, Gadhikar et al. (2023) demonstrated that SLTs could also be found within a randomly pruned source network. This phenomenon can be exploited to further compress the small memory size required by SLTs. However, their method is limited to SLTs that are even sparser than the source, leading to worse accuracy due to unintentionally high sparsity. This paper proposes a method for reducing the SLT memory size without restricting the sparsity of the SLTs that can be found. A random subset of the initial weights is frozen by either permanently pruning them or locking them as a fixed part of the SLT, resulting in a smaller model size. Experimental results show that Edge-Popup (Ramanujan et al., 2020; Sreenivasan et al., 2022) finds SLTs with better accuracy-to-model size trade-off within frozen networks than within dense or randomly pruned source networks. In particular, freezing $70\\%$ of a ResNet on ImageNet provides $3.3\\times$ compression compared to the SLT found within a dense counterpart, raises accuracy by up to $14.12$ points compared to the SLT found within a randomly pruned counterpart, and offers a better accuracy-model size trade-off than both",

    "abstract": "Test-time adaptation (TTA) is an effective approach to mitigate performance degradation of trained models when encountering input distribution shifts at test time. However, existing TTA methods often suffer significant performance drops when facing additional class distribution shifts. We first analyze TTA methods under label distribution shifts and identify the presence of class-wise confusion patterns commonly observed across different covariate shifts. Based on this observation, we introduce label Distribution shift-Aware prediction Refinement for Test-time adaptation (DART), a novel TTA method that refines the predictions by focusing on class-wise confusion patterns. DART trains a prediction refinement module during an intermediate time by exposing it to several batches with diverse class distributions using the training dataset. This module is then used during test time to detect and correct class distribution shifts, significantly improving pseudo-label accuracy for test data. Our method exhibits 5-18% gains in accuracy under label distribution shifts on CIFAR-10C, without any performance degradation when there is no label distribution shift. Extensive experiments on CIFAR, PACS, OfficeHome, and ImageNet benchmarks demonstrate DART's ability to correct inaccurate predictions caused by test-time distribution shifts. This improvement leads to enhanced performance in existing TTA methods, making DART a valuable plug-in tool",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Weight sharing, equivariance, and local filters, as in convolutional neural networks, are believed to contribute to the sample efficiency of neural networks. However, it is not clear how each one of these design choices contributes to the generalization error. Through the lens of statistical learning theory, we aim to provide insight into this question by characterizing the relative impact of each choice on the sample complexity. We obtain lower and upper sample complexity bounds for a class of single hidden layer networks. For a large class of activation functions, the bounds depend merely on the norm of filters and are dimension-independent. We also provide bounds for max-pooling and an extension to multi-layer networks, both with mild dimension dependence. We provide a few takeaways from the theoretical results. It can be shown that depending on the weight-sharing mechanism, the non-equivariant weight-sharing can yield a similar generalization bound as the equivariant one. We show that locality has generalization benefits, however the uncertainty principle implies a trade-off between locality and expressivity. We conduct extensive experiments and highlight some consistent trends for these models",

    "title": "Selective Prediction via Training Dynamics",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Selective Prediction is the task of rejecting inputs a model would predict incorrectly on. This involves a trade-off between input space coverage (how many data points are accepted) and model utility (how good is the performance on accepted data points). Current methods for selective prediction typically impose constraints on either the model architecture or the optimization objective; this inhibits their usage in practice and introduces unknown interactions with pre-existing loss functions. In contrast to prior work, we show that state-of-the-art se- lective prediction performance can be attained solely from studying the (discretized) training dynamics of a model. We propose a general framework that, given a test input, monitors metrics capturing the instability of predictions from intermediate models (i.e., checkpoints) obtained during training w.r.t. the final model's prediction. In particular, we reject data points exhibiting too much disagreement with the final prediction at late stages in training. The proposed rejection mechanism is domain-agnostic (i.e., it works for both discrete and real-valued prediction) and can be flexibly combined with existing selective prediction approaches as it does not require any train-time modifications. Our experimental evaluation on image classification, regression, and time series problems shows that our method beats past state-of-the-art accuracy/utility trade-offs on typical selective prediction benchmarks",

Aside from aiding programming-related tasks, anecdotal evidence suggests that including code in pretraining corpora may improve performance on other, unrelated tasks, yet to date no work has been able to establish a causal connection by controlling between language and code data. Here we do just this. We pretrain language models on datasets which interleave natural language and code in two different settings: competitive, in which the total volume of data seen during pretraining is held constant; and additive, in which the volume of language data is held constant. We study how the pretraining mixture affects performance on (a) compositionality, measured by generalization accuracy on semantic parsing and syntactic transformation tasks, and more broadly on (b) downstream non-code-related objectives, measured by performance on tasks from the BigBench benchmark. We find that pretraining on higher proportions of code improves performance on compositional tasks involving structured output (like semantic parsing), and mathematics. Conversely, increase code mixture can harm performance on other tasks, including on tasks that requires sensitivity to linguistic structure such as syntax or morphology, and tasks measuring real-world knowledge",

Recently, DeepTime demonstrated that this class of models can rival state-of-the-art deep historical-value models on the long time-series forecasting (LTSF) benchmarks. The DeepTime framework comprises two key components: (1) a time-indexed basis parameterized as an implicit neural representation (INR), and (2) a meta-learning formulation that fits observed data to this basis via ridge regression, then extrapolates the result to generate forecasts. Our regularization term encourages the time-indexed basis elements to be more unit standardized and less mutually correlated, intended to enable more robust ridge regression. The regularized variant matches or outperforms DeepTime on all LTSF benchmarks. Moreover, it is significantly more resilient to missing values in the lookback window at test time, enhances forecast accuracy when applied to higher-frequency data than it was trained on, and boosts performance when trained on smaller datasets. Overall, we conclude that our regularized approach sets a new state-of-the-art for deep time-index models",

    "abstract": "The vast majority of Reinforcement Learning methods is largely impacted by the computation effort and data requirements needed to obtain effective estimates of action-value functions, which in turn determine the quality of the overall performance and the sample-efficiency of the learning procedure. Typically, action-value functions are estimated through an iterative scheme that alternates the application of an empirical approximation of the Bellman operator and a subsequent projection step onto a considered function space. It has been observed that this scheme can be potentially generalized to carry out multiple iterations of the Bellman operator at once, benefiting the underlying learning algorithm. However, until now, it has been challenging to effectively implement this idea, especially in high-dimensional problems. In this paper, we introduce iterated $Q$-Network (i-QN), a novel principled approach that enables multiple consecutive Bellman updates by learning a tailored sequence of action-value functions where each serves as the target for the next. We show that i-QN is theoretically grounded and that it can be seamlessly used in value-based and actor-critic methods. We empirically demonstrate the advantages of i-QN in Atari $2600$ games and MuJoCo continuous control problems",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Minimizing loss functions is one important ingredient for machine learning to fit parameters such that the machine learning models extract relations hidden in the data. The smaller the loss function value on various splittings of a dataset, the better the machine learning model is assumed to perform. However, datasets are usually generated by dynamics consisting of deterministic components, where relations are clearly defined and consequently learnable, as well as stochastic parts where outcomes are random and thus not predictable. Depending on the amplitude of the deterministic and stochastic processes, the best achievable loss function value varies and is usually not known in real data science scenarios. In this research, a statistical framework is developed that provides measures to address the predictability of a target given the available input data and, after training a machine learning model, how much of the deterministic relations have been missed by the model. Consequently, the presented framework allows to differentiate model errors into unpredictable parts regarding the given input and a systematic miss of deterministic relations. The work extends the definition of model success or failure as well as the convergence of a training process. Moreover, it is demonstrated how such measures can enrich the procedure of model training. The framework is showcased with time series data on different synthetic and real-world datasets.

Here $\\overline{d}_{\\mathbb{M}}$ is the upper Minkowski dimension of the corresponding support $\\mathbb{M}$ of the data distribution and $\\delta$ is a positive constant. It is, however, unknown as to whether this rate is minimax optimal, i.e. whether there are estimators that achieve a better test-error rate.

(i) Current TTA methods are limited by the bandwidth with which the stream reveals data, since conducting several adaptation steps on each revealed batch from the stream will lead to overfitting. (ii) In many realistic scenarios, the stream reveals insufficient data for the model to fully adapt to a given distribution shift. We tackle the first scenario problem with auxiliary tasks where we leverage unlabeled data from the training distribution. In particular, we propose distilling the predictions of an originally pretrained model on clean data during adaptation. We found that our proposed auxiliary task significantly accelerates the adaptation to distribution shifts. We report a performance improvement over the state of the art by 1.5\\% and 6\\% on average across all corruptions on ImageNet-C under episodic and continual evaluation, respectively. To combat the second scenario of limited data, we analyze the effectiveness of combining federated adaptation with our proposed auxiliary task across different models even when different clients observe different distribution shifts. We find that not only federated averaging enhances adaptation, but combining it with our auxiliary task provides a notable 6\\% performance gains over previous TTA methods",

In this paper, we address the challenges of sim2real transfer caused by latency and asynchronous dynamics in real-world robotic systems. Our approach involves developing a novel framework, REX (Robotic Environments with jaX), that uses a graph-based simulation model to incorporate latency effects while optimizing for parallelization on accelerator hardware. Our framework simulates the asynchronous, hierarchical nature of real-world systems, while simultaneously estimating system dynamics and delays from real-world data and implementing delay compensation strategies to minimize the sim2real gap. We validate our approach on two real-world systems, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving sim2real performance by accurately modeling both system dynamics and delays.

Unlike previous methods for high-level visual planning for robotic manipulation, our method uses VLLMs for the entire planning process, enabling a more tightly integrated loop between perception, control, and planning. As a result, Wonderful Team's performance on real-world semantic and physical planning tasks often exceeds methods that rely on separate vision systems. For example, we see an average 40% success rate improvement on VimaBench over prior methods such as NLaP, an average 30% improvement over Trajectory Generators on tasks from the Trajectory Generator paper, including drawing and wiping a plate, and an average 70% improvement over Trajectory Generators on a new set of semantic reasoning tasks including environment rearrangement with implicit linguistic constraints.

They aim to learn an energy-based model by predicting the latent representation of a target signal y from the latent representation of a context signal x. JEPAs bypass the need for negative and positive samples, traditionally required by contrastive learning while avoiding the overfitting issues associated with generative pretraining. In this paper, we show that graph-level representations can be effectively modeled using this paradigm by proposing a Graph Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (Graph-JEPA). In particular, we employ masked modeling and focus on predicting the latent representations of masked subgraphs starting from the latent representation of a context subgraph. To endow the representations with the implicit hierarchy that is often present in graph-level concepts, we devise an alternative prediction objective that consists of predicting the coordinates of the encoded subgraphs on the unit hyperbola in the 2D plane. Through multiple experimental evaluations, we show that Graph-JEPA can learn highly semantic and expressive representations, as shown by the downstream performance in graph classification, regression, and distinguishing non-isomorphic graphs.

Building on previous work, we show that credal regions can be directly constructed using conformal methods. This allows us to provide a novel extension of classical conformal prediction to problems with ambiguous ground truth, that is, when the exact labels for given inputs are not exactly known. The resulting construction enjoys desirable practical and theoretical properties: (i) conformal coverage guarantees, (ii) smaller prediction sets (compared to classical conformal prediction regions) and (iii) disentanglement of uncertainty sources (epistemic, aleatoric).

To address this, our paper introduces a \\emph{causal fair metric} formulated based on causal structures encompassing sensitive attributes and protected causal perturbation. To enhance the practicality of our metric, we propose metric learning as a method for metric estimation and deployment in real-world problems in the absence of structural causal models. We also demonstrate the applications of the causal fair metric in classifiers.

While previous work has simply approached the task as a binary classification without providing further insight into the underlying decision, we aim to iteratively find a sequence of necessary steps to transform a mathematical expression into an arbitrary equivalent form. Each step in this sequence is specified by an axiom together with its position of application. We denote this task as Stepwise Equation Transformation Identification (SETI) task. To solve the task efficiently, we further propose TreePointerNet, a novel architecture which exploits the inherent tree structure of mathematical equations and consists of three key building blocks: (i) a transformer model tailored to work on hierarchically tree-structured equations, making use of (ii) a copy-pointer mechanism to extract the exact location of a transformation in the tree and finally (iii) custom embeddings that map distinguishable occurrences of the same token type to a common embedding. In addition, we introduce new datasets of equations for the SETI task. We benchmark our model against various baselines and perform an ablation study to quantify the influence of our custom embeddings and the copy-pointer component. Furthermore, we test the robustness of our model on data of unseen complexity.

Clustering within a multiplex graph can involve merging vertices into communities that are consistent across all layers, grouping similar layers into clusters, or creating overlapping clusters among vertices and layers.

This scenario, termed multi-group community detection, significantly enhances the accuracy of clustering processes and aids in the interpretation of partitions. To date, the current literature on state-of-the-art community detection has not extensively addressed this modeling approach. In this paper, we introduce a novel methodology referred to as the \"Mixture Degree-Corrected Stochastic Block Model.\" This generative model, an extension of the widely utilized Degree-Corrected Stochastic Block Model (DCSBM), is designed to cluster similar layers by their community structures while simultaneously identifying communities within each layer's group.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose Describe-and-Dissect (DnD), a novel method to describe the roles of hidden neurons in vision networks. DnD utilizes recent advancements in multimodal deep learning to produce complex natural language descriptions, without the need for labeled training data or a predefined set of concepts to choose from. Additionally, DnD is training-free, meaning we don't train any new models and can easily leverage more capable general purpose models in the future. We have conducted extensive qualitative and quantitative analysis to show that DnD outperforms prior work by providing higher quality neuron descriptions. Specifically, our method on average provides the highest quality labels and is more than 2× as likely to be selected as the best explanation for a neuron than the best baseline. Finally, we present a use case providing critical insights into land cover prediction models for sustainability applications",

    "title": "Cooperative Minibatching in Graph Neural Networks",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Training large scale Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) requires significant computational resources, and the process is highly data-intensive. One of the most effective ways to reduce resource requirements is minibatch training coupled with graph sampling. GNNs have the unique property that items in a minibatch have overlapping data. However, the commonly implemented Independent Minibatching approach assigns each Processing Element (PE, i.e., cores and/or GPUs) its own minibatch to process, leading to duplicated computations and input data access across PEs. This amplifies the Neighborhood Explosion Phenomenon (NEP), which is the main bottleneck limiting scaling. To reduce the effects of NEP in the multi-PE setting, we propose a new approach called Cooperative Minibatching. Our approach capitalizes on the fact that the size of the sampled subgraph is a concave function of the batch size, leading to significant reductions in the amount of work as batch sizes increase. Hence, it is favorable for processors equipped with a fast interconnect to work on a large minibatch together as a single larger processor, instead of working on separate smaller minibatches, even though global batch size is identical. We also show how to take advantage of the same phenomenon in serial execution by generating dependent consecutive minibatches. Our experimental evaluations show up to 4x bandwidth savings for fetching vertex embeddings, by simply increasing this dependency without harming model convergence. Combining our proposed approaches, we achieve up to 64\\% speedup over Independent Minibatching on single-node multi GPU systems, using same resources",

This survey critically examines the privacy threats associated with LLMs, emphasizing the potential for these models to memorize and inadvertently reveal sensitive information. We explore current threats by reviewing privacy attacks on LLMs and propose comprehensive solutions for integrating privacy mechanisms throughout the entire learning pipeline. These solutions range from anonymizing training datasets to implementing differential privacy during training or inference and machine unlearning after training. Our comprehensive review of existing literature highlights ongoing challenges, available tools, and future directions for preserving privacy in LLMs. This work aims to guide the development of more secure and trustworthy AI systems by providing a thorough understanding of privacy preservation methods and their effectiveness in mitigating risks",

    "abstract": "Detecting changes is of fundamental importance when analyzing data streams and has many applications, e.g., in predictive maintenance, fraud detection, or medicine. A principled approach to detect changes is to compare the distributions of observations within the stream to each other via hypothesis testing. Maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), a (semi-)metric on the space of probability distributions, provides powerful non-parametric two-sample tests on kernel-enriched domains. In particular, MMD is able to detect any disparity between distributions under mild conditions. However, classical MMD estimators suffer from a quadratic runtime complexity, which renders their direct use for change detection in data streams impractical. In this article, we propose a new change detection algorithm, called Maximum Mean Discrepancy on Exponential Windows (MMDEW), that combines the benefits of MMD with an efficient computation based on exponential windows. We prove that MMDEW enjoys polylogarithmic runtime and logarithmic memory complexity and show empirically that it outperforms the state of the art on benchmark data streams",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Shapley values are widely used in machine learning to interpret model predictions. However, they have an important drawback in their computational time, which is exponential in the number of variables in the data. Recent work has yielded algorithms that can efficiently and exactly calculate the Shapley values of specific model families, such as Decision Trees and Generalized Additive Models (GAMs). Unfortunately, these model families are fairly restricted. Consequently, we present STAR-SHAP, an algorithm for efficiently calculating the Shapley values of Structured Additive Regression (STAR) models, a generalization of GAMs which allow any number of variable interactions. While the computational cost of STAR-SHAP scales exponentially in the size of these interactions, it is independent of the total number of variables. This allows the interpretation of more complex and flexible models. As long as the variable interactions are moderately-sized, the computation of the Shapley values will be fast, even on high-dimensional datasets. Since STAR models with more than pairwise interactions (e.g. GA2Ms) are seldom used in practice, we also present a new class of STAR models built on the RKHS Weightings of Functions paradigm. More precisely, we introduce a new RKHS Weighting instantiation, and show how to transform it and other RKHS Weightings into STAR models. We therefore introduce a new family of STAR models, as well as the means to interpret their outputs in a timely manner",

However, most traditional methods require predefined module design, which makes it hard to generalize to different goals.

To tackle this, we propose a simple framework that achieves interactive task planning with language models by incorporating both high-level planning and low-level skill execution through function calling, leveraging pretrained vision models to ground the scene in language. We verify the robustness of our system on the real world task of making milk tea drinks. Our system is able to generate novel high-level instructions for unseen objectives and successfully accomplishes user tasks. Furthermore, when the user sends a new request, our system is able to replan accordingly with precision based on the new request, task guidelines and previously executed steps. Our approach is easy to adapt to different tasks by merely substituting the task guidelines, without the need for additional complex prompt engineering",

State-of-the-art models create high-quality content without crediting original creators, causing concern in the artistic community and model providers. To mitigate this, we propose the ©Plug-in Authorization framework, introducing three operations: addition, extraction, and combination. Addition involves training a ©plug-in for specific copyright, facilitating proper credit attribution. The extraction allows creators to reclaim copyright from infringing models, and the combination enables users to merge different ©plug-ins. These operations act as permits, incentivizing fair use and providing flexibility in authorization. We present innovative approaches, ``Reverse LoRA'' for extraction and ``EasyMerge'' for seamless combination. Experiments in artist-style replication and cartoon IP recreation demonstrate ©plug-ins' effectiveness, offering a valuable solution for human copyright protection in the age of generative AIs.

A key insight into the design of our method is that the direction of the gradient in the zeroth-order optimization we use is random and the only information from training data is the step size, i.e., a scalar. Therefore, we only need to privatize the scalar step size, which is memory-efficient. DP-ZO provides a strong privacy-utility trade-off across different tasks, and model sizes that are comparable to DP-SGD in $(\\varepsilon,\\delta)$-DP.

At the same time, parameter-efficient prompt tuning is used to adapt large transformer- based models to downstream tasks without the need to save large copies. In this paper, we examine parameter-efficient prompt tuning of Vision Transformers for downstream tasks under the lens of robustness. We show that previous adversarial defense methods, when applied to the prompt tuning paradigm, suffer from gradient obfuscation and are vulnerable to adaptive attacks.

This paper investigates the intrinsic dimension of the matrix updates approximated by the LoRA method and reveals the performance benefits of increasing this intrinsic dimension.

    "abstract": "Language models are often trained to maximize the likelihood of the next token given past tokens in the training dataset. However, during inference time, they are utilized differently, generating text sequentially and auto-regressively by using previously \\emph{generated} tokens as input to predict the next one. Marginal differences in predictions at each step can cascade over successive steps, resulting in different distributions from what the models were trained for and potentially leading to unpredictable behavior. This paper proposes two simple approaches based on model own generation to address this discrepancy between the training and inference time. Our first approach is Batch-Scheduled Sampling, where, during training, we stochastically choose between the ground-truth token from the dataset and the model's own generated token as input to predict the next token. This is done in an offline manner, modifying the context window by interleaving ground-truth tokens with those generated by the model. Our second approach is Reference-Answer-based Correction, where we explicitly incorporate a self-correction capability into the model during training. This enables the model to effectively self-correct the gaps between the generated sequences and the ground truth data without relying on an external oracle model. By incorporating our proposed strategies during training, we have observed an overall improvement in performance compared to baseline methods, as demonstrated by our extensive experiments using summarization, general question-answering, and math question-answering tasks",

While this direction has been explored previously, existing methods invariably consider oversimplified causal relationships.

To tackle these challenges, we introduce a causal model with hidden confounders on graphs, which considers the existence of hidden confounders affecting both node features and graph structures. We use an identifiable graph VAE model to simultaneously estimate hidden confounders and learn generation functions of the causal model. By incorporating a Gaussian mixture prior distribution, we improve the identifiability of our model to recover the joint distribution of observed data and hidden confounders. Using the generated counterfactual graphs, we enforce consistency in the predictions of classifiers for different counterfactual graphs, thereby achieving graph counterfactual fairness in these classifiers. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in improving the counterfactual fairness of classifiers on various graph tasks.

Past works attribute these errors to dataset bias, claiming that models fail on these perturbed samples as they do not belong to the training data distribution. Here, we challenge this claim and present evidence of the widespread existence of perturbed images within the training data distribution, which networks fail to classify. We train models on data sampled from parametric distributions, then search inside this data distribution to find such in-distribution adversarial examples. This is done using our gradient-free evolution strategies (ES) based approach which we call CMA-Search. Despite training with a large-scale (0.5 million images), unbiased dataset of camera and light variations, CMA-Search can find a failure inside the data distribution in over 71% cases by perturbing the camera position. With lighting changes, CMA-Search finds misclassifications in 42% cases. These findings also extend to natural images from ImageNet and Co3D datasets. This phenomenon of in-distribution images presents a highly worrisome problem for artificial intelligence---they bypass the need for a malicious agent to add engineered noise to induce an adversarial attack.

The most common approach to FL is first-order methods, where clients send their local gradients to the server in each iteration. However, these methods often suffer from slow convergence rates. As a remedy, second-order methods, such as quasi-Newton, can be employed in FL to accelerate its convergence. Unfortunately, similarly to the first-order FL methods, the application of second-order methods in FL can lead to unfair models, achieving high average accuracy while performing poorly on certain clients' local datasets. To tackle this issue, in this paper we introduce a novel second-order FL framework, dubbed distributed quasi-Newton federated learning (DQN-Fed). This approach seeks to ensure fairness while leveraging the fast convergence properties of quasi-Newton methods in the FL context. Specifically, DQN-Fed helps the server update the global model in such a way that (i) all local loss functions decrease to promote fairness, and (ii) the rate of change in local loss functions aligns with that of the quasi-Newton method. We prove the convergence of DQN-Fed and demonstrate its \\textit{linear-quadratic} convergence rate. Moreover, we validate the efficacy of DQN-Fed across a range of federated datasets, showing that it surpasses state-of-the-art fair FL methods in fairness, average accuracy and convergence speed.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Long-tailed classification is challenging due to its heavy imbalance in class probabilities. While existing methods often focus on overall accuracy or accuracy for tail classes, they overlook a critical aspect: certain types of errors can carry greater risks than others in real-world long-tailed problems. For example, misclassifying patients (a tail class) as healthy individuals (a head class) entails far more serious consequences than the reverse scenario. To address this critical issue, we introduce Making Reliable and Flexible Decisions in Long-tailed Classification (RF-DLC), a novel framework aimed at reliable predictions in long-tailed problems. Leveraging Bayesian Decision Theory, we introduce an integrated gain to seamlessly combine long-tailed data distributions and the decision-making procedure. We further propose an efficient variational optimization strategy for the decision risk objective. Our method adapts readily to diverse utility matrices, which can be designed for specific tasks, ensuring its flexibility for different problem settings. In empirical evaluation, we design a new metric, False Head Rate, to quantify tail-sensitivity risk, along with comprehensive experiments on multiple real-world tasks, including large-scale image classification and uncertainty quantification, to demonstrate the reliability and flexibility of our method",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Stochastic variance reduction has proven effective at accelerating first-order algorithms for solving convex finite-sum optimization tasks such as empirical risk minimization. Incorporating second-order information has proven helpful in further improving the performance of these first-order methods. Yet, comparatively little is known about the benefits of using variance reduction to accelerate popular stochastic second-order methods such as Subsampled Newton. To address this, we propose Stochastic Variance-Reduced Newton (SVRN), a finite-sum minimization algorithm that provably accelerates existing stochastic Newton methods from $O(\\alpha\\log(1/\\epsilon))$ to $O\\big(\\frac{\\log(1/\\epsilon)}{\\log(n)}\\big)$ passes over the data, i.e., by a factor of $O(\\alpha\\log(n))$, where $n$ is the number of sum components and $\\alpha$ is the approximation factor in the Hessian estimate. Surprisingly, this acceleration gets more significant the larger the data size $n$, which is a unique property of SVRN. Our algorithm retains the key advantages of Newton-type methods, such as easily parallelizable large-batch operations and a simple unit step size. We use SVRN to accelerate Subsampled Newton and Iterative Hessian Sketch algorithms, and show that it compares favorably to popular first-order methods with variance~reduction",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Deep learning models often exhibit overconfidence in predicting out-of-distribution (OOD) data, underscoring the crucial role of OOD detection in ensuring reliability in predictions. Among various OOD detection approaches, post-hoc detectors have gained significant popularity, primarily due to their ease of implementation and competitive performance. However, recent benchmarks for OOD detection have revealed a lack of consistency in existing post-hoc methods. This inconsistency in post-hoc detectors can be attributed to their sole reliance either on extreme information, such as the maximum logit, or on collective information (i.e., information spanned across classes or training samples) embedded within the output layer. In this paper, we propose ExCeL, which combines both extreme and collective information within the output layer for enhanced and consistent performance in OOD detection. We leverage the logit of the top predicted class as the extreme information (i.e., the maximum logit), while the collective information is derived in a novel approach that involves assessing the probability of other classes appearing in subsequent ranks across various training samples. Our idea is motivated by the observation that, for in-distribution (ID) data, the ranking of classes beyond the predicted class is more deterministic compared to that in OOD data. Experiments conducted on CIFAR100, ImageNet-200, and ImageNet-1K datasets demonstrate that ExCeL consistently is among the five top-performing methods out of twenty-one existing post-hoc baselines when the joint performance on near-OOD and far-OOD is considered (i.e., in terms of AUROC and FPR95). Furthermore, ExCeL shows the best overall performance across all datasets, unlike other baselines that work best on one dataset but have a performance drop in others",

Existing unsupervised domain adaptation methods often struggle with real world distribution shifts which are often much more severe in some channels than others. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce a novel method called Signal Selection and Screening via Sinkhorn alignment for Time Series domain Adaptation (SSSS-TSA). SSSS-TSA addresses channel-level variations by aligning both individual channel representations and selectively weighted combined channel representations. This dual alignment strategy based on channel selection not only ensures effective adaptation to new domains but also maintains robustness in scenarios with training and testing set shifts or when certain channels are absent or corrupted. We evaluate our method on several time-series classification benchmarks and find that it consistently improves performance over existing methods. These results demonstrate the importance of adaptively selecting and screening different channels to enable more effective alignment across domains",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform impressively well in various applications, such as document completion and question-answering. However, the potential for misuse of these models in activities such as plagiarism, generating fake news, and spamming has raised concerns about their responsible use. Consequently, the reliable detection of AI-generated text has become a critical area of research. Recent works have attempted to address this challenge through various methods, including the identification of model signatures in generated text outputs and the application of watermarking techniques to detect AI-generated text. These detectors have shown to be effective under their specific settings. In this paper, we stress-test the robustness of these AI text detectors in the presence of an attacker. We introduce recursive paraphrasing attack to stress test a wide range of detection schemes, including the ones using the watermarking as well as neural network-based detectors, zero-shot classifiers, and retrieval-based detectors. Our experiments conducted on passages, each approximately 300 tokens long, reveal the varying sensitivities of these detectors to our attacks. We also observe that these paraphrasing attacks add slight degradation to the text quality. We analyze the trade-offs between our attack strength and the resulting text quality, measured through human studies, perplexity scores, and accuracy on text benchmarks. Our findings indicate that while our recursive paraphrasing method can significantly reduce detection rates, it only slightly degrades text quality in many cases, highlighting potential vulnerabilities in current detection systems in the presence of an attacker. Additionally, we investigate the susceptibility of watermarked LLMs to spoofing attacks aimed at misclassifying human-written text as AI-generated. We demonstrate that an attacker can infer hidden AI text signatures without white-box access to the detection method, potentially leading to reputational risks for LLM developers. Finally, we provide a theoretical framework connecting the AUROC of the best possible detector to the Total Variation distance between human and AI text distributions. This analysis offers insights into the fundamental challenges of reliable detection as language models continue to advance",

In this paper, we introduce a novel differentially private generative modeling approach based on a gradient flow in the space of probability measures. To this end, we define the gradient flow of the Gaussian-smoothed Sliced Wasserstein Distance, including the associated stochastic differential equation (SDE). By discretizing and defining a numerical scheme for solving this SDE, we demonstrate the link between smoothing and differential privacy based on a Gaussian mechanism, due to a specific form of the SDE's drift term. We then analyze the differential privacy guarantee of our gradient flow, which accounts for both the smoothing and the Wiener process introduced by the SDE itself. Experiments show that our proposed model can generate higher-fidelity data at a low privacy budget compared to a generator-based model, offering a promising alternative",

    "abstract": "Multimodal fusion with a multimodal transformer is an effective method for both early and late fusion paradigms. However, in a multimodal transformer, the modality fusion is performed solely through the self-attention mechanism, which is originally designed for unimodal token sequences. To improve the self-attention mechanism for handling multimodal input, a parametric adapter model, like the Q-former in BLIP-2, is often used to align tokens from different modalities. Our empirical study unveils that only using the self-attention layer to perform the modality fusion makes the model less robust to missing modalities and input noise, as the model will overly rely on one certain modality. To improve the robustness of the transformer, our paper proposes an implicit approach based on Wasserstein distance that aligns tokens from different modalities without using any additional trainable parameters. Our empirical study shows that the implicit modality alignment improves the effectiveness of the multimodal Transformer in discriminative tasks, as well as its robustness to input noise and missing modalities. We conduct experiments on four downstream task datasets, including 2-modalities and 3-modalities tasks. We also consider different fusion paradigms, i.e., early and late fusion. The experimental results show that our proposed method has a significant improvement in both performance and robustness over all baselines across all datasets and fusion paradigms",

While this guarantees that (pre)activations are $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ at initialization with respect to width, it causes their scale to be width-dependent during training. To address this, \\citet{yang2020feature} and \\citet{yang2021tuning} proposed the Maximal Update Parametrization ($\\mu$P), which is also claimed to make the optimal value of various hyperparameters independent of width. However, despite its alleged benefits, $\\mu$P has not gained much traction among practitioners. Possibly, this could stem from a lack of thorough independent evaluation of $\\mu$P against SP. We address this by independently reproducing the empirical claims of the original works. At the same time, we substantially increase the scale of the experiments, by training $16000$ neural networks of sizes from $500$ to $1$B parameters, and empirically investigate $\\mu$P's effect on outputs, gradient updates, weights, training loss and validation loss.

In contrast to prior approaches, our perspective admits a numerically robust Cholesky-based form (without downdates) and avoids state augmentation, which would needlessly inflate the state-space model and reduce the numerical practicality of any fixed-point smoother code.

A promising step in this direction is to disentangle the factors that cause variation in the data. Previously, Invariant Slot Attention disentangled position, scale, and orientation from the remaining features. Extending this approach, we focus on separating the shape and texture components. In particular, we propose a novel architecture that biases object-centric models toward disentangling shape and texture components into two non-overlapping subsets of the latent space dimensions. These subsets are known a priori, hence before the training process.

Current methods estimate Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) using observational datasets where covariates are collected before treatment assignment and outcomes are observed afterward, under assumptions like positivity and unconfoundedness. In this paper, we address a scenario where both covariates and outcomes are gathered after treatment. We show that post-treatment covariates render CATE unidentifiable, and recovering CATE requires learning treatment-independent causal representations. Prior work shows that such representations can be learned through contrastive learning if counterfactual supervision is available in observational data. However, since counterfactuals are rare, other works have explored using simulators that offer synthetic counterfactual supervision. Our goal in this paper is to systematically analyze the role of simulators in estimating CATE. We analyze the CATE error of several baselines and highlight their limitations. We then establish a generalization bound that characterizes the CATE error from jointly training on real and simulated distributions, as a function of the real-simulator mismatch. Finally, we introduce SimPONet, a novel method whose loss function is inspired from our generalization bound. We further show how SimPONet adjusts the simulator's influence on the learning objective based on the simulator's relevance to the CATE task. We experiment with various DGPs, by systematically varying the real-simulator distribution gap to evaluate SimPONet's efficacy against state-of-the-art CATE baselines",

We show that this often leads to the emergence of conflicting gradients during training, where task-specific gradients are pointing in opposite directions. When such conflicts arise, following the average gradient can be detrimental to the learning of each individual tasks, resulting in overall degraded performance.

In this paper we focus on the domain of Large Language Models (LLMs), where we identify two major challenges: (1) Abstraction and Experience Merging, and (2) Long-term Retention with Accurate Recall. These properties are essential for storing new experiences, organizing past experiences, and responding to the environment in ways that leverage relevant historical data. Unlike language models with continual learning, which typically rely on large corpora for fine-tuning and focus on improving performance within specific domains or tasks, LSCS must rapidly and incrementally update with new information from its environment at a high frequency. Existing technologies with the potential of solving the above two major challenges can be classified into four classes based on a conceptual metric called Storage Complexity, which measures the relative space required to store past experiences. Each of these four classes of technologies has its own strengths and limitations while we argue none of them alone can achieve LSCS alone. To this end, we propose a potential instantiation for LSCS that can integrate all four classes of technologies. The new instantiation, serving as a conjecture, operates through two core processes: Absorbing Experiences and Generating Responses",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Lifelong learning (LL) machines are designed to operate safely in dynamic environments by continually updating their knowledge. Conventional LL paradigms often assume that new data come labeled and that each LL machine has to learn independently from its environment. However, human labeling is expensive and impractical in remote conditions where automation is most desired. We introduce the Peer Parallel Lifelong Learning (PEEPLL) framework for distributed Multi-Agent Lifelong Learning, where agents continually learn online by actively requesting assistance from other agents instead of relying on the expensive environment to teach them. Unlike classical distributed AI, where communication scales poorly, lifelong learners need to communicate only on information they have not yet learned. Additionally, agents reply only if they are highly confident: Our TRUE confidence score uses a compute-efficient application of Variational Autoencoder to quantify confidence in prediction without needing data reconstruction. TRUE outperforms traditional Entropy-based confidence scores, reducing communication overhead by 18.05\\% on CIFAR-100 and 5.8\\% on MiniImageNet. To improve system resilience to low-quality or adversarial responses, our agents selectively accept a subset of received responses using the REFINE algorithm, which results in a 51.99\\% increase in the percentage of correct accepted responses on CIFAR-100 and 25.79\\% on MiniImageNet. Like traditional LL agents, PEEPLL agents store a subset of previously acquired knowledge as memory to learn alongside new information to prevent forgetting. We propose a Dynamic Memory-Update mechanism for PEEPLL agents that improves QA's classification performance by 44.17\\% on CIFAR-100 and 26.8\\% on MiniImageNet compared to the baseline Memory-Update mechanism. Our findings demonstrate that a PEEPLL agent can outperform an LL agent even if the latter has environmental supervision available, thus significantly reducing the need for labeling. PEEPLL provides a framework to facilitate research in distributed multi-agent LL, marking a substantial step towards practical, scalable lifelong learning technologies at the edge",

However, the substantial model size poses hardware challenges, affecting both memory size for serving and inference latency for token generation. To address those challenges, we propose Dependency-aware Semi-structured Sparsity (DaSS), a new method for the recent prevalent GLU-based LLMs pruning, which incorporates structural dependency into the weight magnitude-based unstructured pruning. We introduce an MLP-specific pruning metric that evaluates the importance of each weight by jointly considering its magnitude and its corresponding MLP intermediate activation norms. DaSS facilitates a balance between the adaptability offered by unstructured pruning and the structural consistency inherent in dependency-based structured pruning. Empirical evaluations on LLaMA2, Mistral, and Gemma model families demonstrate that DaSS not only achieves superior perplexity and accuracy compared to SparseGPT and Wanda in achieving hardware-friendly N:M sparsity patterns but also maintains the computational efficiency of Wanda",

We evaluate generative models on standard datasets created for multimodal text-image discriminative learning and assess fine-grained aspects of their performance: attribute binding, color recognition, counting, shape recognition, spatial understanding. Existing automated metrics rely on an external pretrained model like CLIP (VLMs) or LLMs, and are sensitive to the exact pretrained model and its limitations. SelfEval sidesteps these issues, and to the best of our knowledge, is the first automated metric to show a high degree of agreement for measuring text-faithfulness with the gold-standard human evaluations across multiple generative models, benchmarks and evaluation metrics. SelfEval also reveals that generative models showcase competitive recognition performance on challenging tasks such as Winoground image-score compared to discriminative models.

Typically, the level of group fairness is measured by the statistical gap between predictions from different protected groups. In this study, we reveal an implicit property of existing group fairness measures, which provides an insight into how the group-fair models behave. Then, we develop a new group-fair constraint based on this implicit property to learn group-fair models. To do so, we first introduce a notable theoretical observation: every group-fair model has an implicitly corresponding transport map between the input spaces of each protected group. Based on this observation, we introduce a new group fairness measure termed Matched Demographic Parity (MDP), which quantifies the averaged gap between predictions of two individuals (from different protected groups) matched by a given transport map. Then, we prove that any transport map can be used in MDP to learn group-fair models, and develop a novel algorithm called Fairness Through Matching (FTM), which learns a group-fair model using MDP constraint with an user-specified transport map. We specifically propose two favorable types of transport maps for MDP, based on the optimal transport theory, and discuss their advantages. Experiments reveal that FTM successfully trains group-fair models with certain desirable properties by choosing the transport map accordingly",

Modern class forgetting methods for CLIP have demonstrated that zero-shot forgetting is achievable by generating synthetic data and fine-tuning both visual and textual encoders with a regularization loss. Our approach shows that class forgetting in CLIP can be accomplished in a zero-shot manner without any visual data by adapting the shared vision-text space of CLIP, thereby making the class forgetting process more efficient. Our method delivers superior results, demonstrating strong performance and complete class removal, regardless of the visual encoder used in CLIP.

Specifically, $\\sigma$-VAE utilizes a scaled identity matrix $\\sigma^2 I$ in the decoder variance, while $\\beta$-VAE introduces a hyperparameter $\\beta$ to reweight the negative ELBO loss. However, a unified theoretical and practical understanding of model optimality remains unclear. For example, existing learning theories on the global optimality of VAE provide limited insight into their empirical success. Previous work showed the mathematical equivalence between the variance scalar $\\sigma^2$ and the hyperparameter $\\beta$ in shaping the loss landscape. While $\\beta$-annealing is widely used, how to implement $\\sigma$-annealing is still unclear. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of $\\sigma$-CVAE, highlighting its enhanced expressiveness in parameterizing conditional densities while addressing the associated estimation challenges arising from suboptimal variational inference. In particular, we propose Calibrated Robust $\\sigma$-CVAE, a doubly robust algorithm that facilitates accurate estimation of $\\sigma$ while effectively preventing the posterior collapse of $\\phi$. Our approach, leveraging functional neural decomposition and KL annealing techniques, provides a unified framework to understand both $\\sigma$-VAE and $\\beta$-VAE regarding parameter optimality and training dynamics.

These algorithms require the statistician to select hyperparameters that control the extent and type of information transfer from related datasets. However, selection strategies for these hyperparameters, as well as the impact of these choices on the algorithm's performance, have been largely unexplored. To address this, we conduct a thorough, precise study of the algorithm in a high-dimensional setting via an asymptotic analysis using the replica method. Our approach reveals a surprisingly simple behavior of the algorithm: Ignoring one of the two types of information transferred to the fine-tuning stage has little effect on generalization performance, implying that efforts for hyperparameter selection can be significantly reduced.

    "abstract": "Most machine learning classifiers are designed to output posterior probabilities for the classes given the input sample. These probabilities may be used to make the categorical decision on the class of the sample; provided as input to a downstream system; or provided to a human for interpretation. Evaluating the quality of the posteriors generated by these system is an essential problem which was addressed decades ago with the invention of proper scoring rules (PSRs). Unfortunately, much of the recent machine learning literature uses calibration metrics---most commonly, the expected calibration error (ECE)---as a proxy to assess posterior performance. The problem with this approach is that calibration metrics reflect only one aspect of the quality of the posteriors, ignoring the discrimination performance. For this reason, we argue that calibration metrics should play no role in the assessment of posterior quality. Expected PSRs should instead be used for this job, preferably normalized for ease of interpretation. In this work, we first give a brief review of PSRs from a practical perspective, motivating their definition using Bayes decision theory. We discuss why expected PSRs provide a principled measure of the quality of a system's posteriors and why calibration metrics are not the right tool for this job. We argue that calibration metrics, while not useful for performance assessment, may be used as diagnostic tools during system development. With this purpose in mind, we discuss a simple and practical calibration metric, called calibration loss, derived from a decomposition of expected PSRs. We compare this metric with the ECE and with the expected score divergence calibration metric from the PSR literature and argue, using theoretical and empirical evidence, that calibration loss is superior to these two metrics",

Under mild assumptions on the data distribution, we establish an upper bound for the KL divergence between the target and the estimated distributions, explicitly depending on any time-dependent noise schedule. Under additional regularity assumptions, taking advantage of favorable underlying contraction mechanisms, we provide a tighter error bound in Wasserstein distance compared to state-of-the-art results. In addition to being tractable, this upper bound jointly incorporates properties of the target distribution and SGM hyperparameters that need to be tuned during training. Finally, we illustrate these bounds through numerical experiments using simulated and CIFAR-10 datasets, identifying an optimal range of noise schedules within a parametric family",

    "abstract": "Sequential learning methods, such as active learning and Bayesian optimization, aim to select the most informative data for task learning. In many applications, however, data selection is constrained by unknown safety conditions, motivating the development of safe learning approaches. A promising line of safe learning methods uses Gaussian processes to model safety conditions, restricting data selection to areas with high safety confidence. However, these methods are limited to local exploration around an initial seed dataset, as safety confidence centers around observed data points. As a consequence, task exploration is slowed down and safe regions disconnected from the initial seed dataset remain unexplored. In this paper, we propose safe transfer sequential learning to accelerate task learning and to expand the explorable safe region. By leveraging abundant offline data from a related source task, our approach guides exploration in the target task more effectively. We also provide a theoretical analysis to explain why single-task method cannot cope with disconnected regions. Finally, we introduce a computationally efficient approximation of our method that reduces runtime through pre-computations.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Despite the widespread adoption of multi-task training in deep learning, little is understood about how multi-task learning (MTL) affects generalization. Prior work has conjectured that the negative effects of MTL are due to optimization challenges that arise during training, and many optimization methods have been proposed to improve multi-task performance. However, recent work has shown that these methods fail to consistently improve multi-task generalization. In this work, we seek to improve our understanding of these failures by empirically studying how MTL impacts the optimization of tasks, and whether this impact can explain the effects of MTL on generalization. We show that MTL results in a generalization gap (a gap in generalization at comparable training loss) between single-task and multi-task trajectories early into training. However, we find that factors of the optimization trajectory previously proposed to explain generalization gaps in single-task settings cannot explain the generalization gaps between single-task and multi-task models. Moreover, we show that the amount of gradient conflict between tasks is correlated with negative effects to task optimization, but is not predictive of generalization. Our work sheds light on the underlying causes for failures in MTL and, importantly, raises questions about the role of general purpose multi-task optimization algorithms",

As we limit image exposure time, human performance degrades to the level of deep networks, suggesting that additional mental processes (requiring additional time) are necessary to identify objects in unusual poses. An analysis of error patterns of humans vs. networks reveals that even time-limited humans are dissimilar to feed-forward deep networks. In conclusion, our comparison reveals that humans are overall more robust than deep networks and that they rely on different mechanisms for recognizing objects in unusual poses.

The event trigger is based on probabilistic uniform error bounds used in Gaussian process regression. We derive regret bounds for adaptive resets without exact prior knowledge of the temporal changes and show in numerical experiments that ET-GP-UCB outperforms competing GP-UCB algorithms on both synthetic and real-world data.

Our analysis reveals that the relative geometry of the admissible and the equivariant layers, respectively, plays a key role. Under natural assumptions on the data, network, loss, and group of symmetries, we show that compatibility of the spaces of admissible layers and equivariant layers, in the sense that the corresponding orthogonal projections commute, implies that the sets of equivariant stationary points are identical for the two strategies. If the linear layers of the network also are given a unitary parametrization, the set of equivariant layers is even invariant under the gradient flow for augmented models. Our analysis however also reveals that even in the latter situation, stationary points may be unstable for augmented training although they are stable for the manifestly equivariant models",

    "abstract": "While Federated Learning (FL) is gaining popularity for training machine learning models in a decentralized fashion, numerous challenges persist, such as asynchronization, computational expenses, data heterogeneity, and gradient and membership privacy attacks. Lately, dataset distillation has emerged as a promising solution for addressing the aforementioned challenges by generating a compact synthetic dataset that preserves a model's training efficacy. However, we discover that using distilled local datasets can amplify the heterogeneity issue in FL. To address this, we propose Federated Learning on Virtual Heterogeneous Data with Local-Global Dataset Distillation (FedLGD), where we seamlessly integrate dataset distillation algorithms into FL pipeline and train FL using a smaller synthetic dataset (referred as virtual data). Specifically, to harmonize the domain shifts, we propose iterative distribution matching to inpaint global information to *local virtual data* and use federated gradient matching to distill *global virtual data* that serve as anchor points to rectify heterogeneous local training, without compromising data privacy. We experiment on both benchmark and real-world datasets that contain heterogeneous data from different sources, and further scale up to an FL scenario that contains a large number of clients with heterogeneous and class-imbalanced data. Our method outperforms *state-of-the-art* heterogeneous FL algorithms under various settings",

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful technique for learning rich representations from unlabeled data. The data representations can capture many underlying attributes of data, and are useful in downstream prediction tasks. In real-world settings, spurious correlations between some attributes (e.g. race, gender and age) and labels for downstream tasks often exist, e.g. disease findings are usually more prevalent among elderly patients. In this paper, we investigate SSL in the presence of spurious correlations and show that the SSL training loss can be minimized by capturing only a subset of conspicuous features relevant to those sensitive attributes, despite the presence of other important predictive features for the downstream tasks. To address this issue, we investigate the learning dynamics of SSL and observe that the learning is slower for samples that conflict with such correlations (e.g. elder patients without diseases). Motivated by these findings, we propose a learning-speed aware SSL (LA-SSL) approach, in which we sample each training data with a probability that is inversely related to its learning speed. We evaluate LA-SSL on three datasets that exhibit spurious correlations between different attributes, demonstrating the enhanced robustness of pretrained representations on downstream classification tasks",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Anomaly detection is the task of identifying examples that do not behave as expected. Because anomalies are rare and unexpected events, collecting real anomalous examples is often challenging in several applications. In addition, learning an anomaly detector with limited (or no) anomalies often yields poor prediction performance. One option is to employ auxiliary synthetic anomalies to improve the model training. However, synthetic anomalies may be of poor quality: anomalies that are unrealistic or indistinguishable from normal samples may deteriorate the detector's performance. Unfortunately, no existing methods quantify the quality of auxiliary anomalies. We fill in this gap and propose the expected anomaly posterior (EAP), an uncertainty-based score function that measures the quality of auxiliary anomalies by quantifying the total uncertainty of an anomaly detector. Experimentally on 40 benchmark datasets of images and tabular data, we show that EAP outperforms 12 adapted data quality estimators in the majority of cases.

    "title": "MIND: Modality-Informed Knowledge Distillation Framework for Multimodal Clinical Prediction Tasks",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Multimodal fusion leverages information across modalities to learn better feature representations with the goal of improving performance in fusion-based tasks. However, multimodal datasets, especially in medical settings, are typically smaller than their unimodal counterparts, which can impede the performance of multimodal models. Additionally, the increase in the number of modalities is often associated with an overall increase in the size of the multimodal network, which may be undesirable in medical use cases. Utilizing smaller unimodal encoders may lead to sub-optimal performance, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional clinical data. In this paper, we propose the Modality-INformed knowledge Distillation (MIND) framework, a multimodal model compression approach based on knowledge distillation that transfers knowledge from ensembles of pre-trained deep neural networks of varying sizes into a smaller multimodal student. The teacher models consist of unimodal networks, allowing the student to learn from diverse representations. MIND employs multi-head joint fusion models, as opposed to single-head models, enabling the utilization of unimodal encoders in the case of unimodal samples without requiring imputation or masking of absent modalities. As a result, MIND generates an optimized multimodal model, enhancing both multimodal and unimodal representations. It can also be leveraged to balance multimodal learning during training. We evaluate MIND on binary classification and multilabel clinical prediction tasks using clinical time series data and chest X-ray images extracted from publicly available datasets. Additionally, we assess the generalizability of the MIND framework on three non-medical multimodal multiclass benchmark datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that MIND enhances the performance of the smaller multimodal network across all five tasks, as well as various fusion methods and multimodal network architectures, compared to several state-of-the-art baselines",

Although AL has been extensively studied for image classification tasks, the specific scenario of interactive image retrieval has received relatively little attention. This scenario presents unique characteristics, including an open-set and class-imbalanced binary classification, starting with very few labeled samples. We introduce a novel batch-mode Active Learning framework named GAL (Greedy Active Learning) that better copes with this application. It incorporates new acquisition functions for sample selection that measure the impact of each unlabeled sample on the classifier. We further embed this strategy in a greedy selection approach, better exploiting the samples within each batch. We evaluate our framework with both linear (SVM) and non-linear MLP/Gaussian Process classifiers. For the Gaussian Process case, we show a theoretical guarantee on the greedy approximation.

    "title": "Lifelong Learning in StyleGAN through Latent Subspaces",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "StyleGAN is one of the most versatile generative models that have emerged in recent times. However, when it is trained continually on a stream of data (potentially previously unseen distributions), it tends to forget the distribution it has learned, as is the case with any other generative model, due to catastrophic forgetting. Recent studies have shown that the latent space of StyleGAN is very versatile, as data from a variety of distributions can be inverted onto it. In this paper, we propose StyleCL, a method that leverages this property to enable lifelong learning in StyleGAN without forgetting. Specifically, given a StyleGAN trained on a certain task (dataset), we propose to learn a latent subspace characterized by a set of dictionary vectors in its latent space, one for each novel, unseen task (or dataset). We also learn a relatively small set of parameters (feature adaptors) in the weight space to complement the dictionary learning in the latent space. Furthermore, we introduce a method that utilizes the similarity between tasks to effectively reuse the feature adaptor parameters from the previous tasks, aiding in the learning process for the current task at hand. Our approach guarantees that the parameters from previous tasks are reused only if they contribute to a beneficial forward transfer of knowledge. Remarkably, StyleCL avoids catastrophic forgetting because the set of dictionary and the feature adaptor parameters are unique for each task. We demonstrate that our method, StyleCL, achieves better generation quality on multiple datasets with significantly fewer additional parameters per task compared to previous methods. This is a consequence of learning task-specific dictionaries in the latent space, which has a much lower dimensionality compared to the weight space.

Knowledge distillation (KD) provides a solution by compressing the knowledge from large, resource-intensive models into task-specific smaller ones. Various strategies exist, some relying on the text generated by the teacher model, optionally, leveraging its output logits to improve learning. However, these logit-based methods usually require the teacher and student models to share the same tokenizer, which limits their applicability across different model families. In this paper, we propose the Universal Logit Distillation (ULD) loss, which uses optimal transport theory to enable distillation across different architectures and tokenizers.

    "abstract": "Recently, deep learning has made rapid progress in antibody design, which plays a key role in the advancement of therapeutics. A dominant paradigm is to train a model to jointly generate the antibody sequence and the structure as a candidate. However, the joint generation requires the model to generate both the discrete amino acid categories and the continuous 3D coordinates; this limits the space of possible architectures and may lead to suboptimal performance. In response, we propose an antibody sequence-structure decoupling (ASSD) framework, which separates sequence generation and structure prediction. Although our approach is simple, our idea allows the use of powerful neural architectures and demonstrates notable performance improvements. We also find that the widely used non-autoregressive generators promote sequences with overly repeating tokens. Such sequences are both out-of-distribution and prone to undesirable developability properties that can trigger harmful immune responses in patients. To resolve this, we introduce a composition-based objective that allows an efficient trade-off between high performance and low token repetition. ASSD shows improved performance in various antibody design experiments, while the composition-based objective successfully mitigates token repetition of non-autoregressive models",

However, we identify critical applications where edge attributes are essential, making prior methods potentially unsuitable in such contexts. Moreover, while trivial adaptations are available, empirical investigations reveal their limited efficacy as they do not properly model the interplay among graph components. To address this, we propose a joint score-based model of nodes and edges for graph generation that considers all graph components. Our approach offers three key novelties: (1) node and edge attributes are combined in an attention module that generates samples based on the two ingredients, (2) node, edge and adjacency information are mutually dependent during the graph diffusion process, and (3) the framework enables the generation of graphs with rich attributes along the edges, providing a more expressive formulation for generative tasks than existing works. We evaluate our method on challenging benchmarks involving real-world and synthetic datasets in which edge features are crucial. Additionally, we introduce a new synthetic dataset that incorporates edge values.

Our noising encoder uses closed-form expressions based on the heat equation to corrupt its digraph input with uniform noise. Our decoder reconstructs the corrupted representation by exploiting the global topological information of the graph included in its random walk Laplacian matrix. Our approach generalizes a special class of exponential kernels over discrete structures, called diffusion kernels or heat kernels, to the non-symmetric case via Reproducing Kernel Banach Spaces (RKBS). This connection with heat kernels provides us with a geometrically motivated algorithm related to Gaussian processes and dimensionality reduction techniques such as Laplacian eigenmaps. It also allows us to interpret and exploit the eigenproperties of the Laplacian matrix.

    "abstract": "Envisioned application areas for reinforcement learning (RL) include autonomous driving, precision agriculture, and finance, which all require RL agents to make decisions in the real world. A significant challenge hindering the adoption of RL methods in these domains is the non-robustness of conventional algorithms. In particular, the focus of RL is typically on the expected value of the return. The expected value is the average over the statistical ensemble of infinitely many trajectories, which can be uninformative about the performance of the average individual. For instance, when we have a heavy-tailed return distribution, the ensemble average can be dominated by rare extreme events. Consequently, optimizing the expected value can lead to policies that yield exceptionally high returns with a probability that approaches zero but almost surely result in catastrophic outcomes in single long trajectories. In this paper, we develop an algorithm that lets RL agents optimize the long-term performance of individual trajectories. The algorithm enables the agents to learn robust policies, which we show in an instructive example with a heavy-tailed return distribution and standard RL benchmarks. The key element of the algorithm is a transformation that we learn from data. This transformation turns the time series of collected returns into one for whose increments expected value and the average over a long trajectory coincide. Optimizing these increments results in robust policies",

    "abstract": "The world of Machine Learning (ML) offers great promise, but often there is a noticeable gap between claims made in research papers and the model's practical performance in real-life applications. This gap can often be attributed to systematic errors and pitfalls that occur during the development phase of ML models. This study aims to systematically identify these errors. For this, we break down the ML process into four main stages: data handling, model design, model evaluation, and reporting. Across these stages, we have identified fourteen common pitfalls based on a comprehensive review of around 60 papers discussing either broad challenges or specific pitfalls within ML pipeline. Moreover, Using the Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) dataset, we perform three experiments to illustrate the impacts of these pitfalls, providing examples of how they can skew results and affect outcomes. In addition, we also perform a review to study the frequency of unclear reporting regarding these pitfalls in ML research. The goal of this review was to assess whether authors have adequately addressed these pitfalls in their reports. For this, we review 126 randomly chosen papers on image segmentation from the ICCV (2013-2021) and MICCAI (2013-2022) conferences from the last ten years. The results from this review show a notable oversight of these issues, with many of the papers lacking clarity on how the pitfalls are handled. This highlights an important gap in current reporting practices within the ML community. The codes for the experiments will be published upon acceptance",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms often struggle with low training efficiency. A common approach to address this challenge is integrating model-based planning algorithms, such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) or Value Iteration (VI), into the environmental model. However, VI faces a significant limitation: it requires iterating over a large tensor with dimensions $|\\mathcal{S}|\\times |\\mathcal{A}| \\times |\\mathcal{S}|$, where $\\mathcal{S}$ and $\\mathcal{A}$ represent the state and action spaces, respectively. This process updates the value of the preceding state $s_{t-1}$ based on the succeeding state $s_t$ through value propagation, resulting in computationally intensive operations. To enhance the training efficiency of RL algorithms, we propose improving the efficiency of the value learning process. In deterministic environments with discrete state and action spaces, we observe that on the sampled empirical state-transition graph, a non-branching sequence of transitions—termed a \\textit{highway}—can take the agent directly from $s_0$ to $s_T$ without deviation through intermediate states. On these non-branching highways, the value-updating process can be streamlined into a single-step operation, eliminating the need for iterative, step-by-step updates. Building on this observation, we introduce a novel graph structure called the \\textit{highway graph} to model state transitions. The highway graph compresses the transition model into a compact representation, where edges can encapsulate multiple state transitions, enabling value propagation across multiple time steps in a single iteration. By integrating the highway graph into RL (as a model-based off-policy RL method), the training process is significantly accelerated, particularly in the early stages of training. Experiments across four categories of environments demonstrate that our method learns significantly faster than established and state-of-the-art model-free and model-based RL algorithms (often by a factor of 10 to 150) while maintaining equal or superior expected returns. Furthermore, a deep neural network-based agent trained using the highway graph exhibits improved generalization capabilities and reduced storage costs",

    "title": "Optimal Transport for Domain Adaptation through Gaussian Mixture Models",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Machine learning systems operate under the assumption that training and test data are sampled from a fixed probability distribution. However, this assumptions is rarely verified in practice, as the conditions upon which data was acquired are likely to change. In this context, the adaptation of the unsupervised domain requires minimal access to the data of the new conditions for learning models robust to changes in the data distribution. Optimal transport is a theoretically grounded tool for analyzing changes in distribution, especially as it allows the mapping between domains. However, these methods are usually computationally expensive as their complexity scales cubically with the number of samples. In this work, we explore optimal transport between Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), which is conveniently written in terms of the components of source and target GMMs. We experiment with 9 benchmarks, with a total of $85$ adaptation tasks, showing that our methods are more efficient than previous shallow domain adaptation methods, and they scale well with number of samples $n$ and dimensions $d$",

In this paper, we provide the first theoretical characterizations of both optimization and generalization of deep WeightNorm models with smooth activation functions. For optimization, from the form of the Hessian of the loss, we note that a small Hessian of the predictor leads to a tractable analysis. Thus, we bound the spectral norm of the Hessian of WeightNorm networks and show its dependence on the network width and weight normalization terms--the latter being unique to networks without WeightNorm. Then, we use this bound to establish training convergence guarantees under suitable assumptions for gradient decent. For generalization, we use WeightNorm to get a uniform convergence based generalization bound, which is independent from the width and depends sublinearly on the depth. Finally, we present experimental results which illustrate how the normalization terms and other quantities of theoretical interest relate to the training of WeightNorm networks",

    "abstract": "This work proposes a scalable probabilistic latent variable model based on Gaussian processes in the context of multiple observation spaces. We focus on an application in astrophysics where it is typical for data sets to contain both observed spectral features as well as scientific properties of astrophysical objects such as galaxies or exoplanets. In our application, we study the spectra of very luminous galaxies known as quasars, and their properties, such as the mass of their central supermassive black hole, their accretion rate and their luminosity, and hence, there can be multiple observation spaces. A single data point is then characterised by different classes of observations which may have different likelihoods. Our proposed model extends the baseline stochastic variational Gaussian process latent variable model (GPLVM) to this setting, proposing a seamless generative model where the quasar spectra and the scientific labels can be generatedsimultaneously when modelled with a shared latent space acting as input to different sets of Gaussian process decoders, one for each observation space. Further, this framework allows training in the missing data setting where a large number of dimensions per data point may be unknown or unobserved. We demonstrate high-fidelity reconstructions of the spectra and the scientific labels during test-time inference and briefly discuss the scientific interpretations of the results along with the significance of such a generative model",

Partial-label learning allows training classifiers in this weakly supervised setting, where state-of-the-art methods already show good predictive performance. However, even the best algorithms give incorrect predictions, which can have severe consequences when they impact actions or decisions. We propose a novel risk-consistent nearest-neighbor-based partial-label learning algorithm with a reject option, that is, the algorithm can reject unsure predictions. Extensive experiments on artificial and real-world datasets show that our method provides the best trade-off between the number and accuracy of non-rejected predictions when compared to our competitors, which use confidence thresholds for rejecting unsure predictions.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Neural message passing serves as a cornerstone framework in graph neural networks, providing a clear and intuitive mathematical guideline for the propagation and aggregation of information among interconnected nodes within graphs. Throughout this process, node representations undergo dynamic updates, considering both the individual states and connections of neighboring nodes. Concurrently, social networks, as prominent forms of interconnected data, form dynamic systems that achieve stability through continuous internal communications and opinion exchanges among social actors along their social ties. Drawing upon the shared concepts between these two domains, our study establishes an explicit connection between message passing and opinion dynamics in sociology. Moreover, we introduce a novel continuous message passing scheme termed ODNet, which integrates bounded confidence to refine the influence weight of local nodes for message propagation. By adjusting the similarity cutoffs of bounded confidence and influence weights within ODNet, we define opinion exchange rules that align with the characteristics of neural message passing and can effectively mitigate the oversmoothing issue. We extend the framework to hypergraphs and formulate corresponding continuous message passing rules, which reveal a close association with particle dynamics. Empirically, we showcase that ODNet enhances prediction performance across various social networks presented as homophilic graphs, heterophilic graphs, and hypergraphs. Notably, our proposed ODNet outperforms existing GNNs with its straightforward construction and robust theoretical foundation",

While improved network architecture and inference algorithms have shown to effectively boost sampling efficiency of diffusion models, the role of model size---a critical determinant of sampling efficiency---has not been thoroughly examined. Through empirical analysis of established text-to-image diffusion models, we conduct an in-depth investigation into how model size influences sampling efficiency across varying sampling steps. Our findings unveil a surprising trend: when operating under a given inference budget, smaller models frequently outperform their larger equivalents in generating high-quality results. Moreover, we extend our study to demonstrate the generalizability of the these findings by applying various diffusion samplers, exploring diverse downstream tasks, evaluating post-distilled models, as well as comparing performance relative to training compute. These findings open up new pathways for the development of LDM scaling strategies which can be employed to enhance generative capabilities within limited inference budgets",

    "abstract": "Model merging offers an effective strategy to combine the strengths of multiple finetuned models into a unified model that preserves the specialized capabilities of each. Existing methods merge models in a global manner, performing arithmetic operations across all model parameters. However, such global merging often leads to task interference, degrading the performance of the merged model. In this work, we introduce Localize-and-Stitch, a novel approach that merges models in a localized way. Our algorithm works in two steps: i) Localization: identify tiny ($1\\%$ of the total parameters) localized regions in the finetuned models containing essential skills for the downstream tasks, and ii) Stitching: reintegrate only these essential regions back into the pretrained model for task synergy. We demonstrate that our approach effectively locates sparse regions responsible for finetuned performance, and the localized regions could be treated as compact and interpretable representations of the finetuned models (tasks). Empirically, we evaluate our method on various vision and language benchmarks, showing that it outperforms existing model merging methods under different data availability scenarios. Beyond strong empirical performance, our algorithm also facilitates model compression and preserves pretrained knowledge, enabling flexible and continual skill composition from multiple finetuned models with minimal storage and computational overhead",

    "abstract": "We address the critical challenge of applying feature attribution methods to the transformer architecture, which dominates current applications in natural language processing and beyond. Traditional attribution methods to explainable AI (XAI) explicitly or implicitly rely on linear or additive surrogate models to quantify the impact of input features on a model's output. In this work, we formally prove an alarming incompatibility: transformers are structurally incapable of representing linear or additive surrogate models used for feature attribution, undermining the grounding of these conventional explanation methodologies. To address this discrepancy, we introduce the Softmax-Linked Additive Log Odds Model (SLALOM), a novel surrogate model specifically designed to align with the transformer framework. SLALOM demonstrates the capacity to deliver a range of insightful explanations with both synthetic and real-world datasets. We highlight SLALOM's unique efficiency-quality curve by showing that SLALOM can produce explanations with substantially higher fidelity than competing surrogate models or provide explanations of comparable quality at a fraction of their computational costs.

However, training of SNNs poses significant challenges due to the necessity for precise temporal and spatial credit assignment. Back-propagation through time (BPTT) algorithm, whilst the most widely used method for addressing these issues, incurs high computational cost due to its temporal dependency. In this work, we propose S-TLLR, a novel three-factor temporal local learning rule inspired by the Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP) mechanism, aimed at training deep SNNs on event-based learning tasks. Furthermore, S-TLLR is designed to have low memory and time complexities, which are independent of the number of time steps, rendering it suitable for online learning on low-power edge devices. To demonstrate the scalability of our proposed method, we have conducted extensive evaluations on event-based datasets spanning a wide range of applications, such as image and gesture recognition, audio classification, and optical flow estimation. S-TLLR achieves comparable accuracy to BPTT (within $\\pm2\\%$ for most tasks), while reducing memory usage by $5-50\\times$ and multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations by $1.3-6.6\\times$, particularly when updates are restricted to the last few time-steps",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are susceptible to adversarial inputs, such as imperceptible noise and naturally occurring challenging samples. This vulnerability likely arises from their passive, one-shot processing approach. In contrast, neuroscience suggests that human vision robustly identifies salient object features by actively switching between multiple fixation points (saccades) and processing surroundings with non-uniform resolution (foveation). This information is processed via two pathways: the dorsal (where) and ventral (what) streams, which identify relevant input portions and discard irrelevant details. Building on this perspective, we outline a deep learning-based active dorsal-ventral vision system and adapt two prior methods, FALcon and GFNet, within this framework to evaluate their robustness. We conduct a comprehensive robustness analysis across three categories: adversarially crafted inputs evaluated under transfer attack scenarios, natural adversarial images, and foreground-distorted images. By learning from focused, downsampled glimpses at multiple distinct fixation points, these active methods significantly enhance the robustness of passive networks, achieving a 2-21 % increase in accuracy. This improvement is demonstrated against state-of-the-art transferable black-box attack. On ImageNet-A, a benchmark for naturally occurring hard samples, we show how distinct predictions from multiple fixation points yield performance gains of 1.5-2 times for both CNN and Transformer based networks. Lastly, we qualitatively demonstrate how an active vision system aligns more closely with human perception for structurally distorted images. This alignment leads to more stable and resilient predictions, with lesser catastrophic mispredictions. In contrast, passive methods, which rely on single-shot learning and inference, often lack the necessary structural understanding",

In parallel, unbalanced OT was designed to allow comparisons of more general positive measures, while being more robust to outliers. In this paper, we bridge the gap between those two concepts and develop a general framework for efficiently comparing positive measures. We notably formulate two different versions of sliced unbalanced OT, and study the associated topology and statistical properties. We then develop a GPU-friendly Frank-Wolfe like algorithm to compute the corresponding loss functions, and show that the resulting methodology is modular as it encompasses and extends prior related work.

This has led to Capsule Network models that do not scale to modern tasks. Our proposed MCAE model alleviates this issue by reformulating the Capsule Network to use masked image modelling as a pretraining stage before finetuning in a supervised manner. Across several experiments and ablations studies we demonstrate that similarly to CNNs and ViTs, Capsule Networks can also benefit from self-supervised pretraining, paving the way for further advancements in this neural network domain. For instance, by pretraining on the Imagenette dataset---consisting of 10 classes of Imagenet-sized images---we achieve state-of-the-art results for Capsule Networks, demonstrating a 9\\% improvement compared to our baseline model.

    "abstract": "Image captioning systems are unable to generate fine-grained captions as they are trained on data that is either noisy (alt-text) or generic (human annotations). This is further exacerbated by maximum likelihood training that encourages generation of frequently occurring phrases. Previous works have tried to address this limitation by fine-tuning captioners with a self-retrieval (SR) reward. However, we find that SR fine-tuning has a tendency to reduce caption faithfulness and even hallucinate. In this work, we circumvent this bottleneck by improving the MLE initialization of the captioning system and designing a curriculum for the SR fine-tuning process. To this extent, we present (1) Visual Caption Boosting, a novel framework to instill fine-grainedness in generic image captioning datasets while remaining anchored in human annotations; and (2) BagCurri, a carefully designed training curriculum that more optimally leverages the contrastive nature of the self-retrieval reward. Jointly, they enable the captioner to describe fine-grained aspects in the image while preserving faithfulness to ground-truth captions. Our approach outperforms previous work by +8.9% on SR against 99 random distractors (RD100) (Dessi et al., 2023); and +7.6% on ImageCoDe. Additionally, existing metrics to evaluate captioning systems fail to reward diversity or evaluate a model's fine-grained understanding ability. Our third contribution addresses this by proposing self-retrieval from the lens of evaluation. We introduce TrueMatch, a benchmark comprising bags of highly similar images that uses SR to assess the captioner's ability to capture subtle visual distinctions. We evaluate and compare several state-of-the-art open-source MLLMs on TrueMatch, and find that our SR approach outperforms them all by a significant margin (e.g. +4.8% - 7.1% over Cambrian) while having 1-2 orders of magnitude fewer parameters. We also outperform vanilla SR by +14.4% to +19.5%",

    "title": "Effective Backdoor Mitigation in Vision-Language Models Depends on the Pre-training Objective",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Despite the advanced capabilities of contemporary machine learning (ML) models, they remain vulnerable to adversarial and backdoor attacks. This vulnerability is particularly concerning in real-world deployments, where compromised models may exhibit unpredictable behavior in critical scenarios. Such risks are heightened by the prevalent practice of collecting massive, internet-sourced datasets for training multimodal models, as these datasets may harbor backdoors. Various techniques have been proposed to mitigate the effects of backdooring in multimodal models, such as CleanCLIP, which is the current state-of-the-art approach. In this work, we demonstrate that the efficacy of CleanCLIP in mitigating backdoors is highly dependent on the particular objective used during model pre-training. We observe that stronger pre-training objectives that lead to higher zero-shot classification performance correlate with harder to remove backdoors behaviors. We show this by training multimodal models on two large datasets consisting of 3 million (CC3M) and 6 million (CC6M) datapoints, under various pre-training objectives, followed by poison removal using CleanCLIP. We find that CleanCLIP, even with extensive hyperparameter tuning, is ineffective in poison removal when stronger pre-training objectives are used. Our findings underscore critical considerations for ML practitioners who train models using large-scale web-curated data and are concerned about potential backdoor threats",

In addition, we also want to control generation to fulfill desired properties such as alignment to a text description, which can be specified with a black-box reward function. Prior works fine-tune pretrained diffusion models to achieve this goal through reinforcement learning-based algorithms. Nonetheless, they suffer from issues including slow credit assignment as well as low quality in their generated samples. In this work, we explore techniques that do not directly maximize the reward but rather generate high-reward images with relatively high probability --- a natural scenario for the framework of generative flow networks (GFlowNets). To this end, we propose the Diffusion Alignment with GFlowNet (DAG) algorithm to post-train diffusion models with black-box property functions.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Besides natural language processing, transformers exhibit extraordinary performance in solving broader applications, including scientific computing and computer vision. Previous works try to explain this from the expressive power and capability perspectives that standard transformers are capable of performing some algorithms. To empower transformers with algorithmic capabilities and motivated by the recently proposed looped transformer (Yang et al., 2024; Giannou et al., 2023), we design a novel transformer framework, dubbed Algorithm Transformer (abbreviated as AlgoFormer). We provide an insight that efficient transformer architectures can be designed by leveraging prior knowledge of tasks and the underlying structure of potential algorithms. Compared with the standard transformer and vanilla looped transformer, the proposed AlgoFormer can perform efficiently in algorithm representation in some specific tasks. In particular, inspired by the structure of human-designed learning algorithms, our transformer framework consists of a pre-transformer that is responsible for task preprocessing, a looped transformer for iterative optimization algorithms, and a post-transformer for producing the desired results after post-processing. We provide theoretical evidence of the expressive power of the AlgoFormer in solving some challenging problems, mirroring human-designed algorithms. Furthermore, some theoretical and empirical results are presented to show that the designed transformer has the potential to perform algorithm representation and learning. Experimental results demonstrate the empirical superiority of the proposed transformer in that it outperforms the standard transformer and vanilla looped transformer in some specific tasks. An extensive experiment on real language tasks (e.g., neural machine translation of German and English, and text classification) further validates the expressiveness and effectiveness of AlgoFormer",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm where multiple clients each having access to a local dataset collaborate to solve a joint problem. Federated Averaging (FedAvg) the algorithm of choice has been widely explored in the classical {\\em server} setting where the server coordinates the information sharing among clients. However, the performance of FedAvg in the {\\em decentralized} setting where only the neighboring clients communicate with each other depending on the network topology is not well understood, especially in the interpolation regime, a common phenomenon observed in modern overparameterized neural networks. In this work, we address this challenge and perform a thorough theoretical performance analysis of FedAvg in the interpolation regime under {\\em decentralized} setting. We consider a class of non-convex functions satisfying the Polyak-{\\L}ojasiewicz (PL) inequality, a condition satisfied by overparameterized neural networks. For the first time, we establish that {\\em Decentralized} FedAvg achieves linear convergence rates of $\\mathcal{O}({T^2} \\log ({1}/{\\epsilon}))$, where $\\epsilon$ is the solution accuracy, and $T$ is the number of local updates at each client. We also extend our analysis to the classical {\\em Server} FedAvg and establish a convergence rate of $\\mathcal{O}(\\log ({1}/{\\epsilon}))$ which significantly improves upon the best-known rates for the simpler strongly-convex setting. In contrast to the standard FedAvg analyses, our work does not require bounded heterogeneity and gradient assumptions. Instead, we show that sample-wise (and local) smoothness of the local objectives suffice to capture the effect of heterogeneity.

This dataset is of particular interest for its large amount of informative missing values which are not missing completely at random, highlighting the impact of missing value handling on accuracy. Under certain missing value schemes a carefully optimised simple neural network performed comparably to Catboost with default settings. However, using less-than-minimum imputation, Catboost with default settings substantially outperformed carefully optimised DL models, achieving the best overall accuracy.

We find that, in importance sampling, privacy is well aligned with utility but at odds with sample size. Based on this insight, we propose two approaches for constructing sampling distributions: one that optimizes the privacy-efficiency trade-off; and one based on a utility guarantee in the form of coresets. We evaluate both approaches empirically in terms of privacy, efficiency, and accuracy on the differentially private $k$-means problem.

Our motivation comes from (1) the recent discussion on whether the increasing amount of publicly accessible synthetic data will improve or hurt currently trained generative models; and (2) the modern deep learning insights that overparameterization improves generalization. Our investigation shows how both training on samples from a pre-trained diffusion model, and using more parameters at certain layers are able to effectively mitigate overfitting in VAEs, therefore improving their generalization, amortized inference, and robustness performance.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithms face the challenge of efficient exploration due to the exponential increase in the size of the joint state-action space. While demonstration-guided learning has proven beneficial in single-agent settings, its direct applicability to MARL is hindered by the practical difficulty of obtaining joint expert demonstrations. In this work, we introduce a novel concept of personalized expert demonstrations, tailored for each individual agent or, more broadly, each individual type of agent within a heterogeneous team. These demonstrations solely pertain to single-agent behaviors and how each agent can achieve personal goals without encompassing any cooperative elements, thus naively imitating them will not achieve cooperation due to potential conflicts. To this end, we propose an approach that selectively utilizes personalized expert demonstrations as guidance and allows agents to learn to cooperate, namely personalized expert-guided MARL (PegMARL). This algorithm utilizes two discriminators: the first provides incentives based on the alignment of individual agent behavior with demonstrations, and the second regulates incentives based on whether the behaviors lead to the desired outcome. We evaluate PegMARL using personalized demonstrations in both discrete and continuous environments. The results demonstrate that PegMARL learns near-optimal policies even when provided with suboptimal demonstrations and outperforms state-of-the-art MARL algorithms in solving coordinated tasks. We also showcase PegMARL's capability of leveraging joint demonstrations in the StarCraft scenario and converging effectively even with demonstrations from non-co-trained policies",

We aim to answer this question as visual concepts learned \"for free\" would enable wide applications such as neuro-symbolic reasoning or human-interpretable object classification. We assume that the visual concepts, if captured by pre-trained VLMs, can be extracted by their vision-language interface with text-based concept prompts. We observe that recent works prompting VLMs with concepts often differ in their strategies to define and evaluate the visual concepts, leading to conflicting conclusions. We propose a new concept definition strategy based on two observations: First, certain concept prompts include shortcuts that recognize correct concepts for wrong reasons; Second, multimodal information (e.g. visual discriminativeness, and textual knowledge) should be leveraged when selecting the concepts. Our proposed concept discovery and learning (CDL) framework is thus designed to identify a diverse list of generic visual concepts (e.g. spiky as opposed to spiky durian), which are ranked and selected based on visual and language mutual information. We carefully design quantitative and human evaluations of the discovered concepts on nine diverse visual recognition datasets, which confirm that pre-trained VLMs do learn visual concepts that provide accurate and thorough descriptions for the recognized objects.

    "abstract": "Collusion rings pose a significant threat to peer review. In these rings, reviewers who are also authors coordinate to manipulate paper assignments, often by strategically bidding on each other's papers. A promising solution is to detect collusion through these manipulated bids, enabling conferences to take appropriate action. However, while methods exist for detecting other types of fraud, no research has yet shown that identifying collusion rings is feasible. In this work, we consider the question of whether it is feasible to detect collusion rings from the paper bidding. We conduct an empirical analysis of two realistic conference bidding datasets and evaluate existing algorithms for fraud detection in other applications. We find that collusion rings can achieve considerable success at manipulating the paper assignment while remaining hidden from detection: for example, in one dataset, undetected colluders are able to achieve assignment to up to 30% of the papers authored by other colluders. In addition, when 10 colluders bid on all of each other's papers, no detection algorithm outputs a group of reviewers with more than 31% overlap with the true colluders. These results suggest that collusion cannot be effectively detected from the bidding using popular existing tools, demonstrating the need to develop more complex detection algorithms as well as those that leverage additional metadata (e.g., reviewer-paper text-similarity scores)",

By overcoming technical challenges, we introduce Diff-Instruct++ (DI++), the first, fast-converging and image data-free human preference alignment method for one-step text-to-image generators. We also introduce novel theoretical insights, showing that using CFG for diffusion distillation is secretly doing RLHF with DI++. Such an interesting finding brings understanding and potential contributions to future research involving CFG. In the experiment sections, we align both UNet-based and DiT-based one-step generators using DI++, which use the Stable Diffusion 1.5 and the PixelArt-$\\alpha$ as the reference diffusion processes. The resulting DiT-based one-step text-to-image model achieves a strong Aesthetic Score of 6.19 and an Image Reward of 1.24 on the COCO validation prompt dataset. It also achieves a leading Human preference Score (HPSv2.0) of 28.48, outperforming other open-sourced models such as Stable Diffusion XL, DMD2, SD-Turbo, as well as PixelArt-$\\alpha$.

However, PINNs often struggle to learn high-frequency and multi-scale target solutions. To tackle this problem, we first study a strong Boundary Condition (BC) version of PINNs for Dirichlet BCs and observe a consistent decline in relative error compared to the standard PINNs. We then perform a theoretical analysis based on the Fourier transform and convolution theorem. We find that strong BC PINNs can better learn the amplitudes of high-frequency components of the target solutions. However, constructing the architecture for strong BC PINNs is difficult for many BCs and domain geometries. Enlightened by our theoretical analysis, we propose Fourier PINNs --- a simple, general, yet powerful method that augments PINNs with pre-specified, dense Fourier bases. Our proposed architecture likewise learns high-frequency components better but places no restrictions on the particular BCs or problem domains. We develop an adaptive learning and basis selection algorithm via alternating neural net basis optimization, Fourier and neural net basis coefficient estimation, and coefficient truncation. This scheme can flexibly identify the significant frequencies while weakening the nominal frequencies to better capture the target solution's power spectrum.

In this work, we take a step further and analyze whether these models can be adapted to target datasets having very different distributions and classes compared to what these models have been trained on, using only a few labeled examples from the target dataset. In such scenarios, finetuning large pretrained models is challenging due to problems of overfitting as well as loss of generalization, and has not been well explored in prior literature. Since, the pre-training data of such models are unavailable, it is difficult to comprehend the performance on various downstream datasets. First, we try to answer the question: Given a target dataset with a few labelled examples, can we estimate whether further fine-tuning can enhance the performance compared to zero-shot evaluation? by analyzing the common vision-language embedding space. Based on the analysis, we propose a novel prompt-tuning method, PromptMargin for adapting such large-scale VLMs directly on the few target samples. PromptMargin effectively tunes the text as well as visual prompts for this task, and has two main modules: 1) Firstly, we use a selective augmentation strategy to complement the few training samples in each task; 2) Additionally, to ensure robust training in the presence of unfamiliar class names, we increase the inter-class margin for improved class discrimination using a novel Multimodal Margin Regularizer. Extensive experiments and analysis across fifteen target benchmark datasets, with varying degrees of distribution shifts from natural images, shows the effectiveness of the proposed framework over the existing state-of-the-art approaches applied to this setting",

    "title": "Mental Modelling of Reinforcement Learning Agents by Language Models",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Can emergent language models faithfully model the intelligence of decision-making agents? Though modern language models already exhibit some reasoning ability, and theoretically can potentially express any probable distribution over tokens, it remains underexplored how the world knowledge these pre-trained models have memorized can be utilised to comprehend an agent's behaviour in the physical world. This paper empirically examines, for the first time, how well large language models (LLMs) can build a mental model of reinforcement learning (RL) agents, termed agent mental modelling, by reasoning about an agent's behaviour and its effect on states from agent interaction history. This research attempts to unveil the potential of leveraging LLMs for elucidating RL agent behaviour, addressing a key challenge in explainable RL. To this end, we propose specific evaluation metrics and test them on selected RL task datasets of varying complexity, reporting findings on agent mental model establishment. Our results disclose that LLMs are not yet capable of fully realising the mental modelling of agents through inference alone without further innovations. This work thus provides new insights into the capabilities and limitations of modern LLMs, highlighting that while they show promise in understanding agents with a longer history context, preexisting beliefs within LLMs about behavioural optimum and state complexity limit their ability to fully comprehend an agent's behaviour and action effects",

    "title": "Reward-based Autonomous Online Learning Framework for Resilient Cooperative Target Monitoring using a Swarm of Robots",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of decentralized cooperative monitoring of an agile target using a swarm of robots undergoing dynamic sensor failures. Each robot is equipped with a proprioceptive sensor suite for the estimation of its own pose and an exteroceptive sensor suite for target detection and position estimation with a limited field of view. Further, the robots use broadcast-based communication modules with a limited communication radius and bandwidth. The uncertainty in the system and the environment can lead to intermittent communication link drops, target visual loss, and large biases in the sensors' estimation output due to temporary or permanent failures. Robotic swarms often operate without leaders, supervisors, or landmarks, i.e., without the availability of ground truth regarding pose information. In such scenarios, each robot is required to exhibit autonomous learning by taking charge of its own learning process while making the most out of available information. In this regard, a novel Autonomous Online Learning (AOL) framework has been proposed, in which a decentralized online learning mechanism driven by reward-like signals, is intertwined with an implicit adaptive consensus-based, two-layered, weighted information fusion process that utilizes the robots' observations and their shared information, thereby ensuring resilience in the robotic swarm. In order to study the effect of loss or reward design in the local and social learning layers, three AOL variants are presented. A novel perturbation-greedy reward design is introduced in the learning layers of two variants, leading to exploration-exploitation in their information fusion's weights' space. Convergence analysis of the weights is carried out, showing that the weights converge under reasonable assumptions. Simulation results show that the AOL variant using the perturbation-greedy reward in its local learning layer performs the best, doing $182.2\\%$ to $652\\%$ and $94.7\\%$ to $150.4\\%$ better than the baselines in terms of detection score and closeness score per robot, respectively, as the total number of robots is increased from $5$ to $30$. Further, AOL's Sim2Real implementation has been validated using a ROS-Gazebo setup",

    "title": "Ask Your Distribution Shift if Pre-Training is Right for You",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Pre-training is a widely used approach to develop models that are robust to distribution shifts. However, in practice, its effectiveness varies: fine-tuning a pre-trained model improves robustness significantly in some cases but *not at all* in others (compared to training from scratch). In this work, we seek to characterize the failure modes that pre-training *can* and *cannot* address. In particular, we focus on two possible failure modes of models under distribution shift: poor extrapolation (e.g., they cannot generalize to a different domain) and biases in the training data (e.g., they rely on spurious features). Our study suggests that, as a rule of thumb, pre-training can help mitigate poor extrapolation but not dataset biases. After providing theoretical motivation and empirical evidence for this finding, we explore two of its implications for developing robust models: (1) pre-training and interventions designed to prevent exploiting biases have complementary robustness benefits, and (2) fine-tuning on a (very) small, non-diverse but *de-biased* dataset can result in significantly more robust models than fine-tuning on a large and diverse but biased dataset",

    "title": "Faithful Interpretation for Graph Neural Networks",
    "volume": "reprod",
    "abstract": "Currently, attention mechanisms have garnered increasing attention in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), such as Graph Attention Networks (GATs) and Graph Transformers (GTs). This is due to not only the commendable boost in performance they offer but also their capacity to provide a more lucid rationale for model behaviors, which are often viewed as inscrutable. However, Attention-based GNNs have demonstrated instability in interpretability when subjected to various sources of perturbations during both training and testing phases, including factors like additional edges or nodes. In this paper, we propose a solution to this problem by introducing a novel notion called Faithful Graph Attention-based Interpretation (FGAI). In particular, FGAI has four crucial properties in terms of stability and sensitivity to interpretation and the final output distribution. Built upon this notion, we propose an efficient methodology for obtaining FGAI, which can be viewed as an ad hoc modification to the canonical Attention-based GNNs. To validate our proposed solution, we introduce two novel metrics tailored for graph interpretation assessment. Experimental results demonstrate that FGAI exhibits superior stability and preserves the interpretability of attention under various forms of perturbations and randomness, which makes FGAI a more faithful and reliable explanation tool",

    "volume": "featured",
    "abstract": "Pretrained foundation models (FMs) have exhibited extraordinary in-context learning performance, allowing zero-shot (or few-shot) generalization to new environments/tasks not encountered during the pretraining. In the case of reinforcement learning (RL), in-context RL (ICRL) emerges when pretraining FMs on decision-making problems in an autoregressive-supervised manner. Nevertheless, the current state-of-the-art ICRL algorithms, such as Algorithm Distillation, Decision Pretrained Transformer and Decision Importance Transformer, impose stringent requirements on the pretraining dataset concerning the behavior (source) policies, context information, and action labels, etc. Notably, these algorithms either demand optimal policies or require varying degrees of well-trained behavior policies for all pretraining environments. This significantly hinders the application of ICRL to real-world scenarios, where acquiring optimal or well-trained policies for a substantial volume of real-world training environments can be prohibitively expensive or even intractable. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a novel approach, termed State-Action Distillation (SAD), that allows to generate an effective pretraining dataset guided solely by random policies. In particular, SAD selects query states and corresponding action labels by distilling the outstanding state-action pairs from the entire state and action spaces by using random policies within a trust horizon, and then inherits the classical autoregressive-supervised mechanism during the pretraining. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that enables effective ICRL under (e.g., uniform) random policies and random contexts. We also establish the quantitative analysis of the trustworthiness as well as the performance guarantees of our SAD approach. Moreover, our empirical results across multiple popular ICRL benchmark environments demonstrate that, on average, SAD outperforms the best baseline by 236.3% in the offline evaluation and by 135.2% in the online evaluation",

In this work, we show that protein language model-based structure predictors can be dramatically simplified at little to no loss in accuracy. Our model, MiniFold, consists of a redesigned Evoformer and a lightweight structure module. We also propose two novel GPU kernels, tailored to the proposed architecture. Equipped with the same ESM2 protein language model, MiniFold is competitive with ESMFold on the standard CAMEO and CASP datasets while achieving training and inference speedups of up to 20x, and significant reductions in peak memory.

Domain adaptive object detection (DAOD) methods have recently demonstrated strong results on addressing this challenge. Unfortunately, we identify systemic benchmarking pitfalls that call past results into question and hamper further progress: (a) Overestimation of performance due to underpowered baselines, (b) Inconsistent implementation practices preventing transparent comparisons of methods, and (c) Lack of generality due to outdated backbones and lack of diversity in benchmarks. We address these problems by introducing: (1) A unified benchmarking and implementation framework, Align and Distill (ALDI), enabling comparison of DAOD methods and supporting future development, (2) A fair and modern training and evaluation protocol for DAOD that addresses benchmarking pitfalls, (3) A new DAOD benchmark dataset, CFC-DAOD, increasing the diversity of available DAOD benchmarks, and (4) A new method, ALDI++, that achieves state-of-the-art results by a large margin.

While the societal impact of foundation models is growing, transparency is on the decline, mirroring the opacity that has plagued past digital technologies (e.g. social media). Reversing this trend is essential: transparency is a vital precondition for public accountability, scientific innovation, and effective governance. To assess the transparency of the foundation model ecosystem and help improve transparency over time, we introduce the Foundation Model Transparency Index. The Foundation Model Transparency Index specifies 100 fine-grained indicators that comprehensively codify transparency for foundation models, spanning the upstream resources used to build a foundation model (e.g data, labor, compute), details about the model itself (e.g. size, capabilities, risks), and the downstream use (e.g. distribution channels, usage policies, affected geographies). We score 10 major foundation model developers (e.g. OpenAI, Google, Meta) against the 100 indicators to assess their transparency. To facilitate and standardize assessment, we score developers in relation to their practices for their flagship foundation model (e.g. GPT-4 for OpenAI, PaLM 2 for Google, Llama 2 for Meta). We present 10 top-level findings about the foundation model ecosystem: for example, no developer currently discloses significant information about the downstream impact of its flagship model, such as the number of users, affected market sectors, or how users can seek redress for harm. Overall, the Foundation Model Transparency Index establishes the level of transparency today to drive progress on foundation model governance via industry standards and regulatory intervention",

Our predictions extrapolate well even at 20x the largest FLOP budget used to fit the curves. More precisely, we find that there are simple shifted power law relationships between (1) the train losses of two models trained on two separate datasets when the models are paired by training compute (train-to-train), (2) the train loss and the test loss on any downstream distribution for a single model (train-to-test), and (3) the test losses of two models trained on two separate train datasets (test-to-test). The results hold up for pre-training datasets that differ substantially (some are entirely code and others have no code at all) and across a variety of downstream tasks.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in generative deep learning have enabled the creation of high-quality synthetic images in text-to-image generation. While prior research indicates that fine-tuning a pretrained diffusion model on ImageNet and generating synthetic training images can boost an ImageNet classifier's performance, when synthetic images start to outnumber real ones in training, the classifier performance starts to degrade, underscoring the scalability challenge of training with synthetic data. In this paper, we delve into the necessity of generative fine-tuning for achieving recognition performance improvements and investigate the scalability of training with large-scale synthetic images. We find that leveraging off-the-shelf generative models without fine-tuning, while addressing challenges of class name ambiguity, limited prompt diversity, and domain shifts effectively mitigates performance degradation from large-scale synthetic data. Specifically, we leverage large language models (LLMs) and CLIP to resolve class name ambiguity. To diversify images, we propose contextualized diversification (CD) and stylized diversification (SD) methods, also prompted by LLMs. Finally, to mitigate domain shifts, we leverage domain adaptation techniques with auxiliary batch normalization for synthetic images. Our framework consistently boosts recognition model performance with increased synthetic data, even up to 6 times the original ImageNet size. Models trained with our approach demonstrate significant in-domain improvement on ImageNet-val (1.20\\% to 2.35\\% across various architectures) and strong out-of-domain generalization on ImageNet-Sketch and -Rendition ($\\sim$10\\% improvement with large vision transformers)",

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained significant attention in recent years for their ability to process data that may be represented as graphs. This has prompted several studies to explore their representational capability based on the graph isomorphism task. Notably, these works inherently assume a countable node feature representation, potentially limiting their applicability. Interestingly, only a few study GNNs with uncountable node feature representation. In the paper, a new perspective on the representational capability of GNNs is investigated across all levels—node-level, neighborhood-level, and graph-level—when the space of node feature representation is uncountable. Specifically, the injective and metric requirements of previous works are softly relaxed by employing a pseudometric distance on the space of input to create a soft-injective function such that distinct inputs may produce similar outputs if and only if the pseudometric deems the inputs to be sufficiently similar on some representation. As a consequence, a simple and computationally efficient soft-isomorphic relational graph convolution network (SIR-GCN) that emphasizes the contextualized transformation of neighborhood feature representations via anisotropic and dynamic message functions is proposed. Furthermore, a mathematical discussion on the relationship between SIR-GCN and key GNNs in literature is laid out to put the contribution into context, establishing SIR-GCN as a generalization of classical GNN methodologies. To close, experiments on synthetic and benchmark datasets demonstrate the relative superiority of SIR-GCN, outperforming comparable models in node and graph property prediction tasks",

    "abstract": "Deep hybrid models (DHMs) for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, jointly training a deep feature extractor with a classification head and a density estimation head based on a normalising flow, provide a conceptually appealing approach to visual OOD detection. The paper that introduced this approach reported 100% AuROC in experiments on two standard benchmarks, including one based on the CIFAR-10 data. As there are no implementations available, we set out to reproduce the approach by carefully filling in gaps in the description of the algorithm. Although we were unable to attain 100% OOD detection rates, and our results indicate that such performance is impossible on the CIFAR-10 benchmark, we achieved good OOD performance. We provide a detailed analysis of when the architecture fails and argue that it introduces an adversarial relationship between the classification component and the density estimator, rendering it highly sensitive to the balance of these two components and yielding a collapsed feature space without careful fine-tuning. Our implementation of DHMs is publicly available",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in integrating positional and structural encodings (PSEs) into graph neural networks (GNNs) have significantly enhanced their performance across various graph learning tasks. However, the general applicability of these encodings and their potential to serve as foundational representations for graphs remain uncertain. This paper investigates the fine-tuning efficiency, scalability with sample size, and generalization capability of learnable PSEs across diverse graph datasets. Specifically, we evaluate their potential as universal pre-trained models that can be easily adapted to new tasks with minimal fine-tuning and limited data. Furthermore, we assess the expressivity of the learned representations, particularly, when used to augment downstream GNNs. We demonstrate through extensive benchmarking and empirical analysis that PSEs generally enhance downstream models. However, some datasets may require specific PSE-augmentations to achieve optimal performance. Nevertheless, our findings highlight their significant potential to become integral components of future graph foundation models. We provide new insights into the strengths and limitations of PSEs, contributing to the broader discourse on foundation models in graph learning",

    "title": "Shedding Light on Problems with Hyperbolic Graph Learning",
    "volume": "reprod",
    "abstract": "Recent papers in the graph machine learning literature have introduced a number of approaches for hyperbolic representation learning. The asserted benefits are improved performance on a variety of graph tasks, node classification and link prediction included. Claims have also been made about the geometric suitability of particular hierarchical graph datasets to representation in hyperbolic space. Despite these claims, our work makes a surprising discovery: when simple Euclidean models with comparable numbers of parameters are properly trained in the same environment, in most cases, they perform as well, if not better, than all introduced hyperbolic graph representation learning models, even on graph datasets previously claimed to be the most hyperbolic as measured by Gromov $\\delta$-hyperbolicity (i.e., perfect trees). This observation gives rise to a simple question: how can this be? We answer this question by taking a careful look at the field of hyperbolic graph representation learning as it stands today, and find that a number of results do not diligently present baselines, make faulty modelling assumptions when constructing algorithms, and use misleading metrics to quantify geometry of graph datasets. We take a closer look at each of these three problems, elucidate the issues, perform an analysis of methods, and introduce a parametric family of benchmark datasets to ascertain the applicability of (hyperbolic) graph neural networks",

    "title": "Multivariate Dense Retrieval: A Reproducibility Study under a Memory-limited Setup",
    "volume": "reprod",
    "abstract": "The current paradigm in dense retrieval is to represent queries and passages as low-dimensional real-valued vectors using neural language models, and then compute query-passage similarity as the dot product of these vector representations. A limitation of this approach is that these learned representations cannot capture or express uncertainty. At the same time, information retrieval over large corpora contains several sources of uncertainty, such as misspelled or ambiguous text. Consequently, retrieval methods that incorporate uncertainty estimation are more likely to generalize well to such data distribution shifts. The multivariate representation learning (MRL) framework proposed by Zamani & Bendersky (2023) is the first method that works in the direction of modeling uncertainty in dense retrieval. This framework represents queries and passages as multivariate normal distributions and computes query-passage similarity as the negative Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between these distributions. Furthermore, MRL formulates KL divergence as a dot product, allowing for efficient first-stage retrieval using standard maximum inner product search. In this paper, we attempt to reproduce MRL under memory constraints (e.g., an academic computational budget). In particular, we focus on a memory-limited, single GPU setup. We find that the original work (i) introduces a typographical/mathematical error early in the formulation of the method that propagates to the rest of the original paper's mathematical formulations, and (ii) does not fully specify certain important design choices that can strongly influence performance. In light of the aforementioned, we address the mathematical error and make some reasonable design choices when important details are unspecified. Additionally, we expand on the results from the original paper with a thorough ablation study which provides more insight into the impact of the framework's different components. While we confirm that MRL can have state-of-the-art performance, we could not reproduce the results reported in the original paper or uncover the reported trends against the baselines under a memory-limited setup that facilitates fair comparisons of MRL against its baselines. Our analysis offers insights as to why that is the case. Most importantly, our empirical results suggest that the variance definition in MRL does not consistently capture uncertainty.

The social agent part explores agents' preferences, beliefs, and reasoning abilities, as well as their interactions and synergistic effects on decision-making. The evaluation protocol covers both game-agnostic and game-specific metrics for assessing agent performance.

    "title": "When Should Reinforcement Learning Use Causal Reasoning?",
    "volume": "survey",
    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) and causal reasoning naturally complement each other. The goal of causal reasoning is to predict the effects of interventions in an environment, while the goal of reinforcement learning is to select interventions that maximize the rewards the agent receives from the environment. Reinforcement learning includes the two most powerful sources of information for estimating causal relationships: temporal ordering and the ability to act on an environment. This paper provides a theoretical study examining which reinforcement learning settings we can expect to benefit from causal reasoning, and how. According to our analysis, the key factor is {\\em whether the behavioral policy---which generates the data---can be executed by the learning agent}, meaning that the observation signal available to the learning agent comprises all observations used by the behavioral policy. Common RL settings with behavioral policies that are executable by the learning agent include on-policy learning and online exploration, where the learning agent uses a behavioral policy to explore the environment. Common RL settings with behavioral policies that are not executable by the learning agent include offline learning with a partially observable state space and asymmetric imitation learning where the demonstrator has access to more observations than the imitator. Using the theory of causal graphs, we show formally that when the behavioral policy is executable by the learning agent, conditional probabilities are causal, and can therefore be used to estimate expected rewards as done in traditional RL. However, when the behavioral policy is not executable by the learning agent, conditional probabilities may be confounded and provide misleading estimates of expected rewards. For confounded settings, we describe previous and new methods for leveraging causal reasoning",

Recent advances in graph neural networks have enabled the embedding of graphs into low-dimensional vector spaces, where the sim- ilarity or distance between graphs can be efficiently quantified. However, these methods are often tailored to specific tasks and function as black boxes, limiting both generalization and interpretability. To address these challenges, there is growing interest in incorporating domain-agnostic and interpretable concepts from graph theory—such as subgraph isomorphism, maximum common subgraph, and graph edit distance—into graph similarity learning as training objectives. This survey presents a comprehensive review of recent advancements in deep graph similarity learning, focusing on models that integrate these graph theory concepts. Despite the different training objectives of these approaches, they share significant commonalities in the training pipeline, techniques, and challenges. We analyze them within a unified lens referred to as graph theory-based deep similarity learning (GTDGSL) methods.

Model MoErging methods aim to recycle expert models to create an aggregate system with improved performance or generalization.

The promise, effectiveness, and large design space of MoErging has spurred the development of many new methods over the past few years. This rapid pace of development has made it challenging to compare different MoErging methods, which are rarely compared to one another and are often validated in different experimental setups. To remedy such gaps, we present a comprehensive survey of MoErging methods that includes a novel taxonomy for cataloging key design choices and clarifying suitable applications for each method. Apart from surveying MoErging research, we inventory software tools and applications that make use of MoErging. We additionally discuss related fields of study such as model merging, multitask learning, and mixture-of-experts models.

    "abstract": "Autoregressive modeling has been a huge success in the field of natural language processing (NLP). Recently, autoregressive models have emerged as a significant area of focus in computer vision, where they excel in producing high-quality visual content. Autoregressive models in NLP typically operate on subword tokens. However, the representation strategy in computer vision can vary in different levels, i.e., pixel-level, token-level, or scale-level, reflecting the diverse and hierarchical nature of visual data compared to the sequential structure of language. This survey comprehensively examines the literature on autoregressive models applied to vision. To improve readability for researchers from diverse research backgrounds, we start with preliminary sequence representation and modeling in vision. Next, we divide the fundamental frameworks of visual autoregressive models into three general sub-categories, including pixel-based, token-based, and scale-based models based on the representation strategy. We then explore the interconnections between autoregressive models and other generative models. Furthermore, we present a multifaceted categorization of autoregressive models in computer vision, including image generation, video generation, 3D generation, and multimodal generation. We also elaborate on their applications in diverse domains, including emerging domains such as embodied AI and 3D medical AI, with about 250 related references. Finally, we highlight the current challenges to autoregressive models in vision with suggestions about potential research directions.

    "volume": "survey",
    "abstract": "Graphs are ubiquitous in real-world applications, ranging from social networks to biological systems, and have inspired the development of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for learning expressive representations. While most research has centered on static graphs, many real-world scenarios involve dynamic, temporally evolving graphs, motivating the need for Continuous-Time Dynamic Graph (CTDG) models. This paper provides a comprehensive review of Graph Representation Learning (GRL) on CTDGs with a focus on Self-Supervised Representation Learning (SSRL). We introduce a novel theoretical framework that analyzes the expressivity of CTDG models through an Information-Flow (IF) lens, quantifying their ability to propagate and encode temporal and structural information. Leveraging this framework, we categorize existing CTDG methods based on their suitability for different graph types and application scenarios. Within the same scope, we examine the design of SSRL methods tailored to CTDGs, such as predictive and contrastive approaches, highlighting their potential to mitigate the reliance on labeled data. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets validate our theoretical insights, demonstrating the strengths and limitations of various methods across long-range, bi-partite and community-based graphs. This work offers both a theoretical foundation and practical guidance for selecting and developing CTDG models, advancing the understanding of GRL in dynamic settings",

    "title": "Adaptive Physics-informed Neural Networks: A Survey",
    "volume": "survey",
    "abstract": "Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising approach for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) using neural networks, particularly in data-scarce scenarios due to their unsupervised training capability. However, a key limitation is the need for re-optimization with each change in PDE parameters, similar to the challenge in traditional numerical methods where each system of equations corresponds to a specific PDE instance. This characteristic poses a barrier to the widespread adoption of PINNs across scientific and engineering applications. This survey explores research addressing this limitation through transfer learning and meta-learning, synthesizing insights to establish a foundation for efficient data generation strategies tailored to PINNs. These methods can potentially improve PINNs' training efficiency, enabling quicker adaptation to new PDEs with fewer data and computational demands. While numerical methods directly solve systems of equations to derive solutions, neural networks implicitly learn solutions by adjusting their parameters. One notable advantage of neural networks lies in their capacity to abstract away from specific problem domains, enabling them to retain, discard, or adapt learned representations to efficiently address similar problems. By understanding how these techniques can be applied to PINNs, this survey seeks to identify promising directions for future research to enable the widespread adoption of PINNs across a wide range of scientific and engineering applications",

In addition, research on the honesty of LLMs also faces challenges, including varying definitions of honesty, difficulties in distinguishing between known and unknown knowledge, and a lack of comprehensive understanding of related research. To address these issues, we provide a survey on the honesty of LLMs, covering its clarification, evaluation approaches, and strategies for improvement.

    "volume": "survey",
    "abstract": "Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a paradigm in knowledge representation, offering exceptional flexibility and performance across a diverse range of applications. INRs leverage multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) to model data as continuous implicit functions, providing critical advantages such as resolution independence, memory efficiency, and generalisation beyond discretised data structures. Their ability to solve complex inverse problems makes them particularly effective for tasks including audio reconstruction, image representation, 3D object reconstruction, and high-dimensional data synthesis. This survey provides a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art INR methods, introducing a clear taxonomy that categorises them into four key areas: activation functions, position encoding, combined strategies, and network structure optimisation. We rigorously analyse their critical properties—such as full differentiability, smoothness, compactness, and adaptability to varying resolutions—while also examining their strengths and limitations in addressing locality biases and capturing fine details. Our experimental comparison offers new insights into the trade-offs between different approaches, showcasing the capabilities and challenges of the latest INR techniques across various tasks. In addition to identifying areas where current methods excel, we highlight key limitations and potential avenues for improvement, such as developing more expressive activation functions, enhancing positional encoding mechanisms, and improving scalability for complex, high-dimensional data. This survey serves as a roadmap for researchers, offering practical guidance for future exploration in the field of INRs.

    "volume": "survey",
    "abstract": "Interpretability researchers face a universal question: without access to ground truth labels, how can the faithfulness of an explanation to its model be determined? Despite immense efforts to develop new evaluation methods, current approaches remain in a pre-paradigmatic state: fragmented, difficult to calibrate, and lacking cohesive theoretical grounding. Observ- ing the lack of a unifying theory, we propose a novel evaluative criterion entitled Generalised Explanation Faithfulness (GEF) which is centered on explanation-to-model alignment, and integrates existing perturbation-based evaluations to eliminate the need for singular, task-specific evaluations. Complementing this unifying perspective, from a geometric point of view, we reveal a prevalent yet critical oversight in current evaluation practice: the failure to account for the learned geometry, and non-linear mapping present in the model, and explanation spaces. To solve this, we propose a general-purpose, threshold-free faithfulness evaluator GEF that incorporates principles from differential geometry, and facilitates evaluation agnostically across tasks, and interpretability approaches. Through extensive cross-domain benchmarks on natural language processing, vision, and tabular tasks, we provide first-of-its-kind insights into the comparative performance of various interpretable methods. This includes local linear approximators, global feature visualisation methods, large language models as post-hoc explainers, and sparse autoencoders. Our contributions are important to the interpretability and AI safety communities, offering a principled, unified approach for evaluation",

The formulation component of the framework, leveraging a contamination perspective, provides a unified interpretation of how weak supervision is formed and subsumes fifteen existing WSL settings. The induced reduction graphs offer comprehensive connections over WSLs. The analysis component of the framework, viewed as a decontamination process, provides a systematic method of conducting risk rewrite.

Is it possible to enhance AI by tapping into the power of brain recordings? These captivating questions lie at the heart of an emerging field at the intersection of neuroscience and artificial intelligence. Our survey dives into this exciting domain, focusing on human brain recording studies and cutting-edge cognitive neuroscience datasets that capture brain activity during natural language processing, visual perception, and auditory experiences. We explore two fundamental approaches: encoding models, which attempt to generate brain activity patterns from sensory inputs; and decoding models, which aim to reconstruct our thoughts and perceptions from neural signals. These techniques not only promise breakthroughs in neurological diagnostics and brain-computer interfaces but also offer a window into the very nature of cognition. In this survey, we first discuss popular representations of language, vision, and speech stimuli, and present a summary of neuroscience datasets. We then review how the recent advances in deep learning transformed this field, by investigating the popular deep learning based encoding and decoding architectures, noting their benefits and limitations across different sensory modalities. From text to images, speech to videos, we investigate how these models capture the brain's response to our complex, multimodal world. While our primary focus is on human studies, we also highlight the crucial role of animal models in advancing our understanding of neural mechanisms. Throughout, we mention the ethical implications of these powerful technologies, addressing concerns about privacy and cognitive liberty. We conclude with a summary and discussion of future trends in this rapidly evolving field.

As an emerging research topic, ICRL has received considerable attention in recent years. This article presents a categorical survey of the latest advances in ICRL. It serves as a comprehensive reference for machine learning researchers and practitioners, as well as starters seeking to comprehend the definitions, advancements, and important challenges in ICRL. We begin by formally defining the problem and outlining the algorithmic framework that facilitates constraint inference across various scenarios. These include deterministic or stochastic environments, environments with limited demonstrations, and multiple agents. For each context, we illustrate the critical challenges and introduce a series of fundamental methods to tackle these issues. This survey encompasses discrete, virtual, and realistic environments for evaluating ICRL agents. We also delve into the most pertinent applications of ICRL, such as autonomous driving, robot control, and sports analytics. To stimulate continuing research, we conclude the survey with a discussion of key unresolved questions in ICRL that can effectively foster a bridge between theoretical understanding and practical industrial applications.

    "volume": "survey",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs), which bridge the gap between human language understanding and complex problem-solving, achieve state-of-the-art performance on several NLP tasks, particularly in few-shot and zero-shot settings. Despite the demonstrable efficacy of LLMs, due to constraints on computational resources, users have to engage with open-source language models or outsource the entire training process to third-party platforms. However, research has demonstrated that language models are susceptible to potential security vulnerabilities, particularly in backdoor attacks. Backdoor attacks are designed to introduce targeted vulnerabilities into language models by poisoning training samples or model weights, allowing attackers to manipulate model responses through malicious triggers. While existing surveys on backdoor attacks provide a comprehensive overview, they lack an in-depth examination of backdoor attacks specifically targeting LLMs. To bridge this gap and grasp the latest trends in the field, this paper presents a novel perspective on backdoor attacks for LLMs by focusing on fine-tuning methods. Specifically, we systematically classify backdoor attacks into three categories: full-parameter fine-tuning, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and no fine-tuning. Based on insights from a substantial review, we also discuss crucial issues for future research on backdoor attacks, such as further exploring attack algorithms that do not require fine-tuning, or developing more covert attack algorithms",

Despite the vast amount of open instruction datasets, naively training a LLM on all existing instructions may not be optimal and practical.

However, under the context of instruction tuning, there still exists a gap in knowledge on what kind of data evaluation metrics can be employed and how they can be integrated into the selection mechanism. To bridge this gap, we present a comprehensive review on existing literature of data assessment and selection especially for instruction tuning of LLMs. We systematically categorize all applicable methods into quality-based, diversity-based, and importance-based ones where a unified, fine-grained taxonomy is structured. For each category, representative methods are elaborated to describe the landscape of relevant research. In addition, comparison between the latest methods is conducted on their officially reported results to provide in-depth discussions on their limitations.

However, they are costly to train and struggle to fully exploit the rich covariates characteristic of longitudinal data, making them difficult for practitioners to use effectively. In this work, we leverage linear mixed models (LMMs) and amortized variational inference to provide conditional priors for VAEs, and propose LMM-VAE, a scalable, interpretable and identifiable model.

Since their inception, GFlowNets have proven to be useful for learning generative models in applications where the majority of the discrete space is unvisited during training. This has inspired some to hypothesize that GFlowNets, when paired with deep neural networks (DNNs), have favorable generalization properties. In this work, we empirically verify some of the hypothesized mechanisms of generalization of GFlowNets. We accomplish this by introducing a novel graph-based benchmark environment where reward difficulty can be easily varied, $p(x)$ can be computed exactly, and an unseen test set can be constructed to quantify generalization performance. Using this graph-based environment, we are able to systematically test the hypothesized mechanisms of generalization of GFlowNets and put forth a set of empirical observations that summarize our findings. In particular, we find (and confirm) that the functions that GFlowNets learn to approximate have an implicit underlying structure which facilitate generalization. Surprisingly ---and somewhat contradictory to existing knowledge--- we also find that GFlowNets are sensitive to being trained offline and off-policy. However, the reward implicitly learned by GFlowNets is robust to changes in the training distribution",

This inference cost is the major obstacle to deploying GNN models with \\emph{online prediction} to reflect the potentially dynamic node features. To address this, we propose an approach to reduce the number of nodes that are included during aggregation. We achieve this through a sparse decomposition, learning to approximate node representations using a weighted sum of linearly transformed features of a carefully selected subset of nodes within the extended neighbourhood. The approach achieves linear complexity with respect to the average node degree and the number of layers in the graph neural network. We introduce an algorithm to compute the optimal parameters for the sparse decomposition, ensuring an accurate approximation of the original GNN model, and present effective strategies to reduce the training time and improve the learning process. We demonstrate via extensive experiments that our method outperforms other baselines designed for inference speedup, achieving significant accuracy gains with comparable inference times for both node classification and spatio-temporal forecasting tasks",

Many existing benchmarks suffer from fragmentation and inconsistent evaluation methodologies, making it challenging to achieve reliable comparisons and reproducible results. In an earlier work, Drouin et al. (2024) introduced BrowserGym which aims to solve this by providing a unified, gym-like environment with well-defined observation and actionspaces, facilitating standardized evaluation across diverse benchmarks. We propose an extended BrowserGym-based ecosystem for web agent research, which unifies existing benchmarks from the literature and includes AgentLab, a complementary framework that aids in agent creation, testing, and analysis. Our proposed ecosystem offers flexibility for integrating new benchmarks while ensuring consistent evaluation and comprehensive experiment management. This standardized approach seeks to reduce the time and complexity of developing web agents, supporting more reliable comparisons and facilitating in-depth analysis of agent behaviors, and could result in more adaptable, capable agents, ultimately accelerating innovation in LLM-driven automation. As a supporting evidence, we conduct the first large-scale, multi-benchmark web agent experiment and compare the performance of 6 state-of-the-art LLMs across 6 popular web agent benchmarks made available in BrowserGym. Among other findings, our results highlight a large discrepancy between OpenAI and Anthropic's latests models, with Claude-3.5-Sonnet leading the way on almost all benchmarks, except on vision-related tasks where GPT-4o is superior. Despite these advancements, our results emphasize that building robust and efficient web agents remains a significant challenge, due to the inherent complexity of real-world web environments and the limitations of current models",

    "title": "Variation Matters: from Mitigating to Embracing Zero-Shot NAS Ranking Function Variation",
    "volume": "expert",
    "abstract": "Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is a powerful automatic alternative to manual design of a neural network. In the zero-shot version, a fast ranking function is used to compare architectures without training them. The outputs of the ranking functions often vary significantly due to different sources of randomness, including the evaluated architecture's weights' initialization or the batch of data used for calculations. A common approach to addressing the variation is to average a ranking function output over several evaluations. We propose taking into account the variation in a different manner, by viewing the ranking function output as a random variable representing a proxy performance metric. During the search process, we strive to construct a stochastic ordering of the performance metrics to determine the best architecture. Our experiments show that the proposed stochastic ordering can effectively boost performance of a search on standard benchmark search spaces",

    "title": "Necessary and Sufficient Watermark for Large Language Models",
    "volume": "expert",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) can now generate texts that are indistinguishable from those written by humans. Such remarkable performance of LLMs increases their risk of being used for malicious purposes. Thus, it is necessary to develop methods for distinguishing texts written by LLMs from those written by humans. Watermarking is one of the most powerful methods for achieving this. Although existing methods have successfully detected texts generated by LLMs, they inevitably degrade the text quality. In this study, we propose the Necessary and Sufficient Watermark (NS-Watermark) for inserting watermarks into generated texts with minimum text quality degradation. More specifically, we derive minimum constraints required to be imposed on the generated texts to distinguish whether LLMs or humans write the texts, and we formulate the NS-Watermark as a constrained optimization problem. Through the experiments, we demonstrate that the NS-Watermark can generate more natural texts than existing watermarking methods and distinguish more accurately between texts written by LLMs and those written by humans. Especially in machine translation tasks, the NS-Watermark can outperform the existing watermarking method by up to 30 BLEU scores",

    "title": "Personalized Negative Reservoir for Incremental Learning in Recommender Systems",
    "volume": "expert",
    "abstract": "Recommender systems have become an integral part of online platforms. Every day the volume of training data is expanding and the number of user interactions is constantly increasing. The exploration of larger and more expressive models has become a necessary pursuit to improve user experience. However, this progression carries with it an increased computational burden. In commercial settings, once a recommendation system model has been trained and deployed it typically needs to be updated frequently as new client data arrive. Cumulatively, the mounting volume of data is guaranteed to eventually make full batch retraining of the model from scratch computationally infeasible. Naively fine-tuning solely on the new data runs into the well-documented problem of catastrophic forgetting. Despite the fact that negative sampling is a crucial part of training with implicit feedback, no specialized technique exists that is tailored to the incremental learning framework. In this work, we propose a personalized negative reservoir strategy, which is used to obtain negative samples for the standard triplet loss of graph-based recommendation systems. Our technique balances alleviation of forgetting with plasticity by encouraging the model to remember stable user preferences and selectively forget when user interests change. We derive the mathematical formulation of a negative sampler to populate and update the reservoir. We integrate our design in three SOTA and commonly used incremental recommendation models. We show that these concrete realizations of our negative reservoir framework achieve state-of-the-art results for standard benchmarks using multiple top-k evaluation metrics",

    "title": "The RealHumanEval: Evaluating Large Language Models' Abilities to Support Programmers",
    "volume": "expert",
    "abstract": "Evaluation of large language models for code has primarily relied on static benchmarks, including HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021), or more recently using human preferences of LLM responses. As LLMs are increasingly used as programmer assistants, we study whether gains on existing benchmarks or more preferred LLM responses translate to programmer productivity when coding with LLMs, including time spent coding. We introduce RealHumanEval, a web interface to measure the ability of LLMs to assist programmers, through either autocomplete or chat support. We conducted a user study (N=243) using RealHumanEval in which users interacted with seven LLMs of varying base model performance. Despite static benchmarks not incorporating humans-in-the-loop, we find that improvements in benchmark performance lead to increased programmer productivity; however gaps in benchmark versus human performance are not proportional---a trend that holds across both forms of LLM support. In contrast, we find that programmer preferences do not correlate with their actual performance, motivating the need for better proxy signals. We open-source RealHumanEval to enable human-centric evaluation of new models and the study data to facilitate efforts to improve code models",
