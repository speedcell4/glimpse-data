    "title": "LEAP-VO: Long-term Effective Any Point Tracking for Visual Odometry",
    "volume": "Jan",
    "abstract": "Visual odometry estimates the motion of a moving camera based on visual input. Existing methods, mostly focusing on two-view point tracking, often ignore the rich temporal context in the image sequence, thereby overlooking the global motion patterns and providing no assessment of the full trajectory reliability. These shortcomings hinder performance in scenarios with occlusion, dynamic objects, and low-texture areas. To address these challenges, we present the Long-term Effective Any Point Tracking (LEAP) module. LEAP innovatively combines visual, inter-track, and temporal cues with mindfully selected anchors for dynamic track estimation. Moreover, LEAP's temporal probabilistic formulation integrates distribution updates into a learnable iterative refinement module to reason about point-wise uncertainty. Based on these traits, we develop LEAP-VO, a robust visual odometry system adept at handling occlusions and dynamic scenes. Our mindful integration showcases a novel practice by employing long-term point tracking as the front-end. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed pipeline significantly outperforms existing baselines across various visual odometry benchmarks",

    "volume": "Jan",
    "abstract": "We present a framework for generating full-bodied photorealistic avatars that gesture according to the conversational dynamics of a dyadic interaction. Given speech audio, we output multiple possibilities of gestural motion for an individual, including face, body, and hands. The key behind our method is in combining the benefits of sample diversity from vector quantization with the high-frequency details obtained through diffusion to generate more dynamic, expressive motion. We visualize the generated motion using highly photorealistic avatars that can express crucial nuances in gestures (e.g. sneers and smirks). To facilitate this line of research, we introduce a first-of-its-kind multi-view conversational dataset that allows for photorealistic reconstruction. Experiments show our model generates appropriate and diverse gestures, outperforming both diffusion- and VQ-only methods. Furthermore, our perceptual evaluation highlights the importance of photorealism (vs. meshes) in accurately assessing subtle motion details in conversational gestures.

    "volume": "Jan",
    "abstract": "With an aging population, numerous assistive and monitoring technologies are under development to enable older adults to age in place. To facilitate aging in place predicting risk factors such as falls, and hospitalization and providing early interventions are important. Much of the work on ambient monitoring for risk prediction has centered on gait speed analysis, utilizing privacy-preserving sensors like radar. Despite compelling evidence that monitoring step length, in addition to gait speed, is crucial for predicting risk, radar-based methods have not explored step length measurement in the home. Furthermore, laboratory experiments on step length measurement using radars are limited to proof of concept studies with few healthy subjects. To address this gap, a radar-based step length measurement system for the home is proposed based on detection and tracking using radar point cloud, followed by Doppler speed profiling of the torso to obtain step lengths in the home. The proposed method was evaluated in a clinical environment, involving 35 frail older adults, to establish its validity. Additionally, the method was assessed in people's homes, with 21 frail older adults who had participated in the clinical assessment. The proposed radar-based step length measurement method was compared to the gold standard Zeno Walkway Gait Analysis System, revealing a 4.5cm/8.3% error in a clinical setting. Furthermore, it exhibited excellent reliability (ICC(2,k)=0.91, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.96) in uncontrolled home settings. The method also proved accurate in uncontrolled home settings, as indicated by a strong agreement (ICC(3,k)=0.81 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.92)) between home measurements and in-clinic assessments",

We systematically evaluate LLMs' abilities to generate and recognize an assortment of visual concepts of increasing complexity and then demonstrate how a preliminary visual representation learning system can be trained using models of text. As language models lack the ability to consume or output visual information as pixels, we use code to represent images in our study. Although LLM-generated images do not look like natural images, results on image generation and the ability of models to correct these generated images indicate that precise modeling of strings can teach language models about numerous aspects of the visual world.

    "abstract": "Visible-infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID) is challenging due to the significant cross-modality discrepancies between visible and infrared images. While existing methods have focused on designing complex network architectures or using metric learning constraints to learn modality-invariant features, they often overlook which specific component of the image causes the modality discrepancy problem. In this paper, we first reveal that the difference in the amplitude component of visible and infrared images is the primary factor that causes the modality discrepancy and further propose a novel Frequency Domain modality-invariant feature learning framework (FDMNet) to reduce modality discrepancy from the frequency domain perspective. Our framework introduces two novel modules, namely the Instance-Adaptive Amplitude Filter (IAF) module and the Phrase-Preserving Normalization (PPNorm) module, to enhance the modality-invariant amplitude component and suppress the modality-specific component at both the image- and feature-levels. Extensive experimental results on two standard benchmarks, SYSU-MM01 and RegDB, demonstrate the superior performance of our FDMNet against state-of-the-art methods",

    "abstract": "Most existing video diffusion models (VDMs) are limited to mere text conditions. Thereby, they are usually lacking in control over visual appearance and geometry structure of the generated videos. This work presents Moonshot, a new video generation model that conditions simultaneously on multimodal inputs of image and text. The model builts upon a core module, called multimodal video block (MVB), which consists of conventional spatialtemporal layers for representing video features, and a decoupled cross-attention layer to address image and text inputs for appearance conditioning. In addition, we carefully design the model architecture such that it can optionally integrate with pre-trained image ControlNet modules for geometry visual conditions, without needing of extra training overhead as opposed to prior methods. Experiments show that with versatile multimodal conditioning mechanisms, Moonshot demonstrates significant improvement on visual quality and temporal consistency compared to existing models. In addition, the model can be easily repurposed for a variety of generative applications, such as personalized video generation, image animation and video editing, unveiling its potential to serve as a fundamental architecture for controllable video generation.

    "abstract": "Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) have become a transformative technology that can change our daily life. Currently, millimeter-wave (mmWave) bands are identified as the promising CAV connectivity solution. While it can provide high data rate, their realization faces many challenges such as high attenuation during mmWave signal propagation and mobility management. Existing solution has to initiate pilot signal to measure channel information, then apply signal processing to calculate the best narrow beam towards the receiver end to guarantee sufficient signal power. This process takes significant overhead and time, hence not suitable for vehicles. In this study, we propose an autonomous and low-cost testbed to collect extensive co-located mmWave signal and other sensors data such as LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), cameras, ultrasonic, etc, traditionally for ``automated'', to facilitate mmWave vehicular communications. Intuitively, these sensors can build a 3D map around the vehicle and signal propagation path can be estimated, eliminating iterative the process via pilot signals. This multimodal data fusion, together with AI, is expected to bring significant advances in ``connected'' research",

Furthermore, we devise a language-based pipeline that exploits how-to video narration text to create weakly supervised training data. We demonstrate our idea applied to the domain of how-to cooking videos, where a user can detour from their current recipe to find steps with alternate ingredients, tools, and techniques. Validating on a ground truth annotated dataset of 16K samples, we show our model's significant improvements over best available methods for video retrieval and question answering, with recall rates exceeding the state of the art by 35%",

    "volume": "Jan",
    "abstract": "With the development of social media, rumors have been spread broadly on social media platforms, causing great harm to society. Beside textual information, many rumors also use manipulated images or conceal textual information within images to deceive people and avoid being detected, making multimodal rumor detection be a critical problem. The majority of multimodal rumor detection methods mainly concentrate on extracting features of source claims and their corresponding images, while ignoring the comments of rumors and their propagation structures. These comments and structures imply the wisdom of crowds and are proved to be crucial to debunk rumors. Moreover, these methods usually only extract visual features in a basic manner, seldom consider tampering or textual information in images. Therefore, in this study, we propose a novel Vision and Graph Fused Attention Network (VGA) for rumor detection to utilize propagation structures among posts so as to obtain the crowd opinions and further explore visual tampering features, as well as the textual information hidden in images. We conduct extensive experiments on three datasets, demonstrating that VGA can effectively detect multimodal rumors and outperform state-of-the-art methods significantly",

    "volume": "Jan",
    "abstract": "In recent years, the Vision Transformer (ViT) model has gradually become mainstream in various computer vision tasks, and the robustness of the model has received increasing attention. However, existing large models tend to prioritize performance during training, potentially neglecting the robustness, which may lead to serious security concerns. In this paper, we establish a new challenge: exploring how to use a small number of additional parameters for adversarial finetuning to quickly and effectively enhance the adversarial robustness of a standardly trained model. To address this challenge, we develop the novel LNLoRA module, incorporating a learnable layer normalization before the conventional LoRA module, which helps mitigate magnitude differences in parameters between the adversarial and standard training paradigms. Furthermore, we propose the FullLoRA-AT framework by integrating the learnable LNLoRA modules into all key components of ViT-based models while keeping the pretrained model frozen, which can significantly improve the model robustness via adversarial finetuning in a parameter-efficient manner. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Imagenette demonstrate the superiority of our proposed FullLoRA-AT framework. It achieves comparable robustness with full finetuning while only requiring about 5% of the learnable parameters. This also effectively addresses concerns regarding extra model storage space and enormous training time caused by adversarial finetuning",

    "abstract": "The attention mechanism has been proven effective on various visual tasks in recent years. In the semantic segmentation task, the attention mechanism is applied in various methods, including the case of both Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) as backbones. However, we observe that the attention mechanism is vulnerable to patch-based adversarial attacks. Through the analysis of the effective receptive field, we attribute it to the fact that the wide receptive field brought by global attention may lead to the spread of the adversarial patch. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a Robust Attention Mechanism (RAM) to improve the robustness of the semantic segmentation model, which can notably relieve the vulnerability against patch-based attacks. Compared to the vallina attention mechanism, RAM introduces two novel modules called Max Attention Suppression and Random Attention Dropout, both of which aim to refine the attention matrix and limit the influence of a single adversarial patch on the semantic segmentation results of other positions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our RAM to improve the robustness of semantic segmentation models against various patch-based attack methods under different attack settings",

    "abstract": "Images generated by most of generative models trained with limited data often exhibit deficiencies in either fidelity, diversity, or both. One effective solution to address the limitation is few-shot generative model adaption. However, the type of approaches typically rely on a large-scale pre-trained model, serving as a source domain, to facilitate information transfer to the target domain. In this paper, we propose a method called Information Transfer from the Built Geodesic Surface (ITBGS), which contains two module: Feature Augmentation on Geodesic Surface (FAGS); Interpolation and Regularization (I\\&R). With the FAGS module, a pseudo-source domain is created by projecting image features from the training dataset into the Pre-Shape Space, subsequently generating new features on the Geodesic surface. Thus, no pre-trained models is needed for the adaption process during the training of generative models with FAGS. I\\&R module are introduced for supervising the interpolated images and regularizing their relative distances, respectively, to further enhance the quality of generated images. Through qualitative and quantitative experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method consistently achieves optimal or comparable results across a diverse range of semantically distinct datasets, even in extremely few-shot scenarios",

These models with robust and aligned semantic representations learned from billions of internet image-text pairs and can be applied to various downstream tasks in a zero-shot manner. However, in some fine-grained domains like medical imaging and remote sensing, the performance of multi-modal foundation models often leaves much to be desired. Consequently, many researchers have begun to explore few-shot adaptation methods for these models, gradually deriving three main technical approaches: 1) prompt-based methods, 2) adapter-based methods, and 3) external knowledge-based methods. Nevertheless, this rapidly developing field has produced numerous results without a comprehensive survey to systematically organize the research progress. Therefore, in this survey, we introduce and analyze the research advancements in few-shot adaptation methods for multi-modal models, summarizing commonly used datasets and experimental setups, and comparing the results of different methods. In addition, due to the lack of reliable theoretical support for existing methods, we derive the few-shot adaptation generalization error bound for multi-modal models. The theorem reveals that the generalization error of multi-modal foundation models is constrained by three factors: domain gap, model capacity, and sample size. Based on this, we propose three possible solutions from the following aspects: 1) adaptive domain generalization, 2) adaptive model selection, and 3) adaptive knowledge utilization",

To test its performance, we have also collected a real-world dataset. We train detectors for both T-shirts, towels and shorts and obtain an average precision of 64.3%. Fine-tuning on real-world data improves performance to 74.2%. Additional insight is provided by discussing various failure modes of the keypoint detectors and by comparing different approaches to obtain cloth meshes and materials.

    "abstract": "The recovery of 3D human mesh from monocular images has significantly been developed in recent years. However, existing models usually ignore spatial and temporal information, which might lead to mesh and image misalignment and temporal discontinuity. For this reason, we propose a novel Spatio-Temporal Alignment Fusion (STAF) model. As a video-based model, it leverages coherence clues from human motion by an attention-based Temporal Coherence Fusion Module (TCFM). As for spatial mesh-alignment evidence, we extract fine-grained local information through predicted mesh projection on the feature maps. Based on the spatial features, we further introduce a multi-stage adjacent Spatial Alignment Fusion Module (SAFM) to enhance the feature representation of the target frame. In addition to the above, we propose an Average Pooling Module (APM) to allow the model to focus on the entire input sequence rather than just the target frame. This method can remarkably improve the smoothness of recovery results from video. Extensive experiments on 3DPW, MPII3D, and H36M demonstrate the superiority of STAF. We achieve a state-of-the-art trade-off between precision and smoothness. Our code and more video results are on the project page https://yw0208.github.io/staf/",

    "title": "Lightweight Adaptive Feature De-drifting for Compressed Image Classification",
    "volume": "Jan",
    "abstract": "JPEG is a widely used compression scheme to efficiently reduce the volume of transmitted images. The artifacts appear among blocks due to the information loss, which not only affects the quality of images but also harms the subsequent high-level tasks in terms of feature drifting. High-level vision models trained on high-quality images will suffer performance degradation when dealing with compressed images, especially on mobile devices. Numerous learning-based JPEG artifact removal methods have been proposed to handle visual artifacts. However, it is not an ideal choice to use these JPEG artifact removal methods as a pre-processing for compressed image classification for the following reasons: 1. These methods are designed for human vision rather than high-level vision models; 2. These methods are not efficient enough to serve as pre-processing on resource-constrained devices. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel lightweight AFD module to boost the performance of pre-trained image classification models when facing compressed images. First, a FDE-Net is devised to generate the spatial-wise FDM in the DCT domain. Next, the estimated FDM is transmitted to the FE-Net to generate the mapping relationship between degraded features and corresponding high-quality features. A simple but effective RepConv block equipped with structural re-parameterization is utilized in FE-Net, which enriches feature representation in the training phase while maintaining efficiency in the deployment phase. After training on limited compressed images, the AFD-Module can serve as a \"plug-and-play\" model for pre-trained classification models to improve their performance on compressed images. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed AFD module can comprehensively improve the accuracy of the pre-trained classification models and significantly outperform the existing methods",

We address the challenge of simplifying artistic typography for non-professionals by offering a dynamic, adaptive, and computationally efficient alternative to traditional rigid templates. Our approach leverages the power of LLMs to understand and interpret user input, facilitating a more intuitive design process. We demonstrate through various case studies how users can articulate their aesthetic preferences and functional requirements, which the system then translates into unique and creative typographic designs. Our evaluations indicate significant improvements in user satisfaction, design flexibility, and creative expression over existing systems. The WordArt Designer API not only democratizes the art of typography but also opens up new possibilities for personalized digital communication and design",

    "volume": "Jan",
    "abstract": "Online contextual reasoning and association across consecutive video frames are critical to perceive instances in visual tracking. However, most current top-performing trackers persistently lean on sparse temporal relationships between reference and search frames via an offline mode. Consequently, they can only interact independently within each image-pair and establish limited temporal correlations. To alleviate the above problem, we propose a simple, flexible and effective video-level tracking pipeline, named \\textbf{ODTrack}, which densely associates the contextual relationships of video frames in an online token propagation manner. ODTrack receives video frames of arbitrary length to capture the spatio-temporal trajectory relationships of an instance, and compresses the discrimination features (localization information) of a target into a token sequence to achieve frame-to-frame association. This new solution brings the following benefits: 1) the purified token sequences can serve as prompts for the inference in the next video frame, whereby past information is leveraged to guide future inference; 2) the complex online update strategies are effectively avoided by the iterative propagation of token sequences, and thus we can achieve more efficient model representation and computation. ODTrack achieves a new \\textit{SOTA} performance on seven benchmarks, while running at real-time speed. Code and models are available at \\url{https://github.com/GXNU-ZhongLab/ODTrack}",

GPS trajectory is an important data source which is used in traffic density detection, transport mode detection, mapping data inferences with the use of different methods such as image processing and machine learning methods. While the data size increases, efficient representation of this type of data is becoming difficult to be used in these methods. A common approach is the representation of GPS trajectory information such as average speed, bearing, etc. in raster image form and applying analysis methods. In this study, we evaluate GPS trajectory data rasterization using the spatial join functions of QGIS, PostGIS+QGIS, and our iterative spatial structured grid aggregation implementation coded in the Python programming language. Our implementation is also parallelizable, and this parallelization is also included as the fourth method. According to the results of experiment carried out with an example GPS trajectory dataset, QGIS method and PostGIS+QGIS method showed relatively low performance with respect to our method using the metric of total processing time. PostGIS+QGIS method achieved the best results for spatial join though its total performance decreased quickly while test area size increases. On the other hand, both of our methods' performances decrease directly proportional to GPS point. And our methods' performance can be increased proportional to the increase with the number of processor cores and/or with multiple computing clusters",

While some approaches have introduced historical frames or fuse and replace initial templates to incorporate temporal information, they have the risk of disrupting the original target appearance and accumulating errors over time. To alleviate these limitations, we propose a novel Transformer RGBT tracking approach, which mixes spatio-temporal multimodal tokens from the static multimodal templates and multimodal search regions in Transformer to handle target appearance changes, for robust RGBT tracking. We introduce independent dynamic template tokens to interact with the search region, embedding temporal information to address appearance changes, while also retaining the involvement of the initial static template tokens in the joint feature extraction process to ensure the preservation of the original reliable target appearance information that prevent deviations from the target appearance caused by traditional temporal updates. We also use attention mechanisms to enhance the target features of multimodal template tokens by incorporating supplementary modal cues, and make the multimodal search region tokens interact with multimodal dynamic template tokens via attention mechanisms, which facilitates the conveyance of multimodal-enhanced target change information. Our module is inserted into the transformer backbone network and inherits joint feature extraction, search-template matching, and cross-modal interaction. Extensive experiments on three RGBT benchmark datasets show that the proposed approach maintains competitive performance compared to other state-of-the-art tracking algorithms while running at 39.1 FPS",

AIGCBench tackles the limitations of existing benchmarks, which suffer from a lack of diverse datasets, by including a varied and open-domain image-text dataset that evaluates different state-of-the-art algorithms under equivalent conditions. We employ a novel text combiner and GPT-4 to create rich text prompts, which are then used to generate images via advanced Text-to-Image models. To establish a unified evaluation framework for video generation tasks, our benchmark includes 11 metrics spanning four dimensions to assess algorithm performance. These dimensions are control-video alignment, motion effects, temporal consistency, and video quality. These metrics are both reference video-dependent and video-free, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation strategy. The evaluation standard proposed correlates well with human judgment, providing insights into the strengths and weaknesses of current I2V algorithms. The findings from our extensive experiments aim to stimulate further research and development in the I2V field.

Existing approaches for SFDA focus on self-training usually including well-established entropy minimization and pseudo-labeling techniques. Recent work suggested a co-learning strategy to improve the quality of the generated target pseudo-labels using robust pretrained networks such as Swin-B. However, since the generated pseudo-labels depend on the source model, they may be noisy due to domain shift. In this paper, we view SFDA from the perspective of label noise learning and learn to de-confuse the pseudo-labels. More specifically, we learn a noise transition matrix of the pseudo-labels to capture the label corruption of each class and learn the underlying true label distribution. Estimating the noise transition matrix enables a better true class-posterior estimation results with better prediction accuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach applied with several SFDA methods: SHOT, SHOT++, and AaD.

We propose SIGNeRF, a novel approach for fast and controllable NeRF scene editing and scene-integrated object generation. A new generative update strategy ensures 3D consistency across the edited images, without requiring iterative optimization. We find that depth-conditioned diffusion models inherently possess the capability to generate 3D consistent views by requesting a grid of images instead of single views. Based on these insights, we introduce a multi-view reference sheet of modified images. Our method updates an image collection consistently based on the reference sheet and refines the original NeRF with the newly generated image set in one go. By exploiting the depth conditioning mechanism of the image diffusion model, we gain fine control over the spatial location of the edit and enforce shape guidance by a selected region or an external mesh",

    "abstract": "Multimodal learning significantly benefits cancer survival prediction, especially the integration of pathological images and genomic data. Despite advantages of multimodal learning for cancer survival prediction, massive redundancy in multimodal data prevents it from extracting discriminative and compact information: (1) An extensive amount of intra-modal task-unrelated information blurs discriminability, especially for gigapixel whole slide images (WSIs) with many patches in pathology and thousands of pathways in genomic data, leading to an ``intra-modal redundancy\" issue. (2) Duplicated information among modalities dominates the representation of multimodal data, which makes modality-specific information prone to being ignored, resulting in an ``inter-modal redundancy\" issue. To address these, we propose a new framework, Prototypical Information Bottlenecking and Disentangling (PIBD), consisting of Prototypical Information Bottleneck (PIB) module for intra-modal redundancy and Prototypical Information Disentanglement (PID) module for inter-modal redundancy. Specifically, a variant of information bottleneck, PIB, is proposed to model prototypes approximating a bunch of instances for different risk levels, which can be used for selection of discriminative instances within modality. PID module decouples entangled multimodal data into compact distinct components: modality-common and modality-specific knowledge, under the guidance of the joint prototypical distribution.

While the amodal segmentation task is to predict the complete mask of partially occluded objects, it is time-consuming and labor-intensive to annotate the pixel-level ground truth amodal masks. Box-level supervised amodal segmentation addresses this challenge by relying solely on ground truth bounding boxes and instance classes as supervision, thereby alleviating the need for exhaustive pixel-level annotations. Nevertheless, current box-level methodologies encounter limitations in generating low-resolution masks and imprecise boundaries, failing to meet the demands of practical real-world applications. We present a novel solution to tackle this problem by introducing a directed expansion approach from visible masks to corresponding amodal masks. Our approach involves a hybrid end-to-end network based on the overlapping region - the area where different instances intersect. Diverse segmentation strategies are applied for overlapping regions and non-overlapping regions according to distinct characteristics. To guide the expansion of visible masks, we introduce an elaborately-designed connectivity loss for overlapping regions, which leverages correlations with visible masks and facilitates accurate amodal segmentation.

In this work, we explore the potential of LMMs like GPT-4V as a generalist web agent that can follow natural language instructions to complete tasks on any given website. We propose SEEACT, a generalist web agent that harnesses the power of LMMs for integrated visual understanding and acting on the web. We evaluate on the recent MIND2WEB benchmark. In addition to standard offline evaluation on cached websites, we enable a new online evaluation setting by developing a tool that allows running web agents on live websites. We show that GPT-4V presents a great potential for web agents - it can successfully complete 50% of the tasks on live websites if we manually ground its textual plans into actions on the websites. This substantially outperforms text-only LLMs like GPT-4 or smaller models (FLAN-T5 and BLIP-2) specifically fine-tuned for web agents. However, grounding still remains a major challenge. Existing LMM grounding strategies like set-of-mark prompting turns out not effective for web agents, and the best grounding strategy we develop in this paper leverages both the HTML text and visuals.

Existing studies solely relied on pure visual networks, while in this paper we solved FSCIL by leveraging the Vision-Language model (e.g., CLIP) and propose a simple yet effective framework, named Learning Prompt with Distribution-based Feature Replay (LP-DiF). We observe that simply using CLIP for zero-shot evaluation can substantially outperform the most influential methods. Then, prompt tuning technique is involved to further improve its adaptation ability, allowing the model to continually capture specific knowledge from each session. To prevent the learnable prompt from forgetting old knowledge in the new session, we propose a pseudo-feature replay approach. Specifically, we preserve the old knowledge of each class by maintaining a feature-level Gaussian distribution with a diagonal covariance matrix, which is estimated by the image features of training images and synthesized features generated from a VAE. When progressing to a new session, pseudo-features are sampled from old-class distributions combined with training images of the current session to optimize the prompt, thus enabling the model to learn new knowledge while retaining old knowledge. Experiments on three prevalent benchmarks, i.e., CIFAR100, mini-ImageNet, CUB-200, and two more challenging benchmarks, i.e., SUN-397 and CUB-200$^*$ proposed in this paper showcase the superiority of LP-DiF, achieving new state-of-the-art (SOTA) in FSCIL.

This paper aims to enhance the data efficiency by introducing multiple-to-multiple local relationship modeling to capture denser supervisions. More specifically, we propose a Medical Language-Image Pre-training (MLIP) framework, which exploits the limited image-text medical data more efficiently through patch-sentence matching. Furthermore, we introduce a masked contrastive learning strategy with semantic integrity estimation to reduce redundancy in images while preserving the underlying semantics. Our evaluation results show that MLIP outperforms previous work in zero/few-shot classification and few-shot segmentation tasks by a large margin",

    "volume": "Jan",
    "abstract": "The elderly population is increasing rapidly around the world. There are no enough caretakers for them. Use of AI-based in-home medical care systems is gaining momentum due to this. Human fall detection is one of the most important tasks of medical care system for the aged people. Human fall is a common problem among elderly people. Detection of a fall and providing medical help as early as possible is very important to reduce any further complexity. The chances of death and other medical complications can be reduced by detecting and providing medical help as early as possible after the fall. There are many state-of-the-art fall detection techniques available these days, but the majority of them need very high computing power. In this paper, we proposed a lightweight and fast human fall detection system using pose estimation. We used `Movenet' for human joins key-points extraction. Our proposed method can work in real-time on any low-computing device with any basic camera. All computation can be processed locally, so there is no problem of privacy of the subject. We used two datasets `GMDCSA' and `URFD' for the experiment. We got the sensitivity value of 0.9375 and 0.9167 for the dataset `GMDCSA' and `URFD' respectively. The source code and the dataset GMDCSA of our work are available online to access",

    "abstract": "The development of multi-modal medical foundation models has attracted significant attention in the field of medicine and healthcare due to their promising prospects in various clinical applications. One area of focus in this research direction is the extractions of features at different scales. While previous studies have explored feature learning at individual scales, investigation on integrating the diverse scales and modalities of information is lacking, which may hinder the potential for mutual reinforcement among these features. This paper aims to bridge this gap by proposing a method that effectively exploits multi-scale and cross-modality information to enhance the performance of medical foundation models. The proposed method simultaneously exploit features at the local, instance, modality and global aspects, facilitating comprehensive representation learning within the models.

    "volume": "Jan",
    "abstract": "Spatio-temporal video grounding (or STVG) task aims at locating a spatio-temporal tube for a specific instance given a text query. Despite advancements, current methods easily suffer the distractors or heavy object appearance variations in videos due to insufficient object information from the text, leading to degradation. Addressing this, we propose a novel framework, context-guided STVG (CG-STVG), which mines discriminative instance context for object in videos and applies it as a supplementary guidance for target localization. The key of CG-STVG lies in two specially designed modules, including instance context generation (ICG), which focuses on discovering visual context information (in both appearance and motion) of the instance, and instance context refinement (ICR), which aims to improve the instance context from ICG by eliminating irrelevant or even harmful information from the context. During grounding, ICG, together with ICR, are deployed at each decoding stage of a Transformer architecture for instance context learning. Particularly, instance context learned from one decoding stage is fed to the next stage, and leveraged as a guidance containing rich and discriminative object feature to enhance the target-awareness in decoding feature, which conversely benefits generating better new instance context for improving localization finally. Compared to existing methods, CG-STVG enjoys object information in text query and guidance from mined instance visual context for more accurate target localization. In our experiments on three benchmarks, including HCSTVG-v1/-v2 and VidSTG, CG-STVG sets new state-of-the-arts in m_tIoU and m_vIoU on all of them, showing its efficacy.

    "abstract": "Despite the recent remarkable achievement in gaze estimation, efficient and accurate personalization of gaze estimation without labels is a practical problem but rarely touched on in the literature. To achieve efficient personalization, we take inspiration from the recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) by updating a negligible number of parameters, \"prompts\", at the test time. Specifically, the prompt is additionally attached without perturbing original network and can contain less than 1% of a ResNet-18's parameters. Our experiments show high efficiency of the prompt tuning approach. The proposed one can be 10 times faster in terms of adaptation speed than the methods compared. However, it is non-trivial to update the prompt for personalized gaze estimation without labels. At the test time, it is essential to ensure that the minimizing of particular unsupervised loss leads to the goals of minimizing gaze estimation error. To address this difficulty, we propose to meta-learn the prompt to ensure that its updates align with the goal. Our experiments show that the meta-learned prompt can be effectively adapted even with a simple symmetry loss. In addition, we experiment on four cross-dataset validations to show the remarkable advantages of the proposed method",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the task of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) visual geo-localization, which aims to match images of the same geographic target taken by different platforms, i.e., UAVs and satellites. In general, the key to achieving accurate UAV-satellite image matching lies in extracting visual features that are robust against viewpoint changes, scale variations, and rotations. Current works have shown that part matching is crucial for UAV visual geo-localization since part-level representations can capture image details and help to understand the semantic information of scenes. However, the importance of preserving semantic characteristics in part-level representations is not well discussed. In this paper, we introduce a transformer-based adaptive semantic aggregation method that regards parts as the most representative semantics in an image. Correlations of image patches to different parts are learned in terms of the transformer's feature map. Then our method decomposes part-level features into an adaptive sum of all patch features. By doing this, the learned parts are encouraged to focus on patches with typical semantics. Extensive experiments on the University-1652 dataset have shown the superiority of our method over the current works",

    "volume": "Jan",
    "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) visual geo-localization aims to match images of the same geographic target captured from different views, i.e., the UAV view and the satellite view. It is very challenging due to the large appearance differences in UAV-satellite image pairs. Previous works map images captured by UAVs and satellites to a shared feature space and employ a classification framework to learn location-dependent features while neglecting the overall distribution shift between the UAV view and the satellite view. In this paper, we address these limitations by introducing distribution alignment of the two views to shorten their distance in a common space. Specifically, we propose an end-to-end network, called PVDA (Progressive View Distribution Alignment). During training, feature encoder, location classifier, and view discriminator are jointly optimized by a novel progressive adversarial learning strategy. Competition between feature encoder and view discriminator prompts both of them to be stronger. It turns out that the adversarial learning is progressively emphasized until UAV-view images are indistinguishable from satellite-view images. As a result, the proposed PVDA becomes powerful in learning location-dependent yet view-invariant features with good scalability towards unseen images of new locations. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, the proposed PVDA requires less inference time but has achieved superior performance on the University-1652 dataset",

Nonetheless, a prevailing trend among existing methods has been the employment of linear combinations of basic LUTs to formulate image-adaptive LUTs, which limits the generalization ability of these methods. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework named AttentionLut for real-time image enhancement, which utilizes the attention mechanism to generate image-adaptive LUTs. Our proposed framework consists of three lightweight modules. We begin by employing the global image context feature module to extract image-adaptive features. Subsequently, the attention fusion module integrates the image feature with the priori attention feature obtained during training to generate image-adaptive canonical polyadic tensors. Finally, the canonical polyadic reconstruction module is deployed to reconstruct image-adaptive residual 3DLUT, which is subsequently utilized for enhancing input images.

One bottleneck faced by existing late fusion methods is that they are usually aligned to the average kernel function, which makes the clustering performance highly dependent on the quality of datasets. Another problem is that they require subsequent k-means clustering after obtaining the consensus partition matrix to get the final discrete labels, and the resulting separation of the label learning and cluster structure optimization processes limits the integrity of these models. To address the above issues, we propose an integrated framework named One-Step Late Fusion Multi-view Clustering with Compressed Subspace (OS-LFMVC-CS). Specifically, we use the consensus subspace to align the partition matrix while optimizing the partition fusion, and utilize the fused partition matrix to guide the learning of discrete labels.

    "abstract": "Multi-modal Learning has attracted widespread attention in medical image analysis. Using multi-modal data, whole slide images (WSIs) and clinical information, can improve the performance of deep learning models in the diagnosis of axillary lymph node metastasis. However, clinical information is not easy to collect in clinical practice due to privacy concerns, limited resources, lack of interoperability, etc. Although patient selection can ensure the training set to have multi-modal data for model development, missing modality of clinical information can appear during test. This normally leads to performance degradation, which limits the use of multi-modal models in the clinic. To alleviate this problem, we propose a bidirectional distillation framework consisting of a multi-modal branch and a single-modal branch. The single-modal branch acquires the complete multi-modal knowledge from the multi-modal branch, while the multi-modal learns the robust features of WSI from the single-modal. We conduct experiments on a public dataset of Lymph Node Metastasis in Early Breast Cancer to validate the method. Our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art performance with an AUC of 0.861 on the test set without missing data, but also yields an AUC of 0.842 when the rate of missing modality is 80\\%. This shows the effectiveness of the approach in dealing with multi-modal data and missing modality.

    "abstract": "Point cloud completion is an indispensable task for recovering complete point clouds due to incompleteness caused by occlusion, limited sensor resolution, etc. The family of coarse-to-fine generation architectures has recently exhibited great success in point cloud completion and gradually became mainstream. In this work, we unveil one of the key ingredients behind these methods: meticulously devised feature extraction operations with explicit cross-resolution aggregation. We present Cross-Resolution Transformer that efficiently performs cross-resolution aggregation with local attention mechanisms. With the help of our recursive designs, the proposed operation can capture more scales of features than common aggregation operations, which is beneficial for capturing fine geometric characteristics. While prior methodologies have ventured into various manifestations of inter-level cross-resolution aggregation, the effectiveness of intra-level one and their combination has not been analyzed. With unified designs, Cross-Resolution Transformer can perform intra- or inter-level cross-resolution aggregation by switching inputs. We integrate two forms of Cross-Resolution Transformers into one up-sampling block for point generation, and following the coarse-to-fine manner, we construct CRA-PCN to incrementally predict complete shapes with stacked up-sampling blocks.

    "volume": "Jan",
    "abstract": "Quantization is of significance for compressing the over-parameterized deep neural models and deploying them on resource-limited devices. Fixed-precision quantization suffers from performance drop due to the limited numerical representation ability. Conversely, mixed-precision quantization (MPQ) is advocated to compress the model effectively by allocating heterogeneous bit-width for layers. MPQ is typically organized into a searching-retraining two-stage process. Previous works only focus on determining the optimal bit-width configuration in the first stage efficiently, while ignoring the considerable time costs in the second stage. However, retraining always consumes hundreds of GPU-hours on the cutting-edge GPUs, thus hindering deployment efficiency significantly. In this paper, we devise a one-shot training-searching paradigm for mixed-precision model compression. Specifically, in the first stage, all potential bit-width configurations are coupled and thus optimized simultaneously within a set of shared weights. However, our observations reveal a previously unseen and severe bit-width interference phenomenon among highly coupled weights during optimization, leading to considerable performance degradation under a high compression ratio. To tackle this problem, we first design a bit-width scheduler to dynamically freeze the most turbulent bit-width of layers during training, to ensure the rest bit-widths converged properly. Then, taking inspiration from information theory, we present an information distortion mitigation technique to align the behaviour of the bad-performing bit-widths to the well-performing ones",

Despite the recent success of large vision language models in many multi-modal tasks, complex situation reasoning over videos involving multiple human-object interaction events still remains challenging. In contrast, humans can easily tackle it by using a series of episode memories as anchors to quickly locate question-related key moments for reasoning. To mimic this effective reasoning strategy, we propose the Glance-Focus model. One simple way is to apply an action detection model to predict a set of actions as key memories. However, these actions within a closed set vocabulary are hard to generalize to various video domains. Instead of that, we train an Encoder-Decoder to generate a set of dynamic event memories at the glancing stage. Apart from using supervised bipartite matching to obtain the event memories, we further design an unsupervised memory generation method to get rid of dependence on event annotations. Next, at the focusing stage, these event memories act as a bridge to establish the correlation between the questions with high-level event concepts and low-level lengthy video content. Given the question, the model first focuses on the generated key event memory, then focuses on the most relevant moment for reasoning through our designed multi-level cross-attention mechanism. We conduct extensive experiments on four Multi-Event VideoQA benchmarks including STAR, EgoTaskQA, AGQA, and NExT-QA.

    "title": "LORE++: Logical Location Regression Network for Table Structure Recognition with Pre-training",
    "volume": "Jan",
    "abstract": "Table structure recognition (TSR) aims at extracting tables in images into machine-understandable formats. Recent methods solve this problem by predicting the adjacency relations of detected cell boxes or learning to directly generate the corresponding markup sequences from the table images. However, existing approaches either count on additional heuristic rules to recover the table structures, or face challenges in capturing long-range dependencies within tables, resulting in increased complexity. In this paper, we propose an alternative paradigm. We model TSR as a logical location regression problem and propose a new TSR framework called LORE, standing for LOgical location REgression network, which for the first time regresses logical location as well as spatial location of table cells in a unified network. Our proposed LORE is conceptually simpler, easier to train, and more accurate than other paradigms of TSR. Moreover, inspired by the persuasive success of pre-trained models on a number of computer vision and natural language processing tasks, we propose two pre-training tasks to enrich the spatial and logical representations at the feature level of LORE, resulting in an upgraded version called LORE++. The incorporation of pre-training in LORE++ has proven to enjoy significant advantages, leading to a substantial enhancement in terms of accuracy, generalization, and few-shot capability compared to its predecessor. Experiments on standard benchmarks against methods of previous paradigms demonstrate the superiority of LORE++, which highlights the potential and promising prospect of the logical location regression paradigm for TSR",

    "volume": "Jan",
    "abstract": "Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative tools, rivaling GANs in sample quality and mirroring the likelihood scores of autoregressive models. A subset of these models, exemplified by DDIMs, exhibit an inherent asymmetry: they are trained over $T$ steps but only sample from a subset of $T$ during generation. This selective sampling approach, though optimized for speed, inadvertently misses out on vital information from the unsampled steps, leading to potential compromises in sample quality. To address this issue, we present the S$^{2}$-DMs, which is a new training method by using an innovative $L_{skip}$, meticulously designed to reintegrate the information omitted during the selective sampling phase. The benefits of this approach are manifold: it notably enhances sample quality, is exceptionally simple to implement, requires minimal code modifications, and is flexible enough to be compatible with various sampling algorithms. On the CIFAR10 dataset, models trained using our algorithm showed an improvement of 3.27% to 14.06% over models trained with traditional methods across various sampling algorithms (DDIMs, PNDMs, DEIS) and different numbers of sampling steps (10, 20, ..., 1000). On the CELEBA dataset, the improvement ranged from 8.97% to 27.08%. Access to the code and additional resources is provided in the github",

    "title": "Answering from Sure to Uncertain: Uncertainty-Aware Curriculum Learning for Video Question Answering",
    "volume": "Jan",
    "abstract": "While significant advancements have been made in video question answering (VideoQA), the potential benefits of enhancing model generalization through tailored difficulty scheduling have been largely overlooked in existing research. This paper seeks to bridge that gap by incorporating VideoQA into a curriculum learning (CL) framework that progressively trains models from simpler to more complex data. Recognizing that conventional self-paced CL methods rely on training loss for difficulty measurement, which might not accurately reflect the intricacies of video-question pairs, we introduce the concept of uncertainty-aware CL. Here, uncertainty serves as the guiding principle for dynamically adjusting the difficulty. Furthermore, we address the challenge posed by uncertainty by presenting a probabilistic modeling approach for VideoQA. Specifically, we conceptualize VideoQA as a stochastic computation graph, where the hidden representations are treated as stochastic variables. This yields two distinct types of uncertainty: one related to the inherent uncertainty in the data and another pertaining to the model's confidence. In practice, we seamlessly integrate the VideoQA model into our framework and conduct comprehensive experiments. The findings affirm that our approach not only achieves enhanced performance but also effectively quantifies uncertainty in the context of VideoQA",

    "abstract": "Reasoning over sports videos for question answering is an important task with numerous applications, such as player training and information retrieval. However, this task has not been explored due to the lack of relevant datasets and the challenging nature it presents. Most datasets for video question answering (VideoQA) focus mainly on general and coarse-grained understanding of daily-life videos, which is not applicable to sports scenarios requiring professional action understanding and fine-grained motion analysis. In this paper, we introduce the first dataset, named Sports-QA, specifically designed for the sports VideoQA task. The Sports-QA dataset includes various types of questions, such as descriptions, chronologies, causalities, and counterfactual conditions, covering multiple sports. Furthermore, to address the characteristics of the sports VideoQA task, we propose a new Auto-Focus Transformer (AFT) capable of automatically focusing on particular scales of temporal information for question answering. We conduct extensive experiments on Sports-QA, including baseline studies and the evaluation of different methods. The results demonstrate that our AFT achieves state-of-the-art performance",

    "volume": "Jan",
    "abstract": "Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy, and accurately distinguishing between benign and malignant thyroid tumors is crucial for developing effective treatment plans in clinical practice. Pathologically, thyroid tumors pose diagnostic challenges due to improper specimen sampling. In this study, we have designed a three-stage model using representation learning to integrate pixel-level and slice-level annotations for distinguishing thyroid tumors. This structure includes a pathology structure recognition method to predict structures related to thyroid tumors, an encoder-decoder network to extract pixel-level annotation information by learning the feature representations of image blocks, and an attention-based learning mechanism for the final classification task. This mechanism learns the importance of different image blocks in a pathological region, globally considering the information from each block. In the third stage, all information from the image blocks in a region is aggregated using attention mechanisms, followed by classification to determine the category of the region. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can predict microscopic structures more accurately. After color-coding, the method achieves results on unstained pathology slides that approximate the quality of Hematoxylin and eosin staining, reducing the need for stained pathology slides. Furthermore, by leveraging the concept of indirect measurement and extracting polarized features from structures correlated with lesions, the proposed method can also classify samples where membrane structures cannot be obtained through sampling, providing a potential objective and highly accurate indirect diagnostic technique for thyroid tumors",

    "volume": "Jan",
    "abstract": "Existing object recognition models have been shown to lack robustness in diverse geographical scenarios due to significant domain shifts in design and context. Class representations need to be adapted to more accurately reflect an object concept under these shifts. In the absence of training data from target geographies, we hypothesize that geography-specific descriptive knowledge of object categories can be leveraged to enhance robustness. For this purpose, we explore the feasibility of probing a large-language model for geography-specific object knowledge, and we investigate integrating knowledge in zero-shot and learnable soft prompting with the CLIP vision-language model. In particular, we propose a geography knowledge regularization method to ensure that soft prompts trained on a source set of geographies generalize to an unseen target set of geographies. Our gains on DollarStreet when generalizing from a model trained only on data from Europe are as large as +2.8 on countries from Africa, and +4.6 on the hardest classes. We further show competitive performance vs. few-shot target training, and provide insights into how descriptive knowledge captures geographical differences",

    "volume": "Jan",
    "abstract": "Vision transformers (ViTs) have achieved promising results on a variety of Computer Vision tasks, however their quadratic complexity in the number of input tokens has limited their application specially in resource-constrained settings. Previous approaches that employ gradual token reduction to address this challenge assume that token redundancy in one layer implies redundancy in all the following layers. We empirically demonstrate that this assumption is often not correct, i.e., tokens that are redundant in one layer can be useful in later layers. We employ this key insight to propose a novel token propagation controller (TPC) that incorporates two different token-distributions, i.e., pause probability and restart probability to control the reduction and reuse of tokens respectively, which results in more efficient token utilization. To improve the estimates of token distributions, we propose a smoothing mechanism that acts as a regularizer and helps remove noisy outliers. Furthermore, to improve the training-stability of our proposed TPC, we introduce a model stabilizer that is able to implicitly encode local image structures and minimize accuracy fluctuations during model training. We present extensive experimental results on the ImageNet-1K dataset using DeiT, LV-ViT and Swin models to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. For example, compared to baseline models, our proposed method improves the inference speed of the DeiT-S by 250% while increasing the classification accuracy by 1.0%",

    "volume": "Jan",
    "abstract": "DSLR cameras can achieve multiple zoom levels via shifting lens distances or swapping lens types. However, these techniques are not possible on smartphone devices due to space constraints. Most smartphone manufacturers adopt a hybrid zoom system: commonly a Wide (W) camera at a low zoom level and a Telephoto (T) camera at a high zoom level. To simulate zoom levels between W and T, these systems crop and digitally upsample images from W, leading to significant detail loss. In this paper, we propose an efficient system for hybrid zoom super-resolution on mobile devices, which captures a synchronous pair of W and T shots and leverages machine learning models to align and transfer details from T to W. We further develop an adaptive blending method that accounts for depth-of-field mismatches, scene occlusion, flow uncertainty, and alignment errors. To minimize the domain gap, we design a dual-phone camera rig to capture real-world inputs and ground-truths for supervised training. Our method generates a 12-megapixel image in 500ms on a mobile platform and compares favorably against state-of-the-art methods under extensive evaluation on real-world scenarios",

We investigate three critical aspects of reference-based diffusion models: the shortcomings compared to text-based counterparts, the training strategies, and the capability in zero-shot, sequential text-based manipulation. We introduce two variations of an image-guided latent diffusion model using different image tokens from the pre-trained CLIP image encoder, and we propose corresponding manipulation methods to adjust their results sequentially using weighted text inputs.

Recent advancements have introduced graph-based and transformer-based methods to improve performance and capture label dependencies.

In this paper, we propose Probabilistic Multi-label Contrastive Learning (ProbMCL), a novel framework to address these challenges in multi-label image classification tasks. Our simple yet effective approach employs supervised contrastive learning, in which samples that share enough labels with an anchor image based on a decision threshold are introduced as a positive set. This structure captures label dependencies by pulling positive pair embeddings together and pushing away negative samples that fall below the threshold. We enhance representation learning by incorporating a mixture density network into contrastive learning and generating Gaussian mixture distributions to explore the epistemic uncertainty of the feature encoder. We validate the effectiveness of our framework through experimentation with datasets from the computer vision and medical imaging domains. Our method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods while achieving a low computational footprint on both datasets.

    "title": "Indoor Obstacle Discovery on Reflective Ground via Monocular Camera",
    "volume": "Jan",
    "abstract": "Visual obstacle discovery is a key step towards autonomous navigation of indoor mobile robots. Successful solutions have many applications in multiple scenes. One of the exceptions is the reflective ground. In this case, the reflections on the floor resemble the true world, which confuses the obstacle discovery and leaves navigation unsuccessful. We argue that the key to this problem lies in obtaining discriminative features for reflections and obstacles. Note that obstacle and reflection can be separated by the ground plane in 3D space. With this observation, we firstly introduce a pre-calibration based ground detection scheme that uses robot motion to predict the ground plane. Due to the immunity of robot motion to reflection, this scheme avoids failed ground detection caused by reflection. Given the detected ground, we design a ground-pixel parallax to describe the location of a pixel relative to the ground. Based on this, a unified appearance-geometry feature representation is proposed to describe objects inside rectangular boxes. Eventually, based on segmenting by detection framework, an appearance-geometry fusion regressor is designed to utilize the proposed feature to discover the obstacles. It also prevents our model from concentrating too much on parts of obstacles instead of whole obstacles. For evaluation, we introduce a new dataset for Obstacle on Reflective Ground (ORG), which comprises 15 scenes with various ground reflections, a total of more than 200 image sequences and 3400 RGB images. The pixel-wise annotations of ground and obstacle provide a comparison to our method and other methods. By reducing the misdetection of the reflection, the proposed approach outperforms others.

Learning-based LiDAR semantic segmentation utilizes machine learning techniques to automatically classify objects and regions in LiDAR point clouds. Learning-based models struggle in off-road environments due to the presence of diverse objects with varying colors, textures, and undefined boundaries, which can lead to difficulties in accurately classifying and segmenting objects using traditional geometric-based features. In this paper, we address this problem by harnessing the LiDAR intensity parameter to enhance object segmentation in off-road environments. Our approach was evaluated in the RELLIS-3D data set and yielded promising results as a preliminary analysis with improved mIoU for classes \"puddle\" and \"grass\" compared to more complex deep learning-based benchmarks. The methodology was evaluated for compatibility across both Velodyne and Ouster LiDAR systems, assuring its cross-platform applicability.

    "abstract": "This paper aims to tackle the problem of modeling dynamic urban street scenes from monocular videos. Recent methods extend NeRF by incorporating tracked vehicle poses to animate vehicles, enabling photo-realistic view synthesis of dynamic urban street scenes. However, significant limitations are their slow training and rendering speed, coupled with the critical need for high precision in tracked vehicle poses. We introduce Street Gaussians, a new explicit scene representation that tackles all these limitations. Specifically, the dynamic urban street is represented as a set of point clouds equipped with semantic logits and 3D Gaussians, each associated with either a foreground vehicle or the background. To model the dynamics of foreground object vehicles, each object point cloud is optimized with optimizable tracked poses, along with a dynamic spherical harmonics model for the dynamic appearance. The explicit representation allows easy composition of object vehicles and background, which in turn allows for scene editing operations and rendering at 133 FPS (1066$\\times$1600 resolution) within half an hour of training. The proposed method is evaluated on multiple challenging benchmarks, including KITTI and Waymo Open datasets. Experiments show that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all datasets. Furthermore, the proposed representation delivers performance on par with that achieved using precise ground-truth poses, despite relying only on poses from an off-the-shelf tracker.

    "abstract": "Manual delineation of tumor regions from magnetic resonance (MR) images is time-consuming, requires an expert, and is prone to human error. In recent years, deep learning models have been the go-to approach for the segmentation of brain tumors. U-Net and its' variants for semantic segmentation of medical images have achieved good results in the literature. However, U-Net and its' variants tend to over-segment tumor regions and may not accurately segment the tumor edges. The edges of the tumor are as important as the tumor regions for accurate diagnosis, surgical precision, and treatment planning. In the proposed work, the authors aim to extract edges from the ground truth using a derivative-like filter followed by edge reconstruction to obtain an edge ground truth in addition to the brain tumor ground truth. Utilizing both ground truths, the author studies several U-Net and its' variant architectures with and without tumor edges ground truth as a target along with the tumor ground truth for brain tumor segmentation. The author used the BraTS2020 benchmark dataset to perform the study and the results are tabulated for the dice and Hausdorff95 metrics. The mean and median metrics are calculated for the whole tumor (WT), tumor core (TC), and enhancing tumor (ET) regions. Compared to the baseline U-Net and its variants, the models that learned edges along with the tumor regions performed well in core tumor regions in both training and validation datasets. The improved performance of edge-trained models trained on baseline models like U-Net and V-Net achieved performance similar to baseline state-of-the-art models like Swin U-Net and hybrid MR-U-Net. The edge-target trained models are capable of generating edge maps that can be useful for treatment planning. Additionally, for further explainability of the results, the activation map generated by the hybrid MR-U-Net has been studied",

    "volume": "Jan",
    "abstract": "Channel modeling is fundamental in advancing wireless systems and has thus attracted considerable research focus. Recent trends have seen a growing reliance on data-driven techniques to facilitate the modeling process and yield accurate channel predictions. In this work, we first provide a concise overview of data-driven channel modeling methods, highlighting their limitations. Subsequently, we introduce the concept and advantages of physics-informed neural network (PINN)-based modeling and a summary of recent contributions in this area. Our findings demonstrate that PINN-based approaches in channel modeling exhibit promising attributes such as generalizability, interpretability, and robustness. We offer a comprehensive architecture for PINN methodology, designed to inform and inspire future model development. A case-study of our recent work on precise indoor channel prediction with semantic segmentation and deep learning is presented.

    "title": "A Comprehensive Study of Knowledge Editing for Large Language Models",
    "volume": "Jan",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown extraordinary capabilities in understanding and generating text that closely mirrors human communication. However, a primary limitation lies in the significant computational demands during training, arising from their extensive parameterization. This challenge is further intensified by the dynamic nature of the world, necessitating frequent updates to LLMs to correct outdated information or integrate new knowledge, thereby ensuring their continued relevance. Note that many applications demand continual model adjustments post-training to address deficiencies or undesirable behaviors. There is an increasing interest in efficient, lightweight methods for on-the-fly model modifications. To this end, recent years have seen a burgeoning in the techniques of knowledge editing for LLMs, which aim to efficiently modify LLMs' behaviors within specific domains while preserving overall performance across various inputs. In this paper, we first define the knowledge editing problem and then provide a comprehensive review of cutting-edge approaches. Drawing inspiration from educational and cognitive research theories, we propose a unified categorization criterion that classifies knowledge editing methods into three groups: resorting to external knowledge, merging knowledge into the model, and editing intrinsic knowledge. Furthermore, we introduce a new benchmark, KnowEdit, for a comprehensive empirical evaluation of representative knowledge editing approaches. Additionally, we provide an in-depth analysis of knowledge location, which can provide a deeper understanding of the knowledge structures inherent within LLMs. Finally, we discuss several potential applications of knowledge editing, outlining its broad and impactful implications",

    "abstract": "Vector quantization-based image semantic communication systems have successfully boosted transmission efficiency, but face a challenge with conflicting requirements between codebook design and digital constellation modulation. Traditional codebooks need a wide index range, while modulation favors few discrete states. To address this, we propose a multilevel generative semantic communication system with a two-stage training framework. In the first stage, we train a high-quality codebook, using a multi-head octonary codebook (MOC) to compress the index range. We also integrate a residual vector quantization (RVQ) mechanism for effective multilevel communication. In the second stage, a noise reduction block (NRB) based on Swin Transformer is introduced, coupled with the multilevel codebook from the first stage, serving as a high-quality semantic knowledge base (SKB) for generative feature restoration. Experimental results highlight MOC-RVQ's superior performance over methods like BPG or JPEG, even without channel error correction coding",

    "volume": "Jan",
    "abstract": "The recent innovations and breakthroughs in diffusion models have significantly expanded the possibilities of generating high-quality videos for the given prompts. Most existing works tackle the single-scene scenario with only one video event occurring in a single background. Extending to generate multi-scene videos nevertheless is not trivial and necessitates to nicely manage the logic in between while preserving the consistent visual appearance of key content across video scenes. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, namely VideoDrafter, for content-consistent multi-scene video generation. Technically, VideoDrafter leverages Large Language Models (LLM) to convert the input prompt into comprehensive multi-scene script that benefits from the logical knowledge learnt by LLM. The script for each scene includes a prompt describing the event, the foreground/background entities, as well as camera movement. VideoDrafter identifies the common entities throughout the script and asks LLM to detail each entity. The resultant entity description is then fed into a text-to-image model to generate a reference image for each entity. Finally, VideoDrafter outputs a multi-scene video by generating each scene video via a diffusion process that takes the reference images, the descriptive prompt of the event and camera movement into account. The diffusion model incorporates the reference images as the condition and alignment to strengthen the content consistency of multi-scene videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VideoDrafter outperforms the SOTA video generation models in terms of visual quality, content consistency, and user preference",

    "abstract": "The early identification of diseases in cocoa pods is an important task to guarantee the production of high-quality cocoa. The use of artificial intelligence techniques such as machine learning, computer vision and deep learning are promising solutions to help identify and classify diseases in cocoa pods. In this paper we introduce the development and evaluation of a deep learning computational model applied to the identification of diseases in cocoa pods, focusing on \"monilia\" and \"black pod\" diseases. An exhaustive review of state-of-the-art of computational models was carried out, based on scientific articles related to the identification of plant diseases using computer vision and deep learning techniques. As a result of the search, EfficientDet-Lite4, an efficient and lightweight model for object detection, was selected. A dataset, including images of both healthy and diseased cocoa pods, has been utilized to train the model to detect and pinpoint disease manifestations with considerable accuracy. Significant enhancements in the model training and evaluation demonstrate the capability of recognizing and classifying diseases through image analysis. Furthermore, the functionalities of the model were integrated into an Android native mobile with an user-friendly interface, allowing to younger or inexperienced farmers a fast and accuracy identification of health status of cocoa pods",

    "volume": "Jan",
    "abstract": "RGBT tracking has been widely used in various fields such as robotics, surveillance processing, and autonomous driving. Existing RGBT trackers fully explore the spatial information between the template and the search region and locate the target based on the appearance matching results. However, these RGBT trackers have very limited exploitation of temporal information, either ignoring temporal information or exploiting it through online sampling and training. The former struggles to cope with the object state changes, while the latter neglects the correlation between spatial and temporal information. To alleviate these limitations, we propose a novel Temporal Adaptive RGBT Tracking framework, named as TATrack. TATrack has a spatio-temporal two-stream structure and captures temporal information by an online updated template, where the two-stream structure refers to the multi-modal feature extraction and cross-modal interaction for the initial template and the online update template respectively. TATrack contributes to comprehensively exploit spatio-temporal information and multi-modal information for target localization. In addition, we design a spatio-temporal interaction (STI) mechanism that bridges two branches and enables cross-modal interaction to span longer time scales. Extensive experiments on three popular RGBT tracking benchmarks show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, while running at real-time speed",

Nowadays, there's always a need to develop a multimodal system that combines multiple biometric traits in an efficient, meaningful way. In this paper, we introduce \"IdentiFace\" which is a multimodal facial biometric system that combines the core of facial recognition with some of the most important soft biometric traits such as gender, face shape, and emotion. We also focused on developing the system using only VGG-16 inspired architecture with minor changes across different subsystems. This unification allows for simpler integration across modalities. It makes it easier to interpret the learned features between the tasks which gives a good indication about the decision-making process across the facial modalities and potential connection. For the recognition problem, we acquired a 99.2% test accuracy for five classes with high intra-class variations using data collected from the FERET database[1]. We achieved 99.4% on our dataset and 95.15% on the public dataset[2] in the gender recognition problem. We were also able to achieve a testing accuracy of 88.03% in the face-shape problem using the celebrity face-shape dataset[3]. Finally, we achieved a decent testing accuracy of 66.13% in the emotion task which is considered a very acceptable accuracy compared to related work on the FER2013 dataset[4]",

    "volume": "Jan",
    "abstract": "Multi-Task Learning (MTL) is a framework, where multiple related tasks are learned jointly and benefit from a shared representation space, or parameter transfer. To provide sufficient learning support, modern MTL uses annotated data with full, or sufficiently large overlap across tasks, i.e., each input sample is annotated for all, or most of the tasks. However, collecting such annotations is prohibitive in many real applications, and cannot benefit from datasets available for individual tasks. In this work, we challenge this setup and show that MTL can be successful with classification tasks with little, or non-overlapping annotations, or when there is big discrepancy in the size of labeled data per task. We explore task-relatedness for co-annotation and co-training, and propose a novel approach, where knowledge exchange is enabled between the tasks via distribution matching. To demonstrate the general applicability of our method, we conducted diverse case studies in the domains of affective computing, face recognition, species recognition, and shopping item classification using nine datasets. Our large-scale study of affective tasks for basic expression recognition and facial action unit detection illustrates that our approach is network agnostic and brings large performance improvements compared to the state-of-the-art in both tasks and across all studied databases. In all case studies, we show that co-training via task-relatedness is advantageous and prevents negative transfer (which occurs when MT model's performance is worse than that of at least one single-task model)",

    "abstract": "Traditional manual detection for solder joint defect is no longer applied during industrial production due to low efficiency, inconsistent evaluation, high cost and lack of real-time data. A new approach has been proposed to address the issues of low accuracy, high false detection rates and computational cost of solder joint defect detection in surface mount technology of industrial scenarios. The proposed solution is a hybrid attention mechanism designed specifically for the solder joint defect detection algorithm to improve quality control in the manufacturing process by increasing the accuracy while reducing the computational cost. The hybrid attention mechanism comprises a proposed enhanced multi-head self-attention and coordinate attention mechanisms increase the ability of attention networks to perceive contextual information and enhances the utilization range of network features. The coordinate attention mechanism enhances the connection between different channels and reduces location information loss. The hybrid attention mechanism enhances the capability of the network to perceive long-distance position information and learn local features. The improved algorithm model has good detection ability for solder joint defect detection, with mAP reaching 91.5%, 4.3% higher than the You Only Look Once version 5 algorithm and better than other comparative algorithms. Compared to other versions, mean Average Precision, Precision, Recall, and Frame per Seconds indicators have also improved.

    "volume": "Jan",
    "abstract": "Crowd counting has gained significant popularity due to its practical applications. However, mainstream counting methods ignore precise individual localization and suffer from annotation noise because of counting from estimating density maps. Additionally, they also struggle with high-density images.To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end model called Fine-Grained Extraction Network (FGENet). Different from methods estimating density maps, FGENet directly learns the original coordinate points that represent the precise localization of individuals.This study designs a fusion module, named Fine-Grained Feature Pyramid(FGFP), that is used to fuse feature maps extracted by the backbone of FGENet. The fused features are then passed to both regression and classification heads, where the former provides predicted point coordinates for a given image, and the latter determines the confidence level for each predicted point being an individual. At the end, FGENet establishes correspondences between prediction points and ground truth points by employing the Hungarian algorithm. For training FGENet, we design a robust loss function, named Three-Task Combination (TTC), to mitigate the impact of annotation noise. Extensive experiments are conducted on four widely used crowd counting datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of FGENet. Notably, our method achieves a remarkable improvement of 3.14 points in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) on the ShanghaiTech Part A dataset, showcasing its superiority over the existing state-of-the-art methods. Even more impressively, FGENet surpasses previous benchmarks on the UCF\\_CC\\_50 dataset with an astounding enhancement of 30.16 points in MAE",

Our expression control is so sophisticated that it can be specialized by the fine-grained emotional vocabulary. We devise a novel diffusion model that can undertake the task of simultaneously face swapping and reenactment. Due to the entanglement of identity and expression, it's nontrivial to separately and precisely control them in one framework, thus has not been explored yet. To overcome this, we propose several innovative designs in the conditional diffusion model, including balancing identity and expression encoder, improved midpoint sampling, and explicitly background conditioning.

    "volume": "Jan",
    "abstract": "Skin lesions are classified in benign or malignant. Among the malignant, melanoma is a very aggressive cancer and the major cause of deaths. So, early diagnosis of skin cancer is very desired. In the last few years, there is a growing interest in computer aided diagnostic (CAD) using most image and clinical data of the lesion. These sources of information present limitations due to their inability to provide information of the molecular structure of the lesion. NIR spectroscopy may provide an alternative source of information to automated CAD of skin lesions. The most commonly used techniques and classification algorithms used in spectroscopy are Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Partial Least Squares - Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA), and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Nonetheless, there is a growing interest in applying the modern techniques of machine and deep learning (MDL) to spectroscopy. One of the main limitations to apply MDL to spectroscopy is the lack of public datasets. Since there is no public dataset of NIR spectral data to skin lesions, as far as we know, an effort has been made and a new dataset named NIR-SC-UFES, has been collected, annotated and analyzed generating the gold-standard for classification of NIR spectral data to skin cancer. Next, the machine learning algorithms XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM, 1D-convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) were investigated to classify cancer and non-cancer skin lesions. Experimental results indicate the best performance obtained by LightGBM with pre-processing using standard normal variate (SNV), feature extraction providing values of 0.839 for balanced accuracy, 0.851 for recall, 0.852 for precision, and 0.850 for F-score. The obtained results indicate the first steps in CAD of skin lesions aiming the automated triage of patients with skin lesions in vivo using NIR spectral data",

    "volume": "Jan",
    "abstract": "Most of the approaches proposed so far to craft targeted adversarial examples against Deep Learning classifiers are highly suboptimal and typically rely on increasing the likelihood of the target class, thus implicitly focusing on one-hot encoding settings. In this paper, we propose a more general, theoretically sound, targeted attack that resorts to the minimization of a Jacobian-induced MAhalanobis distance (JMA) term, taking into account the effort (in the input space) required to move the latent space representation of the input sample in a given direction. The minimization is solved by exploiting the Wolfe duality theorem, reducing the problem to the solution of a Non-Negative Least Square (NNLS) problem. The proposed algorithm provides an optimal solution to a linearized version of the adversarial example problem originally introduced by Szegedy et al. \\cite{szegedy2013intriguing}. The experiments we carried out confirm the generality of the proposed attack which is proven to be effective under a wide variety of output encoding schemes. Noticeably, the JMA attack is also effective in a multi-label classification scenario, being capable to induce a targeted modification of up to half the labels in a complex multilabel classification scenario with 20 labels, a capability that is out of reach of all the attacks proposed so far. As a further advantage, the JMA attack usually requires very few iterations, thus resulting more efficient than existing methods",

    "volume": "Jan",
    "abstract": "Identifying labels that did not appear during training, known as multi-label zero-shot learning, is a non-trivial task in computer vision. To this end, recent studies have attempted to explore the multi-modal knowledge of vision-language pre-training (VLP) models by knowledge distillation, allowing to recognize unseen labels in an open-vocabulary manner. However, experimental evidence shows that knowledge distillation is suboptimal and provides limited performance gain in unseen label prediction. In this paper, a novel query-based knowledge sharing paradigm is proposed to explore the multi-modal knowledge from the pretrained VLP model for open-vocabulary multi-label classification. Specifically, a set of learnable label-agnostic query tokens is trained to extract critical vision knowledge from the input image, and further shared across all labels, allowing them to select tokens of interest as visual clues for recognition. Besides, we propose an effective prompt pool for robust label embedding, and reformulate the standard ranking learning into a form of classification to allow the magnitude of feature vectors for matching, which both significantly benefit label recognition. Experimental results show that our framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on zero-shot task by 5.9% and 4.5% in mAP on the NUS-WIDE and Open Images, respectively",

    "abstract": "Deforestation, a major contributor to climate change, poses detrimental consequences such as agricultural sector disruption, global warming, flash floods, and landslides. Conventional approaches to urban street tree inventory suffer from inaccuracies and necessitate specialised equipment. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes an innovative method that leverages deep learning techniques and mobile phone imaging for urban street tree inventory. Our approach utilises a pair of images captured by smartphone cameras to accurately segment tree trunks and compute the diameter at breast height (DBH). Compared to traditional methods, our approach exhibits several advantages, including superior accuracy, reduced dependency on specialised equipment, and applicability in hard-to-reach areas.

    "volume": "Jan",
    "abstract": "Modern healthcare often utilises radiographic images alongside textual reports for diagnostics, encouraging the use of Vision-Language Self-Supervised Learning (VL-SSL) with large pre-trained models to learn versatile medical vision representations. However, most existing VL-SSL frameworks are trained end-to-end, which is computation-heavy and can lose vital prior information embedded in pre-trained encoders. To address both issues, we introduce the backbone-agnostic Adaptor framework, which preserves medical knowledge in pre-trained image and text encoders by keeping them frozen, and employs a lightweight Adaptor module for cross-modal learning. Experiments on medical image classification and segmentation tasks across three datasets reveal that our framework delivers competitive performance while cutting trainable parameters by over 90% compared to current pre-training approaches. Notably, when fine-tuned with just 1% of data, Adaptor outperforms several Transformer-based methods trained on full datasets in medical image segmentation",

    "volume": "Jan",
    "abstract": "Simulating high-resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images in complex scenes has consistently presented a significant research challenge. The development of a microwave-domain surface scattering model and its reversibility are poised to play a pivotal role in enhancing the authenticity of SAR image simulations and facilitating the reconstruction of target parameters. Drawing inspiration from the field of computer graphics, this paper proposes a surface microwave rendering model that comprehensively considers both Specular and Diffuse contributions. The model is analytically represented by the coherent spatially varying bidirectional scattering distribution function (CSVBSDF) based on the Kirchhoff approximation (KA) and the perturbation method (SPM). And SAR imaging is achieved through the synergistic combination of ray tracing and fast mapping projection techniques. Furthermore, a differentiable ray tracing (DRT) engine based on SAR images was constructed for CSVBSDF surface scattering parameter learning. Within this SAR image simulation engine, the use of differentiable reverse ray tracing enables the rapid estimation of parameter gradients from SAR images. The effectiveness of this approach has been validated through simulations and comparisons with real SAR images. By learning the surface scattering parameters, substantial enhancements in SAR image simulation performance under various observation conditions have been demonstrated",

Unlike previous works that rely on scarce 3D datasets or limited 2D collections with imbalanced viewing angles and imprecise pose priors, our approach aims to develop a zero-shot 3D generative scheme capable of producing visually realistic, geometrically accurate and content-wise diverse 3D humans without relying on pre-existing 3D or 2D assets. To address this challenge, we introduce a meticulously crafted workflow that implements accurate physical modeling to learn the enhanced 3D generative model from synthetic 2D data. During inference, we integrate optimization modules to bridge the gap between realistic appearances and coarse 3D shapes. Specifically, En3D comprises three modules: a 3D generator that accurately models generalizable 3D humans with realistic appearance from synthesized balanced, diverse, and structured human images; a geometry sculptor that enhances shape quality using multi-view normal constraints for intricate human anatomy; and a texturing module that disentangles explicit texture maps with fidelity and editability, leveraging semantical UV partitioning and a differentiable rasterizer. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms prior works in terms of image quality, geometry accuracy and content diversity.

However, manual annotation of fine-grained colorectal tissue samples of multiple classes, especially the rare ones like stromal tumor and anal cancer is laborious and expensive. To address this, we propose a knowledge distillation-based approach, named KD-CTCNet, that effectively captures local texture information from few tissue samples, through a distillation loss, to improve the standard CNN features. The resulting enriched feature representation achieves improved classification performance specifically in low data regimes. Extensive experiments on two public datasets of colorectal tissues reveal the merits of the proposed contributions, with a consistent gain achieved over different approaches across low data settings.

    "abstract": "Video content has experienced a surge in popularity, asserting its dominance over internet traffic and Internet of Things (IoT) networks. Video compression has long been regarded as the primary means of efficiently managing the substantial multimedia traffic generated by video-capturing devices. Nevertheless, video compression algorithms entail significant computational demands in order to achieve substantial compression ratios. This complexity presents a formidable challenge when implementing efficient video coding standards in resource-constrained embedded systems, such as IoT edge node cameras. To tackle this challenge, this paper introduces NU-Class Net, an innovative deep-learning model designed to mitigate compression artifacts stemming from lossy compression codecs. This enhancement significantly elevates the perceptible quality of low-bit-rate videos. By employing the NU-Class Net, the video encoder within the video-capturing node can reduce output quality, thereby generating low-bit-rate videos and effectively curtailing both computation and bandwidth requirements at the edge. On the decoder side, which is typically less encumbered by resource limitations, NU-Class Net is applied after the video decoder to compensate for artifacts and approximate the quality of the original video. Experimental results affirm the efficacy of the proposed model in enhancing the perceptible quality of videos, especially those streamed at low bit rates",

    "abstract": "We describe a new general method for segmentation in MRI scans using Topological Data Analysis (TDA), offering several advantages over traditional machine learning approaches. It works in three steps, first identifying the whole object to segment via automatic thresholding, then detecting a distinctive subset whose topology is known in advance, and finally deducing the various components of the segmentation. Although convoking classical ideas of TDA, such an algorithm has never been proposed separately from deep learning methods. To achieve this, our approach takes into account, in addition to the homology of the image, the localization of representative cycles, a piece of information that seems never to have been exploited in this context. In particular, it offers the ability to perform segmentation without the need for large annotated data sets. TDA also provides a more interpretable and stable framework for segmentation by explicitly mapping topological features to segmentation components. By adapting the geometric object to be detected, the algorithm can be adjusted to a wide range of data segmentation challenges. We carefully study the examples of glioblastoma segmentation in brain MRI, where a sphere is to be detected, as well as myocardium in cardiac MRI, involving a cylinder, and cortical plate detection in fetal brain MRI, whose 2D slices are circles.

    "title": "On Optimal Sampling for Learning SDF Using MLPs Equipped with Positional Encoding",
    "volume": "Jan",
    "abstract": "Neural implicit fields, such as the neural signed distance field (SDF) of a shape, have emerged as a powerful representation for many applications, e.g., encoding a 3D shape and performing collision detection. Typically, implicit fields are encoded by Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLP) with positional encoding (PE) to capture high-frequency geometric details. However, a notable side effect of such PE-equipped MLPs is the noisy artifacts present in the learned implicit fields. While increasing the sampling rate could in general mitigate these artifacts, in this paper we aim to explain this adverse phenomenon through the lens of Fourier analysis. We devise a tool to determine the appropriate sampling rate for learning an accurate neural implicit field without undesirable side effects. Specifically, we propose a simple yet effective method to estimate the intrinsic frequency of a given network with randomized weights based on the Fourier analysis of the network's responses. It is observed that a PE-equipped MLP has an intrinsic frequency much higher than the highest frequency component in the PE layer. Sampling against this intrinsic frequency following the Nyquist-Sannon sampling theorem allows us to determine an appropriate training sampling rate. We empirically show in the setting of SDF fitting that this recommended sampling rate is sufficient to secure accurate fitting results, while further increasing the sampling rate would not further noticeably reduce the fitting error. Training PE-equipped MLPs simply with our sampling strategy leads to performances superior to the existing methods",

While previous works have explored image generation conditioned on scene graphs or layouts, our task is distinctive and important as it involves generating scene graphs themselves unconditionally from noise, enabling efficient and interpretable control for image generation. Our task is challenging, requiring the generation of plausible scene graphs with heterogeneous attributes for nodes (objects) and edges (relations among objects), including continuous object bounding boxes and discrete object and relation categories. We introduce a novel diffusion model, DiffuseSG, that jointly models the adjacency matrix along with heterogeneous node and edge attributes. We explore various types of encodings for the categorical data, relaxing it into a continuous space. With a graph transformer being the denoiser, DiffuseSG successively denoises the scene graph representation in a continuous space and discretizes the final representation to generate the clean scene graph. Additionally, we introduce an IoU regularization to enhance the empirical performance. Our model significantly outperforms existing methods in scene graph generation on the Visual Genome and COCO-Stuff datasets, both on standard and newly introduced metrics that better capture the problem complexity. Moreover, we demonstrate the additional benefits of our model in two downstream applications: 1) excelling in a series of scene graph completion tasks, and 2) improving scene graph detection models by using extra training samples generated from DiffuseSG",

Specifically, we create a dataset from multi-datasets as original prompts. To select the optimal camera, we design an optimal camera matching approach and implement a classifier for original prompts capable of automatically matching. Appending camera descriptions to original prompts generates optimized prompts for further LVM image generation. Experiments demonstrate that SSP improves semantic consistency by an average of 16% compared to others and safety metrics by 48.9%",

    "volume": "Jan",
    "abstract": "Face recognition systems have raised concerns due to their vulnerability to different presentation attacks, and system security has become an increasingly critical concern. Although many face anti-spoofing (FAS) methods perform well in intra-dataset scenarios, their generalization remains a challenge. To address this issue, some methods adopt domain adversarial training (DAT) to extract domain-invariant features. However, the competition between the encoder and the domain discriminator can cause the network to be difficult to train and converge. In this paper, we propose a domain adversarial attack (DAA) method to mitigate the training instability problem by adding perturbations to the input images, which makes them indistinguishable across domains and enables domain alignment. Moreover, since models trained on limited data and types of attacks cannot generalize well to unknown attacks, we propose a dual perceptual and generative knowledge distillation framework for face anti-spoofing that utilizes pre-trained face-related models containing rich face priors. Specifically, we adopt two different face-related models as teachers to transfer knowledge to the target student model. The pre-trained teacher models are not from the task of face anti-spoofing but from perceptual and generative tasks, respectively, which implicitly augment the data. By combining both DAA and dual-teacher knowledge distillation, we develop a dual teacher knowledge distillation with domain alignment framework (DTDA) for face anti-spoofing.

HAD is essential in scenarios of unknown or camouflaged target features, such as water quality monitoring, crop growth monitoring and camouflaged target detection, where prior information of targets is difficult to obtain. Existing HAD methods aim to objectively detect and distinguish background and anomalous spectra, which can be achieved almost effortlessly by human perception. However, the underlying processes of human visual perception are thought to be quite complex. In this paper, we analyze hyperspectral image (HSI) features under human visual perception, and transfer the solution process of HAD to the more robust feature space for the first time. Specifically, we propose a small target aware detector (STAD), which introduces saliency maps to capture HSI features closer to human visual perception. STAD not only extracts more anomalous representations, but also reduces the impact of low-confidence regions through a proposed small target filter (STF). Furthermore, considering the possibility of HAD algorithms being applied to edge devices, we propose a full connected network to convolutional network knowledge distillation strategy. It can learn the spectral and spatial features of the HSI while lightening the network. We train the network on the HAD100 training set and validate the proposed method on the HAD100 test set. Our method provides a new solution space for HAD that is closer to human visual perception with high confidence. Sufficient experiments on real HSI with multiple method comparisons demonstrate the excellent performance and unique potential of the proposed method.

    "volume": "Jan",
    "abstract": "Due to the poor illumination and the difficulty in annotating, nighttime conditions pose a significant challenge for autonomous vehicle perception systems. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has been widely applied to semantic segmentation on such images to adapt models from normal conditions to target nighttime-condition domains. Self-training (ST) is a paradigm in UDA, where a momentum teacher is utilized for pseudo-label prediction, but a confirmation bias issue exists. Because the one-directional knowledge transfer from a single teacher is insufficient to adapt to a large domain shift. To mitigate this issue, we propose to alleviate domain gap by incrementally considering style influence and illumination change. Therefore, we introduce a one-stage Dual-Teacher Bi-directional Self-training (DTBS) framework for smooth knowledge transfer and feedback. Based on two teacher models, we present a novel pipeline to respectively decouple style and illumination shift. In addition, we propose a new Re-weight exponential moving average (EMA) to merge the knowledge of style and illumination factors, and provide feedback to the student model. In this way, our method can be embedded in other UDA methods to enhance their performance. For example, the Cityscapes to ACDC night task yielded 53.8 mIoU (\\%), which corresponds to an improvement of +5\\% over the previous state-of-the-art.

    "title": "BEV-CLIP: Multi-modal BEV Retrieval Methodology for Complex Scene in Autonomous Driving",
    "volume": "Jan",
    "abstract": "The demand for the retrieval of complex scene data in autonomous driving is increasing, especially as passenger vehicles have been equipped with the ability to navigate urban settings, with the imperative to address long-tail scenarios. Meanwhile, under the pre-existing two dimensional image retrieval method, some problems may arise with scene retrieval, such as lack of global feature representation and subpar text retrieval ability. To address these issues, we have proposed \\textbf{BEV-CLIP}, the first multimodal Bird's-Eye View(BEV) retrieval methodology that utilizes descriptive text as an input to retrieve corresponding scenes. This methodology applies the semantic feature extraction abilities of a large language model (LLM) to facilitate zero-shot retrieval of extensive text descriptions, and incorporates semi-structured information from a knowledge graph to improve the semantic richness and variety of the language embedding. Our experiments result in 87.66% accuracy on NuScenes dataset in text-to-BEV feature retrieval. The demonstrated cases in our paper support that our retrieval method is also indicated to be effective in identifying certain long-tail corner scenes",

    "title": "Relating Events and Frames Based on Self-Supervised Learning and Uncorrelated Conditioning for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation",
    "volume": "Jan",
    "abstract": "Event-based cameras provide accurate and high temporal resolution measurements for performing computer vision tasks in challenging scenarios, such as high-dynamic range environments and fast-motion maneuvers. Despite their advantages, utilizing deep learning for event-based vision encounters a significant obstacle due to the scarcity of annotated data caused by the relatively recent emergence of event-based cameras. To overcome this limitation, leveraging the knowledge available from annotated data obtained with conventional frame-based cameras presents an effective solution based on unsupervised domain adaptation. We propose a new algorithm tailored for adapting a deep neural network trained on annotated frame-based data to generalize well on event-based unannotated data. Our approach incorporates uncorrelated conditioning and self-supervised learning in an adversarial learning scheme to close the gap between the two source and target domains. By applying self-supervised learning, the algorithm learns to align the representations of event-based data with those from frame-based camera data, thereby facilitating knowledge transfer.Furthermore, the inclusion of uncorrelated conditioning ensures that the adapted model effectively distinguishes between event-based and conventional data, enhancing its ability to classify event-based images accurately.Through empirical experimentation and evaluation, we demonstrate that our algorithm surpasses existing approaches designed for the same purpose using two benchmarks. The superior performance of our solution is attributed to its ability to effectively utilize annotated data from frame-based cameras and transfer the acquired knowledge to the event-based vision domain",

    "volume": "Jan",
    "abstract": "Semantic segmentation models trained on annotated data fail to generalize well when the input data distribution changes over extended time period, leading to requiring re-training to maintain performance. Classic Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) attempts to address a similar problem when there is target domain with no annotated data points through transferring knowledge from a source domain with annotated data. We develop an online UDA algorithm for semantic segmentation of images that improves model generalization on unannotated domains in scenarios where source data access is restricted during adaptation. We perform model adaptation is by minimizing the distributional distance between the source latent features and the target features in a shared embedding space. Our solution promotes a shared domain-agnostic latent feature space between the two domains, which allows for classifier generalization on the target dataset. To alleviate the need of access to source samples during adaptation, we approximate the source latent feature distribution via an appropriate surrogate distribution, in this case a Gassian mixture model (GMM). We evaluate our approach on well established semantic segmentation datasets and demonstrate it compares favorably against state-of-the-art (SOTA) UDA semantic segmentation methods",

    "volume": "Jan",
    "abstract": "Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (UAD) with incremental training is crucial in industrial manufacturing, as unpredictable defects make obtaining sufficient labeled data infeasible. However, continual learning methods primarily rely on supervised annotations, while the application in UAD is limited due to the absence of supervision. Current UAD methods train separate models for different classes sequentially, leading to catastrophic forgetting and a heavy computational burden. To address this issue, we introduce a novel Unsupervised Continual Anomaly Detection framework called UCAD, which equips the UAD with continual learning capability through contrastively-learned prompts. In the proposed UCAD, we design a Continual Prompting Module (CPM) by utilizing a concise key-prompt-knowledge memory bank to guide task-invariant `anomaly' model predictions using task-specific `normal' knowledge. Moreover, Structure-based Contrastive Learning (SCL) is designed with the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to improve prompt learning and anomaly segmentation results. Specifically, by treating SAM's masks as structure, we draw features within the same mask closer and push others apart for general feature representations. We conduct comprehensive experiments and set the benchmark on unsupervised continual anomaly detection and segmentation, demonstrating that our method is significantly better than anomaly detection methods, even with rehearsal training.

In real-world scenarios, test data streams are not always independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). Instead, they are frequently temporally correlated, making them non-i.i.d. Many existing methods struggle to cope with this scenario. In response, we propose a diversity-aware and category-balanced buffer that can simulate an i.i.d. data stream, even in non-i.i.d. scenarios. Combined with a diversity and entropy-weighted entropy loss, we show that a stable adaptation is possible on a wide range of corruptions and natural domain shifts, based on ImageNet.

    "abstract": "The rise of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has spurred interest in language-based driving tasks. However, existing research typically focuses on limited tasks and often omits key multi-view and temporal information which is crucial for robust autonomous driving. To bridge these gaps, we introduce NuInstruct, a novel dataset with 91K multi-view video-QA pairs across 17 subtasks, where each task demands holistic information (e.g., temporal, multi-view, and spatial), significantly elevating the challenge level. To obtain NuInstruct, we propose a novel SQL-based method to generate instruction-response pairs automatically, which is inspired by the driving logical progression of humans. We further present BEV-InMLLM, an end-to-end method for efficiently deriving instruction-aware Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) features, language-aligned for large language models. BEV-InMLLM integrates multi-view, spatial awareness, and temporal semantics to enhance MLLMs' capabilities on NuInstruct tasks. Moreover, our proposed BEV injection module is a plug-and-play method for existing MLLMs. Our experiments on NuInstruct demonstrate that BEV-InMLLM significantly outperforms existing MLLMs, e.g. around 9% improvement on various tasks.

This greatly affects the detection accuracy of deep learning models. To overcome these problems, we concentrate on deep learning models for real-time detection of cars and tanks in an occluded environment with a cluttered background employing SSD and YOLO algorithms and improved precision of detection and reduce problems faced by these models. The developed method makes the custom dataset and employs a preprocessing technique to clean the noisy dataset. For training the developed model we apply the data augmentation technique to balance and diversify the data. We fine-tuned, trained, and evaluated these models on the established dataset by applying these techniques and highlighting the results we got more accurately than without applying these techniques. The accuracy and frame per second of the SSD-Mobilenet v2 model are higher than YOLO V3 and YOLO V4. Furthermore, by employing various techniques like data enhancement, noise reduction, parameter optimization, and model fusion we improve the effectiveness of detection and recognition. We further added a counting algorithm, and target attributes experimental comparison, and made a graphical user interface system for the developed model with features of object counting, alerts, status, resolution, and frame per second.

    "title": "3D Visibility-aware Generalizable Neural Radiance Fields for Interacting Hands",
    "volume": "Jan",
    "abstract": "Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) are promising 3D representations for scenes, objects, and humans. However, most existing methods require multi-view inputs and per-scene training, which limits their real-life applications. Moreover, current methods focus on single-subject cases, leaving scenes of interacting hands that involve severe inter-hand occlusions and challenging view variations remain unsolved. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a generalizable visibility-aware NeRF (VA-NeRF) framework for interacting hands. Specifically, given an image of interacting hands as input, our VA-NeRF first obtains a mesh-based representation of hands and extracts their corresponding geometric and textural features. Subsequently, a feature fusion module that exploits the visibility of query points and mesh vertices is introduced to adaptively merge features of both hands, enabling the recovery of features in unseen areas. Additionally, our VA-NeRF is optimized together with a novel discriminator within an adversarial learning paradigm. In contrast to conventional discriminators that predict a single real/fake label for the synthesized image, the proposed discriminator generates a pixel-wise visibility map, providing fine-grained supervision for unseen areas and encouraging the VA-NeRF to improve the visual quality of synthesized images. Experiments on the Interhand2.6M dataset demonstrate that our proposed VA-NeRF outperforms conventional NeRFs significantly. Project Page: \\url{https://github.com/XuanHuang0/VANeRF}",

However, despite the presence of numerous WiFi-enabled devices around us, few expose CSI to users, resulting in a lack of sensing hardware options. Variants of the Espressif ESP32 have emerged as potential low-cost and easy-to-deploy solutions for WiFi CSI-based HAR. In this work, four ESP32-S3-based 2.4GHz directional antenna systems are evaluated for their ability to facilitate long-range through-wall HAR. Two promising systems are proposed, one of which combines the ESP32-S3 with a directional biquad antenna. This combination represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first demonstration of such a system in WiFi-based HAR. The second system relies on the built-in printed inverted-F antenna (PIFA) of the ESP32-S3 and achieves directionality through a plane reflector. In a comprehensive evaluation of line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) HAR performance, both systems are deployed in an office environment spanning a distance of 18 meters across five rooms. In this experimental setup, the Wallhack1.8k dataset, comprising 1806 CSI amplitude spectrograms of human activities, is collected and made publicly available. Based on Wallhack1.8k, we train activity recognition models using the EfficientNetV2 architecture to assess system performance in LOS and NLOS scenarios. For the core NLOS activity recognition problem, the biquad antenna and PIFA-based systems achieve accuracies of 92.0$\\pm$3.5 and 86.8$\\pm$4.7, respectively, demonstrating the feasibility of long-range through-wall HAR with the proposed systems",

    "volume": "Jan",
    "abstract": "Traditionally, pathological analysis and diagnosis are performed by manually eyeballing glass slide specimens under a microscope by an expert. The whole slide image is the digital specimen produced from the glass slide. Whole slide image enabled specimens to be observed on a computer screen and led to computational pathology where computer vision and artificial intelligence are utilized for automated analysis and diagnosis. With the current computational advancement, the entire whole slide image can be analyzed autonomously without human supervision. However, the analysis could fail or lead to wrong diagnosis if the whole slide image is affected by tissue artifacts such as tissue fold or air bubbles depending on the severity. Existing artifact detection methods rely on experts for severity assessment to eliminate artifact affected regions from the analysis. This process is time consuming, exhausting and undermines the goal of automated analysis or removal of artifacts without evaluating their severity, which could result in the loss of diagnostically important data. Therefore, it is necessary to detect artifacts and then assess their severity automatically. In this paper, we propose a system that incorporates severity evaluation with artifact detection utilizing convolutional neural networks. The proposed system uses DoubleUNet to segment artifacts and an ensemble network of six fine tuned convolutional neural network models to determine severity. This method outperformed current state of the art in accuracy by 9 percent for artifact segmentation and achieved a strong correlation of 97 percent with the evaluation of pathologists for severity assessment. The robustness of the system was demonstrated using our proposed heterogeneous dataset and practical usability was ensured by integrating it with an automated analysis system",

    "abstract": "Given the difficulty of manually annotating motion in video, the current best motion estimation methods are trained with synthetic data, and therefore struggle somewhat due to a train/test gap. Self-supervised methods hold the promise of training directly on real video, but typically perform worse. These include methods trained with warp error (i.e., color constancy) combined with smoothness terms, and methods that encourage cycle-consistency in the estimates (i.e., tracking backwards should yield the opposite trajectory as tracking forwards). In this work, we take on the challenge of improving state-of-the-art supervised models with self-supervised training. We find that when the initialization is supervised weights, most existing self-supervision techniques actually make performance worse instead of better, which suggests that the benefit of seeing the new data is overshadowed by the noise in the training signal. Focusing on obtaining a ``clean'' training signal from real-world unlabelled video, we propose to separate label-making and training into two distinct stages. In the first stage, we use the pre-trained model to estimate motion in a video, and then select the subset of motion estimates which we can verify with cycle-consistency. This produces a sparse but accurate pseudo-labelling of the video. In the second stage, we fine-tune the model to reproduce these outputs, while also applying augmentations on the input. We complement this boot-strapping method with simple techniques that densify and re-balance the pseudo-labels, ensuring that we do not merely train on ``easy'' tracks. We show that our method yields reliable gains over fully-supervised methods in real videos, for both short-term (flow-based) and long-range (multi-frame) pixel tracking",

    "abstract": "Recent studies in Radiance Fields have paved the robust way for novel view synthesis with their photorealistic rendering quality. Nevertheless, they usually employ neural networks and volumetric rendering, which are costly to train and impede their broad use in various real-time applications due to the lengthy rendering time. Lately 3D Gaussians splatting-based approach has been proposed to model the 3D scene, and it achieves remarkable visual quality while rendering the images in real-time. However, it suffers from severe degradation in the rendering quality if the training images are blurry. Blurriness commonly occurs due to the lens defocusing, object motion, and camera shake, and it inevitably intervenes in clean image acquisition. Several previous studies have attempted to render clean and sharp images from blurry input images using neural fields. The majority of those works, however, are designed only for volumetric rendering-based neural radiance fields and are not straightforwardly applicable to rasterization-based 3D Gaussian splatting methods. Thus, we propose a novel real-time deblurring framework, deblurring 3D Gaussian Splatting, using a small Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) that manipulates the covariance of each 3D Gaussian to model the scene blurriness. While deblurring 3D Gaussian Splatting can still enjoy real-time rendering, it can reconstruct fine and sharp details from blurry images. A variety of experiments have been conducted on the benchmark, and the results have revealed the effectiveness of our approach for deblurring.

    "title": "Rethinking RAFT for Efficient Optical Flow",
    "volume": "Jan",
    "abstract": "Despite significant progress in deep learning-based optical flow methods, accurately estimating large displacements and repetitive patterns remains a challenge. The limitations of local features and similarity search patterns used in these algorithms contribute to this issue. Additionally, some existing methods suffer from slow runtime and excessive graphic memory consumption. To address these problems, this paper proposes a novel approach based on the RAFT framework. The proposed Attention-based Feature Localization (AFL) approach incorporates the attention mechanism to handle global feature extraction and address repetitive patterns. It introduces an operator for matching pixels with corresponding counterparts in the second frame and assigning accurate flow values. Furthermore, an Amorphous Lookup Operator (ALO) is proposed to enhance convergence speed and improve RAFTs ability to handle large displacements by reducing data redundancy in its search operator and expanding the search space for similarity extraction. The proposed method, Efficient RAFT (Ef-RAFT),achieves significant improvements of 10% on the Sintel dataset and 5% on the KITTI dataset over RAFT. Remarkably, these enhancements are attained with a modest 33% reduction in speed and a mere 13% increase in memory usage. The code is available at: https://github.com/n3slami/Ef-RAFT",

The goal is to equip robots with the ability to reliably receive objects with unseen geometry handed over by humans in various complex trajectories. We acquire such generalizability by learning H2R handover at scale with a comprehensive solution including procedural simulation assets creation, automated demonstration generation, and effective imitation learning. We leverage large-scale 3D model repositories, dexterous grasp generation methods, and curve-based 3D animation to create an H2R handover simulation environment named \\simabbns, surpassing the number of scenes in existing simulators by three orders of magnitude. We further introduce a distillation-friendly demonstration generation method that automatically generates a million high-quality demonstrations suitable for learning. Finally, we present a 4D imitation learning method augmented by a future forecasting objective to distill demonstrations into a visuo-motor handover policy.

    "title": "Sharp-NeRF: Grid-based Fast Deblurring Neural Radiance Fields Using Sharpness Prior",
    "volume": "Jan",
    "abstract": "Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown remarkable performance in neural rendering-based novel view synthesis. However, NeRF suffers from severe visual quality degradation when the input images have been captured under imperfect conditions, such as poor illumination, defocus blurring, and lens aberrations. Especially, defocus blur is quite common in the images when they are normally captured using cameras. Although few recent studies have proposed to render sharp images of considerably high-quality, yet they still face many key challenges. In particular, those methods have employed a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) based NeRF, which requires tremendous computational time. To overcome these shortcomings, this paper proposes a novel technique Sharp-NeRF -- a grid-based NeRF that renders clean and sharp images from the input blurry images within half an hour of training. To do so, we used several grid-based kernels to accurately model the sharpness/blurriness of the scene. The sharpness level of the pixels is computed to learn the spatially varying blur kernels. We have conducted experiments on the benchmarks consisting of blurry images and have evaluated full-reference and non-reference metrics. The qualitative and quantitative results have revealed that our approach renders the sharp novel views with vivid colors and fine details, and it has considerably faster training time than the previous works.

    "volume": "Jan",
    "abstract": "Deep learning is the current de facto state of the art in tomographic imaging. A common approach is to feed the result of a simple inversion, for example the backprojection, to a convolutional neural network (CNN) which then computes the reconstruction. Despite strong results on 'in-distribution' test data similar to the training data, backprojection from sparse-view data delocalizes singularities, so these approaches require a large receptive field to perform well. As a consequence, they overfit to certain global structures which leads to poor generalization on out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. Moreover, their memory complexity and training time scale unfavorably with image resolution, making them impractical for application at realistic clinical resolutions, especially in 3D: a standard U-Net requires a substantial 140GB of memory and 2600 seconds per epoch on a research-grade GPU when training on 1024x1024 images. In this paper, we introduce GLIMPSE, a local processing neural network for computed tomography which reconstructs a pixel value by feeding only the measurements associated with the neighborhood of the pixel to a simple MLP. While achieving comparable or better performance with successful CNNs like the U-Net on in-distribution test data, GLIMPSE significantly outperforms them on OOD samples while maintaining a memory footprint almost independent of image resolution; 5GB memory suffices to train on 1024x1024 images. Further, we built GLIMPSE to be fully differentiable, which enables feats such as recovery of accurate projection angles if they are out of calibration",

    "title": "Accurate Leukocyte Detection Based on Deformable-DETR and Multi-Level Feature Fusion for Aiding Diagnosis of Blood Diseases",
    "volume": "Jan",
    "abstract": "In standard hospital blood tests, the traditional process requires doctors to manually isolate leukocytes from microscopic images of patients' blood using microscopes. These isolated leukocytes are then categorized via automatic leukocyte classifiers to determine the proportion and volume of different types of leukocytes present in the blood samples, aiding disease diagnosis. This methodology is not only time-consuming and labor-intensive, but it also has a high propensity for errors due to factors such as image quality and environmental conditions, which could potentially lead to incorrect subsequent classifications and misdiagnosis. To address these issues, this paper proposes an innovative method of leukocyte detection: the Multi-level Feature Fusion and Deformable Self-attention DETR (MFDS-DETR). To tackle the issue of leukocyte scale disparity, we designed the High-level Screening-feature Fusion Pyramid (HS-FPN), enabling multi-level fusion. This model uses high-level features as weights to filter low-level feature information via a channel attention module and then merges the screened information with the high-level features, thus enhancing the model's feature expression capability. Further, we address the issue of leukocyte feature scarcity by incorporating a multi-scale deformable self-attention module in the encoder and using the self-attention and cross-deformable attention mechanisms in the decoder, which aids in the extraction of the global features of the leukocyte feature maps. The effectiveness, superiority, and generalizability of the proposed MFDS-DETR method are confirmed through comparisons with other cutting-edge leukocyte detection models using the private WBCDD, public LISC and BCCD datasets.

    "volume": "Jan",
    "abstract": "It is challenging but highly desired to acquire high-quality photos with clear content in low-light environments. Although multi-image processing methods (using burst, dual-exposure, or multi-exposure images) have made significant progress in addressing this issue, they typically focus exclusively on specific restoration or enhancement tasks, being insufficient in exploiting multi-image. Motivated by that multi-exposure images are complementary in denoising, deblurring, high dynamic range imaging, and super-resolution, we propose to utilize bracketing photography to unify restoration and enhancement tasks in this work. Due to the difficulty in collecting real-world pairs, we suggest a solution that first pre-trains the model with synthetic paired data and then adapts it to real-world unlabeled images. In particular, a temporally modulated recurrent network (TMRNet) and self-supervised adaptation method are proposed. Moreover, we construct a data simulation pipeline to synthesize pairs and collect real-world images from 200 nighttime scenarios. Experiments on both datasets show that our method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art multi-image processing ones.

    "volume": "Jan",
    "abstract": "Image generation models can generate or edit images from a given text. Recent advancements in image generation technology, exemplified by DALL-E and Midjourney, have been groundbreaking. These advanced models, despite their impressive capabilities, are often trained on massive Internet datasets, making them susceptible to generating content that perpetuates social stereotypes and biases, which can lead to severe consequences. Prior research on assessing bias within image generation models suffers from several shortcomings, including limited accuracy, reliance on extensive human labor, and lack of comprehensive analysis. In this paper, we propose BiasPainter, a novel metamorphic testing framework that can accurately, automatically and comprehensively trigger social bias in image generation models. BiasPainter uses a diverse range of seed images of individuals and prompts the image generation models to edit these images using gender, race, and age-neutral queries. These queries span 62 professions, 39 activities, 57 types of objects, and 70 personality traits. The framework then compares the edited images to the original seed images, focusing on any changes related to gender, race, and age. BiasPainter adopts a testing oracle that these characteristics should not be modified when subjected to neutral prompts. Built upon this design, BiasPainter can trigger the social bias and evaluate the fairness of image generation models. To evaluate the effectiveness of BiasPainter, we use BiasPainter to test five widely-used commercial image generation software and models, such as stable diffusion and Midjourney. Experimental results show that 100\\% of the generated test cases can successfully trigger social bias in image generation models",

    "title": "Beyond Subspace Isolation: Many-to-Many Transformer for Light Field Image Super-resolution",
    "volume": "Jan",
    "abstract": "The effective extraction of spatial-angular features plays a crucial role in light field image super-resolution (LFSR) tasks, and the introduction of convolution and Transformers leads to significant improvement in this area. Nevertheless, due to the large 4D data volume of light field images, many existing methods opted to decompose the data into a number of lower-dimensional subspaces and perform Transformers in each sub-space individually. As a side effect, these methods inadvertently restrict the self-attention mechanisms to a One-to-One scheme accessing only a limited subset of LF data, explicitly preventing comprehensive optimization on all spatial and angular cues. In this paper, we identify this limitation as subspace isolation and introduce a novel Many-to-Many Transformer (M2MT) to address it. M2MT aggregates angular information in the spatial subspace before performing the self-attention mechanism. It enables complete access to all information across all sub-aperture images (SAIs) in a light field image. Consequently, M2MT is enabled to comprehensively capture long-range correlation dependencies. With M2MT as the pivotal component, we develop a simple yet effective M2MT network for LFSR. Our experimental results demonstrate that M2MT achieves state-of-the-art performance across various public datasets. We further conduct in-depth analysis using local attribution maps (LAM) to obtain visual interpretability, and the results validate that M2MT is empowered with a truly non-local context in both spatial and angular subspaces to mitigate subspace isolation and acquire effective spatial-angular representation",

    "volume": "Jan",
    "abstract": "Self-supervised pre-training paradigms have been extensively explored in the field of skeleton-based action recognition. In particular, methods based on masked prediction have pushed the performance of pre-training to a new height. However, these methods take low-level features, such as raw joint coordinates or temporal motion, as prediction targets for the masked regions, which is suboptimal. In this paper, we show that using high-level contextualized features as prediction targets can achieve superior performance. Specifically, we propose Skeleton2vec, a simple and efficient self-supervised 3D action representation learning framework, which utilizes a transformer-based teacher encoder taking unmasked training samples as input to create latent contextualized representations as prediction targets. Benefiting from the self-attention mechanism, the latent representations generated by the teacher encoder can incorporate the global context of the entire training samples, leading to a richer training task. Additionally, considering the high temporal correlations in skeleton sequences, we propose a motion-aware tube masking strategy which divides the skeleton sequence into several tubes and performs persistent masking within each tube based on motion priors, thus forcing the model to build long-range spatio-temporal connections and focus on action-semantic richer regions. Extensive experiments on NTU-60, NTU-120, and PKU-MMD datasets demonstrate that our proposed Skeleton2vec outperforms previous methods and achieves state-of-the-art results",

    "volume": "Jan",
    "abstract": "Existing deep-learning-based methods for nighttime video deraining rely on synthetic data due to the absence of real-world paired data. However, the intricacies of the real world, particularly with the presence of light effects and low-light regions affected by noise, create significant domain gaps, hampering synthetic-trained models in removing rain streaks properly and leading to over-saturation and color shifts. Motivated by this, we introduce NightRain, a novel nighttime video deraining method with adaptive-rain-removal and adaptive-correction. Our adaptive-rain-removal uses unlabeled rain videos to enable our model to derain real-world rain videos, particularly in regions affected by complex light effects. The idea is to allow our model to obtain rain-free regions based on the confidence scores. Once rain-free regions and the corresponding regions from our input are obtained, we can have region-based paired real data. These paired data are used to train our model using a teacher-student framework, allowing the model to iteratively learn from less challenging regions to more challenging regions. Our adaptive-correction aims to rectify errors in our model's predictions, such as over-saturation and color shifts. The idea is to learn from clear night input training videos based on the differences or distance between those input videos and their corresponding predictions. Our model learns from these differences, compelling our model to correct the errors. From extensive experiments, our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance. It achieves a PSNR of 26.73dB, surpassing existing nighttime video deraining methods by a substantial margin of 13.7%",

Automated systems utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown promise in improving the accuracy and efficiency of chest X-ray image classification.

Extracting robust features from limited medical image datasets remains a critical challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning-based multilayer multimodal fusion model that emphasizes extracting features from different layers and fusing them. Our disease detection model considers the discriminatory information captured by each layer. Furthermore, we propose the fusion of different-sized feature maps (FDSFM) module to effectively merge feature maps from diverse layers. The proposed model achieves a significantly higher accuracy of 97.21% and 99.60% for both three-class and two-class classifications, respectively.

    "volume": "Jan",
    "abstract": "Accurate medical image segmentation is essential for clinical quantification, disease diagnosis, treatment planning and many other applications. Both convolution-based and transformer-based u-shaped architectures have made significant success in various medical image segmentation tasks. The former can efficiently learn local information of images while requiring much more image-specific inductive biases inherent to convolution operation. The latter can effectively capture long-range dependency at different feature scales using self-attention, whereas it typically encounters the challenges of quadratic compute and memory requirements with sequence length increasing. To address this problem, through integrating the merits of these two paradigms in a well-designed u-shaped architecture, we propose a hybrid yet effective CNN-Transformer network, named BRAU-Net++, for an accurate medical image segmentation task. Specifically, BRAU-Net++ uses bi-level routing attention as the core building block to design our u-shaped encoder-decoder structure, in which both encoder and decoder are hierarchically constructed, so as to learn global semantic information while reducing computational complexity. Furthermore, this network restructures skip connection by incorporating channel-spatial attention which adopts convolution operations, aiming to minimize local spatial information loss and amplify global dimension-interaction of multi-scale features. Extensive experiments on three public benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach surpasses other state-of-the-art methods including its baseline: BRAU-Net under almost all evaluation metrics. We achieve the average Dice-Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 82.47, 90.10, and 92.94 on Synapse multi-organ segmentation, ISIC-2018 Challenge, and CVC-ClinicDB, as well as the mIoU of 84.01 and 88.17 on ISIC-2018 Challenge and CVC-ClinicDB, respectively",

    "abstract": "The understanding of the convoluted evolution of infant brain networks during the first postnatal year is pivotal for identifying the dynamics of early brain connectivity development. Existing deep learning solutions suffer from three major limitations. First, they cannot generalize to multi-trajectory prediction tasks, where each graph trajectory corresponds to a particular imaging modality or connectivity type (e.g., T1-w MRI). Second, existing models require extensive training datasets to achieve satisfactory performance which are often challenging to obtain. Third, they do not efficiently utilize incomplete time series data. To address these limitations, we introduce FedGmTE-Net++, a federated graph-based multi-trajectory evolution network. Using the power of federation, we aggregate local learnings among diverse hospitals with limited datasets. As a result, we enhance the performance of each hospital's local generative model, while preserving data privacy. The three key innovations of FedGmTE-Net++ are: (i) presenting the first federated learning framework specifically designed for brain multi-trajectory evolution prediction in a data-scarce environment, (ii) incorporating an auxiliary regularizer in the local objective function to exploit all the longitudinal brain connectivity within the evolution trajectory and maximize data utilization, (iii) introducing a two-step imputation process, comprising a preliminary KNN-based precompletion followed by an imputation refinement step that employs regressors to improve similarity scores and refine imputations. Our comprehensive experimental results showed the outperformance of FedGmTE-Net++ in brain multi-trajectory prediction from a single baseline graph in comparison with benchmark methods",

    "abstract": "Generating 3D human models directly from text helps reduce the cost and time of character modeling. However, achieving multi-attribute controllable and realistic 3D human avatar generation is still challenging due to feature coupling and the scarcity of realistic 3D human avatar datasets. To address these issues, we propose Text2Avatar, which can generate realistic-style 3D avatars based on the coupled text prompts. Text2Avatar leverages a discrete codebook as an intermediate feature to establish a connection between text and avatars, enabling the disentanglement of features. Furthermore, to alleviate the scarcity of realistic style 3D human avatar data, we utilize a pre-trained unconditional 3D human avatar generation model to obtain a large amount of 3D avatar pseudo data, which allows Text2Avatar to achieve realistic style generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can generate realistic 3D avatars from coupled textual data, which is challenging for other existing methods in this field",

    "title": "Revisiting Nonlocal Self-Similarity from Continuous Representation",
    "volume": "Jan",
    "abstract": "Nonlocal self-similarity (NSS) is an important prior that has been successfully applied in multi-dimensional data processing tasks, e.g., image and video recovery. However, existing NSS-based methods are solely suitable for meshgrid data such as images and videos, but are not suitable for emerging off-meshgrid data, e.g., point cloud and climate data. In this work, we revisit the NSS from the continuous representation perspective and propose a novel Continuous Representation-based NonLocal method (termed as CRNL), which has two innovative features as compared with classical nonlocal methods. First, based on the continuous representation, our CRNL unifies the measure of self-similarity for on-meshgrid and off-meshgrid data and thus is naturally suitable for both of them. Second, the nonlocal continuous groups can be more compactly and efficiently represented by the coupled low-rank function factorization, which simultaneously exploits the similarity within each group and across different groups, while classical nonlocal methods neglect the similarity across groups. This elaborately designed coupled mechanism allows our method to enjoy favorable performance over conventional NSS methods in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. Extensive multi-dimensional data processing experiments on-meshgrid (e.g., image inpainting and image denoising) and off-meshgrid (e.g., climate data prediction and point cloud recovery) validate the versatility, effectiveness, and efficiency of our CRNL as compared with state-of-the-art methods",

    "volume": "Jan",
    "abstract": "In recent years, text-to-video retrieval methods based on CLIP have experienced rapid development. The primary direction of evolution is to exploit the much wider gamut of visual and textual cues to achieve alignment. Concretely, those methods with impressive performance often design a heavy fusion block for sentence (words)-video (frames) interaction, regardless of the prohibitive computation complexity. Nevertheless, these approaches are not optimal in terms of feature utilization and retrieval efficiency. To address this issue, we adopt multi-granularity visual feature learning, ensuring the model's comprehensiveness in capturing visual content features spanning from abstract to detailed levels during the training phase. To better leverage the multi-granularity features, we devise a two-stage retrieval architecture in the retrieval phase. This solution ingeniously balances the coarse and fine granularity of retrieval content. Moreover, it also strikes a harmonious equilibrium between retrieval effectiveness and efficiency. Specifically, in training phase, we design a parameter-free text-gated interaction block (TIB) for fine-grained video representation learning and embed an extra Pearson Constraint to optimize cross-modal representation learning. In retrieval phase, we use coarse-grained video representations for fast recall of top-k candidates, which are then reranked by fine-grained video representations. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness. Notably, our method achieves comparable performance with the current state-of-the-art methods while being nearly 50 times faster",

However, in Open Scene Semi-Supervised Object Detection (O-SSOD), unlabeled data may contains unknown objects not observed in the labeled data, which will increase uncertainty in the model's predictions for known objects. It is detrimental to the current methods that mainly rely on self-training, as more uncertainty leads to the lower localization and classification precision of pseudo labels. To this end, we propose Credible Teacher, an end-to-end framework. Credible Teacher adopts an interactive teaching mechanism using flexible labels to prevent uncertain pseudo labels from misleading the model and gradually reduces its uncertainty through the guidance of other credible pseudo labels.

    "abstract": "Cancer diagnosis is a well-studied problem in machine learning since early detection of cancer is often the determining factor in prognosis. Supervised deep learning achieves excellent results in cancer image classification, usually through transfer learning. However, these models require large amounts of labelled data and for several types of cancer, large labelled datasets do not exist. In this paper, we demonstrate that a model pre-trained using a self-supervised learning algorithm known as Barlow Twins can outperform the conventional supervised transfer learning pipeline. We juxtapose two base models: i) pretrained in a supervised fashion on ImageNet; ii) pretrained in a self-supervised fashion on ImageNet. Both are subsequently fine tuned on a small labelled skin lesion dataset and evaluated on a large test set. We achieve a mean test accuracy of 70\\% for self-supervised transfer in comparison to 66\\% for supervised transfer. Interestingly, boosting performance further is possible by self-supervised pretraining a second time (on unlabelled skin lesion images) before subsequent fine tuning. This hints at an alternative path to collecting more labelled data in settings where this is challenging - namely just collecting more unlabelled images. Our framework is applicable to cancer image classification models in the low-labelled data regime",

Incorrect parameter selection can significantly hinder ADMM's convergence rate. To address this challenge, in this paper we first propose a general approach to optimize the value of penalty parameter, followed by a novel closed-form formula to compute the optimal relaxation parameter in the context of linear quadratic problems (LQPs).

    "abstract": "Relative pose estimation for RGBD cameras is crucial in a number of applications. Previous approaches either rely on the RGB aspect of the images to estimate pose thus not fully making use of depth in the estimation process or estimate pose from the 3D cloud of points that each image produces, thus not making full use of RGB information. This paper shows that if one pair of correspondences is hypothesized from the RGB-based ranked-ordered correspondence list, then the space of remaining correspondences is restricted to corresponding pairs of curves nested around the hypothesized correspondence, implicitly capturing depth consistency. This simple Geometric Depth Constraint (GDC) significantly reduces potential matches. In effect this becomes a filter on possible correspondences that helps reduce the number of outliers and thus expedites RANSAC significantly. As such, the same budget of time allows for more RANSAC iterations and therefore additional robustness and a significant speedup. In addition, the paper proposed a Nested RANSAC approach that also speeds up the process, as shown through experiments on TUM, ICL-NUIM, and RGBD Scenes v2 datasets",

    "abstract": "Window-based transformers have demonstrated strong ability in large-scale point cloud understanding by capturing context-aware representations with affordable attention computation in a more localized manner. However, because of the sparse nature of point clouds, the number of voxels per window varies significantly. Current methods partition the voxels in each window into multiple subsets of equal size, which cost expensive overhead in sorting and padding the voxels, making them run slower than sparse convolution based methods. In this paper, we present ScatterFormer, which, for the first time to our best knowledge, could directly perform attention on voxel sets with variable length. The key of ScatterFormer lies in the innovative Scatter Linear Attention (SLA) module, which leverages the linear attention mechanism to process in parallel all voxels scattered in different windows. Harnessing the hierarchical computation units of the GPU and matrix blocking algorithm, we reduce the latency of the proposed SLA module to less than 1 ms on moderate GPUs. Besides, we develop a cross-window interaction module to simultaneously enhance the local representation and allow the information flow across windows, eliminating the need for window shifting. Our proposed ScatterFormer demonstrates 73 mAP (L2) on the large-scale Waymo Open Dataset and 70.5 NDS on the NuScenes dataset, running at an outstanding detection rate of 28 FPS.

Recent DML techniques utilize the proxy to interact with the corresponding image samples in the embedding space.

In this paper, we present a novel proxy-based DML framework that focuses on aligning the sample and proxy distributions to improve the efficiency of proxy-based DML losses. Specifically, we propose the Data-Augmented Domain Adaptation (DADA) method to adapt the domain gap between the group of samples and proxies. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to leverage domain adaptation to boost the performance of proxy-based DML.

Previous One-shot Generalizable Neural Radiance Fields (OG-NeRF) methods solve this task in an inference-time finetuning-free manner, yet suffer the blurry issue due to the encoder-only architecture that highly relies on the limited reference image. On the other hand, recent diffusion-based image-to-3d methods show vivid plausible results via distilling pre-trained 2D diffusion models into a 3D representation, yet require tedious per-scene optimization. Targeting these issues, we propose the GD$^2$-NeRF, a Generative Detail compensation framework via GAN and Diffusion that is both inference-time finetuning-free and with vivid plausible details. In detail, following a coarse-to-fine strategy, GD$^2$-NeRF is mainly composed of a One-stage Parallel Pipeline (OPP) and a 3D-consistent Detail Enhancer (Diff3DE). At the coarse stage, OPP first efficiently inserts the GAN model into the existing OG-NeRF pipeline for primarily relieving the blurry issue with in-distribution priors captured from the training dataset, achieving a good balance between sharpness (LPIPS, FID) and fidelity (PSNR, SSIM). Then, at the fine stage, Diff3DE further leverages the pre-trained image diffusion models to complement rich out-distribution details while maintaining decent 3D consistency. Extensive experiments on both the synthetic and real-world datasets show that GD$^2$-NeRF noticeably improves the details while without per-scene finetuning",

    "abstract": "In contrast to the well-investigated field of SAR-to-Optical translation, this study explores the lesser-investigated domain of Optical-to-SAR translation, a challenging field due to the ill-posed nature of this translation. The complexity arises as a single optical data can have multiple SAR representations based on the SAR viewing geometry. We propose a novel approach, termed SAR Temporal Shifting, which inputs an optical data from the desired timestamp along with a SAR data from a different temporal point but with a consistent viewing geometry as the expected SAR data, both complemented with a change map of optical data during the intervening period. This model modifies the SAR data based on the changes observed in optical data to generate the SAR data for the desired timestamp. Our model, a dual conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), named Temporal Shifting GAN (TSGAN), incorporates a siamese encoder in both the Generator and the Discriminator. To prevent the model from overfitting on the input SAR data, we employed a change weighted loss function. Our approach surpasses traditional translation methods by eliminating the GAN's fiction phenomenon, particularly in unchanged regions, resulting in higher SSIM and PSNR in these areas. Additionally, modifications to the Pix2Pix architecture and the inclusion of attention mechanisms have enhanced the model's performance on all regions of the data. This research paves the way for leveraging legacy optical datasets, the most abundant and longstanding source of Earth imagery data, extending their use to SAR domains and temporal analyses. To foster further research, we provide the code, datasets used in our study, and a framework for generating paired SAR-Optical datasets for new regions of interest.

    "abstract": "Efficiently finding optimal correspondences between point clouds is crucial for solving both rigid and non-rigid point cloud registration problems. Existing methods often rely on geometric or semantic feature embedding to establish correspondences and estimate transformations or flow fields. Recently, state-of-the-art methods have employed RAFT-like iterative updates to refine the solution. However, these methods have certain limitations. Firstly, their iterative refinement design lacks transparency, and their iterative updates follow a fixed path during the refinement process, which can lead to suboptimal results. Secondly, these methods overlook the importance of refining or optimizing correspondences (or matching matrices) as a precursor to solving transformations or flow fields. They typically compute candidate correspondences based on distances in the point feature space. However, they only project the candidate matching matrix into some matrix space once with Sinkhorn or dual softmax operations to obtain final correspondences. This one-shot projected matching matrix may be far from the globally optimal one, and these approaches do not consider the distribution of the target matching matrix. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that exploits the Denoising Diffusion Model to predict a searching gradient for the optimal matching matrix within the Doubly Stochastic Matrix Space. During the reverse denoising process, our method iteratively searches for better solutions along this denoising gradient, which points towards the maximum likelihood direction of the target matching matrix. Our method offers flexibility by allowing the search to start from any initial matching matrix provided by the online backbone or white noise.

EMAGE leverages masked body gesture priors during training to boost inference performance. It involves a Masked Audio Gesture Transformer, facilitating joint training on audio-to-gesture generation and masked gesture reconstruction to effectively encode audio and body gesture hints. Encoded body hints from masked gestures are then separately employed to generate facial and body movements. Moreover, EMAGE adaptively merges speech features from the audio's rhythm and content and utilizes four compositional VQ-VAEs to enhance the results' fidelity and diversity. Experiments demonstrate that EMAGE generates holistic gestures with state-of-the-art performance and is flexible in accepting predefined spatial-temporal gesture inputs, generating complete, audio-synchronized results.

    "title": "Diffusion Model with Perceptual Loss",
    "volume": "Jan",
    "abstract": "Diffusion models trained with mean squared error loss tend to generate unrealistic samples. Current state-of-the-art models rely on classifier-free guidance to improve sample quality, yet its surprising effectiveness is not fully understood. In this paper, We show that the effectiveness of classifier-free guidance partly originates from it being a form of implicit perceptual guidance. As a result, we can directly incorporate perceptual loss in diffusion training to improve sample quality. Since the score matching objective used in diffusion training strongly resembles the denoising autoencoder objective used in unsupervised training of perceptual networks, the diffusion model itself is a perceptual network and can be used to generate meaningful perceptual loss. We propose a novel self-perceptual objective that results in diffusion models capable of generating more realistic samples. For conditional generation, our method only improves sample quality without entanglement with the conditional input and therefore does not sacrifice sample diversity. Our method can also improve sample quality for unconditional generation, which was not possible with classifier-free guidance before",

    "title": "HEAP: Unsupervised Object Discovery and Localization with Contrastive Grouping",
    "volume": "Jan",
    "abstract": "Unsupervised object discovery and localization aims to detect or segment objects in an image without any supervision. Recent efforts have demonstrated a notable potential to identify salient foreground objects by utilizing self-supervised transformer features. However, their scopes only build upon patch-level features within an image, neglecting region/image-level and cross-image relationships at a broader scale. Moreover, these methods cannot differentiate various semantics from multiple instances. To address these problems, we introduce Hierarchical mErging framework via contrAstive grouPing (HEAP). Specifically, a novel lightweight head with cross-attention mechanism is designed to adaptively group intra-image patches into semantically coherent regions based on correlation among self-supervised features. Further, to ensure the distinguishability among various regions, we introduce a region-level contrastive clustering loss to pull closer similar regions across images. Also, an image-level contrastive loss is present to push foreground and background representations apart, with which foreground objects and background are accordingly discovered. HEAP facilitates efficient hierarchical image decomposition, which contributes to more accurate object discovery while also enabling differentiation among objects of various classes. Extensive experimental results on semantic segmentation retrieval, unsupervised object discovery, and saliency detection tasks demonstrate that HEAP achieves state-of-the-art performance",

    "abstract": "Estimating the 6D object pose from a single RGB image often involves noise and indeterminacy due to challenges such as occlusions and cluttered backgrounds. Meanwhile, diffusion models have shown appealing performance in generating high-quality images from random noise with high indeterminacy through step-by-step denoising. Inspired by their denoising capability, we propose a novel diffusion-based framework (6D-Diff) to handle the noise and indeterminacy in object pose estimation for better performance. In our framework, to establish accurate 2D-3D correspondence, we formulate 2D keypoints detection as a reverse diffusion (denoising) process. To facilitate such a denoising process, we design a Mixture-of-Cauchy-based forward diffusion process and condition the reverse process on the object features. Extensive experiments on the LM-O and YCB-V datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework",

    "abstract": "The laws of model size, data volume, computation and model performance have been extensively studied in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). However, the scaling laws in Optical Character Recognition (OCR) have not yet been investigated. To address this, we conducted comprehensive studies that involved examining the correlation between performance and the scale of models, data volume and computation in the field of text recognition.Conclusively, the study demonstrates smooth power laws between performance and model size, as well as training data volume, when other influencing factors are held constant. Additionally, we have constructed a large-scale dataset called REBU-Syn, which comprises 6 million real samples and 18 million synthetic samples. Based on our scaling law and new dataset, we have successfully trained a scene text recognition model, achieving a new state-ofthe-art on 6 common test benchmarks with a top-1 average accuracy of 97.42%",

    "title": "An Improved Baseline for Reasoning Segmentation with Large Language Model",
    "volume": "Jan",
    "abstract": "While LISA effectively bridges the gap between segmentation and large language models to enable reasoning segmentation, it poses certain limitations: unable to distinguish different instances of the target region, and constrained by the pre-defined textual response formats. In this work, we introduce LISA++, an update to the existing LISA model, focusing on improving core functionalities while keeping the base architecture intact. The main enhancements in LISA++ include: \\textbf{1) Enhanced Segmentation}: The instance segmentation ability has been added, providing a more detailed scene analysis along with the existing multi-region semantic segmentation. \\textbf{2) More Natural Conversation}: Improved capability for multi-turn dialogue, with the ability to incorporate segmentation results directly into text responses, i.e., Segmentation in Dialogue (SiD). These improvements are achieved by curating the existing samples of generic segmentation datasets, aimed specifically at enhancing the segmentation and conversational skills without structural change and additional data sources. Comparative analysis with the original LISA model shows significant advancements in these areas, positioning LISA++ as a notable upgrade in visual understanding and interaction. LISA++'s adaptability and improved features highlight the versatility of the mask-as-embedding paradigm proposed by LISA, and the potential as a foundational model for diverse applications",

    "title": "KeDuSR: Real-World Dual-Lens Super-Resolution via Kernel-Free Matching",
    "volume": "Jan",
    "abstract": "Dual-lens super-resolution (SR) is a practical scenario for reference (Ref) based SR by utilizing the telephoto image (Ref) to assist the super-resolution of the low-resolution wide-angle image (LR input). Different from general RefSR, the Ref in dual-lens SR only covers the overlapped field of view (FoV) area. However, current dual-lens SR methods rarely utilize these specific characteristics and directly perform dense matching between the LR input and Ref. Due to the resolution gap between LR and Ref, the matching may miss the best-matched candidate and destroy the consistent structures in the overlapped FoV area. Different from them, we propose to first align the Ref with the center region (namely the overlapped FoV area) of the LR input by combining global warping and local warping to make the aligned Ref be sharp and consistent. Then, we formulate the aligned Ref and LR center as value-key pairs, and the corner region of the LR is formulated as queries. In this way, we propose a kernel-free matching strategy by matching between the LR-corner (query) and LR-center (key) regions, and the corresponding aligned Ref (value) can be warped to the corner region of the target. Our kernel-free matching strategy avoids the resolution gap between LR and Ref, which makes our network have better generalization ability. In addition, we construct a DuSR-Real dataset with (LR, Ref, HR) triples, where the LR and HR are well aligned. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the second-best method by a large margin. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/ZifanCui/KeDuSR",
