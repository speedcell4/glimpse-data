    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The blending of facial images is an effective way to fuse attributes such that the synthesis is robust to the finer details (e.g., periocular-region, nostrils, hairlines). Specifically, facial blending aims to transfer the style of a source image to a target such that violations in the natural appearance are minimized. Despite the many practical applications, facial image blending remains mostly unexplored with the reasons being two-fold: 1) the lack of quality paired data for supervision and 2) facial synthesizers (i.e., the models) are sensitive to small variations in lighting, texture, resolution and age. We address the reasons for the bottleneck by first building Facial Pairs to Blend (FPB) dataset, which was generated through our facial attribute optimization algorithm. Then, we propose an effective normalization scheme to capture local statistical information during blending: namely, Local Instance Normalization (LAN). Lastly, a novel local-reshuffle-layer is designed to map local patches in the feature space, which can be learned in an end-to-end fashion with dedicated loss. This new layer is essential for the proposed Localin Reshuffle Network (LRNet). Extensive experiments, and both quantitative and qualitative results, demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Despite the availability of many Markov Random Field (MRF) optimization algorithms, their widespread usage is currently limited due to imperfect MRF modelling arising from hand-crafted model parameters and the selection of inferior inference algorithm. In addition to differentiability, the two main aspects that enable learning these model parameters are the forward and backward propagation time of the MRF optimization algorithm and its inference capabilities. In this work, we introduce two fast and differentiable message passing algorithms, namely, Iterative Semi-Global Matching Revised (ISGMR) and Parallel Tree-Reweighted Message Passing (TRWP) which are greatly sped up on a GPU by exploiting massive parallelism. Specifically, ISGMR is an iterative and revised version of the standard SGM for general pairwise MRFs with improved optimization effectiveness, and TRWP is a highly parallel version of Sequential TRW (TRWS) for faster optimization. Our experiments on the standard stereo and denoising benchmarks demonstrated that ISGMR and TRWP achieve much lower energies than SGM and Mean-Field (MF), and TRWP is two orders of magnitude faster than TRWS without losing effectiveness in optimization. We further demonstrated the effectiveness of our algorithms on end-to-end learning for semantic segmentation. Notably, our CUDA implementations are at least 7 and 700 times faster than PyTorch GPU implementations for forward and backward propagation respectively, enabling efficient end-to-end learning with message passing",

Two popular methods, recurrent neural networks and feed-forward deep networks, are able to predict rough motion trend, but motion details such as limb movement may be lost. To predict more accurate future human motion, we propose an Adversarial Refinement Network (ARNet) following a simple yet effective coarse-to-fine mechanism with novel adversarial error augmentation. Specifically, we take both the historical motion sequences and coarse prediction as input of our cascaded refinement network to predict refined human motion and strengthen the refinement network with adversarial error augmentation. During training, we deliberately introduce the error distribution by learning through the adversarial mechanism among different subjects. In testing, our cascaded refinement network alleviates the prediction error from the coarse predictor resulting in accurate prediction robustly. This adversarial error augmentation provides rich error cases as input to our refinement network, leading to better generalization performance on the testing dataset.

When the number of classes is large, classes are usually represented by semantic class prototypes learned automatically from unannotated text collections. This typically leads to much lower performances than with manually designed semantic prototypes such as attributes. While most ZSL works focus on the visual aspect and reuse standard semantic prototypes learned from generic text collections, we focus on the problem of semantic class prototype design for large scale ZSL. More specifically, we investigate the use of noisy textual metadata associated to photos as text collections, as we hypothesize they are likely to provide more plausible semantic embeddings for visual classes if exploited appropriately. We thus make use of a source-based filtering strategy to improve the robustness of semantic prototypes. Evaluation on the large scale ImageNet dataset shows a significant improvement in ZSL performances over two strong baselines, and over usual semantic embeddings used in previous works. We show that this improvement is obtained for several embedding methods, leading to state of the art results when one uses automatically created visual and text features",

To make the skeleton movement realistic and expressive, we embed the knowledge of an articulated 3D human skeleton and a learned dictionary of personal speech iconic gestures into the generation process in both learning and testing pipelines. The former prevents the generation of unreasonable body distortion, while the later helps our model quickly learn meaningful body movement through a few recorded videos. To produce photo-realistic and high-resolution video with motion details, we propose to insert part attention mechanisms in the conditional GAN, where each detailed part, e.g. head and hand, is automatically zoomed in to have their own discriminators.

Then the same linear combinations are applied in the embedding space to generate hypothesis embedding for the target domain sample, remaining prediction consistency. The deviation between the target and source domain is reduced by approximating the predicted and hypothesis embedding for the target domain sample. Guided by the proposed strategy, we design Domain Adaptation Gaze Estimation Network(DAGEN), which learns embedding with prediction consistency and achieves state-of-the-art results on both the MPIIGaze and the EYEDIAP datasets",

Given a sketch, with no semantic tagging, and a reference image of a specific style, the model can synthesize meaningful details with colors and textures. Based on the GAN framework, the model consists of three novel modules designed explicitly for better artistic style capturing and generation. To enforce the content faithfulness, we introduce the dual-masked mechanism which directly shapes the feature maps according to sketch. To capture more artistic style aspects, we design feature-map transformation for a better style consistency to the reference image. Finally, an inverse process of instance-normalization disentangles the style and content information and further improves the synthesis quality. Experiments demonstrate a significant qualitative and quantitative boost over baseline models based on previous state-of-the-art techniques, modified for the proposed task (17% better Frechet Inception distance and 18% better style classification score).

The context embedding module extracts and embeds the global context information of a given frame into a local feature representation such that the information can be utilized in the final classification stage.

Based on that, we construct a RAW-Guiding exposure time adjustment Network (RGNET), which overcomes RGB images' nonlinearity and RAW images' inaccessibility. That is, RGNET is only trained with RGB images and corresponding RAW images, which helps project nonlinear RGB images into a linear domain, simultaneously without using RAW images in the testing phase. Furthermore, our network consists of three individual sub-modules for unprocessing, reconstruction and processing, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed sub-net for unprocessing is the first learning-based unprocessing method.

Recent work has introduced volumetric, implicit and model-based shape learning frameworks for reconstruction of objects and people from one or more images. However, the accuracy and completeness for reconstruction of clothed people is limited due to the large variation in shape resulting from clothing, hair, body size, pose and camera viewpoint. This paper introduces two advances to overcome this limitation: firstly a new synthetic dataset of realistic clothed people, 3DVH;and secondly, a novel multiple-view loss function for training of monocular volumetric shape estimation, which is demonstrated to significantly improve generalisation and reconstruction accuracy. The 3DVH dataset of realistic clothed 3D human models rendered with diverse natural backgrounds is demonstrated to allows transfer to reconstruction from real images of people. Comprehensive comparative performance evaluation on both synthetic and real images of people demonstrates that the proposed method significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art learning-based single image 3D human shape estimation approaches achieving significant improvement of reconstruction accuracy, completeness, and quality. An ablation study shows that this is due to both the proposed multiple-view training and the new 3DVH dataset.

The key problem is how to efficiently learn and fuse cross-camera information for improved presentation in such heterogeneous setup with domain gaps (e.g., color vs. monochrome, HSR vs. LSR).  We have divided the end-to-end pipeline into three consecutive modularized sub-tasks, including the reference-based exposure compensation (RefEC), reference-based colorization (RefColor)  and reference-based super-resolution (RefSR), to alleviate domain gaps and capture inter-camera dynamics between hybrid inputs.

Due to the fixed top-down perspective of X-ray scanning of often tightly packed luggages, such images typically suffer from penetration-induced occlusions, severe object overlapping and violent changes in appearance. For this particular application, few research efforts have been made. To deal with the overlapping in X-ray images classification, we propose a novel Security X-ray Multi-label Classification Network (SXMNet). Our hypothesis is that different overlapping levels and scale variations are the primary challenges in the multi-label classification problem of prohibited items. To address these challenges, we propose to incorporate 1) spatial attention to locate prohibited items despite shape, color and texture variations; and 2) anisotropic fusion of per-stage predictions to dynamically fuse hierarchical visual information under violent variations. Motivated by these, our SXMNet is boosted by bottom-up attention and neural-guided Meta Fusion. Raw input image is exploited to generate high-quality attention masks in a bottom-up way for pyramid feature refinement. Subsequently, the per-stage predictions according to the refined features are automatically re-weighted and fused via a soft selection guided by neural knowledge.

It includes three modules. At first, the position and channel co-attention fusion modules adaptively fuse color and depth features in spatial and channel dimension. Finally, a final fusion module integrates the outputs of the two co-attention fusion modules for forming a more representative feature. Our extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of CANet in fusing RGB and D features, achieving the state-of-the-art performance on two challenging RGB-D semantic segmentation datasets, i.e., NYUDv2, SUN-RGBD",

Previous works generally focus on how to collect contextual information by enlarging the size of receptive field, such as PSPNet, DenseASPP. In contrast to previous works, this paper proposes a new network -- CycleNet, which considers assigning a more accurate representative for every pixel. It consists of two modules, Cycle Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (CycleASPP) and Alignment with Deformable Convolution (ADC). The former realizes dense connections between a series of atrous convolution layers with different dilation rates. Not only the forward connections can aggregate more contextual information, but also the backward connections can pay more attention to important information by transferring high-level features to low-level layers. Besides, ADC generates accurate information during the decoding process. It draws support from deformable convolution to select and recombine features from different blocks, thus improving the misalignment issues caused by simple interpolation. A set of experiments have been conducted on Cityscapes and ADE20K to demonstrate the effectiveness of CycleNet. In particular, our model achieved 46.14% mIoU on ADE20K validation set",

    "abstract": "Multi-task learning (MTL) aims to learn shared representations from multiple tasks simultaneously, which has yielded outstanding performance in widespread applications of computer vision. However, existing multi-task approaches often demand manual design on network architectures, including shared backbone and individual branches. In this work, we propose MTNAS, a practical and principled neural architecture search algorithm for multi-task learning. We focus on searching for the overall optimized network architecture with task-specific branches and task-shared backbone. Specifically, the MTNAS pipeline consists of two searching stages: branch search and backbone search. For branch search, we separately optimize each branch structure for each target task. For backbone search, we first design a pre-searching procedure t1o pre-optimize the backbone structure on ImageNet. We observe that searching on such auxiliary large-scale data can not only help learn low-/mid-level features but also offer good initialization of backbone structure. After backbone pre-searching, we further optimize the backbone structure for learning task-shared knowledge under the overall multi-task guidance. We apply MTNAS to joint learning of object detection and semantic segmentation for autonomous driving. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our searched multi-task model achieves superior performance for each task and consumes less computation complexity compared to prior hand-crafted MTL baselines.

    "abstract": "Current works on multimodal facial expression recognition typically require paired visible and thermal facial images. Although visible cameras are readily available in our daily life, thermal cameras are expensive and less prevalent. It is costly to collect a large quantity of synchronous visible and thermal facial images. To tackle this paired training data bottleneck, we propose an unpaired multimodal facial expression recognition method, which makes full use of the massive number of unpaired visible and thermal images by utilizing thermal images to construct better image representations and classifiers for visible images during training. Specifically, two deep neural networks are trained from visible and thermal images to learn image representations and expression classifiers for two modalities. Then, an adversarial strategy is adopted to force statistical similarity between the learned visible and thermal representations, and to minimize the distribution mismatch between the predictions of the visible and thermal images. Through adversarial learning, the proposed method leverages thermal images to construct better image representations and classifiers for visible images during training, without the requirement of paired data. A decoder network is built upon the visible hidden features in order to preserve some inherent features of the visible view. We also take the variability of the different images' transferability into account via adaptive classification loss. During testing, only visible images are required and the visible network is used. Thus, the proposed method is appropriate for real-world scenarios, since thermal imaging is rare in these instances. Experiments on two benchmark multimodal expression databases and three visible facial expression databases demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art methods",

Extending from StarGAN's architecture, DotFAN integrates with two additional subnetworks, i.e., face expert model (FEM) and face shape regressor (FSR), for latent facial code control. While FSR aims to extract face attributes, FEM is designed to capture a face identity. With their aid, DotFAN can separately learn facial feature codes and effectively generate face images of various facial attributes while keeping the identity of augmented faces unaltered.

This poses the challenge of adapting models learned on the unrealistic synthetic domain to real images. To this end we develop a novel autoencoder-based approach that uses synthetic labels unaligned with particular images for adapting to target domain data.

Our overall system achieves state-of-the-art performance in sound source localization, and more importantly, we find that despite the constraint on available information, the results of (i) achieve similar performance.

To address this, we propose a two-step model. First, the images are converted to raw image data before adding noise. We then trained a GAN to estimate the noise distribution over a large collection of images (1 million). The estimated noise was used to train a deep neural network denoiser.

Using the information from an IMU, the y-axes of cameras can be aligned with the gravity, reducing their relative orientation to a single DOF (degree of freedom). In this paper, we use the gravity information to derive extremely efficient minimal solvers for homography-based egomotion estimation from orientation- and scale-covariant features. We use the fact that orientation- and scale-covariant features, such as SIFT or ORB, provide additional constraints on the homography. Based on the prior knowledge about the target plane (horizontal/vertical/general plane, w.r.t. the gravity direction) and using the SIFT/ORB constraints, we derive new minimal solvers that require fewer correspondences than traditional approaches and, thus, speed up the robust estimation procedure significantly. The proposed solvers are compared with the state-of-the-art point-based solvers on both synthetic data and real images, showing comparable accuracy and significant improvement in terms of speed.

However, the structure between the semantic units in images (usually the detected regions from object detection model) and sentences (each single word) is different.

The investigation on rain removal has thus been attracting, while the performances of existing deraining have limitations owing to over smoothing effect, poor generalization capability and rain intensity varies both in spatial locations and color channels. To address these issues, we proposed a Multi-scale Attentive Residual Dense Network called MARD-Net in end-to-end manner, to exactly extract the negative rain streaks from rainy images while precisely preserving the image details. The architecture of modified dense network can be used to exploit the rain streaks details representation through feature reuse and propagation. Further, the Multi-scale Attentive Residual Block (MARB) is involved in the dense network to guide the rain streaks feature extraction and representation capability. Since contextual information is very critical for deraining, MARB first uses different convolution kernels along with fusion to extract multi-scale rain features and employs feature attention module to identify rain streaks regions and color channels, as well as has the skip connections to aggregate features at multiple levels and accelerate convergence. The proposed method is extensively evaluated on several frequent-use synthetic and real-world datasets. The quantitative and qualitative results show that the designed framework performs better than the recent state-of-the-art deraining approaches on promoting the rain removal performance and preserving image details under various rain streaks cases",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in pruning of neural networks have made it possible to remove a large number of filters or weights without any perceptible drop in accuracy. The number of parameters and that of FLOPs are usually the reported metrics to measure the quality of the pruned models. However, the gain in speed for these pruned models is often overlooked in the literature due to the complex nature of latency measurements. In this paper, we show the limitation of filter pruning methods in terms of latency reduction and propose LayerPrune framework. LayerPrune presents a set of layer pruning methods based on different criteria that achieve higher latency reduction than filter pruning methods on similar accuracy. The advantage of layer pruning over filter pruning in terms of latency reduction is a result of the fact that the former is not constrained by the original model's depth and thus allows for a larger range of latency reduction. For each filter pruning method we examined, we use the same filter importance criterion to calculate a per-layer importance score in one-shot. We then prune the least important layers and fine-tune the shallower model which obtains comparable or better accuracy than its filter-based pruning counterpart. This one-shot process allows to remove layers from single path networks like VGG before fine-tuning, unlike in iterative filter pruning, a minimum number of filters per layer is required to allow for data flow which constraint the search space. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to examine the effect of pruning methods on latency metric instead of FLOPs for multiple networks, datasets and hardware targets. LayerPrune also outperforms handcrafted architectures such as Shufflenet, MobileNet, MNASNet and ResNet18 by 7.3%, 4.6%, 2.8% and 0.5% respectively on similar latency budget on ImageNet dataset",

However, most of the current algorithms struggle to scale to city-size environments mainly because of the need to collect large (semi-)annotated datasets for CNN training and create databases for test environment of images, keypoint level features or image embeddings. This data acquisition is not only expensive and time-consuming but also may cause privacy concerns. In this work, we propose a novel framework for semantic visual localization in city-scale environments which alleviates the aforementioned problem by using freely available 2D maps such as OpenStreetMap. Our method does not require any images or image-map pairs for training or test environment database collection. Instead, a robust embedding is learned from a depth and building instance label information of a particular location in the 2D map. At test time, this embedding is extracted from a panoramic building instance label and depth images. It is then used to retrieve the closest match in the database.We evaluate our localization framework on two large-scale datasets consisting of Cambridge and San Francisco cities with a total length of drivable roads spanning over 500 km and including approximately 110k unique locations.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "With the growing attention on learning-to-learn new tasks using only a few examples, meta-learning has been widely used in numerous problems such as few-shot classification, reinforcement learning, and domain generalization. However, meta-learning models are prone to overfitting when there are no sufficient training tasks for the meta-learners to generalize. Although existing approaches such as Dropout are widely used to address the overfitting problem, these methods are typically designed for regularizing models of a single task in supervised training.In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective method to alleviate the risk of overfitting for gradient-based meta-learning. Specifically, during the gradient-based adaptation stage, we randomly drop the gradient in the inner-loop optimization of each parameter in deep neural networks, such that the augmented gradients improve generalization to new tasks. We present a general form of the proposed gradient dropout regularization and show that this term can be sampled from either the Bernoulli or Gaussian distribution. To validate the proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments and analysis on numerous computer vision tasks, demonstrating that the gradient dropout regularization mitigates the overfitting problem and improves the performance upon various gradient-based meta-learning frameworks",

Many existing approaches often predict head poses by localizing facial landmarks and then solve 2D to 3D correspondence problem with a mean head model. Such approaches completely rely on the landmark detection accuracy, an ad-hoc alignment step, and the extraneous head model. To address this drawback, we present an end-to-end deep network, which explores rotation axis (yaw, pitch, and roll) focused innovative attention mechanism to capture the subtle changes in images. The mechanism uses attentional spatial pooling from a self-attention layer and learns the importance over fine-grained to coarse spatial structures and combine them to capture rich semantic information concerning a given rotation axis. The experimental evaluation of our approach using three benchmark datasets is very competitive to state-of-the-art methods, including with and without landmark-based approaches",

The loss of spatial importance negatively affects the performance of hash learning and thus reduces its accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a new deep hashing method with weighted spatial information, which generates hash codes by using discrete spatial importance distribution. In particular, to extract the discrete spatial importance information of images effectively, we propose a method to learn the spatial attention map and hash code simultaneously, which makes the spatial attention map more conductive to hash-based retrieval.

Owing to the disentangled makeup representation, our method can not only flexible control the degree of local makeup styles, but also can transfer local makeup styles from different images into the final result, which any other approaches fail to handle. For makeup removal, different from other methods which regard makeup removal as the reverse process of makeup transfer, we integrate the makeup transfer with the makeup removal into one uniform framework and obtain multiple makeup removal results.

Existing Re-ID studies focus on the short-term cloth-consistent setting, under which a person re-appears in different camera views with the same outfit. A discriminative feature representation learned by existing deep Re-ID models is thus dominated by the visual appearance of clothing.  In this work, we focus on a much more difficult yet practical setting where person matching is conducted over long-duration, e.g., over days and months and therefore inevitably under the new challenge of changing clothes. This problem, termed Long-Term Cloth-Changing (LTCC) Re-ID is much understudied due to the lack of large scale datasets. The first contribution of this work is a new LTCC dataset containing people captured over a long period of time with frequent clothing changes. As a second contribution, we propose a novel Re-ID method specifically designed to address the cloth-changing challenge. Specifically, we consider that under cloth-changes, soft-biometrics such as body shape would be more reliable. We, therefore, introduce a shape embedding module as well as a cloth-elimination shape-distillation module aiming to eliminate the now unreliable clothing appearance features and focus on the body shape information.

In a multi-view data set, where objects deform in a non-rigid manner, a rigid transformation occurs only between two views taken at the exact same time, i.e., when they are synchronized.We demonstrate the effectiveness of the synchronization task on the Human3.6M data set and achieve state-of-the-art results in 3D human pose estimation",

Most existing methods canbe broadly categorized into two classes: top-down and bottom-up meth-ods. Both of the two types of methods involve two stages, namely, persondetection and joints detection. Conventionally, the two stages are imple-mented separately without considering their interactions between them,and this may inevitably cause some issue intrinsically.

Some global attributes, e.g., the action of the person, can be critical to 3D HPE, especially in the case of occlusion or depth ambiguity. To address this issue, this paper introduces a new 3D HPE framework by learning global pose features in GCNs. Specifically, we add a global node to the graph and connect it to all the body joint nodes. On one hand, global features are updated by aggregating all body joint features to model the global attributes. On the other hand, the feature update of each body joint depends on not only their neighbors but also the global node. Furthermore, we propose a heterogeneous multi-task learning framework to learn the local and global features. While each local node regresses the 3D coordinate of the corresponding body joint, we force the global node to classify an action category or learn a low-dimensional pose embedding.

Moreover, in the case of sparse data, it is incorrect to assume that the same point will be captured in two consecutive scans.

In this re-parameterized data, there exists a large number of line intersection (and not correspondence) constraints that allow us to solve the registration task. We propose the use of a two-step alternating projection algorithm by formulating the registration as the simultaneous satisfaction of intersection and rigidity constraints.

However, a separately trained SOT network is not directly adaptable because domains can differ, and handcrafted rules contain a considerable number of hyperparameters, thus making  it difficult to optimize the MOT method. To address this issue, we propose a versatile affinity network (VAN) that can perform the entire MOT process in a single network including target specific SOT to handle incomplete detection issues, affinity computation between target and candidates, and decision of tracking termination. We train the VAN in an end-to-end manner by using event-aware learning that is designed to reduce the potential error caused by FNs, FPs, and identity switching. The proposed VAN significantly reduces the number of hyperparameters and handcrafted rules required for the MOT framework and successfully improves the MOT performance. We implement the VAN using two baselines with different candidate refinement methods to demonstrate the effects of the proposed VAN. We also conduct extensive experiments including ablation studies on three public benchmark datasets: 2D MOT2015, MOT2016, and MOT2017.

Current approaches based on the tracking by detection paradigm either require some sort of domain knowledge or supervision to associate data correctly into tracks. In this work, we present a self-supervised multiple object tracking approach based on visual features and minimum cost lifted multicuts. Our method is based on straight-forward spatio-temporal cues that can be extracted from neighboring frames in an image sequences without supervision. Clustering based on these cues enables us to learn the required appearance invariances for the tracking task at hand and train an AutoEncoder to generate suitable latent representations. Thus, the resulting latent representations can serve as robust appearance cues for tracking even over large temporal distances where no reliable spatio-temporal features can be extracted. We show that, despite being trained without using the provided annotations, our model provides competitive results on the challenging MOT Benchmark for pedestrian tracking",

Current approaches are based on inference processes that rely on the result of a single modality classifier (visual, semantic, or latent joint space) that balances the classification between the seen and unseen classes using gating mechanisms. There are a couple of problems with such approaches: 1) multi-modal classifiers are known to generally be more accurate than single modality classifiers, and 2) gating mechanisms rely on a complex one-class training of an external domain classifier that modulates the seen and unseen classifiers. In this paper, we mitigate these issues by proposing a novel GZSL method -- augmentation network that tackles multi-modal and multi-domain inference for generalised zero-shot learning (AN-GZSL). The multi-modal inference combines visual and semantic classification and automatically balances the seen and unseen classification using temperature calibration, without requiring any gating mechanisms or external domain classifiers. Experiments show that our method produces the new state-of-the-art GZSL results for fine-grained benchmark data sets CUB and FLO and for the large-scale data set ImageNet.

For instance, EdgeCRF based on patches extracted from colour edges works effectively only when the presence of noise is insignificant, which is not the case for many real images; and, CRFNet, a recent method based on fully supervised deep learning works only for the CRFs that are in the training data, and hence fail to deal with other possible CRFs beyond the training data. To address these problems, we introduce a non-deep-learning method using prediction consistency and gradual refinement. First, we rely more on the patches of the input image that provide more consistent predictions. If the predictions from a patch are more consistent, it means that the patch is likely to be less affected by noise or any inferior colour combinations, and hence, it can be more reliable for CRF estimation. Second, we employ a gradual refinement scheme in which we start from a simple CRF model to generate a result which is more robust to noise but less accurate, and then we gradually increase the model's complexity to improve the estimation. This is because a simple model, while being less accurate, overfits less to noise than a complex model does.

    "abstract": "Recent works have demonstrated superior results for depth estimation from a stereo pair of images using convolutional neural networks. However, these methods require large amounts of computational resources and are not suited to real-time applications on edge devices. In this work, we propose a novel method for real-time stereo matching on edge devices, which consists of an efficient backbone for feature extraction, an attention-aware feature aggregation, and a cascaded 3D CNN architecture for multi-scale disparity estimation. The efficient backbone is designed to generate multi-scale feature maps with constrained computational power. The multi-scale feature maps are further adaptively aggregated via the proposed attention-aware feature aggregation module to improve representational capacity of features. Multi-scale cost volumes are constructed using aggregated feature maps and regularized using a cascaded 3D CNN architecture to estimate disparity maps in anytime settings. The network infers a disparity map at low resolution and then progressively refines the disparity maps at higher resolutions by calculating the disparity residuals. Because of the efficient extraction and aggregation of informative features, the proposed method can achieve accurate depth estimation in real-time inference. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method processed stereo image pairs with resolution 1242x375 at 12-33 fps on an NVIDIA Jetson TX2 module and achieved competitive accuracy in depth estimation.

We call such an intermediate layer a semantic bottleneck.Once the attributes are learned, they can be re-combined to reach the final decision and provide both an accurate prediction and an explicit reasoning behind the CNN decision.In this paper, we look into semantic bottlenecks that capture context: we want attributes to be in groups of a few meaningful elements and participate jointly to the final decision.We use a two-layer semantic bottleneck that gathers attributes into interpretable, sparse groups, allowing them contribute differently to the final output depending on the context.We test our contextual semantic interpretable bottleneck (CSIB) on the task of landscape scenicness estimation and train the semantic interpretable bottleneck using an auxiliary database (SUN Attributes).Our model yields in predictions as accurate as a non-interpretable baseline when applied to a real-world test set of Flickr images, all while providing clear and interpretable explanations for each prediction",

The labels are further used in semi-supervised learning scenarios. Motivated by the lack of a large video aerial dataset, we also introduce Ruralscapes, a new dataset with high resolution (4K) images and manually annotated dense labels every 50 frames - the largest of its kind, to the best of our knowledge. Our novel SegProp automatically annotates the remaining unlabeled 98% of frames with an accuracy exceeding 90% (F-measure), significantly outperforming other state-of-the-art label propagation methods. Moreover, when integrating other methods as modules inside SegProp's iterative label propagation loop, we achieve a significant boost over the baseline labels. Finally, we test SegProp in a full semi-supervised setting: we train several state-of-the-art deep neural networks on the SegProp-automatically-labeled training frames and test them on completely novel videos.

Apart from open-set problem, we find that imbalanced training data  is another main factor causing the performance degradation of FR and re-ID, and data imbalance  widely exists in the real applications. However, very little research explores why and how data imbalance influences the performance of FR and re-ID. In this work, we deeply investigate data imbalance in the perspective of neural network optimisation and feature distribution. We find one main reason of performance degradation caused by data imbalance is that the weights (from the penultimate fully-connected layer) are far from their class centers in feature space. Based on this investigation, we propose a unified framework, Imbalance-Robust Softmax (IR-Softmax), which can simultaneously solve the open-set problem and reduce the influence of data imbalance. IR-Softmax can generalise to any softmax and its variants (which are discriminative for open-set problem) by directly setting the weights as their class centers, naturally solving the data imbalance problem. In this work, we explicitly re-formulate two discriminative softmax (A-Softmax [??] and AM-Softmax [??]) under the framework of IR-Softmax.

This model, however, depends fully on the quality of the input image. Degraded image case, such as the motion-blurred issue, downgrades the quality of the reconstructed 3D body. This issue becomes severe as recent motion deblurring methods mainly focused on solving the camera motion case while ignoring the blur caused by human-articulated motion. In this work, we construct a localized adversarial framework that solves both human-articulated and camera motion blurs. To achieve this, we utilize the result of the restored image in a 3D body reconstruction module and produces a localized map. The map is employed to guide the adversarial modules on learning both the human body and scene regions. Nevertheless, training these modules straight-away is impractical since the recent blurry dataset is not supported by the 3D body predictor module. To settle this issue, we generate a novel dataset that simulates realistic blurry human motion while maintaining the presence of camera motion.

Our face normalization mainly acts on the aspect of image resolution, closely related to face super-resolution. However, previous face super-resolution methods require paired training data with pixel-to-pixel correspondence, which is typically unavailable between real-world low-resolution and high-resolution faces. FAN can leverage both paired and unpaired data as we disentangle the features into identity and non-identity components and adapt the distribution of the identity features, which breaks the limit of current face super-resolution methods.

The loss leverages both image- and patch-level predictions to generate auxiliary supervision and enables specific training at patch-level. Rather than forming strictly binary from the predictions as done in previous loss formulations, we create targets in a more customized manner.This way, the loss accounts for possible misclassification of less certain instances.

In this paper, we consider the background as an important cue that guides the feature activation to cover the sophisticated object region and propose contrastive attention loss. The loss promotes similarity between foreground and its dropped version, and, dissimilarity between the dropped version and background. Furthermore, we propose foreground consistency loss that penalizes earlier layers producing noisy attention regarding the later layer as a reference to provide them with a sense of backgroundness. It guides the early layers to activate on objects rather than locally distinctive backgrounds so that their attentions to be similar to the later layer. For better optimizing the above losses, we use the non-local attention blocks to replace channel-pooled attention leading to enhanced attention maps considering the spatial similarity.

    "abstract": "As scene segmentation systems reach visually accurate results, many recent papers focus on making these network architectures faster, smaller and more efficient. In particular, studies often aim at designing `real-time' systems. Achieving this goal is particularly relevant in the context of real-time video understanding for autonomous vehicles, and robots.In this paper, we argue that the commonly used performance metric of mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) does not fully capture the information required to estimate the true performance of these networks when they operate in `real-time'.We propose a change of objective in the segmentation task, and its associated metric that encapsulates this missing information in the following way: We propose to predict the future output segmentation map that will match the future input frame at the time when the network finishes the processing.We introduce the associated latency-aware metric, from which we can determine a ranking.We perform latency timing experiments of some recent networks on different hardware and assess the performances of these networks on our proposed task. We propose improvements to scene segmentation networks to better perform on our task by using multi-frames input and increasing capacity in the initial convolutional layers",

This study can be distinguished from other studies in the customization made for the VGG16 model, the diversity of the datasets adopted, the duration of disc segmentation, the loss function utilized, and the number of parameters required to train our model. Our approach was tested on seven publicly available datasets augmented by a dataset from a private clinic that was annotated by two Doctors of Optometry through a web portal built for this purpose. We achieved an accuracy of 99.78% and a Dice coefficient of 94.73% for a disc segmentation from a retinal image in 0.03 seconds.

We manually labeled a subset of the 2D-3D Semantics(2D-3D-S) dataset with bounding boxes, and introduce our 2D-3D inference module to generate accurate pixel-wise segment proposal masks. Guided by 3D information, we first generate a point cloud of objects and calculate objectness probability score for each point. Then we project the point cloud with objectness probabilities back to 2D images followed by a refinement step to obtain segment proposals, which are treated as pseudo labels to train a semantic segmentation network. Our method works in a recursive manner to gradually refine the above-mentioned segment proposals. Extensive experimental results on the 2D-3D-S dataset show that the proposed method can generate accurate segment proposals when bounding box labels are available on only a small subset of training images.

A successful VQA model relies on the information from both visual and textual modalities. Previous endeavours of VQA are made on the good attention mechanism, and multi-modal fusion strategies. For example, most models, till date, are proposed to fuse the multi-modal features based on implicit neural network through cross-modal interactions. To better explore and exploit the information of different modalities, the idea of second order interactions of different modalities, which is prevalent in recommendation system, is re-purposed to VQA in efficiently and explicitly modeling the second order interaction on both the visual and textual features, learned in a shared embedding space. To implement this idea, we  propose a novel Second Order enhanced Multi-glimpse Attention model (SOMA) where each glimpse denotes an attention map. SOMA adopts multi-glimpse attention to focus on different contents in the image. With projected the multi-glimpse outputs and question feature into a shared embedding space, an explicit second order feature is constructed to model the interaction on both the intra-modality and cross-modality of features. Furthermore, we advocate a semantic deformation method as data augmentation to generate more training examples in Visual Question Answering.

To address this problem, a deblurring architecture that adopts (1) adaptive deconvolution modules and (2) learning based image prior solvers is proposed. The adaptive deconvolution module adjusts the regularization weight locally to well process both smooth and non-smooth regions. Moreover, a cascade made of image priors is learned from the mapping between intermediates thus robust to arbitrary noise, aliasing, and artifact. According to our analysis, the proposed architecture can achieve a significant improvement on the convergence rate and result in an even better restoration performance",

And the emotion labels for these in-the-wild facial expressions cannot easily be annotated solely on pre-defined AU patterns.

To address this issue, we develop a RAF-AU database that employs a sign-based (i.e., AUs) and judgement-based (i.e., perceived emotion) approach to annotating blended facial expressions in the wild.  We first reviewed the annotation methods in existing databases and identified crowdsourcing as a promising strategy for labeling in-the-wild facial expressions. Then, RAF-AU was finely annotated by experienced coders, on which we also conducted a preliminary investigation of which key AUs contribute most to a perceived emotion, and the relationship between AUs and facial expressions. Finally, we provided a baseline for AU recognition in RAF-AU using popular features and multi-label learning methods",

    "abstract": "We present a novel approach to perform the unsupervised domain adaptation for object detection through forward-backward cyclic (FBC) training. Recent adversarial training based domain adaptation methods have shown their effectiveness on minimizing domain discrepancy via marginal feature distributions alignment. However, aligning the marginal feature distributions does not guarantee the alignment of class conditional distributions. This limitation is more evident when adapting object detectors as the domain discrepancy is larger compared to the image classification task, e.g. various number of objects exist in one image and the majority of content in an image is background. This motivates us to learn domain-invariance for category-level semantics via gradient alignment for instance-level adaptation. Intuitively, if the gradients of two domains point in similar directions, then the learning of one domain can improve that of another domain. To achieve gradient alignment, we propose Forward- Backward Cyclic Adaptation, which iteratively computes adaptation from source to target via backward hopping and from target to source via forward passing. In addition, we align low-level features for adapting image-level color/texture via adversarial training. However, the detector performs well on both domains is not ideal for the target domain. As such, in each cycle, domain diversity is enforced by maximum entropy regularization on the source domain to penalize confident source-specific learning and minimum entropy regularization on target domain to intrigue target-specific learning. Theoretical analysis of the training process is provided, and extensive experiments on challenging cross-domain object detection datasets have shown the superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art",

In this work, we aim to tackle the fairness-aware image classification problem, whose goal is to classify a target attribute (e.g., attractiveness) in a fair manner regarding protected attributes (e.g., gender, age, race). To this end, existing methods mainly rely on protected attribute labels for training, which are costly and sometimes unavailable for real-world scenarios. To alleviate the restriction and enlarge the scalability of fair models, we introduce a new framework where a fair classification model can be trained on datasets without protected attribute labels (i.e., target datasets) by exploiting knowledge from pre-built benchmarks (i.e., source datasets). Specifically, when training a target attribute encoder, we encourage its representations to be independent of the features from the pre-trained encoder on a source dataset. Moreover, we design a Group-wise Fair loss to minimize the gap in error rates between different protected attribute groups. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to train the fairness-aware image classification model on a target dataset without protected attribute annotations. To verify the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct experiments on CelebA and UTK datasets with two settings: the conventional and the transfer settings. In the both settings, our model shows the fairest results when compared to the existing methods",

One difficulty in this setting is that objects are located in various orientations and highly overlapped, where a traditional box proposal approach such as Mask R-CNN does not work well because more than one objects often have very similar bounding-boxes. To address this issue, we adopt a recently developed point proposal approach. This approach firstly generates point proposals instead of box proposals, then an instance mask is predicted over an image for each proposal point. This procedure enables us to obtain pixel-precise masks even for objects sharing the same bounding-box. However, mask prediction over an image may produce a few false positive pixels apart from objects and  these false positives are problematic for robot picking task. To suppress them, we introduce rectangular masks. A rectangular mask for each proposal point restricts the existence area of the corresponding object within the rectangle. The experimental result on WISDOM dataset shows that our method achieves superior performance to Mask R-CNN with the same backbone model and introduction of rectangular masks gives small improvement of mask AP and large improvement of box AP",

In this work, we propose to synthesize visual features for unseen classes, so that the model learns both seen and unseen objects in the visual domain. Consequently, the major challenge becomes, how to accurately synthesize unseen objects merely using their class semantics? Towards this ambitious goal, we propose a novel generative model that uses class-semantics to not only generate the features but also to discriminatively separate them. Further, using a unified model, we ensure the synthesized features have high diversity that represents the intra-class differences and variable localization precision in the detected bounding boxes.

This has motivated the development of several RGB-D saliency datasets and algorithms that use all four channels of the RGB-D data for both training and inference. Unfortunately, existing RGB-D saliency datasets are small, which may lead to overfitting and limited generalization for diverse scenarios. Here we propose a semi-supervised system for RGB-D saliency detection that can be trained on smaller RGB-D saliency datasets without saliency ground truth, while also make effective joint use of a large RGB saliency dataset with saliency ground truth together. To generalize our method on RGB-D saliency datasets, a novel prediction-guided cross-refinement module which jointly estimates both saliency and depth by mutual refinement between two respective tasks, and an adversarial learning approach are employed. Critically, our system does not require saliency ground-truth for the RGB-D datasets, which saves the massive human labor for hand labeling, and does not require the depth data for inference, allowing the method to be used for the much broader range of applications where only RGB data are available. Evaluation on seven RGB-D datasets demonstrates that even without saliency ground truth for RGB-D datasets and using only the RGB data of RGB-D datasets at inference, our semi-supervised system performs favorable against state-of-the-art fully-supervised RGB-D saliency detection methods that use saliency ground truth for RGB-D datasets at training and depth data at inference on two largest testing datasets.

However, this requires high expertise and clinical experience. Even for experienced radiologists, this is a time-consuming task. Hence, the automated generation of accurate radiology reports from chest X-Ray images is gaining popularity. Compared to other image captioning tasks where coherence is the key criterion, medical image captioning requires high accuracy in detecting anomalies and extracting information along with coherence. That is, the report must be easy to read and convey medical facts accurately. We propose a deep neural network to achieve this. Given a set of Chest X-Ray images of the patient, the proposed network predicts the medical tags and generates a readable radiology report. For generating the report and tags, the proposed network learns to extract salient features of the image from a deep CNN and generates tag embeddings for each patient's X-Ray images. We use transformers for learning self and cross attention. We encode the image and tag features with self-attention to get a finer representation. Use both the above features in cross attention with the input sequence to generate the report's Findings. Then, cross attention is applied between the generated Findings and the input sequence to generate the report's Impressions. We use a publicly available dataset to evaluate the proposed network. The performance indicates that we can generate a readable radiology report, with a relatively higher BLEU score over SOTA.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Deep learning for 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) camera pose estimation is highly efficient at test time and can achieve accurate results in challenging, weakly textured environments. Typically, however, success in deep learning relies on large amounts of training images spanning many orientations and positions of the environment making it impractical for medium size or large environments. In this work we present a direct 6-DoF camera pose estimation method which alleviates the need for orientation augmentation at train time while still supporting any SO(3) rotation at test time. This property is achieved by the following three step procedure. Firstly, omni-directional training images are rotated to a common orientation. Secondly, a fully rotation equivariant CNN encoder is applied and its output is used to obtain: (i) a rotation invariant prediction of the camera position and (ii) a rotation equivariant prediction of the probability distribution over camera orientations. Finally, for a test image of a novel orientation, the camera position is predicted robustly due to in-built rotation invariance, while the camera orientation is recovered from the relative shift of the peak in the probability distribution of camera orientations. We demonstrate our approach on synthetic and real-image datasets, where we significantly outperform classical CNN-based pose regression, (i) in terms of accuracy when a single training orientation is used, and (ii) in training efficiency when orientation augmentation is employed. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed rotation equivariant CNN for localization is the first direct pose estimation method able to predict orientation without explicit rotation augmentation at train time",

Additionally, we extend the concept of meaningful perturbation introduced by Fong & Vedaldi to the temporal dimension, to identify the temporal part of a sequence most meaningful to the network for a classification decision.

Rather than relying on a generic face prior,  in this paper, we explore the use of a set of exemplars, i.e. other high-resolution images of the same person. These guide the neural network as we condition the output on them. Multiple exemplars work better than a single one. To combine the information from multiple exemplars effectively, we intro-duce a pixel-wise weight generation module. Besides standard face super-resolution, our method allows to perform subtle face editing simply by replacing the exemplars with another set with different facial features. A user study is conducted and shows the super-resolved images can hardly be distinguished from real images on the CelebA dataset.

It first generates a set of embedding and mixing coefficients from a given visual representation, and then combines them into a single embedding. We introduce three techniques to successfully train MIX'EM and avoid degenerate solutions; (i) diversify mixture components by maximizing entropy, (ii) minimize instance conditioned component entropy to enforce a clustered embedding space, and (iii) use an associative embedding loss to enforce semantic separability. By applying (i) and (ii), semantic categories emerge through the mixture coefficients, making it possible to apply (iii). Subsequently, we run K-means on the representations to acquire semantic classification. We conduct extensive experiments and analyses on STL10, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100-20 datasets, achieving state-of-the-art classification accuracy of 78%, 82%, and 44%, respectively. To achieve robust and high accuracy, it is essential to use the mixture components to initialize K-means.

In this paper, we consider reasoning on complex referring expression comprehension (c-REF) task that seeks to localise the target objects in an image guided by complex queries.

(ii) It is non-trivial to reason among multiple objects guided by the query and localise the target correctly. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Modular Graph Attention Network (MGA-Net). Specifically, to comprehend the long queries, we devise a language attention network to decompose them into four types: basic attributes, absolute location, visual relationship and relative locations, which mimics the human language understanding mechanism. Moreover, to capture the complex logic in a query, we construct a relational graph to represent the visual objects and their relationships, and propose a multi-step reasoning method to progressively understand the complex logic.

Before learning-based algorithms were developed, many advanced generic segmentation algorithms are superpixel-based. However, due to the irregular shape and size of superpixels, it is hard to apply deep learning to superpixel-based image segmentation directly. In this paper, we combined the merits of the FCN and superpixels and proposed a highly accurate and extremely fast generic image segmentation algorithm. We treated image segmentation as multiple superpixel merging decision problems and determined whether the boundary between two adjacent superpixels should be kept. In other words, if the boundary of two adjacent superpixels should be deleted, then the two superpixels will be merged. The network applies the colors, the edge map, and the superpixel information to make decision about merging suprepixels. By solving all the superpixel-merging subproblems with just one forward pass, the FCN facilitates the speed of the whole segmentation process by a wide margin meanwhile gaining higher accuracy. Simulations show that the proposed algorithm has favorable runtime, meanwhile achieving highly accurate segmentation results. It outperforms state-of-the-art image segmentation methods, including feature-based and learning-based methods, in all metrics",

Therefore, unsupervised person ReID has gained a lot of attention due to its potential to solve the domain adaptation problem. Many methods focus on minimizing the distribution discrepancy in feature domain but neglecting the differences among input distributions.

To address this task, we propose a deep learning framework of cross-modality co-attention for video event localization. Our proposed audiovisual transformer (AV-transformer) is able to exploit intra and inter-frame visual information, with audio features jointly observed to perform co-attention over the above three modalities. With visual, temporal, and audio information observed across consecutive video frames, our model achieves promising capability in extracting informative spatial/temporal features for improved event localization. Moreover, our model is able to produce instance-level attention, which would identify image regions at the instance level which are associated with the sound/event of interest.

    "abstract": "In recent years, many methods have been proposed to explain individual classification predictions of deep neural networks. However, how to leverage the created explanations to improve the learning process has been less explored. The explanations extracted from a model can be used to guide the learning process of the model itself. Another type of information used to guide the training of a model is the knowledge provided by a powerful teacher model. The goal of this work is to leverage the self-explanation to improve the learning process by borrowing ideas from knowledge distillation. We start by investigating the effective components of the knowledge transferred from the teacher network to the student network. Our investigation reveals that both the responses in non-ground-truth classes and the class-similarity information in teacher's outputs contribute to the success of the knowledge distillation. Motivated by the conclusion, we propose an implementation of introspective learning by distilling knowledge from online self-explanations. The models trained with the introspective learning procedure outperform the ones trained with the standard learning procedure, as well as the ones trained with different regularization methods. When compared to the models learned from peer networks or teacher networks, our models also show competitive performance and requires neither peers nor teachers",

It then creates a resynthesized image using an autoencoder consisting of a semantic image generator as the encoder and a photographic image generator as the decoder.Extensive experiments demonstrate that the performance of the proposed method is comparable to that of existing methods, even without postprocessing. The proposed method with postprocessing outperformed state-of-the-art methods on the Lost and Found dataset.Further, in evaluations using our Highway Anomaly Dataset, which includes actual and synthetic road obstacles, the proposed method significantly outperformed a supervised method that explicitly learns road obstacles.Thus, the proposed machine-learning-based road obstacle detection method is a practical solution that will advance the development of autonomous driving systems",

We reformulate pedestrian trajectory forecasting as a structured reinforcement learning (RL) problem.

Our proposed RL-based model allows pedestrians to accelerate and slow down to avoid imminent danger (e.g. cars), while obeying human dynamics learnt from in-lab motion capture datasets. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical model consisting of a semantic trajectory policy network that provides a distribution over possible movements, and a human locomotion network that generates 3d human poses in each step. The RL-formulation allows the model to learn even from states that are seldom exhibited in the dataset, utilizing all of the available prior and scene information. Extensive evaluations using both real and simulated data illustrate that the proposed model is on par with recent models such as S-GAN, ST-GAT and S-STGCNN in pedestrian forecasting, while outperforming these in collision avoidance.

Our approach combines Deep Learning and 3D geometry: It relies on an embedding of local 3D geometry to match the CAD models to the input images.  For points at the surface of objects, this embedding can be computed directly from the CAD model; for image locations, we learn to predict it from the image itself. This establishes correspondences between 3D points on the CAD model and 2D locations of the input images.  However, many of these correspondences are ambiguous as many points may have similar local geometries.  We show that we can use Mask-RCNN in a class-agnostic way to detect the new objects without retraining and thus drastically limit the number of possible correspondences.  We can then robustly estimate a 3D pose from these discriminative correspondences using a RANSAC-like algorithm.  We demonstrate the performance of this approach on the T-LESS dataset, by using a small number of objects to learn the embedding and testing it on the other objects.

    "abstract": "Class-imbalance is one of the major challenges in real world datasets where a few classes (called majority classes) constitute much more data samples than the rest (called minority classes). Learning deep neural networks using such datasets leads to performance which is typically biased towards the majority classes. Most of the prior works try to solve class-imbalance by assigning more weights to the  minority classes in various manners (e.g., data re-sampling, cost-sensitive learning). However, we argue that the number of available training data may not be always a good clue to determine the weighting strategy because some of the minority classes might be sufficiently represented even by a small number of training data. Overweighting samples of such classes can lead to drop in the model's overall performance. We claim that the 'difficulty' of a class as perceived by the model is more important to determine the weighting. In this light, we propose a novel loss function named Class-wise Difficulty-Balanced loss, or CDB loss, which dynamically distributes weights to each sample according to the difficulty of the class that the sample belongs to. Note that the assigned weights dynamically change as the 'difficulty' for the model may change with the learning progress. Extensive experiments are conducted on both image (artificially induced class-imbalanced MNIST, long-tailed CIFAR and ImageNet-LT) and video (EGTEA) datasets. The results show that CDB loss consistently outperforms the recently proposed loss functions on class-imbalanced datasets irrespective of the data type (i.e., video or image)",

However, by optimizing via such domain classification discrepancy, ambiguous target samples that are not smoothly distributed on the low-dimensional data manifold are often missed. To solve this issue, we propose a novel Contrastively Smoothed Class Alignment (CoSCA) model, that explicitly incorporates both intra- and inter-class domain discrepancy to better align ambiguous target samples with the source domain. CoSCA estimates the underlying label hypothesis of target samples, and simultaneously adapts their feature representations by optimizing a proposed contrastive loss.

As the pre-trained HMR is not recognition-oriented, we fine-tune it in an end-to-end gait recognition framework. To cope with differences between gait datasets and those used for pre-training the HMR, we introduce a reconstruction loss between the silhouette masks in the gait datasets and the rendered silhouettes from the estimated SMPL model produced by a differentiable renderer. This enables us to adapt the HMR to the gait dataset without supervision using the ground-truth joint locations. Experimental results with the OU-MVLP and CASIA-B datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed method for both gait identification and verification scenarios, a direct consequence of the explicitly disentangled pose and shape features produced by the proposed end-to-end model-based framework",

    "abstract": "Deep learning methods, especially multi-task learning with CNNs, have achieved good results in many fields of computer vision. Semantic segmentation and shape detection of lumbar vertebrae, sacrum, and femoral heads from clinical X-ray images are important and challenging tasks. In this paper, we propose a multi-task deep neural network, MBNet. It is developed based on our new multi-path convolutional neural network, BiLuNet, for semantic segmentation on X-ray images. Our MBNet has two branches, one is for semantic segmentation of lumbar vertebrae, sacrum, and femoral heads. It shares the main features with the second branch to learn and classify by supervised learning. The output of the second branch is to predict the inspected values for lumbar vertebra inspection. These networks are capable of performing the two tasks with very limited training data.  We collect our dataset and annotated it by doctors for model training and performance evaluation.  Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our BiLuNet model provides better mIoUs with the same training data.  The experimental results have demonstrated the feasibility of our MBNet for semantic segmentation of lumbar vertebrae, as well as the parameter prediction for the doctors to perform clinical diagnosis of low back pains.Code is available at https://github.com/LuanTran07/BiLUnet-Lumbar-Spine",

We show that our proposed method is able to generate 256x256 resolution images from novel classes that are of similar visual quality to those from the training classes. In lieu of a source image, we demonstrate that random sampling of the metric space also results in high-quality samples. We show that interpolation in the feature space and latent space results in semantically and visually plausible transformations in the image space. Finally, the usefulness of the generated samples to the downstream task of data augmentation is demonstrated.

    "abstract": "Unsupervised representation learning via generative modeling is a staple to many computer vision applications in the absence of labeled data. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are powerful generative models that learn representations useful for data generation. However, due to inherent challenges in the training objective, VAEs fail to learn useful representations amenable for downstream tasks. Regularization-based methods that attempt to improve the representation learning aspect of VAEs come at a price: poor sample generation. In this paper, we explore this representation-generation trade-off for regularized VAEs and introduce a new family of priors, namely decoupled priors, or dpVAEs, that decouple the representation space from the generation space. This decoupling enables the use of VAE regularizers on the representation space without impacting the distribution used for sample generation, and thereby reaping the representation learning benefits of the regularizations without sacrificing the sample generation. dpVAE leverages invertible networks to learn a bijective mapping from an arbitrarily complex representation distribution to a simple, tractable, generative distribution. Decoupled priors can be adapted to the state-of-the-art VAE regularizers without additional hyperparameter tuning. We showcase the use of dpVAEs with different regularizers. Experiments on MNIST, SVHN, and CelebA demonstrate, quantitatively and qualitatively, that dpVAE fixes sample generation for regularized VAEs",

Reconstructing ghosting-free HDR images of dynamic scenes from a set of multi-exposure images is a challenging task, especially with large object motion, disparity, and occlusions, leading to visible artifacts using existing methods. In this paper, we propose a Pyramidal Alignment and Masked merging network (PAMnet) that learns to synthesize HDR images from input low dynamic range (LDR) images in an end-to-end manner. Instead of aligning under/overexposed images to the reference view directly in pixel-domain, we apply deformable convolutions across multiscale features for pyramidal alignment. Aligned features offer more flexibility to refine the inevitable misalignment for subsequent merging network without reconstructing the aligned image explicitly. To make full use of aligned features, we use dilated dense residual blocks with squeeze-and-excitation (SE) attention. Such attention mechanism effectively helps to remove redundant information and suppress misaligned features. Additional mask-based weighting is further employed to refine the HDR reconstruction, which offers better image quality and sharp local details. Experiments demonstrate that PAMnet can produce ghosting-free HDR results in the presence of large disparity and motion.

We, therefore, introduce an attention-based regularization mechanism that maximally separates the latent features of discriminative regions of different classes while minimizing the contribution of the non-discriminative regions to the final class prediction.

These languages are highly variable in communication with divergences between gloss representation, sign configuration, and multiple variants, among others, due to cultural and regional aspects.  Current methods for automatic and continuous sign translation include robust and deep learning models that encode the visual signs representation. Despite the significant progress, the convergence of such models requires huge amounts of data to exploit sign representation, resulting in very complex models. This fact is associated to the highest variability but also to the shortage exploration of many language components that support communication. For instance, gesture motion and grammatical structure are fundamental components in communication, which can deal with visual and geometrical sign misinterpretations during video analysis. This work introduces a new Colombian sign language translation dataset (CoL-SLTD), that focuses on motion and structural information, and could be a significant resource to determine the contribution of several language components. Additionally, an encoder-decoder deep strategy is herein introduced to support automatic translation, including attention modules that capture short, long, and structural kinematic dependencies and their respective relationships with sign recognition. The evaluation in CoL-SLTD proves the relevance of the motion representation, allowing compact deep architectures to represent the translation.

This paper proposes a novel algorithm to correct the relative frames between keyframes after the keyframes have been updated by a back-end optimization process. The correction model is derived using conservation of the measurement constraint between landmarks and the robot pose. The proposed algorithm is designed to be easily integrable to existing keyframe-based SLAM systems while exhibiting robust and accurate performance superior to existing interpolation methods. The algorithm also requires low computational resources and hence has a minimal burden on the whole SLAM pipeline.

    "abstract": "This paper studies the recognition of oracle character, the earliest known hieroglyphs in China. Essentially, oracle character recognition suffers from the problem of data limitation and imbalance. Recognizing the oracle characters of extremely limited samples, naturally, should be taken as the few-shot learning task. Different from the standard few-shot learning setting, our model has only access to large-scale unlabeled source Chinese characters and few labeled oracle characters. In such a setting, meta-based or metric-based few-shot methods are failed to be efficiently trained on source unlabeled data; and thus the only possible methodologies are self-supervised learning and data augmentation. Unfortunately, the conventional geometric augmentation always performs the same global transformations to all samples in pixel format, without considering the diversity of each part within a sample. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, there is no effective self-supervised learning method for few-shot learning. To this end, this paper integrates the idea of self-supervised learning in data augmentation. And we propose a novel data augmentation approach, named Orc-Bert Augmentor pre-trained by self-supervised learning, for few-shot oracle character recognition. Specifically, Orc-Bert Augmentor leverages a self-supervised  BERT model pre-trained on large unlabeled Chinese characters datasets to generate sample-wise augmented samples. Given a masked input in vector format, Orc-Bert Augmentor can recover it and then output a pixel format image as augmented data. Different mask proportion brings diverse reconstructed output. Concatenated with Gaussian noise, the model further performs point-wise displacement to improve diversity. Experimentally, we collect two large-scale datasets of oracle characters and other Chinese ancient characters for few-shot oracle character recognition and Orc-Bert Augmentor pre-training. Extensive experiments on few-shot learning demonstrate the effectiveness of our Orc-Bert Augmentor on improving the performance of various networks in the few-shot oracle character recognition",

To address these issues, we propose a moderate-size SISR network named matrix channel attention network (MCAN) by constructing a matrix ensemble of multi-connected channel attention blocks (MCAB).

However, existing models only learn limited multi-scale features in a multi-branches manner, and directly expanding the number of scale branches for more scales will confuse the discrimination and affect performance. Because for a specific input image, there are a few scale features that are critical. In order to fulfill vast scale representation for person Re-ID and solve the contradiction of excessive scale declining performance, we proposed a novel Dense-Scale Feature Learning Network (DSLNet) which consist of two core components: Dense Connection Group (DCG) for providing abundant scale features, and Channel-Wise Scale Selection (CSS) module for dynamic select the most discriminative scale features to each input image. DCG is composed of a densely connected convolutional stream. The receptive field gradually increases as the feature flows along the convolution stream. Dense shortcut connections provide much more fused multi-scale features than existing methods. CSS is a novel attention module different from any existing model which calculates attention along the branch direction. By enhancing or suppressing specific scale branches, truly channel-wised multi-scale selection is realized. To the best of our knowledge, DSLNet is most lightweight and achieves state-of-the-art performance among lightweight models on four commonly used Re-ID datasets, surpassing most large-scale models",

However state-of-art deep learning segmentation networks could not be deployed on embedded devices with limited onboard resources, due to the required high computation capacity and the lack of capability to deal with poor underwater image quality. In this work, we present a new deep underwater segmentation network, featured by a compact encoder and a lightweight decoder. We use only one step upsampling block to recover features maps from the encoder to significantly speed up the inference time. Furthermore, we adopt three strategies to improve network accuracy. Firstly, in parallel with the main decoder path, we introduce a branch path to extract additional low-level features. Secondly, we use position attention module to enhance the high-level semantic information and use channel attention module to introduce extra global context as well as refine the inter-dependencies of each feature. Thirdly, we proposed to use two additional auxiliary loss and smooth loss functions to better train the network, such that it will be more robust in segmenting images at varying resolutions and generating smooth boundaries.We validate our network accuracy on two different underwater segmentation datasets, a generalistic and a specialist one, and our model achieves the same level of accuracy of state-of-art networks. We also tested the network speed on different embedded platforms, and we showed it reaches real-time inference speed on both Nvidia Jetson GPU platforms TX2 and Nano, with respectively around 24 and 18 FPS (Frame Per Second). The proposed network inference is up to 27 times faster than other considered networks. Its high accuracy and speed will so pave the way for its deployment and application on AUVs systems",

Contrary to previous works, our method does not require to manually select key frames, and produces state-of-the-art results with as little as 2% of annotated frames, which are randomly chosen. To this end, we propose a semi-supervised learning approach where a spatio-temporal model combining a feature extractor and a temporal module are learned in two stages. The first stage uses datasets of unlabeled videos to learn a strong spatio-temporal representation of facial behavior dynamics based on contrastive learning. To our knowledge we are the first to build upon this framework for modeling facial behavior in an unsupervised manner. The second stage uses another dataset of randomly chosen labeled frames to train a regressor on top of our spatio-temporal model for estimating the AU intensity. We show that although backpropagation through time is applied only with respect to the output of the network for extremely sparse and randomly chosen labeled frames, our model can be effectively trained to estimate AU intensity accurately, thanks to the unsupervised pre-training of the first stage. We experimentally validate that our method outperforms existing methods when working with as little as 2% of randomly chosen data for both DISFA and BP4D datasets, without a careful choice of labeled frames, a time-consuming task still required in previous approaches",

In this work, we address this very challenging task for the first time. We propose a baseline based on multi-instance and multi-label learning. Furthermore, we propose a novel approach that uses sets of actions as representation instead of modeling individual action classes. Since computing the probabilities for the full power set becomes intractable as the number of action classes increases, we assign an action set to each detected person under the constraint that the assignment is consistent with the annotation of the video clip.

However, the two strategies are highly dependent on the last mask or the fixed mask given in the first frame and hence cannot adapt well to high deformation and rapid motion of objects. In this paper, we proposed a novel architecture named Mask-Ranking Network(MRNet), which takes advantage of both the propagation-based method and the matching-based method, to address the above problem. Specifically, in order to make better use of the long-term previous masks, we propose a novel propagation mechanism to make the network comprehensively consider the previous information. Under a unified encoder-decoder framework, we track the pixel-wise similarity of the object activation area in a long-term manner and explore the correlation between frames. In contrast to propagation-based only or matching-based only techniques, our method reduces the accumulation of errors in the propagation process and effectively uses the long-term previous frame information. In the video object segmentation task, MRNet can better handle the deformation of the objects, and make the segmentation result more accurate. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed method on the DAVIS 2016 and DAVIS 2017 dataset.

At the extreme, the corresponding annotated data are unavailable. Exploiting synthetic data is a very promising solution except for domain distribution mismatches between synthetic datasets and real datasets. To address the severe domain distribution mismatch, we propose a synthetic-to-real domain adaptation method for scene text detection, which transfers knowledge from synthetic data (source domain) to real data (target domain). In this paper, a text self-training (TST) method and adversarial text instance alignment (ATA) for domain adaptive scene text detection are introduced. ATA helps the network learn domain-invariant features by training a domain classifier in an adversarial manner. TST diminishes the adverse effects of false positives(FPs) and false negatives(FNs) from inaccurate pseudo-labels. Two components have positive effects on improving the performance of scene text detectors when adapting from synthetic-to-real scenes. We evaluate the proposed method by transferring from SynthText, VISD to ICDAR2015, ICDAR2013.

In this paper, we propose a simple and computationally efficient, hyperparameter-free method that uses cosine similarity. Although recent studies show its effectiveness for metric learning, it remains uncertain if cosine similarity works well also for OOD detection and, if so, why. We provide an intuitive explanation of why cosine similarity works better than the standard methods that use the maximum of softmax outputs or logits. Besides, there are several differences in the design of output layers, which are essential to achieve the best performance. We show through experiments that our method outperforms the existing methods on the evaluation test recently proposed by Shafaei et al., which takes the above issue of hyperparameter dependency into account; it achieves at least comparable performance to the state-of-the-art on the conventional test, where other methods but ours are allowed to use explicit OOD samples for determining hyperparameters",

    "abstract": "We propose new, and robust, loss functions for the point cloud registration problem. Our loss functions are inspired by the Best Buddies Similarity (BBS) measure that counts the number of mutual nearest neighbors between two point sets. This measure has been shown to be robust to outliers and missing data in the case of template matching for images. We present several algorithms, collectively named Best Buddy Registration (BBR), where each algorithm consists of optimizing one of these loss functions with Adam gradient descent. The loss functions differ in several ways, including the distance function used (point-to-point vs. point-to-plane), and how the BBS measure is combined with the actual distances between pairs of points. Experiments on various data sets, both synthetic and real, demonstrate the effectiveness of the BBR algorithms, showing that they are quite robust to noise, outliers, and distractors, and cope well with extremely sparse point clouds. One variant, BBR-F, achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in the registration of automotive lidar scans taken up to several seconds apart, from the KITTI and Apollo-Southbay datasets",

However, existing image dehazing methods are mainly developed for land scenes  and perform poorly when applied to overwater images. To address this problem, we collect the first overwater image dehazing dataset and propose an OverWater Image Dehazing GAN (OWI-DehazeGAN). Due to the difficulties of collecting paired hazy and clean images, the dataset is composed of unpaired hazy and clean images taken over water. The proposed OWI-DehazeGAN learns the underlying style mapping between hazy and clean images in an encoder-decoder framework, which is supervised by a forward-backward translation consistency loss for self-supervision and a perceptual loss for content preservation. In addition to qualitative evaluation, we design an image quality assessment  network to rank the dehazed images. Experimental results on both real and synthetic test data demonstrate that the proposed method performs superiorly against several state-of-the-art land dehazing methods",

We propose Power Normalizing Second-order Detector consisting of the Encoding Network (EN), the Multi-scale Feature Fusion (MFF), Second-order Pooling (SOP) with Power Normalization (PN), the Hyper Attention Region Proposal Network (HARPN) and Similarity Network (SN). EN takes support image crops and a query image per episode to produce covolutional feature maps across several layers while MFF combines them into multi-scale feature maps. SOP aggregates them per support image while PN  detects the presence of visual feature instead of counting its frequency of occurrence. HARPN cross-correlates the PN pooled support features against the query feature map to match regions and produce query region proposals that are then aggregated with SOP/PN. Finally, support and query second-order descriptors are passed to SN. Our approach performs well because: (i) HARPN leverages SOP/PN for cross-correlation of detected rather than counted support features with query features which improves region proposals, (ii) SOP/PN capture second-order statistics per region proposal and factor out spatial locations, and (iii) PN limits the complexity of the space of functions over which HARPN and SN learn. These properties lead to the state of the art on the PASCAL VOC 2007/12, MS COCO and the FSOD datasets",

    "abstract": "Point cloud completion estimates the complete shape given incomplete point cloud, which is a crucial task as the raw point cloud measurements suffer from missing data. Most of previous methods for point cloud completion share the encoder-decoder structure, where the encoder projects the raw point cloud into low-dimensional latent space and the decoder decodes the condensed latent information back into the list of points. While the low-dimensional projection extracts semantic features to guide the global completion of the missing data, the unique local geometric details observed from partial data are often lost. In this paper, we propose a shape completion framework that maintains both of the global context and the local characteristics. Our network is composed of two complementary prediction branches. One of the branches fills the unseen parts with the global context learned from the database model, which can be replaced by any of the conventional shape completion network. The other branch, which we refer as a Symmetry-Aware Upsampling Module (SAUM), conservatively maintains the geometric details given the observed partial data, clearly utilizing the symmetry for the shape completion. Experimental results show that the combination of the two prediction branches enables more plausible shape completion for point clouds than the state-of-the-art approaches",

Several real-world SISR datasets have been constructed to reduce this gap; however, their scale is relatively small due to laborious and costly data collection process. To remedy this issue, we propose to learn a realistic degradation model from the existing real-world datasets, and use the learned degradation model to synthesize realistic HR-LR image pairs. Specifically, we learn a group of basis degradation kernels, and simultaneously learn a weight prediction network to predict the pixel-wise spatially variant degradation kernel as the weighted combination of the basis kernels. With the learned degradation model, a large number of realistic HR-LR pairs can be easily generated to train a more robust SISR model. Extensive experiments are performed to quantitatively and qualitatively validate the proposed degradation learning method and its effectiveness in improving the generalization performance of SISR models in practical scenarios",

Finally, in the loss module, the smooth of disparity is well supervised based on semantic boundary and region.

Previous works regress the text boundary in Cartesian coordinates as ordinary object detection.

The implicit disregard of text scale also impairs multi-scale detection ability. To better learn the arbitrary text boundary and handle the text scale variation, we propose a novel Scale-Aware Polar Representation (SAPR) framework. The text boundary is represented in Polar coordinates, where scale and angle of text could be both clearly expressed for targeted learning. This simple but effective transformation brings significant performance improvement. The explicit learning on separated text scale also promotes the multi-scale detection ability. Based on the Polar representation, we design line IoU loss and symmetry sine loss to better optimize the scale and angle of text with a multi-path decoder architecture. Furthermore, an accurate center line calculation is proposed to guide text boundary restoration under various scales. Overall, the proposed SAPR framework is able to effectively detect arbitrarily-shaped texts and tackle the scale variation simultaneously.

Our proposed Unified Dehazing and Detection (UDnD) framework consists of three parts: a residual-aware haze density classifier, a density-aware dehazing network, and a density-aware object detector. First, the classifier exploits the residuals of hazy images to accurately predict density levels, which provide rich domain knowledge for the subsequent two tasks.

Experiments demonstrate that UDnD performs favorably against other methods for object detection in real-world hazy scenes. Also, HRDN achieves better results than state-of-the-art dehazing methods in terms of PSNR and SSIM.

These three tasks are integrated into a unified learning framework using the principles of Noise Contrastive Estimation and Multiple Instance Learning.  We validate the effectiveness of our approach on low-shot sign spotting benchmarks.

    "abstract": "Low Rank Representation (LRR) based unsupervised clustering methods have achieved great success since these methods could explore low-dimensional subspace structure embedded in original data effectively. The conventional LRR methods generally treat the data as the points in Euclidean space. However, it is no longer suitable for high-dimension data (such as video or imageset). That is because high-dimension data are always considered as non-linear manifold data such as Grassmann manifold. Besides, the typical LRR methods always adopt the traditional single nuclear norm based low rank constraint which can not fully reveal the low rank property of the data representation and often leads to suboptimal solution. In this paper, a new LRR based clustering model is constructed on Grassmann manifold for high-dimension data. In the proposed method, each high-dimension data is formed as a sample on Grassmann manifold with non-linear metric. Meanwhile, a non-convex low rank representation is adopt to reveal the intrinsic property of these high-dimension data and reweighted rank minimization constraint is introduced.

    "abstract": "Existing zero-shot learning (ZSL) methods assume that there exist sufficient training samples from seen classes, each annotated with semantic descriptors such as attributes, for knowledge transfer to unseen classes without any training samples. However, this assumption is often invalid because collecting sufficient seen class samples can be difficult and attribute annotation is expensive; it thus severely limits the scalability of ZSL. In this paper, we define a new setting termed Few-Shot Zero-Shot Learning (FSZSL), where only a few annotated images are collected from each seen class (i.e., few-shot). This is clearly more challenging yet more realistic than the conventional ZSL setting. To overcome the resultant image-level attribute sparsity, we propose a novel inductive ZSL model termed sparse attribute propagation (SAP) by propagating attribute annotations to more unannotated images using sparse coding. This is followed by learning bidirectional projections between features and attributes for ZSL. An efficient solver is provided for such knowledge transfer with less supervision, together with rigorous theoretic analysis. With our SAP, we show that a ZSL training dataset can also be augmented by the abundant web images returned by image search engine, to further improve the model performance.

To obtain prediction uncertainty, we model the crowd density values using Gaussian distributions and develop a convolutional neural network architecture to predict these distributions. A key advantage of our method over existing crowd counting methods is its ability to quantify the uncertainty of its predictions. We illustrate the benefits of knowing the prediction uncertainty by developing a method to reduce the human annotation effort needed to adapt counting networks to a new domain. We present sample selection strategies which make use of the density and uncertainty of predictions from the networks trained on one domain to select the informative images from a target domain of interest to acquire human annotation. We show that our sample selection strategy drastically reduces the amount of labeled data from the target domain needed to adapt a counting network trained on a source domain to the target domain. Empirically, the networks trained on the UCF-QNRF dataset can be adapted to surpass the performance of the previous state-of-the-art results on NWPU dataset and Shanghaitech dataset using only 17% of the labeled training samples from the target domain.

    "abstract": "Previous work on novel object detection considers zero or few-shot settings where none or few examples of each category are available for training. In real world scenarios, it is less practical to expect that 'all' the novel classes are either unseen or have few-examples. Here, we propose a more realistic setting termed 'Any-shot detection', where totally unseen and few-shot categories can simultaneously co-occur during inference. Any-shot detection offers unique challenges compared to conventional novel object detection such as, a high imbalance between unseen, few-shot and seen object classes, susceptibility to forget base-training while learning novel classes and distinguishing novel classes from the background. To address these challenges, we propose a unified any-shot detection model, that can concurrently learn to detect both zero-shot and few-shot object classes. Our core idea is to use class semantics as prototypes for object detection, a formulation that naturally minimizes knowledge forgetting and mitigates the class-imbalance in the label space. Besides, we propose a rebalanced loss function that emphasizes difficult few-shot cases but avoids overfitting on the novel classes to allow detection of totally unseen classes. Without bells and whistles, our framework can also be used solely for Zero-shot object detection and Few-shot object detection tasks.

One unique feature of RF-GAN lies with its single generator which is reconfigurable and can perform bidirectional image translations by swapping its parameters. In addition, a multi-domain discriminator is designed which allows joint discrimination of original and translated samples in multiple domains. Experiments over eight unpaired image translation datasets (on various tasks such as object transfiguration, season transfer, and painters' style transfer, etc.) show that RF-GAN reduces the model size by up to 75% as compared with state-of-the-art translation GANs but produces superior image translation performance with lower Frechet Inception Distance consistently",

We also proposed a fast version of BBFE, named Fast-BBFE, to achieve better trade-off between efficiency and accuracy. Without bells and whistles, our BBFE improves different baseline methods (both anchor-based and anchor-free) by a large margin ( 2.0 points higher AP) on COCO, surpassing common feature pyramid networks including FPN and PANet",

    "abstract": "Meta-learning approaches have addressed few-shot problems by finding initialisations suited for fine-tuning to target tasks. Often there are additional properties within training data (which we refer to as context), not relevant to the target task, which act as a distractor to meta-learning, particularly when the target task contains examples from a novel context not seen during training. We address this oversight by incorporating a context-adversarial component into the meta-learning process. This produces an initialisation which is both context-agnostic and task-generalised. We evaluate our approach on three commonly used meta-learning algorithms and four case studies. We demonstrate our context-agnostic meta-learning improves results in each case. First, we report few-shot character classification on the Omniglot dataset, using alphabets as context. An average improvement of 4.3% is observed across methods and tasks when classifying characters from an unseen alphabet. Second, we perform few-shot classification on Mini-ImageNet, obtaining context from the label hierarchy, with an average improvement of 2.8%.  Third, we perform few-shot classification on CUB, with annotation metadata as context, and demonstrate an average improvement of 1.9%. Fourth, we evaluate on a dataset for personalised energy expenditure predictions from video, using participant knowledge as context. We demonstrate that context-agnostic meta-learning decreases the average mean square error by 30%",

    "abstract": "In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have obtained promising results in single-image super-resolution (SR) for remote sensing images. However, most existing methods are inadequate for remote sensing image SR due to the high computational cost required. Therefore, enhancing the representation ability with fewer parameters and a shorter prediction time is a challenging and critical task for remote sensing image SR. In this paper, we propose a novel CNN called a parallel-connected residual channel attention network (PCRCAN). Specifically, inspired by group convolution, we propose a parallel module with feature aggregation modules in PCRCAN. The parallel module significantly reduces the model parameters and fully integrates feature maps by widening the network architecture. In addition, to reduce the difficulty of training a complex deep network and improve model performance, we use a residual channel attention block as the basic feature mapping unit instead of a single convolutional layer. Experiments on a public remote sensing dataset UC Merced land-use dataset revealed that PCRCAN achieved higher accuracy, efficiency, and visual improvement than most state-of-the-art methods",

Therein, U-Net consisting of the contracting path for context capturing and the symmetric expanding path for precise localization, has become a meta network architecture for medical image segmentation, and manifests acceptable results even with moderate scale of training data. This study proposes a novel attention modulated network based on the baseline U-Net, and explores embedded spatial and channel attention modules for adaptively highlighting interdependent channel maps and focusing on more discriminant regions via investigating relevant feature association. The proposed spatial and channel attention modules can be used in a plug and play manner and embedded after any learned feature map for adaptively emphasizing discriminant features and neglecting irrelevant information.

Automated cell/nuclei detection and segmentation is in general a critical step in automatic system, and is quite challenging due to the existed heterogeneous characteristics of cancer cell such as large variability in size, shape, appearance, and texture of the different cells. This study proposes a novel method for simultaneous detection and segmentation of cells based on the Mask R-CNN, which conducts multiple end-to-end learning tasks by minimizing multi task losses for generic object detection and segmentation. The conventional Mask R-CNN employs cross entropy loss for evaluating the object detection fidelity, and equally treats all training samples in learning procedure regardless to the properties of the objects such as easily or hard degree for detection, which may lead to miss-detection of hard samples. To boost the detection performance of hard samples, this work integrates the focal loss for formulating detection criteria into Mask R-CNN, and investigate a feasible method for balancing the contribution of multiple task losses in network training procedure.

Second, the input of body joints sequences has noise introduced during dataset collection and feature production. In this work, we propose a global link, which extends the existing skeleton graph (the natural link) to capture the overall state of gait based on spatial-temporal convolution. In addition, we use soft thresholding to reduce noise. The thresholds are learned automatically by a block called shrinkage block. Combined with the global link and shrinkage block, we further propose the global graph convolution shrinkage network (G-GCSN) to capture the emotion-related features.

    "abstract": "Hyperspectral (HS) imaging is a promising imaging modality, which can simultaneously acquire various bands of images of the same scene and capture detailed spectral distribution helping for numerous applications. However, existing HS imaging sensor can only obtain images with low spatial resolution. Thus fusing a low resolution hyperspectral (LR-HS) image with a high resolution (HR) RGB (or multispectral) image into a HR-HS image has received much attention. Conventional fusion methods usually employ various hand-crafted priors to regularize the mathematical model formulating the relation between the observations and the HR-HS image, and conduct optimization for pursuing the optimal solution. However, the politic prior would be various for different scenes and is difficult to hammer out for a specific scene. Recently, deep learning-based methods have been widely explored for HS image resolution enhancement, and impressive performance has been validated. As it is known that deep learning-based methods essentially require large-scale training samples, which are hard to obtain due to the limitation of the existing HS cameras, for constructing the model with good generalization.\nMotivated by the deep image prior that network architecture itself sufficiently captures a great deal of low-level image statistics with arbitrary learning strategy, we investigate the deep learned image prior consisting both spatial structure and spectral attribute instead of hand-crafted priors for unsupervised multispectral (RGB) and HS image fusion, and propose a novel deep spatial and spectral prior learning framework for exploring the underlying structure of the latent HR-HS image with the observed HR-RGB and LR-HS images only. The proposed deep prior learning method has no requirement to prepare massive triplets of the HR-RGB, LR-HS and HR-HS images for network training. \nWe validate the proposed method on two benchmark HS image datasets, and experimental results show that our method is comparable or outperforms the state-of-the-art HS image super-resolution approaches",

    "abstract": "Fully supervised change detection methods require difficult to procure pixel-level labels, while weakly supervised approaches can be trained with image-level labels. However, most of these approaches require a combination of changed and unchanged image pairs for training. Thus, these methods can not directly be used for datasets where only changed image pairs are available. We present W-CDNet, a novel weakly supervised change detection network that can be trained with image-level semantic labels. Additionally, W-CDNet can be trained with two different types of datasets, either containing changed image pairs only or a mixture of changed and unchanged image pairs. Since we use image-level semantic labels for training, we simultaneously create a change mask and label the changed object for single-label images. W-CDNet employs a W-shaped siamese U-net to extract feature maps from an image pair which then get compared in order to create a raw change mask. The core part of our model, the Change Segmentation and Classification (CSC) module, learns an accurate change mask at a hidden layer by using a custom Remapping Block and then segmenting the current input image with the change mask. The segmented image is used to predict the image-level semantic label. The correct label can only be predicted if the change mask actually marks relevant change. This forces the model to learn an accurate change mask. We demonstrate the segmentation and classification performance of our approach and achieve top results on AICD and HRSCD, two public aerial imaging change detection datasets as well as on a Food Waste change detection dataset.

The scene classifier classifies the visible-thermal image into legal pedestrian crossing and illegal pedestrian crossing scenes. The two scene-specific segmentation frameworks estimate the normal pedestrians and jaywalking pedestrians.

    "abstract": "Multiview similarity learning aims to measure the neighbor relationship between each pair of samples, which has been widely used in data mining and presents encouraging performance on lots of applications. Nevertheless, the recent existing multiview similarity learning methods have two main drawbacks. On one hand, the comprehensive consensus similarity is learned based on previous fixed graphs learned from all views separately, which ignores the latent cues hidden in graphs from different views. On the other hand, when the data are contaminated with noise or outlier, the performance of existing methods will decline greatly because the original true data distribution is destroyed. To address the two problems, a Robust Multiview Similarity Learning(RMvSL) method is proposed in this paper. The contributions of RMvSL includes three aspects. Firstly, the recent low-rank representation shows some advantage in removing noise and outliers, which motivates us to introduce the data representation via low-rank constraint in order to generate clean reconstructed data for robust graph learning in each view. Secondly, a multiview scheme is established to learn the consensus similarity by dynamically learned graphs from all views. Meanwhile, the consensus similarity can be used to propagate the latent relationship information from other views to learn each view graph in turn. Finally, the above two processes are put into a unified objective function to optimize the data reconstruction, view graphs learning and consensus similarity graph learning alternatingly, which can help to obtain overall optimal solutions. Experimental results on several visual data clustering demonstrates that RMvSL outperforms the most existing methods on similarity learning and presents great robustness on noisy data",

These shortcomings hinder the interactive fusion between motion information and RGB information, and greatly limit its real-world applications. In this paper, we exploit better ways to use motion information in a unified end-to-end trainable network architecture.

Second, we propose a novel motion cue called short-range-motion (SRM) module to enhance the 2DConvolutional branch to learn RGB information and dynamic motion information.

The existing example-based approaches often calculate a global pose error to search a single match 3D pose from the source library. This way fails to capture the local deformations of human pose and highly dependent on a large training set. To alleviate these issues, we propose a simple example-based approach with locality similarity preserving to estimate 3D human pose. Specifically, first of all, we split an annotated or detected 2D pose into 2D body parts with kinematic priors. Then, to recover the 3D pose from these 2D body parts, we recombine a 3D pose by using 3D body parts that are split from the 3D pose candidates. Note that joints in the combined 3D parts are refined by a weighted searching strategy during the inference. Moreover, to increase the search speed, we propose a candidate selecting mechanism to narrow the original source data. We evaluate our approach on three well-design benchmarks, including Human3.6M, HumanEva-I, and MPII. The extensive experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach.
