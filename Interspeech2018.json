    "title": "From Vocoders to Code-Excited Linear Prediction: Learning How We Hear What We Hear",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "It all started almost a century ago, in 1920s. A new undersea transatlantic telegraph cable had been laid. The idea of transmitting speech over the new telegraph cable caught the fancy of Homer Dudley, a young engineer who had just joined Bell Telephone Laboratories. This led to the invention of Vocoder - its close relative Voder was showcased as the first machine to create human speech at the 1939 New York World's Fair. However, the voice quality of vocoders was not good enough for use in commercial telephony. During the time speech scientists were busy with vocoders, several major developments took place outside speech research. Norbert Wiener developed a mathematical theory for calculating the best filters and predictors for detecting signals hidden in noise. Linear Prediction or Linear Predictive Coding became a major tool for speech processing. Claude Shannon established that the highest bit rate in a communication channel in presence of noise is achieved when the transmitted signal resembles random white Gaussian noise. Shannon's theory led to the invention of Code-Excited Linear Prediction (CELP). Nearly all digital cellular standards as well as standards for digital voice communication over the Internet use CELP coders. The success in speech coding came with understanding of what we hear and what we do not. Speech encoding at low bit rates introduce errors and these errors must be hidden under the speech signal to become inaudible. More and more, speech technologies are being used in different acoustic environments raising questions about the robustness of the technology. Human listeners handle situations well when the signal at our ears is not just one signal, but also a superposition of many acoustic signals. We need new research to develop signal-processing methods that can separate the mixed acoustic signal into individual components and provide performance similar or superior to that of human listeners",

    "title": "Semi-Supervised End-to-End Speech Recognition",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We propose a novel semi-supervised method for end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR). It can exploit large unpaired speech and text datasets, which require much less human effort to create paired speech-to-text datasets. Our semi-supervised method targets the extraction of an intermediate representation between speech and text data using a shared encoder network. Autoencoding of text data with this shared encoder improves the feature extraction of text data as well as that of speech data when the intermediate representations of speech and text are similar to each other as an inter-domain feature. In other words, by combining speech-to-text and text-to-text mappings through the shared network, we can improve speech-to-text mapping by learning to reconstruct the unpaired text data in a semi-supervised end-to-end manner. We investigate how to design suitable inter-domain loss, which minimizes the dissimilarity between the encoded speech and text sequences, which originally belong to quite different domains. The experimental results we obtained with our proposed semi-supervised training shows a larger character error rate reduction from 15.8% to 14.4% than a conventional language model integration on the Wall Street Journal dataset",

In some experiments, we also use an auxiliary CTC loss function to help the convergence. In addition, we train long short-term memory (LSTM) language models on subword units.

We demonstrate that even without re-training, our attention-equipped end-to-end model is able to deal with arbitrary numbers of input channels during inference.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recently, the connectionist temporal classification (CTC) model coupled with recurrent (RNN) or convolutional neural networks (CNN), made it easier to train speech recognition systems in an end-to-end fashion. However in real-valued models, time frame components such as mel-filter-bank energies and the cepstral coefficients obtained from them, together with their first and second order derivatives, are processed as individual elements, while a natural alternative is to process such components as composed entities. We propose to group such elements in the form of quaternions and to process these quaternions using the established quaternion algebra. Quaternion numbers and quaternion neural networks have shown their efficiency to process multidimensional inputs as entities, to encode internal dependencies and to solve many tasks with less learning parameters than real-valued models. This paper proposes to integrate multiple feature views in quaternion-valued convolutional neural network (QCNN), to be used for sequence-to-sequence mapping with the CTC model. Promising results are reported using simple QCNNs in phoneme recognition experiments with the TIMIT corpus. More precisely, QCNNs obtain a lower phoneme error rate (PER) with less learning parameters than a competing model based on real-valued CNNs",

We present a general method that enables control of arbitrary aspects of speech, which we demonstrate on the task of emotion control. Current TTS systems use supervised machine learning and are therefore heavily reliant on labelled data. If no labels are available for a desired control dimension, then creating interpretable control becomes challenging. We introduce a method that uses external, labelled data (i.e. not the original data used to train the acoustic model) to enable the control of dimensions that are not labelled in the original data. Adding interpretable control allows the voice to be manually controlled to produce more engaging speech, for applications such as audiobooks. We evaluate our method using a listening test",

Both subjective and objective results demonstrate that corrupted linguistic features, especially those in the test set, affected the ideal system's performance significantly in a statistical sense due to a mismatched condition between the training and test sets. Interestingly, while an utterance-level Turing test showed that listeners had a difficult time differentiating synthetic speech from natural speech, it further indicated that adding noise to the linguistic features in the training set can partially reduce the effect of the mismatch, regularize the model and help the system perform better when linguistic features of the test set are noisy",

    "abstract": "This paper explores speaking rate variation in Mandarin read speech. In contrast to assuming that each utterance is generated in a constant or global speaking rate, this study seeks to estimate local speaking rate for each prosodic unit in an utterance. The exploration is based on the existing speaking rate-dependent hierarchical prosodic model (SR-HPM). The main idea is to first use the SR-HPM to explore the prosodic structures of utterances and extract the prosodic units. Then, local speaking rate is estimated for each prosodic unit (prosodic phrase in this study). Some major influence factors including tone, base syllable type, prosodic structure and speaking rate of the higher prosodic units (utterance and BG/PG) are compensated in the local SR estimation. A syntactic-local SR model is constructed and use in the prosody generation of Mandarin TTS. Experimental results on a large read speech corpus generated by a professional female announcer showed that the generated prosody with local speaking rate variations is proved to be more vivid than the one with a constant speaking rate",

The proposed architecture has three components, word embedding layer, BLSTM layer and CRF layer.

The BLSTM layer can efficiently use both past and future input features, while the CRF layer can efficiently use sentence level information. We integrate these three components and learn the whole process end-to-end. In addition, we investigate both character-level embeddings and context sensitive embeddings to this model and employ an attention mechanism for combining alternative word-level embeddings. By using an attention mechanism, the model is able to decide how much information to use from each level of embeddings. Objective evaluation results show the proposed BLSTM-CRF architecture achieves the best results on both Mandarin and English datasets, with an absolute improvement of 3.21% and 3.74% in F1 score, respectively, for intonational phrase prediction, compared to previous state-of-the-art method (BLSTM).

However, speaker identity is also characterized by its prosody features, such as fundamental frequency (F0) and energy contour. We believe that with a better understanding of speaker dependent/independent prosody features, we can devise an analytic approach that addresses voice conversion in a better way. We consider that speaker dependent features reflect speaker's individuality, while speaker independent features reflect the expression of linguistic content. Therefore, the former is to be converted while the latter is to be carried over from source to target during the conversion. To achieve this, we provide an analysis of speaker dependent and speaker independent prosody patterns in different temporal scales by using wavelet transform. The centrepiece of this paper is based on the understanding that a speech utterance can be characterized by speaker dependent and independent features in its prosodic manifestations. Experiments show that the proposed prosody analysis scheme improves the prosody conversion performance consistently under the sparse representation framework",

    "abstract": "The vulnerability of automatic speaker verification (ASV) systems to spoofing is widely acknowledged. Recent years have seen an intensification in research efforts to develop spoofing countermeasures, also known as presentation attack detection (PAD) systems. Much of this work has involved the exploration of features that discriminate reliably between bona fide and spoofed speech. While there are grounds to use different front-ends for ASV and PAD systems (they are different tasks) the use of a single front-end has obvious benefits, not least convenience and computational efficiency, especially when ASV and PAD are combined. This paper investigates the performance of a variety of different features used previously for both ASV and PAD and assesses their performance when combined for both tasks. The paper also presents a Gaussian back-end fusion approach to system combination. In contrast to cascaded architectures, it relies upon the modelling of the two-dimensional score distribution stemming from the combination of ASV and PAD in parallel. This approach to combination is shown to generalise particularly well across independent ASVspoof 2017 v2.0 development and evaluation datasets",

    "abstract": "Probabilistic linear discriminant analysis (PLDA) is the leading method for computing scores in speaker recognition systems. The method models the vectors representing each audio sample as a sum of three terms: one that depends on the speaker identity, one that models the within-speaker variability and one that models any remaining variability. The last two terms are assumed to be independent across samples. We recently proposed an extension of the PLDA method, which we termed Joint PLDA (JPLDA), where the second term is considered dependent on the type of nuisance condition present in the data (e.g., the language or channel). The proposed method led to significant gains for multilanguage speaker recognition when taking language as the nuisance condition. In this paper, we present a generalization of this approach that allows for multiple nuisance terms. We show results using language and several nuisance conditions describing the acoustic characteristics of the sample and demonstrate that jointly including all these factors in the model leads to better results than including only language or acoustic condition factors. Overall, we obtain relative improvements in detection cost function between 5% and 47% for various systems and test conditions with respect to standard PLDA approaches",

Similar to the DTW approach, we rely on deep neural network (DNN) based posterior probabilities as feature vectors. The posteriors from a spoken query and a test utterance are used to compute frame-level similarities in a matrix form. This matrix contains somewhere a quasi-diagonal pattern if the query occurs in the test utterance. We propose to use this matrix as an image and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) for identifying the pattern and make a decision about the occurrence of the query.

    "abstract": "We propose to learn acoustic word embeddings with temporal context for query-by-example (QbE) speech search. The temporal context includes the leading and trailing word sequences of a word. We assume that there exist spoken word pairs in the training database. We pad the word pairs with their original temporal context to form fixed-length speech segment pairs. We obtain the acoustic word embeddings through a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) which is trained on the speech segment pairs with a triplet loss. By shifting a fixed-length analysis window through the search content, we obtain a running sequence of embeddings. In this way, searching for the spoken query is equivalent to the matching of acoustic word embeddings. The experiments show that our proposed acoustic word embeddings learned with temporal context are effective in QbE speech search. They outperform the state-of-the-art frame-level feature representations and reduce run-time computation since no dynamic time warping is required in QbE speech search. We also find that it is important to have sufficient speech segment pairs to train the deep CNN for effective acoustic word embeddings",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "With the explosive development of human-computer speech interaction, spoken term detection is widely required and has attracted increasing interest. In this paper, we propose a weak supervised approach using Siamese recurrent auto-encoder (RAE) to represent speech segments for query-by-example spoken term detection (QbyE-STD). The proposed approach exploits word pairs that contain different instances of the same/different word content as input to train the Siamese RAE. The encoder last hidden state vector of Siamese RAE is used as the feature for QbyE-STD, which is a fixed dimensional embedding feature containing mostly semantic content related information. The advantages of the proposed approach are: 1) extracting more compact feature with fixed dimension while keeping the semantic information for STD; 2) the extracted feature can describe the sequential phonetic structure of similar sounds to degree, which can be applied for zero-resource QbyE-STD. Evaluations on real scene Chinese speech interaction data and TIMIT confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach compared to the conventional ones",

    "abstract": "A universal cross-lingual representation of documents, which can capture the underlying semantics is very useful in many natural language processing tasks. In this paper, we develop a new document vectorization method which effectively selects the most salient sequential patterns from the inputs to create document vectors via a self-attention mechanism using a neural machine translation (NMT) model. The model used by our method can be trained with parallel corpora that are unrelated to the task at hand. During testing, our method will take a monolingual document and convert it into a \"Neural machine Translation framework based cross-lingual Document Vector\" (NTDV). NTDV has two comparative advantages. Firstly, the NTDV can be produced by the forward pass of the encoder in the NMT and the process is very fast and does not require any training/optimization. Secondly, our model can be conveniently adapted from a pair of existing attention based NMT models and the training requirement on parallel corpus can be reduced significantly. In a cross-lingual document classification task, our NTDV embeddings surpass the previous state-of-the-art performance in the English-to-German classification test and, to our best knowledge, it also achieves the best performance among the fast decoding methods in the German-to-English classification test",

A DNN is first trained to learn a set of hierarchical non-linear transformation parameters that project the original spectral and prosodic feature vectors onto a feature space where the distance between similar syllable pairs is small and between dissimilar syllable pairs is large. These transformed features are then fused using an attention-based long short-term memory (LSTM) network. As a side result, a deep denoising autoencoder based fine-tuning technique is used to improve the performance of sequence predictions. A sequence matching method called the sliding syllable protocol is also developed for keyword spotting. Syllable recognition and keyword spotting (KWS) experiments are conducted specifically for the Hindi language which is one of the widely spoken languages across the globe but is not addressed significantly by the speech processing community.

Active capsules at one level make predictions, via transformation matrices, for the parameters of higher-level capsules. When multiple predictions agree, a higher level capsule becomes active. We employed spectrogram representations from the short segments of an audio signal as an input of the CapsNet.

Previous approaches to infant cry classification have either applied a statistical classifier to summative features of the whole cry, or applied a syntactic pattern recognition technique to a temporal sequence of features. In this work we explore a deep neural network architecture that exploits both temporal and summative features to make a joint classification. The temporal input comprises centi-second frames of low-level signal features which are input to LSTM nodes, while the summative vector comprises a large set of statistical functionals of the same frames that are input to MLP nodes. The combined network is jointly optimized and evaluated using leave-one-speaker-out cross-validation on the challenge training set. Results are compared to independently-trained temporal and summative networks and to a baseline SVM classifier. The combined model outperforms the other models and the challenge baseline on the training set. While problems remain in finding the best configuration and training protocol for such networks, the approach seems promising for future signal classification tasks",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In the past, the performance of machine learning algorithms depended heavily on the representation of the data. Well-designed features therefore played a key role in speech and paralinguistic recognition tasks. Consequently, engineers have put a great deal of work into manually designing large and complex acoustic feature sets. With the emergence of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), however, it is now possible to automatically infer higher abstractions from simple spectral representations or even learn directly from raw waveforms. This raises the question if (complex) hand-crafted features will still be needed in the future. We take this year's INTERSPEECH Computational Paralinguistic Challenge as an opportunity to approach this issue by means of two corpora - Atypical Affect and Crying. At first, we train a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to evaluate the performance of several hand-crafted feature sets of varying complexity. Afterwards, we make the network do the feature engineering all on its own by prefixing a stack of convolutional layers. Our results show that there is no clear winner (yet).

Recently, Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN), which is combined by convolution neural network and recurrent neural network, is popular in this field and achieves state-of-art on related corpus. However, most of work on CRNN only utilizes simple spectral information, which is not capable to capture enough emotion characteristics for the SER task. In this work, we investigate two joint representation learning structures based on CRNN aiming at capturing richer emotional information from speech. Cooperating the handcrafted high-level statistic features with CRNN, a two-channel SER system (HSF-CRNN) is developed to jointly learn the emotion-related features with better discriminative property. Furthermore, considering that the time duration of speech segment significantly affects the accuracy of emotion recognition, another two-channel SER system is proposed where CRNN features extracted from different time scale of spectrogram segment are used for joint representation learning. The systems are evaluated over Atypical Affect Challenge of ComParE2018 and IEMOCAP corpus. Experimental results show that our proposed systems outperform the plain CRNN",

Six native speakers of BP participated in an ultrasound experiment and produced target phonemes in #CV, VCV and VC# environments with the vowels /i, e, a, o/. Tongue contours for the rhotics were compared using Smoothing Spline ANOVAs. /ɾ, ʁ/ were produced with a tongue body and dorsum gesture, while /ɾ/ also had an apical gesture.

BP rhotics can be described as the coordination of a tongue dorsum and a tongue body or tip gesture. ‘Archetypal' /R/ is posited to be /ɾ/. Allophony between /ɾ/ and [ɻ, ɹ, χ] is due to tongue tip lenition. Allophony between /ʁ/ and [h] is due to weakening of the tongue dorsum and body gestures.

    "abstract": "Although the TIMIT acoustic-phonetic dataset ([1], [2]) was created three decades ago, it remains in wide use, with more than 20000 Google Scholar references and more than 1000 since 2017. Despite TIMIT's antiquity and relatively small size, inspection of these references shows that it is still used in many research areas: speech recognition, speaker recognition, speech synthesis, speech coding, speech enhancement, voice activity detection, speech perception, overlap detection and source separation, diagnosis of speech and language disorders and linguistic phonetics, among others. Nevertheless, comparable datasets are not available even for other widely-studied languages, much less for under-documented languages and varieties. Therefore, we have developed a method for creating TIMIT-like datasets in new languages with modest effort and cost and we have applied this method in standard Thai, standard Mandarin Chinese, English from Chinese L2 learners, the Guanzhong dialect of Mandarin Chinese and the Ga language of West Africa. Other collections are planned or underway. The resulting datasets will be published through the LDC, along with instructions and open-source tools for replicating this method in other languages, covering the steps of sentence selection and assignment to speakers, speaker recruiting and recording, proof-listening and forced alignment",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Tashlhiyt Berber is a language in which every consonant can take up the nucleus position in a syllable. The present study investigates how gestural properties are modified when the consonants occur in different syllable positions (onset, nucleus, coda). Furthermore, the effect of higher structural components such as morphology on the respective gestural organization patterns are examined. Therefore, we collected articulographic data for different consonantal roots, such as /bdg/ and /gzm/ with varying affixes, entailing different syllabification patterns in Tashlhiyt. Consonantal properties in different syllable positions are investigated with respect to their intragestural properties and intergestural properties, i.e. bonding strength. Furthermore, gestural coherence with respect to prefixation were examined. Results reveal that consonantal gestures were not modified on the intragestural level in terms of duration, velocity, stiffness or displacement, when the morphological structure was kept constant. However, on the intergestural level syllable relation was encoded, revealing a tighter bonding for onset-nucleus relations than for heterosyllabic sequences. Furthermore, when changing the morphological marker, modifications of intragestural parameters occur, inducing temporal changes of consonantal gestures. We conclude that higher structural components should be taken into account when investigating syllable internal timing patterns",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Many languages of South Asia show a phonemic contrast between retroflexes and dentals across different manners of articulation. This contrast, however, tends to be less phonetically distinct and more variable in nasals. The goal of this paper is to examine the overall similarity of the retroflex-dental contrasts in Punjabi stops and nasals. Ultrasound tongue imaging recordings were obtained from 14 Punjabi speakers producing /ʈ,ɳ,t,n/ in the /ba_ab/ nonsense word context. Selected video frames were fed to a principal component analysis (PCA); the output was used for (1) training a linear discriminant model on one manner that discriminates place and (2) testing it on the other manner. The results showed 100% correct classification of the contrast (retroflex or dental) in stops and 92% correct classification in nasals in the training data. The classification was much poorer across different manners: on average 67% of stops and 57% of nasals were classified correctly based on training sets with nasals or stops, respectively. In both cases, retroflex responses were more common. These results suggest that the tongue configurations for Punjabi retroflex and dental consonants differ by manner of articulation. The contrast is also overall less robust in nasals than in stops, confirming previous reports",

    "abstract": "Resyllabification is a phonological process in continuous speech in which the coda of a syllable is converted into the onset of the following syllable, either in the same word or in the subsequent word. This paper presents an analysis of resyllabification across words in different Indian languages and its implications in Indian language text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis systems. The evidence for resyllabification is evaluated based on the acoustic analysis of a read speech corpus of the corresponding language. This study shows that the resyllabification obeys the maximum onset principle and introduces the notion of prominence resyllabification in Indian languages. This paper finds acoustic evidence for total resyllabification. The resyllabification rules obtained are applied to TTS systems. The correctness of the rules is evaluated quantitatively by comparing the acoustic log-likelihood scores of the speech utterances with the original and resyllabified texts and by performing a pair comparison (PC) listening test on the synthesized speech output. An improvement in the log-likelihood score with the resyllabified text is observed and the synthesized speech with the resyllabified text is preferred 3 times over those without resyllabification",

A listening test was carried out on a sentence of Irish with three accented, prominent syllables (P1, P2, P3). Using inverse filtering and resynthesis, a ‘flattened' version was generated, with only slight declination of f0 and other voice source parameters. The global waveshape parameter Rd was modulated to provide (i) source boosting (tenser phonation) on either P1 or P2 and/or (ii) source attenuation (laxer phonation) following (Post-attenuation) or preceding (Pre-attenuation) P1 or P2. Rd variation was achieved in two different ways to generate two series of stimuli. f0 was not varied in either series. Twenty-nine listeners rated the prominence level of all syllables in the utterance. Results show that the phrasal position (P1 vs. P2) makes a large difference to prominence judgements. P1 emerged as overall more prominent and more readily ‘enhanced' by the source modifications. Post-attenuation was particularly important for P1, with effects equal to or greater than local P-boosting. In the case of P2, Pre-attenuation was much more important than Post-attenuation",

This serves to elucidate their relationship to the H1-H2 estimate, widely used to make inferences on changes in Oq and voice quality. It has been suggested that H1 is mainly determined by Up and that the pulse shape has a relatively small impact. To investigate this, a series of glottal pulses were generated using the LF model, where Up was kept constant, while Oq and Rk were systematically varied. The resulting harmonic amplitudes of these pulses show that Up is not the sole determinant of H1. Rather, H1 is highly dependent on Oq and to a certain degree also on Rk. Although the effects of these parameters on the lowest harmonics is rather complex, we find that the H1-H2 measure is broadly correlated with Oq. However, there is also a strong effect of differences in glottal skew, particularly at high Oq values, which could invalidate inferences on Oq and voice quality from estimates of H1-H2",

In this paper, we examine the stability of the output of a semi-automatic system, based on the long-term formant distributions (LTFDs) of F1, F2 and F3, as the channel quality of the input recordings decreases. Cross-validated, calibrated GMM-UBM log likelihood-ratios (LLRs) were computed for 97 Standard Southern British English speakers under four conditions. In each condition the same speech material was used, but the technical properties of the recordings changed (high quality studio recording, landline telephone recording, high bit-rate GSM mobile telephone recording and low bit-rate GSM mobile telephone recording). Equal error rate (EER) and the log LR cost function (Cllr) were compared across conditions. System validity was found to decrease with poorer technical quality, with the largest differences in EER (21.66%) and Cllr (0.46) found between the studio and the low bit-rate GSM conditions. However, importantly, performance for individual speakers was affected differently by channel quality. Speakers that produced stronger evidence overall were found to be more variable.

Along with these, other aspects of a speaker's voice play an important role to convey the information to the listener such as mood, attitude and emotional state. The glottal pulse characteristics in different phonation types vary due to the tension of laryngeal muscles together with the respiratory effort. In the present study, we are deriving the features that can capture effects of excitation on the vocal tract system through a signal processing method, called as zero-time windowing (ZTW) method. The ZTW method gives the instantaneous spectrum which captures the changes in the speech production mechanism, providing higher spectral resolution. The cepstral coefficients derived from ZTW method are used for the classification of phonation types. Along with zero-time windowing cepstral coefficients (ZTWCCs), we use the excitation source features derived from zero frequency filtering (ZFF) method. The excitation features used are: strength of excitation, energy of excitation, loudness measure and ZFF signal energy. Classification experiments using ZTWCC and excitation features reveal a significant improvement in the detection of phonation type compared to the existing voice quality features and MFCC features",

Mizo is one of the few languages that has voiced and voiceless nasals in its phoneme inventory. This analysis is motivated by the interaction between breathiness and nasality reported in a number of speech perception studies using synthetic stimuli. However, there are no studies examining this interaction in vowels after voiced and voiceless nasals. Existing research has also documented the interaction between breathy phonation and vowel height. The current study is an acoustic analysis of breathiness in high and low vowels following voiced and voiceless nasals in Mizo. The acoustic parameter measures are: H1H2 ratio, spectral balance (SB), strength of excitation (SoE) and waveform peak factor (WPF). The values obtained for all the four acoustic measures suggest that vowels following voiceless nasals exhibit stronger acoustic characteristics associated with breathy phonation than vowels following voiced nasals. In addition, the degree of acoustic breathiness is affected by vowel height",

This paper reports on our efforts to manually code child utterances as being of type \"laugh\", \"cry\", \"fuss\", \"babble\" and \"hiccup\" and to develop algorithms capable of performing the same task automatically. Human labelers achieve much higher rates of inter-coder agreement for some of these categories than for others. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) achieves better accuracy on tokens that have been coded by two human labelers than on tokens that have been coded by only one labeler, but the difference is not as much as we expected, suggesting that the acoustic and contextual features being used by human labelers are not yet available to the LDA. Convolutional neural network and hidden markov model achieve better accuracy than LDA, but worse F-score, because they over-weight the prior.

This CNN consists of several parallel convolutions with different kernel sizes to exploit contextual information at different levels. A temporal pooling layer aggregates the hidden representations of different words into a unique sequence level embedding, from which we compute the emotion posteriors. We optimized a weighted sum of classification and verification losses. The verification loss tries to bring embeddings from same emotions closer while it separates embeddings for different emotions.

    "abstract": "The perceptual evaluation of emotional attributes is noisy due to inconsistencies between annotators. The low inter-evaluator agreement arises due to the complex nature of emotions. Conventional approaches average scores provided by multiple annotators. While this approach reduces the influence of dissident annotations, previous studies have showed the value of considering individual evaluations to better capture the underlying ground-truth. One of these approaches is the qualitative agreement (QA) method, which provides an alternative framework that captures the inherent trends amongst the annotators. While previous studies have focused on using the QA method for time-continuous annotations from a fixed number of annotators, most emotional databases are annotated with attributes at the sentence-level (e.g., one global score per sentence). This study proposes a novel formulation based on the QA framework to estimate reliable sentence-level annotations for preference-learning. The proposed relative labels between pairs of sentences capture consistent trends across evaluators. The experimental evaluation shows that preference-learning methods to rank-order emotional attributes trained with the proposed QA-based labels achieve significantly better performance than the same algorithms trained with relative scores obtained by averaging absolute scores across annotators. These results show the benefits of QA-based labels for preference-learning using sentence-level annotations",

Subsequently, we apply transfer learning to predict gender using feature embeddings obtained from a model pre-trained for large-scale audio classification. In order to account for the diverse acoustic conditions in movie audio, we use audio clips from YouTube labeled for gender. We compare the performance of our proposed method with baseline experiments that were setup to assess the importance of feature embeddings and training data used for gender identification task.

We propose a convolutional neural networks (CNN) based gender classifier that consists of: (1) convolution layers, which can be interpreted as a feature learning stage and (2) a multilayer perceptron (MLP), which can be interpreted as a classification stage. The system takes raw speech signal as input and outputs gender posterior probabilities. Experimental studies conducted on two datasets, namely AVspoof and ASVspoof 2015, with different architectures show that with simple architectures the proposed approach yields better system than standard acoustic features based approach. Further analysis of the CNNs show that the CNNs learn formant and fundamental frequency information for gender identification",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a raw-waveform neural network and uses it along with a denoising network for clustering in weakly-supervised learning scenarios under extreme noise conditions. Specifically, we consider language independent gender identification on a set of varied noise conditions and signal to noise ratios (SNRs). We formulate the denoising problem as a source separation task and train the system using a discriminative criterion in order to enhance output SNRs. A denoising recurrent neural network (RNN) is first trained on a small subset (roughly one-fifth) of the data for learning a speech-specific mask. The denoised speech signal is then directly fed as input to a raw-waveform convolutional neural network (CNN) trained with denoised speech. We evaluate the standalone performance of denoiser in terms of various signal-to-noise measures and discuss its contribution towards robust gender identification. An absolute improvement of 11.06% and 13.33% is achieved by the combined pipeline over the i-vector SVM baseline system for 0 dB and -5 dB SNR conditions, respectively. We further analyse the information captured by the first CNN layer in both noisy and denoised speech",

To better explore time dependencies, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with long short-term memory (LSTM) are adopted for both generator and discriminator in this study. We evaluated SSGAN-PIT on the WSJ0 two-talker mixed speech separation task and found that SSGAN-PIT outperforms SSGAN without PIT and the neural networks based speech separation with or without PIT.

However, it remains challenging to achieve satisfying performance provided a very short available target speaker utterance (anchor).

The proposed model is different from prior works that the carnonical embedding space encodes knowledges of both the anchor and the mixture during training phase: first, embeddings for the anchor and mixture speech are separately constructed in a primary embedding space and then combined as an input to feed-forward layers to transform to a carnonical embedding space which we discover more stable than the primary one. Experimental results show that given a very short utterance, the proposed model can efficiently recover high quality target speech from a mixture, which outperforms various baseline models, with 5.2% and 6.6% relative improvements in SDR and PESQ respectively compared with a baseline oracle deep attracor model.

Despite decades of research on this topic, F0 estimation at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) in unexpected noise conditions remains difficult. This work proposes a new approach to noise robust F0 estimation using a recurrent neural network (RNN) trained in a supervised manner. Recent studies employ deep neural networks (DNNs) for F0 tracking as a frame-by-frame classification task into quantised frequency states but we propose waveform-to-sinusoid regression instead to achieve both noise robustness and accurate estimation with increased frequency resolution. Experimental results with PTDB-TUG corpus contaminated by additive noise (NOISEX-92) demonstrate that the proposed method improves gross pitch error (GPE) rate and fine pitch error (FPE) by more than 35% at SNRs between -10 dB and +10 dB compared with well-known noise robust F0 tracker, PEFAC.

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art methods for monaural singing voice separation consist in estimating the magnitude spectrum of the voice in the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) domain by means of deep neural networks (DNNs). The resulting magnitude estimate is then combined with the mixture's phase to retrieve the complex-valued STFT of the voice, which is further synthesized into a time-domain signal. However, when the sources overlap in time and frequency, the STFT phase of the voice differs from the mixture's phase, which results in interference and artifacts in the estimated signals. In this paper, we investigate on recent phase recovery algorithms that tackle this issue and can further enhance the separation quality. These algorithms exploit phase constraints that originate from a sinusoidal model or from consistency, a property that is a direct consequence of the STFT redundancy. Experiments conducted on real music songs show that those algorithms are efficient for reducing interference in the estimated voice compared to the baseline approach",

Self-similarity matrix (SSM) of a feature sequence is a square matrix, which encodes the acoustic-phonetic composition of the underlying speech signal. Deviations in the acoustic characteristics of underlying sound units due to the degradation of intelligibility will deviate the CLP speech's SSM structure from that of normal. This degree of deviations in CLP speech's SSM from the corresponding normal speech's SSM may provide information about the severity profile of speech intelligibility. The degree of deviations is quantified using the structural similarity (SSIM) index, which is considered as the representative of objective intelligibility score. The proposed method is evaluated using two parameterizations of speech signals: Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients and Gaussian posteriorgrams and compared with dynamic time warping (DTW) based intelligibility assessment method.

    "abstract": "Hypernasality in cleft palate (CP) children is due to the velopharyngeal insufficiency. The vowels get nasalized in hypernasal speech and the nasality evidence are mainly present in low-frequency region around the first formant (F1) of vowels. The detection of hypernasality using Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) feature may get affected because the feature might not be able to capture the nasality evidence present in the low-frequency region. This is due to the fact that the MFCC feature extracted from high pitched children speech contains the pitch harmonics effect of magnitude spectrum. The pitch harmonics effect results in high variance for the higher dimensions of MFCC coefficients. This problem may increase due to high perturbation in pitch of CP speech. So in this work, a pitch-adaptive MFCC feature is used for hypernasality detection. The feature is derived from the cepstral smooth spectrum instead of magnitude spectrum. A pitch-adaptive low time liftering is done to smooth out the pitch harmonics. This feature when used for the detection of hypernasality using support vector machine (SVM) gives an accuracy of 83.45%, 88.04% and 85.58% for /a/, /i/ and /u/ vowels respectively, which is better than the accuracy of MFCC feature",

While we empirically find that such a combination gives slight improvements in perplexity over the combination of forward and backward models, we finally show that a combination of the same number of forward models gives the best perplexity and word error rate (WER) overall",

These models, called neural error corrective language models (NECLMs), utilizes ASR hypotheses of a target utterance as a context for estimating the generative probability of words. NECLMs are expressed as conditional generative models composed of an encoder network and a decoder network. In the models, the encoder network constructs context vectors from N-best lists and ASR confidence scores generated in a speech recognizer. The decoder network rescores recognition hypotheses by computing a generative probability of words using the context vectors so as to correct ASR errors. We evaluate the proposed models in Japanese lecture ASR tasks. Experimental results show that NECLM achieve better ASR performance than a state-of-the-art ASR system that incorporate a convolutional neural network acoustic model and a long short-term memory recurrent neural network language model",

We propose a method based on the contrastive estimation method that alleviates the need for such data. Experiments in the music domain demonstrate that global features, as well as features extracted from an external knowledge-base, can be incorporated into our reranker.

German and Cantonese-speaking participants freely labeled such utterances in the two languages and assigned to each stimulus a verbal label. Based on the results of the four experiments we were able to establish to what degree the attitudinal frames of reference of the two groups overlap and how they differ. Verbal labels were assessed regarding their emotional content in terms of valence, activation and dominance and for the linguistic opposition between assertive and interrogative speech act and hence permit to abstract from the language of the rater and ultimately even abstract from the attitudinal categories used when eliciting the stimuli. Instead we regard each utterance as a data-point in the emotional space. We found that the judgments of the two rater groups agree well with respect to the valence of attitudinal expressions and diverge most as to the perceived activation of the stimulus presenter. Cantonese speaking participants seem to mirror Germans' ratings of German stimuli better than vice versa, which suggests an interesting asymmetry of attitudinal perception. As for the modality of presentation, the audio channel primarily transmits linguistically relevant information regarding the opposition of assertion and interrogation while the visual information signals the emotional content",

    "abstract": "Video blogging is a form of unidirectional communication where a video blogger expresses his/her opinion about different issues. The success of a video blog is measured using metrics like the number of views and comments by online viewers. Researchers have highlighted the importance of non-verbal behaviours (e.g. attitudes) in the context of video blogging and showed that it correlates with the level of attention (number of views) gained by a video blog. Therefore, an automatic attitude recognition system can help potential video bloggers to train their attitudes. It can also be useful in developing video blogs summarization and search tools. This study proposes a novel Active Feature Transformation (AFT) method for automatic recognition of attitudes (a form of non-verbal behaviour) in video blogs. The proposed method transforms the Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) features for the classification task. The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) transformation is also used for comparison.

This is due to difficulty in deriving the excitation source features using inverse filtering from singing voice. We propose to use the excitation source features that are derived directly from the signal. It is known that, the characteristics of the excitation source vary in different phonation types due to the vibration of the vocal folds together with the respiratory effort (lungs effort).

Initially Convolutional Deep Belief Network (CDBN) are used to pre-train the weights of CNN system. This acts as a generative model to explore the structure of the input data using statistical methods. Then a CNN is trained using supervised back-propagation learning algorithm to fine tune the weights. Results show that a small amount of data can be used to achieve good results in classification with this deep learning approach.

Dysarthria is a voice disorder where individuals are unable to control one or more of the aspects of speech—the articulation, breathing, voicing, or prosody—leading to less intelligible speech. In this paper, we evaluate the accuracy of state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition systems (ASRs) on two dysarthric speech datasets and compare the results to ASR performance on control speech. The limits of ASR performance using different voices have not been explored since the field has shifted from generative models of speech recognition to deep neural network architectures. To test how far the field has come in recognizing disordered speech, we test two different ASR systems: (1) Carnegie Mellon University's Sphinx Open Source Recognition and (2) Google®Speech Recognition. While (1) uses generative models of speech recognition, (2) uses deep neural networks. As expected, while (2) achieved lower word error rates (WER) on dysarthric speech than (1), control speech had a WER 59% lower than dysarthric speech. Future studies should be focused not only on making ASRs robust to environmental noise, but also more robust to different voices",

    "abstract": "The acoustic quality of exemplar-based voice conversion (VC) degrades whenever the phoneme labels of the selected exemplars do not match the phonetic content of the frame being represented. To address this issue, we propose a Phoneme-Selective Objective Function (PSOF) that promotes a sparse representation of each speech frame with exemplars from a few phoneme classes. Namely, PSOF enforces group sparsity on the representation, where each group corresponds to a phoneme class. The sparse representation for exemplars within a phoneme class tends to activate or suppress simultaneously using the proposed objective function. We conducted two sets of experiments on the ARCTIC corpus to evaluate the proposed method. First, we evaluated the ability of PSOF to reduce phoneme mismatches. Then, we assessed its performance on a VC task and compared it against three baseline methods from previous studies. Results from objective measurements and subjective listening tests show that the proposed method effectively reduces phoneme mismatches and significantly improves VC acoustic quality while retaining the voice identity of the target speaker",

    "abstract": "Incorporating phonetic information has been shown to improve the performance of exemplar-based voice conversion. A standard approach is to build a phonetically structured dictionary, where exemplars are categorized into sub-dictionaries according to their phoneme labels. However, acquiring phoneme labels can be expensive and the phoneme labels can have inaccuracies. The latter problem becomes more salient when the speakers are non-native speakers. This paper presents an iterative dictionary-learning algorithm that avoids the need for phoneme labels and instead learns the structured dictionaries in an unsupervised fashion. At each iteration, two steps are alternatively performed: cluster update and dictionary update. In the cluster update step, each training frame is assigned to a cluster whose sub-dictionary represents it with the lowest residual. In the dictionary update step, the sub-dictionary for a cluster is updated using all the speech frames in the cluster. We evaluate the proposed algorithm through objective and subjective experiments on a new corpus of non-native English speech. Compared to previous studies, the proposed algorithm improves the acoustic quality of voice-converted speech while retaining the target speaker's identity",

When performing spectral conversion (SC) under this framework, the low-dimensional spectral features, such as mel-ceptral coefficients (MCCs), are often adopted to represent the high-dimensional spectral envelopes. The joint density Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-based SC method with the STRAIGHT vocoder is a well-known representative. Although it is reasonably effective, the loss of spectral details in the converted spectral envelopes inevitably deteriorates speech quality and similarity. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel exemplar-based spectral detail compensation method for VC. In the offline stage, the paired dictionaries of source spectral envelopes and target spectral details are constructed. In the online stage, the locally linear embedding (LLE) algorithm is applied to predict the target spectral details from the source spectral envelopes and then, the predicted spectral details are used to compensate the converted spectral envelopes obtained by a baseline GMM-based SC method with the STRAIGHT vocoder. Experimental results show that the proposed method can notably improve the baseline system in terms of objective and subjective tests",

We use a BLSTM to map the spectral features of whispered speech to those of neutral speech. Three other BLSTMs are employed to predict the pitch, periodicity levels and the voiced/unvoiced phoneme decisions from the spectral features of whispered speech. We use objective measures to quantify the quality of the predicted spectral features and excitation parameters, using data recorded from six subjects, in a four fold setup. We find that the temporal smoothness of the spectral features predicted using the proposed BLSTM based system is statistically more compared to that predicted using deep neural network based baseline schemes. We also observe that while the performance of the proposed system is comparable to the baseline scheme for pitch prediction, it is superior in terms of classifying voicing decisions and predicting periodicity levels. From subjective evaluation via listening test, we find that the proposed method is chosen as the best performing scheme 26.61% (absolute) more often than the best baseline scheme.

Two systems are studied: (1) the i-vector-based VC (IVC) system and (2) the speaker-encoder-based VC (SEVC) system. Phonetic PosteriorGrams are adopted as speaker-independent linguistic features extracted from speech samples. Both systems train a multi-speaker deep bidirectional long-short term memory (DBLSTM) VC model, taking in additional inputs that encode speaker identities, in order to generate the outputs. In the IVC system, the speaker identity of a new target speaker is represented by i-vectors. In the SEVC system, the speaker identity is represented by speaker embedding predicted from a separately trained model. Experiments verify the effectiveness of both systems in achieving VC based only on a single target-speaker utterance. Furthermore, the IVC approach is superior to SEVC, in terms of the quality of the converted speech and its similarity to the utterance produced by the genuine target speaker",

    "abstract": "Recently, cycle-consistent adversarial network (Cycle-GAN) has been successfully applied to voice conversion to a different speaker without parallel data, although in those approaches an individual model is needed for each target speaker. In this paper, we propose an adversarial learning framework for voice conversion, with which a single model can be trained to convert the voice to many different speakers, all without parallel data, by separating the speaker characteristics from the linguistic content in speech signals. An autoencoder is first trained to extract speaker-independent latent representations and speaker embedding separately using another auxiliary speaker classifier to regularize the latent representation. The decoder then takes the speaker-independent latent representation and the target speaker embedding as the input to generate the voice of the target speaker with the linguistic content of the source utterance. The quality of decoder output is further improved by patching with the residual signal produced by another pair of generator and discriminator. A target speaker set size of 20 was tested in the preliminary experiments and very good voice quality was obtained. Conventional voice conversion metrics are reported. We also show that the speaker information has been properly reduced from the latent representations",

    "abstract": "Acoustic emotion recognition is a popular and central research direction in paralinguistic analysis, due its relation to a wide range of affective states/traits and manifold applications. Developing highly generalizable models still remains as a challenge for researchers and engineers, because of multitude of nuisance factors. To assert generalization, deployed models need to handle spontaneous speech recorded under different acoustic conditions compared to the training set. This requires that the models are tested for cross-corpus robustness. In this work, we first investigate the suitability of Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) models trained with time- and space-continuously annotated affective primitives for cross-corpus acoustic emotion recognition. We next employ an effective approach to use the frame level valence and arousal predictions of LSTM models for utterance level affect classification and apply this approach on the ComParE 2018 challenge corpora. The proposed method alone gives motivating results both on development and test set of the Self-Assessed Affect Sub-Challenge. On the development set, the cross-corpus prediction based method gives a boost to performance when fused with top components of the baseline system.

We have investigated cues related to the perception of the emotional valence according to three main relevant linguistic levels: phonetics, lexical and prosodic. For this purpose we studied: the degree-of-articulation, the voice quality, an affect lexicon and the expressive prosodic contours. For the phonetics level, a set of gender-dependent audio-features was computed on vowel analysis (voice quality and speech articulation measurements). At the lexical level, an affect lexicon was extracted from the automatic transcription of the USoMS database. This lexicon has been assessed for the Challenge task comparatively to a reference polarity lexicon. In order to detect expressive prosody, N-gram models of the prosodic contours were computed from an intonation labeling system. At last, an emotional valence classifier was designed combining ComParE and eGeMAPS feature sets with other phonetic, prosodic and lexical features.

For this, we apply pitch stylization on each syllable segment in the audio. Further, we compute a quality score using the learner`s patterns and the respective ground-truth patterns. Finally, the score, the patterns of the learners and the ground-truth are sent to the front-end for display as a feedback to the learners.

End-to-end trainable dialogue systems recently attracted a lot of attention because they offer several advantages over traditional systems. One of them is the avoidance to train each system module independently, by creating a single network architecture which maps an input to the corresponding output without the need for intermediate representations. While the end-to-end system investigated here had been tested in a text-in/out scenario it remained an open question how the system would perform in a speech-in/out scenario, with noisy input from a speech recognizer and output speech generated by a speech synthesizer. To evaluate this, both dialogue systems were trained on the same corpus, including human-human dialogues in the Cambridge restaurant domain, and then compared in both scenarios by human evaluation. The results show, that in both interfaces the end-to-end system receives significantly higher ratings on all metrics than the traditional modular system, an indication that it enables users to reach their goals faster and experience both a more natural system response and a better comprehension by the dialogue system",

    "abstract": "Acoustic-prosodic entrainment describes the tendency of humans to align or adapt their speech acoustics to each other in conversation. This alignment of spoken behavior has important implications for conversational success. However, modeling the subtle nature of entrainment in spoken dialogue continues to pose a challenge. In this paper, we propose a straightforward definition for local entrainment in the speech domain and operationalize an algorithm based on this: acoustic-prosodic features that capture entrainment should be maximally different between real conversations involving two partners and sham conversations generated by randomly mixing the speaking turns from the original two conversational partners. We propose an approach for measuring local entrainment that quantifies alignment of behavior on a turn-by-turn basis, projecting the differences between interlocutors' acoustic-prosodic features for a given turn onto a discriminative feature subspace that maximizes the difference between real and sham conversations. We evaluate the method using the derived features to drive a classifier aiming to predict an objective measure of conversational success (i.e., low versus high), on a corpus of task-oriented conversations. The proposed entrainment approach achieves 72% classification accuracy using a Naive Bayes classifier, outperforming three previously established approaches evaluated on the same conversational corpus",

    "abstract": "For spoken dialog systems to conduct fluid conversational interactions with users, the systems must be sensitive to turn-taking cues produced by a user. Models should be designed so that effective decisions can be made as to when it is appropriate, or not, for the system to speak. Traditional end-of-turn models, where decisions are made at utterance end-points, are limited in their ability to model fast turn-switches and overlap. A more flexible approach is to model turn-taking in a continuous manner using RNNs, where the system predicts speech probability scores for discrete frames within a future window. The continuous predictions represent generalized turn-taking behaviors observed in the training data and can be applied to make decisions that are not just limited to end-of-turn detection. In this paper, we investigate optimal speech-related feature sets for making predictions at pauses and overlaps in conversation. We find that while traditional acoustic features perform well, part-of-speech features generally perform worse than word features. We show that our current models outperform previously reported baselines",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a multiclass classification of correction dialog turns using machine learning. The classes are determined by the type of the introduced recognition errors while performing WOz trials and creating the multilingual corpus. Three datasets were obtained using different sets of acoustic-prosodic features on the multilingual dialogue corpus. The classification experiments were done using different machine learning paradigms: Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines and Deep Learning. After careful experiments setup and optimization on the hyper-parameter space, the obtained classification results were analyzed and compared in the terms of accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score. The achieved results are comparable with those obtained in similar experiments on different tasks and speech databases",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In the slot-filling paradigm, where a user can refer back to slots in the context during the conversation, the goal of the contextual understanding system is to resolve the referring expressions to the appropriate slots in the context. In large-scale multi-domain systems, this presents two challenges - scaling to a very large and potentially unbounded set of slot values and dealing with diverse schemas. We present a neural network architecture that addresses the slot value scalability challenge by reformulating the contextual interpretation as a decision to carryover a slot from a set of possible candidates. To deal with heterogenous schemas, we introduce a simple data-driven method for transforming the candidate slots. Our experiments show that our approach can scale to multiple domains and provides competitive results over a strong baseline",

    "title": "Capsule Networks for Low Resource Spoken Language Understanding",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Designing a spoken language understanding system for command-and-control applications can be challenging because of a wide variety of domains and users or because of a lack of training data. In this paper we discuss a system that learns from scratch from user demonstrations. This method has the advantage that the same system can be used for many domains and users without modifications and that no training data is required prior to deployment. The user is required to train the system, so for a user friendly experience it is crucial to minimize the required amount of data. In this paper we investigate whether a capsule network can make efficient use of the limited amount of available training data. We compare the proposed model to an approach based on Non-negative Matrix Factorisation which is the state-of-the-art in this setting and another deep learning approach that was recently introduced for end-to-end spoken language understanding. We show that the proposed model outperforms the baseline models for three command-and-control applications: controlling a small robot, a vocally guided card game and a home automation task",

    "title": "Intent Discovery Through Unsupervised Semantic Text Clustering",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Conversational systems need to understand spoken language to be able to converse with a human in a meaningful coherent manner. This understanding (Spoken Language understanding - SLU) of the human language is operationalized through identifying intents and entities. While classification methods that rely on labeled data are often used for SLU, creating large supervised data sets is extremely tedious and time consuming. This paper presents a practical approach to automate the process of intent discovery on unlabeled data sets of human language text through clustering techniques. We explore a range of representations for the texts and various clustering methods to validate the clustering stability through quantitative metrics like Adjusted Random Index (ARI). A final alignment of the clusters to the semantic intent is determined through consensus labelling. Our experiments on public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach generating homogeneous clusters with 89% cluster accuracy, leading to better semantic intent alignments. Furthermore, we illustrate that the clustering offer an alternate and effective way to mine sentence variants that can aid the bootstrapping of SLU models",
