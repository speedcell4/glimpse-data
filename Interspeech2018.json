    "title": "From Vocoders to Code-Excited Linear Prediction: Learning How We Hear What We Hear",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "It all started almost a century ago, in 1920s. A new undersea transatlantic telegraph cable had been laid. The idea of transmitting speech over the new telegraph cable caught the fancy of Homer Dudley, a young engineer who had just joined Bell Telephone Laboratories. This led to the invention of Vocoder - its close relative Voder was showcased as the first machine to create human speech at the 1939 New York World's Fair. However, the voice quality of vocoders was not good enough for use in commercial telephony. During the time speech scientists were busy with vocoders, several major developments took place outside speech research. Norbert Wiener developed a mathematical theory for calculating the best filters and predictors for detecting signals hidden in noise. Linear Prediction or Linear Predictive Coding became a major tool for speech processing. Claude Shannon established that the highest bit rate in a communication channel in presence of noise is achieved when the transmitted signal resembles random white Gaussian noise. Shannon's theory led to the invention of Code-Excited Linear Prediction (CELP). Nearly all digital cellular standards as well as standards for digital voice communication over the Internet use CELP coders. The success in speech coding came with understanding of what we hear and what we do not. Speech encoding at low bit rates introduce errors and these errors must be hidden under the speech signal to become inaudible. More and more, speech technologies are being used in different acoustic environments raising questions about the robustness of the technology. Human listeners handle situations well when the signal at our ears is not just one signal, but also a superposition of many acoustic signals. We need new research to develop signal-processing methods that can separate the mixed acoustic signal into individual components and provide performance similar or superior to that of human listeners",

    "title": "Semi-Supervised End-to-End Speech Recognition",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We propose a novel semi-supervised method for end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR). It can exploit large unpaired speech and text datasets, which require much less human effort to create paired speech-to-text datasets. Our semi-supervised method targets the extraction of an intermediate representation between speech and text data using a shared encoder network. Autoencoding of text data with this shared encoder improves the feature extraction of text data as well as that of speech data when the intermediate representations of speech and text are similar to each other as an inter-domain feature. In other words, by combining speech-to-text and text-to-text mappings through the shared network, we can improve speech-to-text mapping by learning to reconstruct the unpaired text data in a semi-supervised end-to-end manner. We investigate how to design suitable inter-domain loss, which minimizes the dissimilarity between the encoded speech and text sequences, which originally belong to quite different domains. The experimental results we obtained with our proposed semi-supervised training shows a larger character error rate reduction from 15.8% to 14.4% than a conventional language model integration on the Wall Street Journal dataset",

In some experiments, we also use an auxiliary CTC loss function to help the convergence. In addition, we train long short-term memory (LSTM) language models on subword units.

We demonstrate that even without re-training, our attention-equipped end-to-end model is able to deal with arbitrary numbers of input channels during inference.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recently, the connectionist temporal classification (CTC) model coupled with recurrent (RNN) or convolutional neural networks (CNN), made it easier to train speech recognition systems in an end-to-end fashion. However in real-valued models, time frame components such as mel-filter-bank energies and the cepstral coefficients obtained from them, together with their first and second order derivatives, are processed as individual elements, while a natural alternative is to process such components as composed entities. We propose to group such elements in the form of quaternions and to process these quaternions using the established quaternion algebra. Quaternion numbers and quaternion neural networks have shown their efficiency to process multidimensional inputs as entities, to encode internal dependencies and to solve many tasks with less learning parameters than real-valued models. This paper proposes to integrate multiple feature views in quaternion-valued convolutional neural network (QCNN), to be used for sequence-to-sequence mapping with the CTC model. Promising results are reported using simple QCNNs in phoneme recognition experiments with the TIMIT corpus. More precisely, QCNNs obtain a lower phoneme error rate (PER) with less learning parameters than a competing model based on real-valued CNNs",

We present a general method that enables control of arbitrary aspects of speech, which we demonstrate on the task of emotion control. Current TTS systems use supervised machine learning and are therefore heavily reliant on labelled data. If no labels are available for a desired control dimension, then creating interpretable control becomes challenging. We introduce a method that uses external, labelled data (i.e. not the original data used to train the acoustic model) to enable the control of dimensions that are not labelled in the original data. Adding interpretable control allows the voice to be manually controlled to produce more engaging speech, for applications such as audiobooks. We evaluate our method using a listening test",

Both subjective and objective results demonstrate that corrupted linguistic features, especially those in the test set, affected the ideal system's performance significantly in a statistical sense due to a mismatched condition between the training and test sets. Interestingly, while an utterance-level Turing test showed that listeners had a difficult time differentiating synthetic speech from natural speech, it further indicated that adding noise to the linguistic features in the training set can partially reduce the effect of the mismatch, regularize the model and help the system perform better when linguistic features of the test set are noisy",

    "abstract": "This paper explores speaking rate variation in Mandarin read speech. In contrast to assuming that each utterance is generated in a constant or global speaking rate, this study seeks to estimate local speaking rate for each prosodic unit in an utterance. The exploration is based on the existing speaking rate-dependent hierarchical prosodic model (SR-HPM). The main idea is to first use the SR-HPM to explore the prosodic structures of utterances and extract the prosodic units. Then, local speaking rate is estimated for each prosodic unit (prosodic phrase in this study). Some major influence factors including tone, base syllable type, prosodic structure and speaking rate of the higher prosodic units (utterance and BG/PG) are compensated in the local SR estimation. A syntactic-local SR model is constructed and use in the prosody generation of Mandarin TTS. Experimental results on a large read speech corpus generated by a professional female announcer showed that the generated prosody with local speaking rate variations is proved to be more vivid than the one with a constant speaking rate",

The proposed architecture has three components, word embedding layer, BLSTM layer and CRF layer.

The BLSTM layer can efficiently use both past and future input features, while the CRF layer can efficiently use sentence level information. We integrate these three components and learn the whole process end-to-end. In addition, we investigate both character-level embeddings and context sensitive embeddings to this model and employ an attention mechanism for combining alternative word-level embeddings. By using an attention mechanism, the model is able to decide how much information to use from each level of embeddings. Objective evaluation results show the proposed BLSTM-CRF architecture achieves the best results on both Mandarin and English datasets, with an absolute improvement of 3.21% and 3.74% in F1 score, respectively, for intonational phrase prediction, compared to previous state-of-the-art method (BLSTM).

However, speaker identity is also characterized by its prosody features, such as fundamental frequency (F0) and energy contour. We believe that with a better understanding of speaker dependent/independent prosody features, we can devise an analytic approach that addresses voice conversion in a better way. We consider that speaker dependent features reflect speaker's individuality, while speaker independent features reflect the expression of linguistic content. Therefore, the former is to be converted while the latter is to be carried over from source to target during the conversion. To achieve this, we provide an analysis of speaker dependent and speaker independent prosody patterns in different temporal scales by using wavelet transform. The centrepiece of this paper is based on the understanding that a speech utterance can be characterized by speaker dependent and independent features in its prosodic manifestations. Experiments show that the proposed prosody analysis scheme improves the prosody conversion performance consistently under the sparse representation framework",

    "abstract": "The vulnerability of automatic speaker verification (ASV) systems to spoofing is widely acknowledged. Recent years have seen an intensification in research efforts to develop spoofing countermeasures, also known as presentation attack detection (PAD) systems. Much of this work has involved the exploration of features that discriminate reliably between bona fide and spoofed speech. While there are grounds to use different front-ends for ASV and PAD systems (they are different tasks) the use of a single front-end has obvious benefits, not least convenience and computational efficiency, especially when ASV and PAD are combined. This paper investigates the performance of a variety of different features used previously for both ASV and PAD and assesses their performance when combined for both tasks. The paper also presents a Gaussian back-end fusion approach to system combination. In contrast to cascaded architectures, it relies upon the modelling of the two-dimensional score distribution stemming from the combination of ASV and PAD in parallel. This approach to combination is shown to generalise particularly well across independent ASVspoof 2017 v2.0 development and evaluation datasets",

    "abstract": "Probabilistic linear discriminant analysis (PLDA) is the leading method for computing scores in speaker recognition systems. The method models the vectors representing each audio sample as a sum of three terms: one that depends on the speaker identity, one that models the within-speaker variability and one that models any remaining variability. The last two terms are assumed to be independent across samples. We recently proposed an extension of the PLDA method, which we termed Joint PLDA (JPLDA), where the second term is considered dependent on the type of nuisance condition present in the data (e.g., the language or channel). The proposed method led to significant gains for multilanguage speaker recognition when taking language as the nuisance condition. In this paper, we present a generalization of this approach that allows for multiple nuisance terms. We show results using language and several nuisance conditions describing the acoustic characteristics of the sample and demonstrate that jointly including all these factors in the model leads to better results than including only language or acoustic condition factors. Overall, we obtain relative improvements in detection cost function between 5% and 47% for various systems and test conditions with respect to standard PLDA approaches",

Similar to the DTW approach, we rely on deep neural network (DNN) based posterior probabilities as feature vectors. The posteriors from a spoken query and a test utterance are used to compute frame-level similarities in a matrix form. This matrix contains somewhere a quasi-diagonal pattern if the query occurs in the test utterance. We propose to use this matrix as an image and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) for identifying the pattern and make a decision about the occurrence of the query.

    "abstract": "We propose to learn acoustic word embeddings with temporal context for query-by-example (QbE) speech search. The temporal context includes the leading and trailing word sequences of a word. We assume that there exist spoken word pairs in the training database. We pad the word pairs with their original temporal context to form fixed-length speech segment pairs. We obtain the acoustic word embeddings through a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) which is trained on the speech segment pairs with a triplet loss. By shifting a fixed-length analysis window through the search content, we obtain a running sequence of embeddings. In this way, searching for the spoken query is equivalent to the matching of acoustic word embeddings. The experiments show that our proposed acoustic word embeddings learned with temporal context are effective in QbE speech search. They outperform the state-of-the-art frame-level feature representations and reduce run-time computation since no dynamic time warping is required in QbE speech search. We also find that it is important to have sufficient speech segment pairs to train the deep CNN for effective acoustic word embeddings",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "With the explosive development of human-computer speech interaction, spoken term detection is widely required and has attracted increasing interest. In this paper, we propose a weak supervised approach using Siamese recurrent auto-encoder (RAE) to represent speech segments for query-by-example spoken term detection (QbyE-STD). The proposed approach exploits word pairs that contain different instances of the same/different word content as input to train the Siamese RAE. The encoder last hidden state vector of Siamese RAE is used as the feature for QbyE-STD, which is a fixed dimensional embedding feature containing mostly semantic content related information. The advantages of the proposed approach are: 1) extracting more compact feature with fixed dimension while keeping the semantic information for STD; 2) the extracted feature can describe the sequential phonetic structure of similar sounds to degree, which can be applied for zero-resource QbyE-STD. Evaluations on real scene Chinese speech interaction data and TIMIT confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach compared to the conventional ones",

    "abstract": "A universal cross-lingual representation of documents, which can capture the underlying semantics is very useful in many natural language processing tasks. In this paper, we develop a new document vectorization method which effectively selects the most salient sequential patterns from the inputs to create document vectors via a self-attention mechanism using a neural machine translation (NMT) model. The model used by our method can be trained with parallel corpora that are unrelated to the task at hand. During testing, our method will take a monolingual document and convert it into a \"Neural machine Translation framework based cross-lingual Document Vector\" (NTDV). NTDV has two comparative advantages. Firstly, the NTDV can be produced by the forward pass of the encoder in the NMT and the process is very fast and does not require any training/optimization. Secondly, our model can be conveniently adapted from a pair of existing attention based NMT models and the training requirement on parallel corpus can be reduced significantly. In a cross-lingual document classification task, our NTDV embeddings surpass the previous state-of-the-art performance in the English-to-German classification test and, to our best knowledge, it also achieves the best performance among the fast decoding methods in the German-to-English classification test",

A DNN is first trained to learn a set of hierarchical non-linear transformation parameters that project the original spectral and prosodic feature vectors onto a feature space where the distance between similar syllable pairs is small and between dissimilar syllable pairs is large. These transformed features are then fused using an attention-based long short-term memory (LSTM) network. As a side result, a deep denoising autoencoder based fine-tuning technique is used to improve the performance of sequence predictions. A sequence matching method called the sliding syllable protocol is also developed for keyword spotting. Syllable recognition and keyword spotting (KWS) experiments are conducted specifically for the Hindi language which is one of the widely spoken languages across the globe but is not addressed significantly by the speech processing community.

Active capsules at one level make predictions, via transformation matrices, for the parameters of higher-level capsules. When multiple predictions agree, a higher level capsule becomes active. We employed spectrogram representations from the short segments of an audio signal as an input of the CapsNet.

Previous approaches to infant cry classification have either applied a statistical classifier to summative features of the whole cry, or applied a syntactic pattern recognition technique to a temporal sequence of features. In this work we explore a deep neural network architecture that exploits both temporal and summative features to make a joint classification. The temporal input comprises centi-second frames of low-level signal features which are input to LSTM nodes, while the summative vector comprises a large set of statistical functionals of the same frames that are input to MLP nodes. The combined network is jointly optimized and evaluated using leave-one-speaker-out cross-validation on the challenge training set. Results are compared to independently-trained temporal and summative networks and to a baseline SVM classifier. The combined model outperforms the other models and the challenge baseline on the training set. While problems remain in finding the best configuration and training protocol for such networks, the approach seems promising for future signal classification tasks",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In the past, the performance of machine learning algorithms depended heavily on the representation of the data. Well-designed features therefore played a key role in speech and paralinguistic recognition tasks. Consequently, engineers have put a great deal of work into manually designing large and complex acoustic feature sets. With the emergence of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), however, it is now possible to automatically infer higher abstractions from simple spectral representations or even learn directly from raw waveforms. This raises the question if (complex) hand-crafted features will still be needed in the future. We take this year's INTERSPEECH Computational Paralinguistic Challenge as an opportunity to approach this issue by means of two corpora - Atypical Affect and Crying. At first, we train a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to evaluate the performance of several hand-crafted feature sets of varying complexity. Afterwards, we make the network do the feature engineering all on its own by prefixing a stack of convolutional layers. Our results show that there is no clear winner (yet).

Recently, Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN), which is combined by convolution neural network and recurrent neural network, is popular in this field and achieves state-of-art on related corpus. However, most of work on CRNN only utilizes simple spectral information, which is not capable to capture enough emotion characteristics for the SER task. In this work, we investigate two joint representation learning structures based on CRNN aiming at capturing richer emotional information from speech. Cooperating the handcrafted high-level statistic features with CRNN, a two-channel SER system (HSF-CRNN) is developed to jointly learn the emotion-related features with better discriminative property. Furthermore, considering that the time duration of speech segment significantly affects the accuracy of emotion recognition, another two-channel SER system is proposed where CRNN features extracted from different time scale of spectrogram segment are used for joint representation learning. The systems are evaluated over Atypical Affect Challenge of ComParE2018 and IEMOCAP corpus. Experimental results show that our proposed systems outperform the plain CRNN",

Six native speakers of BP participated in an ultrasound experiment and produced target phonemes in #CV, VCV and VC# environments with the vowels /i, e, a, o/. Tongue contours for the rhotics were compared using Smoothing Spline ANOVAs. /ɾ, ʁ/ were produced with a tongue body and dorsum gesture, while /ɾ/ also had an apical gesture.

BP rhotics can be described as the coordination of a tongue dorsum and a tongue body or tip gesture. ‘Archetypal' /R/ is posited to be /ɾ/. Allophony between /ɾ/ and [ɻ, ɹ, χ] is due to tongue tip lenition. Allophony between /ʁ/ and [h] is due to weakening of the tongue dorsum and body gestures.

    "abstract": "Although the TIMIT acoustic-phonetic dataset ([1], [2]) was created three decades ago, it remains in wide use, with more than 20000 Google Scholar references and more than 1000 since 2017. Despite TIMIT's antiquity and relatively small size, inspection of these references shows that it is still used in many research areas: speech recognition, speaker recognition, speech synthesis, speech coding, speech enhancement, voice activity detection, speech perception, overlap detection and source separation, diagnosis of speech and language disorders and linguistic phonetics, among others. Nevertheless, comparable datasets are not available even for other widely-studied languages, much less for under-documented languages and varieties. Therefore, we have developed a method for creating TIMIT-like datasets in new languages with modest effort and cost and we have applied this method in standard Thai, standard Mandarin Chinese, English from Chinese L2 learners, the Guanzhong dialect of Mandarin Chinese and the Ga language of West Africa. Other collections are planned or underway. The resulting datasets will be published through the LDC, along with instructions and open-source tools for replicating this method in other languages, covering the steps of sentence selection and assignment to speakers, speaker recruiting and recording, proof-listening and forced alignment",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Tashlhiyt Berber is a language in which every consonant can take up the nucleus position in a syllable. The present study investigates how gestural properties are modified when the consonants occur in different syllable positions (onset, nucleus, coda). Furthermore, the effect of higher structural components such as morphology on the respective gestural organization patterns are examined. Therefore, we collected articulographic data for different consonantal roots, such as /bdg/ and /gzm/ with varying affixes, entailing different syllabification patterns in Tashlhiyt. Consonantal properties in different syllable positions are investigated with respect to their intragestural properties and intergestural properties, i.e. bonding strength. Furthermore, gestural coherence with respect to prefixation were examined. Results reveal that consonantal gestures were not modified on the intragestural level in terms of duration, velocity, stiffness or displacement, when the morphological structure was kept constant. However, on the intergestural level syllable relation was encoded, revealing a tighter bonding for onset-nucleus relations than for heterosyllabic sequences. Furthermore, when changing the morphological marker, modifications of intragestural parameters occur, inducing temporal changes of consonantal gestures. We conclude that higher structural components should be taken into account when investigating syllable internal timing patterns",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Many languages of South Asia show a phonemic contrast between retroflexes and dentals across different manners of articulation. This contrast, however, tends to be less phonetically distinct and more variable in nasals. The goal of this paper is to examine the overall similarity of the retroflex-dental contrasts in Punjabi stops and nasals. Ultrasound tongue imaging recordings were obtained from 14 Punjabi speakers producing /ʈ,ɳ,t,n/ in the /ba_ab/ nonsense word context. Selected video frames were fed to a principal component analysis (PCA); the output was used for (1) training a linear discriminant model on one manner that discriminates place and (2) testing it on the other manner. The results showed 100% correct classification of the contrast (retroflex or dental) in stops and 92% correct classification in nasals in the training data. The classification was much poorer across different manners: on average 67% of stops and 57% of nasals were classified correctly based on training sets with nasals or stops, respectively. In both cases, retroflex responses were more common. These results suggest that the tongue configurations for Punjabi retroflex and dental consonants differ by manner of articulation. The contrast is also overall less robust in nasals than in stops, confirming previous reports",

    "abstract": "Resyllabification is a phonological process in continuous speech in which the coda of a syllable is converted into the onset of the following syllable, either in the same word or in the subsequent word. This paper presents an analysis of resyllabification across words in different Indian languages and its implications in Indian language text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis systems. The evidence for resyllabification is evaluated based on the acoustic analysis of a read speech corpus of the corresponding language. This study shows that the resyllabification obeys the maximum onset principle and introduces the notion of prominence resyllabification in Indian languages. This paper finds acoustic evidence for total resyllabification. The resyllabification rules obtained are applied to TTS systems. The correctness of the rules is evaluated quantitatively by comparing the acoustic log-likelihood scores of the speech utterances with the original and resyllabified texts and by performing a pair comparison (PC) listening test on the synthesized speech output. An improvement in the log-likelihood score with the resyllabified text is observed and the synthesized speech with the resyllabified text is preferred 3 times over those without resyllabification",

A listening test was carried out on a sentence of Irish with three accented, prominent syllables (P1, P2, P3). Using inverse filtering and resynthesis, a ‘flattened' version was generated, with only slight declination of f0 and other voice source parameters. The global waveshape parameter Rd was modulated to provide (i) source boosting (tenser phonation) on either P1 or P2 and/or (ii) source attenuation (laxer phonation) following (Post-attenuation) or preceding (Pre-attenuation) P1 or P2. Rd variation was achieved in two different ways to generate two series of stimuli. f0 was not varied in either series. Twenty-nine listeners rated the prominence level of all syllables in the utterance. Results show that the phrasal position (P1 vs. P2) makes a large difference to prominence judgements. P1 emerged as overall more prominent and more readily ‘enhanced' by the source modifications. Post-attenuation was particularly important for P1, with effects equal to or greater than local P-boosting. In the case of P2, Pre-attenuation was much more important than Post-attenuation",

This serves to elucidate their relationship to the H1-H2 estimate, widely used to make inferences on changes in Oq and voice quality. It has been suggested that H1 is mainly determined by Up and that the pulse shape has a relatively small impact. To investigate this, a series of glottal pulses were generated using the LF model, where Up was kept constant, while Oq and Rk were systematically varied. The resulting harmonic amplitudes of these pulses show that Up is not the sole determinant of H1. Rather, H1 is highly dependent on Oq and to a certain degree also on Rk. Although the effects of these parameters on the lowest harmonics is rather complex, we find that the H1-H2 measure is broadly correlated with Oq. However, there is also a strong effect of differences in glottal skew, particularly at high Oq values, which could invalidate inferences on Oq and voice quality from estimates of H1-H2",

In this paper, we examine the stability of the output of a semi-automatic system, based on the long-term formant distributions (LTFDs) of F1, F2 and F3, as the channel quality of the input recordings decreases. Cross-validated, calibrated GMM-UBM log likelihood-ratios (LLRs) were computed for 97 Standard Southern British English speakers under four conditions. In each condition the same speech material was used, but the technical properties of the recordings changed (high quality studio recording, landline telephone recording, high bit-rate GSM mobile telephone recording and low bit-rate GSM mobile telephone recording). Equal error rate (EER) and the log LR cost function (Cllr) were compared across conditions. System validity was found to decrease with poorer technical quality, with the largest differences in EER (21.66%) and Cllr (0.46) found between the studio and the low bit-rate GSM conditions. However, importantly, performance for individual speakers was affected differently by channel quality. Speakers that produced stronger evidence overall were found to be more variable.

Along with these, other aspects of a speaker's voice play an important role to convey the information to the listener such as mood, attitude and emotional state. The glottal pulse characteristics in different phonation types vary due to the tension of laryngeal muscles together with the respiratory effort. In the present study, we are deriving the features that can capture effects of excitation on the vocal tract system through a signal processing method, called as zero-time windowing (ZTW) method. The ZTW method gives the instantaneous spectrum which captures the changes in the speech production mechanism, providing higher spectral resolution. The cepstral coefficients derived from ZTW method are used for the classification of phonation types. Along with zero-time windowing cepstral coefficients (ZTWCCs), we use the excitation source features derived from zero frequency filtering (ZFF) method. The excitation features used are: strength of excitation, energy of excitation, loudness measure and ZFF signal energy. Classification experiments using ZTWCC and excitation features reveal a significant improvement in the detection of phonation type compared to the existing voice quality features and MFCC features",

Mizo is one of the few languages that has voiced and voiceless nasals in its phoneme inventory. This analysis is motivated by the interaction between breathiness and nasality reported in a number of speech perception studies using synthetic stimuli. However, there are no studies examining this interaction in vowels after voiced and voiceless nasals. Existing research has also documented the interaction between breathy phonation and vowel height. The current study is an acoustic analysis of breathiness in high and low vowels following voiced and voiceless nasals in Mizo. The acoustic parameter measures are: H1H2 ratio, spectral balance (SB), strength of excitation (SoE) and waveform peak factor (WPF). The values obtained for all the four acoustic measures suggest that vowels following voiceless nasals exhibit stronger acoustic characteristics associated with breathy phonation than vowels following voiced nasals. In addition, the degree of acoustic breathiness is affected by vowel height",

This paper reports on our efforts to manually code child utterances as being of type \"laugh\", \"cry\", \"fuss\", \"babble\" and \"hiccup\" and to develop algorithms capable of performing the same task automatically. Human labelers achieve much higher rates of inter-coder agreement for some of these categories than for others. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) achieves better accuracy on tokens that have been coded by two human labelers than on tokens that have been coded by only one labeler, but the difference is not as much as we expected, suggesting that the acoustic and contextual features being used by human labelers are not yet available to the LDA. Convolutional neural network and hidden markov model achieve better accuracy than LDA, but worse F-score, because they over-weight the prior.

This CNN consists of several parallel convolutions with different kernel sizes to exploit contextual information at different levels. A temporal pooling layer aggregates the hidden representations of different words into a unique sequence level embedding, from which we compute the emotion posteriors. We optimized a weighted sum of classification and verification losses. The verification loss tries to bring embeddings from same emotions closer while it separates embeddings for different emotions.

    "abstract": "The perceptual evaluation of emotional attributes is noisy due to inconsistencies between annotators. The low inter-evaluator agreement arises due to the complex nature of emotions. Conventional approaches average scores provided by multiple annotators. While this approach reduces the influence of dissident annotations, previous studies have showed the value of considering individual evaluations to better capture the underlying ground-truth. One of these approaches is the qualitative agreement (QA) method, which provides an alternative framework that captures the inherent trends amongst the annotators. While previous studies have focused on using the QA method for time-continuous annotations from a fixed number of annotators, most emotional databases are annotated with attributes at the sentence-level (e.g., one global score per sentence). This study proposes a novel formulation based on the QA framework to estimate reliable sentence-level annotations for preference-learning. The proposed relative labels between pairs of sentences capture consistent trends across evaluators. The experimental evaluation shows that preference-learning methods to rank-order emotional attributes trained with the proposed QA-based labels achieve significantly better performance than the same algorithms trained with relative scores obtained by averaging absolute scores across annotators. These results show the benefits of QA-based labels for preference-learning using sentence-level annotations",

Subsequently, we apply transfer learning to predict gender using feature embeddings obtained from a model pre-trained for large-scale audio classification. In order to account for the diverse acoustic conditions in movie audio, we use audio clips from YouTube labeled for gender. We compare the performance of our proposed method with baseline experiments that were setup to assess the importance of feature embeddings and training data used for gender identification task.

We propose a convolutional neural networks (CNN) based gender classifier that consists of: (1) convolution layers, which can be interpreted as a feature learning stage and (2) a multilayer perceptron (MLP), which can be interpreted as a classification stage. The system takes raw speech signal as input and outputs gender posterior probabilities. Experimental studies conducted on two datasets, namely AVspoof and ASVspoof 2015, with different architectures show that with simple architectures the proposed approach yields better system than standard acoustic features based approach. Further analysis of the CNNs show that the CNNs learn formant and fundamental frequency information for gender identification",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a raw-waveform neural network and uses it along with a denoising network for clustering in weakly-supervised learning scenarios under extreme noise conditions. Specifically, we consider language independent gender identification on a set of varied noise conditions and signal to noise ratios (SNRs). We formulate the denoising problem as a source separation task and train the system using a discriminative criterion in order to enhance output SNRs. A denoising recurrent neural network (RNN) is first trained on a small subset (roughly one-fifth) of the data for learning a speech-specific mask. The denoised speech signal is then directly fed as input to a raw-waveform convolutional neural network (CNN) trained with denoised speech. We evaluate the standalone performance of denoiser in terms of various signal-to-noise measures and discuss its contribution towards robust gender identification. An absolute improvement of 11.06% and 13.33% is achieved by the combined pipeline over the i-vector SVM baseline system for 0 dB and -5 dB SNR conditions, respectively. We further analyse the information captured by the first CNN layer in both noisy and denoised speech",

To better explore time dependencies, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with long short-term memory (LSTM) are adopted for both generator and discriminator in this study. We evaluated SSGAN-PIT on the WSJ0 two-talker mixed speech separation task and found that SSGAN-PIT outperforms SSGAN without PIT and the neural networks based speech separation with or without PIT.

However, it remains challenging to achieve satisfying performance provided a very short available target speaker utterance (anchor).

The proposed model is different from prior works that the carnonical embedding space encodes knowledges of both the anchor and the mixture during training phase: first, embeddings for the anchor and mixture speech are separately constructed in a primary embedding space and then combined as an input to feed-forward layers to transform to a carnonical embedding space which we discover more stable than the primary one. Experimental results show that given a very short utterance, the proposed model can efficiently recover high quality target speech from a mixture, which outperforms various baseline models, with 5.2% and 6.6% relative improvements in SDR and PESQ respectively compared with a baseline oracle deep attracor model.

Despite decades of research on this topic, F0 estimation at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) in unexpected noise conditions remains difficult. This work proposes a new approach to noise robust F0 estimation using a recurrent neural network (RNN) trained in a supervised manner. Recent studies employ deep neural networks (DNNs) for F0 tracking as a frame-by-frame classification task into quantised frequency states but we propose waveform-to-sinusoid regression instead to achieve both noise robustness and accurate estimation with increased frequency resolution. Experimental results with PTDB-TUG corpus contaminated by additive noise (NOISEX-92) demonstrate that the proposed method improves gross pitch error (GPE) rate and fine pitch error (FPE) by more than 35% at SNRs between -10 dB and +10 dB compared with well-known noise robust F0 tracker, PEFAC.

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art methods for monaural singing voice separation consist in estimating the magnitude spectrum of the voice in the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) domain by means of deep neural networks (DNNs). The resulting magnitude estimate is then combined with the mixture's phase to retrieve the complex-valued STFT of the voice, which is further synthesized into a time-domain signal. However, when the sources overlap in time and frequency, the STFT phase of the voice differs from the mixture's phase, which results in interference and artifacts in the estimated signals. In this paper, we investigate on recent phase recovery algorithms that tackle this issue and can further enhance the separation quality. These algorithms exploit phase constraints that originate from a sinusoidal model or from consistency, a property that is a direct consequence of the STFT redundancy. Experiments conducted on real music songs show that those algorithms are efficient for reducing interference in the estimated voice compared to the baseline approach",

Self-similarity matrix (SSM) of a feature sequence is a square matrix, which encodes the acoustic-phonetic composition of the underlying speech signal. Deviations in the acoustic characteristics of underlying sound units due to the degradation of intelligibility will deviate the CLP speech's SSM structure from that of normal. This degree of deviations in CLP speech's SSM from the corresponding normal speech's SSM may provide information about the severity profile of speech intelligibility. The degree of deviations is quantified using the structural similarity (SSIM) index, which is considered as the representative of objective intelligibility score. The proposed method is evaluated using two parameterizations of speech signals: Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients and Gaussian posteriorgrams and compared with dynamic time warping (DTW) based intelligibility assessment method.

    "abstract": "Hypernasality in cleft palate (CP) children is due to the velopharyngeal insufficiency. The vowels get nasalized in hypernasal speech and the nasality evidence are mainly present in low-frequency region around the first formant (F1) of vowels. The detection of hypernasality using Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) feature may get affected because the feature might not be able to capture the nasality evidence present in the low-frequency region. This is due to the fact that the MFCC feature extracted from high pitched children speech contains the pitch harmonics effect of magnitude spectrum. The pitch harmonics effect results in high variance for the higher dimensions of MFCC coefficients. This problem may increase due to high perturbation in pitch of CP speech. So in this work, a pitch-adaptive MFCC feature is used for hypernasality detection. The feature is derived from the cepstral smooth spectrum instead of magnitude spectrum. A pitch-adaptive low time liftering is done to smooth out the pitch harmonics. This feature when used for the detection of hypernasality using support vector machine (SVM) gives an accuracy of 83.45%, 88.04% and 85.58% for /a/, /i/ and /u/ vowels respectively, which is better than the accuracy of MFCC feature",

While we empirically find that such a combination gives slight improvements in perplexity over the combination of forward and backward models, we finally show that a combination of the same number of forward models gives the best perplexity and word error rate (WER) overall",

These models, called neural error corrective language models (NECLMs), utilizes ASR hypotheses of a target utterance as a context for estimating the generative probability of words. NECLMs are expressed as conditional generative models composed of an encoder network and a decoder network. In the models, the encoder network constructs context vectors from N-best lists and ASR confidence scores generated in a speech recognizer. The decoder network rescores recognition hypotheses by computing a generative probability of words using the context vectors so as to correct ASR errors. We evaluate the proposed models in Japanese lecture ASR tasks. Experimental results show that NECLM achieve better ASR performance than a state-of-the-art ASR system that incorporate a convolutional neural network acoustic model and a long short-term memory recurrent neural network language model",

We propose a method based on the contrastive estimation method that alleviates the need for such data. Experiments in the music domain demonstrate that global features, as well as features extracted from an external knowledge-base, can be incorporated into our reranker.

German and Cantonese-speaking participants freely labeled such utterances in the two languages and assigned to each stimulus a verbal label. Based on the results of the four experiments we were able to establish to what degree the attitudinal frames of reference of the two groups overlap and how they differ. Verbal labels were assessed regarding their emotional content in terms of valence, activation and dominance and for the linguistic opposition between assertive and interrogative speech act and hence permit to abstract from the language of the rater and ultimately even abstract from the attitudinal categories used when eliciting the stimuli. Instead we regard each utterance as a data-point in the emotional space. We found that the judgments of the two rater groups agree well with respect to the valence of attitudinal expressions and diverge most as to the perceived activation of the stimulus presenter. Cantonese speaking participants seem to mirror Germans' ratings of German stimuli better than vice versa, which suggests an interesting asymmetry of attitudinal perception. As for the modality of presentation, the audio channel primarily transmits linguistically relevant information regarding the opposition of assertion and interrogation while the visual information signals the emotional content",

    "abstract": "Video blogging is a form of unidirectional communication where a video blogger expresses his/her opinion about different issues. The success of a video blog is measured using metrics like the number of views and comments by online viewers. Researchers have highlighted the importance of non-verbal behaviours (e.g. attitudes) in the context of video blogging and showed that it correlates with the level of attention (number of views) gained by a video blog. Therefore, an automatic attitude recognition system can help potential video bloggers to train their attitudes. It can also be useful in developing video blogs summarization and search tools. This study proposes a novel Active Feature Transformation (AFT) method for automatic recognition of attitudes (a form of non-verbal behaviour) in video blogs. The proposed method transforms the Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) features for the classification task. The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) transformation is also used for comparison.

This is due to difficulty in deriving the excitation source features using inverse filtering from singing voice. We propose to use the excitation source features that are derived directly from the signal. It is known that, the characteristics of the excitation source vary in different phonation types due to the vibration of the vocal folds together with the respiratory effort (lungs effort).

Initially Convolutional Deep Belief Network (CDBN) are used to pre-train the weights of CNN system. This acts as a generative model to explore the structure of the input data using statistical methods. Then a CNN is trained using supervised back-propagation learning algorithm to fine tune the weights. Results show that a small amount of data can be used to achieve good results in classification with this deep learning approach.

Dysarthria is a voice disorder where individuals are unable to control one or more of the aspects of speech—the articulation, breathing, voicing, or prosody—leading to less intelligible speech. In this paper, we evaluate the accuracy of state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition systems (ASRs) on two dysarthric speech datasets and compare the results to ASR performance on control speech. The limits of ASR performance using different voices have not been explored since the field has shifted from generative models of speech recognition to deep neural network architectures. To test how far the field has come in recognizing disordered speech, we test two different ASR systems: (1) Carnegie Mellon University's Sphinx Open Source Recognition and (2) Google®Speech Recognition. While (1) uses generative models of speech recognition, (2) uses deep neural networks. As expected, while (2) achieved lower word error rates (WER) on dysarthric speech than (1), control speech had a WER 59% lower than dysarthric speech. Future studies should be focused not only on making ASRs robust to environmental noise, but also more robust to different voices",

    "abstract": "The acoustic quality of exemplar-based voice conversion (VC) degrades whenever the phoneme labels of the selected exemplars do not match the phonetic content of the frame being represented. To address this issue, we propose a Phoneme-Selective Objective Function (PSOF) that promotes a sparse representation of each speech frame with exemplars from a few phoneme classes. Namely, PSOF enforces group sparsity on the representation, where each group corresponds to a phoneme class. The sparse representation for exemplars within a phoneme class tends to activate or suppress simultaneously using the proposed objective function. We conducted two sets of experiments on the ARCTIC corpus to evaluate the proposed method. First, we evaluated the ability of PSOF to reduce phoneme mismatches. Then, we assessed its performance on a VC task and compared it against three baseline methods from previous studies. Results from objective measurements and subjective listening tests show that the proposed method effectively reduces phoneme mismatches and significantly improves VC acoustic quality while retaining the voice identity of the target speaker",

    "abstract": "Incorporating phonetic information has been shown to improve the performance of exemplar-based voice conversion. A standard approach is to build a phonetically structured dictionary, where exemplars are categorized into sub-dictionaries according to their phoneme labels. However, acquiring phoneme labels can be expensive and the phoneme labels can have inaccuracies. The latter problem becomes more salient when the speakers are non-native speakers. This paper presents an iterative dictionary-learning algorithm that avoids the need for phoneme labels and instead learns the structured dictionaries in an unsupervised fashion. At each iteration, two steps are alternatively performed: cluster update and dictionary update. In the cluster update step, each training frame is assigned to a cluster whose sub-dictionary represents it with the lowest residual. In the dictionary update step, the sub-dictionary for a cluster is updated using all the speech frames in the cluster. We evaluate the proposed algorithm through objective and subjective experiments on a new corpus of non-native English speech. Compared to previous studies, the proposed algorithm improves the acoustic quality of voice-converted speech while retaining the target speaker's identity",

When performing spectral conversion (SC) under this framework, the low-dimensional spectral features, such as mel-ceptral coefficients (MCCs), are often adopted to represent the high-dimensional spectral envelopes. The joint density Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-based SC method with the STRAIGHT vocoder is a well-known representative. Although it is reasonably effective, the loss of spectral details in the converted spectral envelopes inevitably deteriorates speech quality and similarity. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel exemplar-based spectral detail compensation method for VC. In the offline stage, the paired dictionaries of source spectral envelopes and target spectral details are constructed. In the online stage, the locally linear embedding (LLE) algorithm is applied to predict the target spectral details from the source spectral envelopes and then, the predicted spectral details are used to compensate the converted spectral envelopes obtained by a baseline GMM-based SC method with the STRAIGHT vocoder. Experimental results show that the proposed method can notably improve the baseline system in terms of objective and subjective tests",

We use a BLSTM to map the spectral features of whispered speech to those of neutral speech. Three other BLSTMs are employed to predict the pitch, periodicity levels and the voiced/unvoiced phoneme decisions from the spectral features of whispered speech. We use objective measures to quantify the quality of the predicted spectral features and excitation parameters, using data recorded from six subjects, in a four fold setup. We find that the temporal smoothness of the spectral features predicted using the proposed BLSTM based system is statistically more compared to that predicted using deep neural network based baseline schemes. We also observe that while the performance of the proposed system is comparable to the baseline scheme for pitch prediction, it is superior in terms of classifying voicing decisions and predicting periodicity levels. From subjective evaluation via listening test, we find that the proposed method is chosen as the best performing scheme 26.61% (absolute) more often than the best baseline scheme.

Two systems are studied: (1) the i-vector-based VC (IVC) system and (2) the speaker-encoder-based VC (SEVC) system. Phonetic PosteriorGrams are adopted as speaker-independent linguistic features extracted from speech samples. Both systems train a multi-speaker deep bidirectional long-short term memory (DBLSTM) VC model, taking in additional inputs that encode speaker identities, in order to generate the outputs. In the IVC system, the speaker identity of a new target speaker is represented by i-vectors. In the SEVC system, the speaker identity is represented by speaker embedding predicted from a separately trained model. Experiments verify the effectiveness of both systems in achieving VC based only on a single target-speaker utterance. Furthermore, the IVC approach is superior to SEVC, in terms of the quality of the converted speech and its similarity to the utterance produced by the genuine target speaker",

    "abstract": "Recently, cycle-consistent adversarial network (Cycle-GAN) has been successfully applied to voice conversion to a different speaker without parallel data, although in those approaches an individual model is needed for each target speaker. In this paper, we propose an adversarial learning framework for voice conversion, with which a single model can be trained to convert the voice to many different speakers, all without parallel data, by separating the speaker characteristics from the linguistic content in speech signals. An autoencoder is first trained to extract speaker-independent latent representations and speaker embedding separately using another auxiliary speaker classifier to regularize the latent representation. The decoder then takes the speaker-independent latent representation and the target speaker embedding as the input to generate the voice of the target speaker with the linguistic content of the source utterance. The quality of decoder output is further improved by patching with the residual signal produced by another pair of generator and discriminator. A target speaker set size of 20 was tested in the preliminary experiments and very good voice quality was obtained. Conventional voice conversion metrics are reported. We also show that the speaker information has been properly reduced from the latent representations",

    "abstract": "Acoustic emotion recognition is a popular and central research direction in paralinguistic analysis, due its relation to a wide range of affective states/traits and manifold applications. Developing highly generalizable models still remains as a challenge for researchers and engineers, because of multitude of nuisance factors. To assert generalization, deployed models need to handle spontaneous speech recorded under different acoustic conditions compared to the training set. This requires that the models are tested for cross-corpus robustness. In this work, we first investigate the suitability of Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) models trained with time- and space-continuously annotated affective primitives for cross-corpus acoustic emotion recognition. We next employ an effective approach to use the frame level valence and arousal predictions of LSTM models for utterance level affect classification and apply this approach on the ComParE 2018 challenge corpora. The proposed method alone gives motivating results both on development and test set of the Self-Assessed Affect Sub-Challenge. On the development set, the cross-corpus prediction based method gives a boost to performance when fused with top components of the baseline system.

We have investigated cues related to the perception of the emotional valence according to three main relevant linguistic levels: phonetics, lexical and prosodic. For this purpose we studied: the degree-of-articulation, the voice quality, an affect lexicon and the expressive prosodic contours. For the phonetics level, a set of gender-dependent audio-features was computed on vowel analysis (voice quality and speech articulation measurements). At the lexical level, an affect lexicon was extracted from the automatic transcription of the USoMS database. This lexicon has been assessed for the Challenge task comparatively to a reference polarity lexicon. In order to detect expressive prosody, N-gram models of the prosodic contours were computed from an intonation labeling system. At last, an emotional valence classifier was designed combining ComParE and eGeMAPS feature sets with other phonetic, prosodic and lexical features.

For this, we apply pitch stylization on each syllable segment in the audio. Further, we compute a quality score using the learner`s patterns and the respective ground-truth patterns. Finally, the score, the patterns of the learners and the ground-truth are sent to the front-end for display as a feedback to the learners.

End-to-end trainable dialogue systems recently attracted a lot of attention because they offer several advantages over traditional systems. One of them is the avoidance to train each system module independently, by creating a single network architecture which maps an input to the corresponding output without the need for intermediate representations. While the end-to-end system investigated here had been tested in a text-in/out scenario it remained an open question how the system would perform in a speech-in/out scenario, with noisy input from a speech recognizer and output speech generated by a speech synthesizer. To evaluate this, both dialogue systems were trained on the same corpus, including human-human dialogues in the Cambridge restaurant domain, and then compared in both scenarios by human evaluation. The results show, that in both interfaces the end-to-end system receives significantly higher ratings on all metrics than the traditional modular system, an indication that it enables users to reach their goals faster and experience both a more natural system response and a better comprehension by the dialogue system",

    "abstract": "Acoustic-prosodic entrainment describes the tendency of humans to align or adapt their speech acoustics to each other in conversation. This alignment of spoken behavior has important implications for conversational success. However, modeling the subtle nature of entrainment in spoken dialogue continues to pose a challenge. In this paper, we propose a straightforward definition for local entrainment in the speech domain and operationalize an algorithm based on this: acoustic-prosodic features that capture entrainment should be maximally different between real conversations involving two partners and sham conversations generated by randomly mixing the speaking turns from the original two conversational partners. We propose an approach for measuring local entrainment that quantifies alignment of behavior on a turn-by-turn basis, projecting the differences between interlocutors' acoustic-prosodic features for a given turn onto a discriminative feature subspace that maximizes the difference between real and sham conversations. We evaluate the method using the derived features to drive a classifier aiming to predict an objective measure of conversational success (i.e., low versus high), on a corpus of task-oriented conversations. The proposed entrainment approach achieves 72% classification accuracy using a Naive Bayes classifier, outperforming three previously established approaches evaluated on the same conversational corpus",

    "abstract": "For spoken dialog systems to conduct fluid conversational interactions with users, the systems must be sensitive to turn-taking cues produced by a user. Models should be designed so that effective decisions can be made as to when it is appropriate, or not, for the system to speak. Traditional end-of-turn models, where decisions are made at utterance end-points, are limited in their ability to model fast turn-switches and overlap. A more flexible approach is to model turn-taking in a continuous manner using RNNs, where the system predicts speech probability scores for discrete frames within a future window.

In this paper, we investigate optimal speech-related feature sets for making predictions at pauses and overlaps in conversation.

The user is required to train the system, so for a user friendly experience it is crucial to minimize the required amount of data.

This understanding (Spoken Language understanding - SLU) of the human language is operationalized through identifying intents and entities. While classification methods that rely on labeled data are often used for SLU, creating large supervised data sets is extremely tedious and time consuming. This paper presents a practical approach to automate the process of intent discovery on unlabeled data sets of human language text through clustering techniques. We explore a range of representations for the texts and various clustering methods to validate the clustering stability through quantitative metrics like Adjusted Random Index (ARI). A final alignment of the clusters to the semantic intent is determined through consensus labelling. Our experiments on public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach generating homogeneous clusters with 89% cluster accuracy, leading to better semantic intent alignments. Furthermore, we illustrate that the clustering offer an alternate and effective way to mine sentence variants that can aid the bootstrapping of SLU models",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "This paper addresses engagement recognition based on four multimodal listener behaviors - backchannels, laughing, eye-gaze and head nodding. Engagement is an indicator of how much a user is interested in the current dialogue. Multiple third-party annotators give ground truth labels of engagement in a human-robot interaction corpus. Since perception of engagement is subjective, the annotations are sometimes different between individual annotators. Conventional methods directly use integrated labels, such as those generated through simple majority voting and do not consider each annotator's recognition. We propose a two-step engagement recognition where each annotator's recognition is modeled and the different annotators' models are aggregated to recognize the integrated label. The proposed neural network consists of two parts. The first part corresponds to each annotator's model which is trained with the corresponding labels independently. The second part aggregates the different annotators' models to obtain one integrated label. After each part is pre-trained, the whole network is fine-tuned through back-propagation of prediction errors. Experimental results show that the proposed network outperforms baseline models which directly recognize the integrated label without considering differing annotations",

The current work investigates the timing of turn-taking in question-response sequences in naturalistic conversations in Ruuli, an under-studied Bantu language spoken in Uganda. We extracted sequences involving wh-questions and polar questions and measured the duration of the gap or overlap between questions and their following responses, additionally differentiating between different response types such as affirmative (i.e. type-conforming) or negative (i.e. non-type-conforming) responses to polar questions. We find that the timing of responses to various question types in Ruuli is consistent with timings that have been reported for a variety of other languages, with a mean gap duration between questions and responses of around 259 ms. Our findings thus emphasize the universal nature of turn-taking behavior in human interaction, despite Ruuli's substantial structural differences from languages in which turn-taking has been previously studied",

Under the severe threat of various speech spoofing techniques, ASV systems can easily be 'fooled' by spoofed speech which sounds as real as human-beings. As two effective solutions, the Constant Q Cepstral Coefficients (CQCC) and the Scattering Cepstral Coefficients (SCC) perform well on the detection of artificial speech signals, especially for attacks from speech synthesis (SS) and voice conversion (VC). However, for spoofing subsets generated by different approaches, a low Equal Error Rate (EER) cannot be maintained. In this paper, an adaptive weighting based standalone detector is proposed to address the selective detection degradation. The clustering property of the genuine and the spoofed subsets are analysed for the selection of suitable weighting factors. With a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) classifier as the back-end, the proposed detector is evaluated on the ASVspoof 2015 database. The EERs of 0.01% and 0.20% are obtained on the known and the unknown attacks, respectively.

Various features of speech signals have been used to fight counterfeit attacks. Among the different spoofing attack variants, replay attacks pose a significant threat as they do not require any expert knowledge and are difficult to detect. This paper proposes the use of a spectral centroid based frequency modulation (FM) features that we term spectral centroid deviation (SCD) for replay attack detection. Spectral centroid frequency (SCF) and spectral centroid magnitude coefficient (SCMC) features extracted from the same front-end as SCD are also investigated as complementary features. Evaluations on the ASVspoof 2017 dataset indicate that the proposed SCD features with a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) back-end is highly capable of discriminating genuine from replay spoofed speech, providing an equal error rate improvement greater than 60% relative to the CQCC baseline system from the ASVspoof 2017 challenge. Interestingly, experiments also reveal that the proposed SCD features exhibit an increased variance for replay spoofed speech relative to genuine speech, particularly for the lowest and highest frequency subbands",

In addition, linearly-spaced Gabor filterbank gave lower EER than Butterworth filterbank. To explore possible complementary information using amplitude and frequency, we have used score-level fusion of IA and IF.

The key idea of this paper is to capture the Instantaneous Amplitude (IA) obtained from the instantaneous energy fluctuations. The replay speech is affected by acoustic environment and distortions of intermediate device. Thus, the noise added in replayed speech is important to detect. The Amplitude Modulations (AM) are more susceptible to noise and multipath interferences that may result due to replay mechanism.

This paper introduces a statistics-plus-principal information feature where a short-term spectral statistics information (STSSI), octave-band principal information (OPI) and full-band principal information (FPI) are proposed on the basis of CQT. Firstly, in contrast to conventional utterance-level long-term statistic information, STSSI reveals the spectral statistics at frame-level, moreover it provides a feasibility condition for model training while only small training database is available. Secondly, OPI emphasizes the principal information for octave-bands, STSSI and OPI creates a strong complementarity to enhance the anti-spoofing feature. Thirdly, FPI is also of complementary effect with OPI. With the statistical property over CQT spectral domain and the principal information through discrete cosine transform (DCT), the proposed statistics-plus-principal feature shows reasonable advantage of the complementary trait for spoofing detection.

However, the performance of anti-spoofing systems degrades significantly in noisy conditions. To address this issue, we propose a deep learning framework to extract spoofing identity vectors, as well as the use of soft missing-data masks. The proposed feature extraction employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) plus a recurrent neural network (RNN) in order to provide a single deep feature vector per utterance. Thus, the CNN is treated as a convolutional feature extractor that operates at the frame level. On top of the CNN outputs, the RNN is employed to obtain a single spoofing identity representation of the whole utterance. Experimental evaluation is carried out on both a clean and a noisy version of the ASVSpoof2015 corpus.

    "abstract": "The development of automatic systems that can detect replayed speech has emerged as a significant research challenge for securing voice biometric systems and is the focus of this paper. Specifically, this paper proposes two novel features to capture the static and dynamic characteristics of the signal from the modulation spectrum, which complement short term spectral features for use in replay detection. The modulation spectral centroid frequency feature is proposed as a vector representation of the first order spectral moments of the modulation spectrum. In conjunction to this, the long term spectral average serves to capture the static characteristics of the modulation spectrum. The proposed system, employing a GMM back-end, was evaluated on the ASVSpoof 2017 dataset and found to yield an EER of 6.54%",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Most frequency domain techniques for pitch extraction such as cepstrum, harmonic product spectrum (HPS) and summation residual harmonics (SRH) operate on the magnitude spectrum and turn it into a function in which the fundamental frequency emerges as argmax. In this paper, we investigate the extension of these three techniques to the phase and group delay (GD) domains. Our extensions exploit the observation that the bin at which F (magnitude) becomes maximum, for some monotonically increasing function F, is equivalent to bin at which F (phase) has maximum negative slope and F (group delay) has the maximum value. To extract the pitch track from speech phase spectrum, these techniques were coupled with the source-filter model in the phase domain that we proposed in earlier publications and a novel voicing detection algorithm proposed here. The accuracy and robustness of the phase-based pitch extraction techniques are illustrated and compared with their magnitude-based counterparts using six pitch evaluation metrics. On average, it is observed that the phase spectrum can be successfully employed in pitch tracking with comparable accuracy and robustness to the speech magnitude spectrum",

    "title": "Time-regularized Linear Prediction for Noise-robust Extraction of the Spectral Envelope of Speech",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Feature extraction of speech signals is typically performed in short-time frames by assuming that the signal is stationary within each frame. For the extraction of the spectral envelope of speech, which conveys the formant frequencies produced by the resonances of the slowly varying vocal tract, an often used frame length is within 20-30 ms. However, this kind of conventional frame-based spectral analysis is oblivious of the broader temporal context of the signal and is prone to degradation by, for example, environmental noise. In this paper, we propose a new frame-based linear prediction (LP) analysis method that includes a regularization term that penalizes energy differences in consecutive frames of an all-pole spectral envelope model. This integrates the slowly varying nature of the vocal tract as a part of the analysis. Objective evaluations related to feature distortion and phonetic representational capability were performed by studying the properties of the mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) representations computed from different spectral estimation methods under noisy conditions using the TIMIT database. The results show that the proposed time-regularized LP approach exhibits superior MFCC distortion behavior while simultaneously having the greatest average separability of different phoneme categories in comparison to the other methods",

In this paper, we propose to use unsupervised auditory filterbank learning using Convolutional Restricted Boltzmann Machine (ConvRBM). Analysis of the subband filters shows that most of the subband filters are Fourier-like basis functions. The infant cry classification experiments were performed on the two databases, namely, DA-IICT Cry and Baby Chillanto. The experimental results show that the proposed features perform better than the standard Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) using various statistically meaningful performance measures.

    "abstract": "Non-parallel Voice Conversion (VC) has gained significant attention since last one decade. Obtaining corresponding speech frames from both the source and target speakers before learning the mapping function in the non-parallel VC is a key step in the standalone VC task. Obtaining such corresponding pairs, is more challenging due to the fact that both the speakers may have uttered different utterances from same or the different languages. Iterative combination of a Nearest Neighbor search step and a Conversion step Alignment (INCA) and its variant Temporal Context (TC)-INCA are popular unsupervised alignment algorithms. The INCA and TC-INCA iteratively learn the mapping function after getting the Nearest Neighbor (NN) aligned pairs from the intermediate converted and the target spectral features. In this paper, we propose to use dynamic features along with static features to calculate the NN aligned pairs in both the INCA and TC-INCA algorithms (since the dynamic features are known to play a key role to differentiate major phonetic categories). We obtained on an average relative improvement of 13.75% and 5.39% with our proposed Dynamic INCA and Dynamic TC-INCA, respectively.

We propose a two-step method. In the first step, we jointly calculate the syllable and phoneme onset detection functions (ODFs) using a convolutional neural network (CNN). In the second step, the syllable and phoneme boundaries and labels are inferred hierarchically by using a duration-informed hidden Markov model (HMM). To achieve the inference, we incorporate the a priori duration model as the transition probabilities and the ODFs as the emission probabilities into the HMM. The proposed method is designed in a language-independent way such that no phoneme class labels are used. For the model training and algorithm evaluation, we collect a new jingju (also known as Beijing or Peking opera) solo singing voice dataset and manually annotate the boundaries and labels at phrase, syllable and phoneme levels. The dataset is publicly available. The proposed method is compared with a baseline method based on hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM) forced alignment.

    "abstract": "The advances in Automatic Speaker Verification (ASV) system for voice biometric purpose comes with the danger of spoofing attacks. The replay attack is the most accessible attack, where the attacker imitates speaker's identity by replaying the pre-recorded speech samples of the target speaker. Most of the conventional features, such as Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), Instantaneous Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (IFCC), etc. uses filterbank structure for feature extraction purpose. In this paper, we propose a novel Empirical Mode Decomposition Cepstral Coefficient (EMDCC) feature set, where the filterbank in MFCC is replaced with the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) to obtain the subband signals. The proposed feature set takes an advantage of using EMD that acts as a dyadic filterbank and handles the nonlinear and non-stationary nature of the speech signal. The stand-alone EMDCC feature set gives the Equal Error Rate (EER) of 28.06% compared to the baseline CQCC and MFCC system with EER of 29.18% and 31.3%, respectively on the evaluation set of ASV Spoof 2017 Challenge database.

Earlier researchers mainly used vocal tract-based (segmental) information for replay detection. However, during replay, excitation source-based information also gets affected (in particular, degradation in pitch source harmonics at higher frequency regions) due to recording environment and replay devices. Hence, in addition to the vocal tract-based system information, we have also explored the excitation source-based informations for SSD. In particular, we have used Linear Frequency Residual Cepstral Coefficients (LFRCC) for replay detection. The objective of this paper is to explore possible complementary excitation (glottal) source information present in the Linear Prediction residual-based features. Experiments performed on the ASV Spoof 2017 Challenge database with Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifiers.

    "abstract": "Traditional phone recognition systems are developed using read speech. But, in reality, the speech that needs to be processed by machine is not always in read mode. Therefore to handle the phone recognition in realistic scenarios, three broad modes of speech: read, conversation and extempore are considered in this study. The conversation mode includes informal communication in an unconstrained environment between two or more individuals. In the extempore mode, a person speaks with confidence without the help of notes. Read mode is a formal type of speech in a rigid environment. In this work, we have proposed a sparse based feature for speech mode classification. The effectiveness of sparse representation depends on the dictionary. Therefore, we have learned multiple overcomplete dictionaries by using parallel atom-update dictionary learning (PAU-DL) technique to capture the discrimination characteristics present in the considered speech modes. Further, sparse features correspond to the sequence of speech frames are derived using the learned dictionary by applying the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm. The proposed sparse features are evaluated on speech corpora consisting of six Indian languages by performing classification of speech modes. The results with the proposed sparse features outperform the standard spectral, excitation source and prosodic features",

Building on existing 2-D models to analyze a spectrogram patch, we propose a multicomponent 2-D AM-FM representation for spectrogram decomposition. The components of the proposed representation comprise a DC, a fundamental frequency carrier and its harmonics and a spectrotemporal envelope, all in 2-D. The number of harmonics required is patch-dependent. The estimation of the AM and FM is done using the Riesz transform and the component weights are estimated using a least-squares approach. The proposed representation provides an improvement over existing state-of-the-art approaches, for both male and female speakers. This is quantified using reconstruction SNR and perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) metric. Further, we perform an overlap-add on the DC component, pooling all the patches and obtain a time-frequency (t-f) aperiodicity map for the speech signal.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In general, reconstruction of a speech signal from the spectrogram is non-unique because of the unavailability of the phase spectrum. Considering zero phase would result in a minimum-phase reconstruction. This limitation is overcome by computing the recently introduced phase-encoded spectrogram. In this approach, one modifies each frame of a speech signal to possess the causal, delta-dominant (CDD) property prior to computing the spectrogram. In an earlier publication, we showed that finite-length CDD sequences can be retrieved exactly from their magnitude spectra using a cepstrum technique. Although exactness is guaranteed in principle, practical implementations result in a limited, but high, reconstruction accuracy. In this paper, we focus on increasing the reconstruction accuracy. We formulate the reconstruction problem within an optimization framework and deploy a recently proposed iterative, alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm called autocorrelation retrieval—Kolmogorov factorization (CoRK). Experimental validations show that the CoRK algorithm results in a reconstruction accurate up to machine precision. We also show that both CoRK and cepstrum techniques are robust and invariant to the choice of the window duration, the amount of overlap between consecutive speech frames, the strength of the delta used to impart the CDD property and the presence of noise",

    "abstract": "Speech, speaker and language systems have traditionally relied on carefully collected speech material for training acoustic models. There is an overwhelming abundance of publicly accessible audio material available for training. A major challenge, however, is that such found data is not professionally recorded and therefore may contain a wide diversity of background noise, nonlinear distortions, or other unknown environmental based contamination or mismatch. There is a critical need for automatic analysis to screen such unknown data sets before acoustic model development, or to perform input audio purity screening prior to classification. In this study, we propose a waveform based clipping detection algorithm for naturalistic audio streams and analyze the impact of clipping at different severities on speech quality measures and automatic speaker recognition systems. We use the TIMIT and NIST SRE-08 corpora as case studies. The results show, as expected, that clipping introduces a nonlinear distortion into clean speech data, which reduces both speech quality and speaker recognition performance. We also investigate what degree of clipping can be present to sustain effective speech system performance. The proposed detection system, which will be released, could contribute to massive new audio collections for speech and language technology development",

Contrarily to current trends on development of stand-alone spoof detection system, this work aims detection of replay attacks directly on the ASV system. The claim made through replay spoofing trials is rejected as impostors directly by ASV system. The objective here is to model the changes in the excitation signal characteristics caused by playback devices for replay detection. Accordingly, two linear prediction (LP) residual based source features are proposed for rejecting replay spoofing trials namely, RMFCC (residual mel-frequency cepstral coefficients) and LPRHEMFCC (LP residual Hilbert envelope MFCC). A comparative analysis between these two source features has been performed through speaker verification experiments to evaluate their effectiveness for ASV anti-spoofing applications. The comparison between the two has been made in the form of (source feature + MFCC) combination. The experiments are conducted using self-developed IITG-MV replay database. From the experimental results, it has been observed that 'LPRHEMFCC+MFCC' combination outperforms 'RMFCC+MFCC' combination, under replay attacks.

In the reconstructed speech signal, energy due to the high frequency unvoiced sound units and noises is suppressed. Consequently, over an analysis frame, the mean of the square magnitude (MSM) of the sample points is significantly higher for the vowels than other sound units. Further, the MSM at each time instant is non-linearly mapped (NLM) using a negative exponential functions to enhance the transitions at the onset and the offset points of vowels and suppress small fluctuations. The NLM-MSM is used as a front-end feature for discriminating vowels in a given speech signal.

For CTC-based models, it usually uses the LSTM-type networks as acoustic models. However, LSTMs are computationally expensive and sometimes difficult to train with CTC criterion. In this paper, inspired by the recent DFSMN works, we propose to replace the LSTMs with DFSMN in CTC-based acoustic modeling and explore how this type of non-recurrent models behave when trained with CTC loss. We have evaluated the performance of DFSMN-CTC using both context-independent (CI) and context-dependent (CD) phones as target labels in many LVCSR tasks with various amount of training data. Experimental results shown that DFSMN-CTC acoustic models using either CI-Phones or CD-Phones can significantly outperform the conventional hybrid models that trained with CD-Phones and cross-entropy (CE) criterion. Moreover, a novel joint CTC and CE training method is proposed, which enables to improve the stability of CTC training and performance. In a 20000 hours Mandarin recognition task, joint CTC-CE trained DFSMN can achieve a 11.0% and 30.1% relative performance improvement compared to DFSMN-CE models in a normal and fast speed test set respectively",

In this paper, we study end-to-end systems trained directly from the raw waveform, building on two alternatives for trainable replacements of mel-filterbanks that use a convolutional architecture. The first one is inspired by gammatone filterbanks (Hoshen et al., 2015; Sainath et al, 2015) and the second one by the scattering transform (Zeghidour et al., 2017). We propose two modifications to these architectures and systematically compare them to mel-filterbanks, on the Wall Street Journal dataset. The first modification is the addition of an instance normalization layer, which greatly improves on the gammatone-based trainable filterbanks and speeds up the training of the scattering-based filterbanks. The second one relates to the low-pass filter used in these approaches. These modifications consistently improve performances for both approaches and remove the need for a careful initialization in scattering-based trainable filterbanks. In particular, we show a consistent improvement in word error rate of the trainable filterbanks relatively to comparable mel-filterbanks.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Acoustic-to-word (A2W) prediction model based on Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) criterion has gained increasing interest in recent studies. Although previous studies have shown that A2W system could achieve competitive Word Error Rate (WER), there is still performance gap compared with the conventional speech recognition system when the amount of training data is not exceptionally large. In this study, we empirically investigate advanced model initializations and training strategies to achieve competitive speech recognition performance on 300 hour subset of the Switchboard task (SWB-300Hr). We first investigate the use of hierarchical CTC pretraining for improved model initialization. We also explore curriculum training strategy to gradually increase the target vocabulary size from 10k to 20k. Finally, joint CTC and Cross Entropy (CE) training techniques are studied to further improve the performance of A2W system. The combination of hierarchical-CTC model initialization, curriculum training and joint CTC-CE training translates to a relative of 12.1% reduction in WER. Our final A2W system evaluated on Hub5-2000 test sets achieves a WER of 11.4/20.8 for Switchboard and CallHome parts without using language model and decoder",

    "abstract": "Sequence-to-sequence attention-based models have recently shown very promising results on automatic speech recognition (ASR) tasks, which integrate an acoustic, pronunciation and language model into a single neural network. In these models, the Transformer, a new sequence-to-sequence attentionbased model relying entirely on self-attention without using RNNs or convolutions, achieves a new single-model state-of-the- art BLEU on neural machine translation (NMT) tasks. Since the outstanding performance of the Transformer, we extend it to speech and concentrate on it as the basic architecture of sequence-to-sequence attention-based model on Mandarin Chinese ASR tasks. Furthermore, we investigate a comparison between syllable based model and context-independent phoneme (CI-phoneme) based model with the Transformer in Mandarin Chinese. Additionally, a greedy cascading decoder with the Transformer is proposed for mapping CI-phoneme sequences and syllable sequences into word sequences. Experiments on HKUST datasets demonstrate that syllable based model with the Transformer performs better than CI-phoneme based counterpart, and achieves a character error rate (CER) of 28.77%, which is competitive to the state-of-the-art CER of 28.0% by the joint CTC-attention based encoder-decoder network",

In the multi-head attention model, multiple attentions are calculated and then, they are integrated into a single attention. On the other hand, instead of the integration in the attention level, our proposed method uses multiple decoders for each attention and integrates their outputs to generate a final output. Furthermore, in order to make each head to capture the different modalities, different attention functions are used for each head, leading to the improvement of the recognition performance with an ensemble effect. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conduct an experimental evaluation using Corpus of Spontaneous Japanese.

    "abstract": "Deep neural network (DNN) based DOA estimation (DNN-DOAest) methods report superior performance but the degradation is observed under stronger additive noise and room reverberation conditions. Motivated by our previous work with an acoustic vector sensor (AVS) and the great success of DNN based speech denoising and dereverberation (DNN-SDD), a unified DNN framework for robust DOA estimation task is thoroughly investigated in this paper. First, a novel DOA cue termed as sub-band inter-sensor data ratio (Sb-ISDR) is proposed to efficiently represent DOA information for training a DNN-DOAest model. Second, a speech-aware DNN-SDD is presented, where coherence vectors denoting the probability of time-frequency points dominated by speech signals are used as additional input to facilitate the training to predict complex ideal ratio masks. Last, by stacking the DNN-DOAest on the DNN-SDD with a joint part, the unified network is jointly fine-tuned, which enables DNN-SDD to serve as a pre-processing front-end to adaptively generate ‘clean' speech features that are easier to be correctly classified by the following DNN-DOAest for robust DOA estimation.

    "abstract": "Particle filter (PF) has been proved to be an effective tool to track sound sources. In traditional PF, a pre-defined dynamic model is used to model source motion, which tends to be mismatched due to the uncertainty of source motion. Besides, non-stationary interferences pose a severe challenge to source tracking. To this end, an observation-guided adaptive particle filter (OAPF) is proposed for multiple concurrent sound source tracking. Firstly, sensor signals are processed in the time-frequency domain to obtain the direction of arrival (DOA) observations of sources. Then, by updating particle states with these DOA observations, angular distances between particles and observations are reduced to guide particles to directions of sources. Thirdly, particle weights are updated by an interference-adaptive likelihood function to reduce the impacts of interferences. At last, with the updated particles and the corresponding weights, OAPF is utilized to determine the final DOAs of sources. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves favorable performance for multiple concurrent sound source tracking in noisy environments",

In this paper, we propose a decomposition method based on filtering/suppressing the impulsive interference of percussive source on the harmonic components and impulsive interference of the harmonic source on the percussive components by modified moving average filter in the Fourier frequency domain. The significant advantage of the proposed method is that it minimizes the artifacts in the separated signal spectrograms. In this work, we have proposed Affine and Gain masking methods to separate the harmonic and percussive components to achieve minimal spectral leakage.

These estimated speaker activities are subsequently used for the calibration of the beamforming algorithm. This framework is tested with three different speaker activity detection (SAD) methods, two of which use classical algorithms and one that is event-driven. Our methods, when tested in real world reverberant scenarios, can achieve very high signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) of around 20 dB and sound quality of 0.85 in short-time objective intelligibility (STOI) close to optimal beamforming results of 22 dB SIR and 0.89 in STOI",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) describe the propagation of sound waves from the sound source to ear drums, which contain most of information for localization. However, HRTFs are highly individual-dependent and thus because of the difference of anthropometric features between subjects, individualization of HRTFs is a great challenge for accurate localization perception in virtual auditory displays (VAD). In this paper, we propose a sparsity-constrained weight mapping method termed SWM to obtain individual HRTFs. The key idea behind SWM is to obtain optimal weights to combine HRTFs from the training subjects based on the relationship of anthropometric features between the target subject and the training subjects. To this end, SWM learns two sparse representations between the target subject and the training subjects in terms of anthropometric features and HRTFs, respectively. A non-negative sparse model is used for this purpose when considering the non-negative property of the anthropometric features. Then, we build a mapping between the two weight vectors using a nonlinear regression. Furthermore, an iterative data extension method is proposed in order to increase training samples for mapping model. The objective and subjective experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other methods in terms of log-spectral distortion (LSD) and localization accuracy",

    "abstract": "In order to separate individual sources from convoluted speech mixtures, complex-domain independent component analysis (ICA) is employed on the individual frequency bins of time frequency representations of the speech mixtures, obtained using short-time Fourier transform (STFT). The frequency components computed using STFT are separated by constant frequency difference with a constant frequency resolution. However, it is well known that the human auditory mechanism offers better resolution at lower frequencies. Hence, the perceptual quality of the extracted sources critically depends on the separation achieved in the lower frequency components. In this paper, we propose to perform source separation on the time-frequency representation computed though constant Q transform (CQT), which offers non uniform logarithmic binning in the frequency domain. Complex-domain ICA is performed on the individual bins of the CQT in order to get separated components in each frequency bin which are suitably scaled and permuted to obtain separated sources in the CQT domain. The estimated sources are obtained by applying inverse constant Q transform to the scaled and permuted sources. In comparison with the STFT based frequency domain ICA methods, there has been a consistent improvement of 3 dB or more in the Signal to Interference Ratios of the extracted sources",

Given a binaural test-speech, the source is localized using maximum likelihood (ML) criterion. In this work, we propose a subband weighting scheme where subband likelihoods are weighted based on their reliability. We measure the reliability of a subband using the average frame level localization error obtained for the respective subbands. These reliability values are used as the weights for each subband likelihood prior to combining the likelihoods for ML estimation.

Our presentation concerns only attitudinally and emotionally neutral utterances. The second part of the talk will present particular aspects: 1) the different centers of articulatory \"effort\" at the syllable level; 2) the suggestion of the existence of an unmarked strong-long pattern, neither trochaic nor iambic, at the word level in languages where natives don't have the consciousness of a \"lexical stress,\" or don't agree on its existence or position; 3) the regrouping of one or more words into a prosodic phrase by the application of two established principles: a) the \"hat-pattern\" principle (t'Hart) favoring initial high-rising and final low-falling F0, and b) the intensive or the temporal rhythmic basic tendencies (Woodrow, Fraisse) favoring a more intense, stronger, more precisely articulated beginning and a lengthened ending; 4) the existence of a multilayer rhythm at the utterance level composed by the repetition/alternation of integrated Gestalts at the levels of the syllable, word, and phrases. One or two Gestalts will prevail perceptually depending on a) the language, b) the style, and c) the rate of speech.

In this approach, the CorrNet training methodology treats normalized and un-normalized features as two parallel views of the same speech data. Once trained, this network generates frame-wise fMLLR-like features, thus overcoming the limitations of fMLLR/i-vectors. The recognition accuracy using the proposed CorrNet-generated features is comparable with the i-vector model counterparts and significantly better than the un-normalized features like filterbank. With CorrNet-features, we get an absolute improvement in word error rate of 2.5% for TIMIT, 2.69% for WSJ84 and 3.2% for Switchboard-33hour over un-normalized features",

    "title": "Machine Speech Chain with One-shot Speaker Adaptation",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In previous work, we developed a closed-loop speech chain model based on deep learning, in which the architecture enabled the automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech synthesis (TTS) components to mutually improve their performance. This was accomplished by the two parts teaching each other using both labeled and unlabeled data. This approach could significantly improve model performance within a single-speaker speech dataset, but only a slight increase could be gained in multi-speaker tasks. Furthermore, the model is still unable to handle unseen speakers. In this paper, we present a new speech chain mechanism by integrating a speaker recognition model inside the loop. We also propose extending the capability of TTS to handle unseen speakers by implementing one-shot speaker adaptation. This enables TTS to mimic voice characteristics from one speaker to another with only a one-shot speaker sample, even from a text without any speaker information. In the speech chain loop mechanism, ASR also benefits from the ability to further learn an arbitrary speaker's characteristics from the generated speech waveform, resulting in a significant improvement in the recognition rate",

    "title": "Waveform-Based Speaker Representations for Speech Synthesis",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Speaker adaptation is a key aspect of building a range of speech processing systems, for example personalised speech synthesis. For deep-learning based approaches, the model parameters are hard to interpret, making speaker adaptation more challenging. One widely used method to address this problem is to extract a fixed length vector as speaker representation and use this as an additional input to the task-specific model. This allows speaker-specific output to be generated, without modifying the model parameters. However, the speaker representation is often extracted in a task-independent fashion. This allows the same approach to be used for a range of tasks, but the extracted representation is unlikely to be optimal for the specific task of interest. Furthermore, the features from which the speaker representation is extracted are usually pre-defined, often a standard speech representation. This may limit the available information that can be used. In this paper, an integrated optimisation framework for building a task specific speaker representation, making use of all the available information, is proposed. Speech synthesis is used as the example task. The speaker representation is derived from raw waveform, incorporating text information via an attention mechanism. This paper evaluates and compares this framework with standard task-independent forms",

    "abstract": "Simultaneous lecture translation requires speech to be translated in real time before the speaker has spoken an entire sentence since a long delay will create difficulties for the listeners trying to follow the lecture. The challenge is to construct a full-fledged system with speech recognition, machine translation and text-to-speech synthesis (TTS) components that could produce high-quality speech translations on the fly. Specifically for a TTS, this poses problems as a conventional framework commonly requires the language-dependent contextual linguistics of a full sentence to produce a natural-sounding speech waveform. Several studies have proposed ways for an incremental TTS (ITTS), in which it can estimate the target prosody from only partial knowledge of the sentence. However, most investigations are being done only in French, English and German. French is a syllable-timed language and the others are stress-timed languages. The Japanese language, which is a mora-timed language, has not been investigated so far. In this paper, we evaluate the quality of Japanese synthesized speech based on various linguistic and temporal incremental units. Experimental results reveal that an accent phrase incremental unit (a group of moras) is essential for a Japanese ITTS as a trade-off between quality and synthesis units",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a unified training framework for the generation of glottal signals in deep learning (DL)-based parametric speech synthesis systems. The glottal vocoding-based speech synthesis system, especially the modeling-by-generation (MbG) structure that we proposed recently, significantly improves the naturalness of synthesized speech by faithfully representing the noise component of the glottal excitation with an additional DL structure. Because the MbG method introduces a multistage processing pipeline, however, its training process is complicated and inefficient. To alleviate this problem, we propose a unified training approach that directly generates speech parameters by merging all the required models, such as acoustic, glottal and noise models into a single unified network. Considering the fact that noise analysis should be performed after training the glottal model, we also propose a stochastic noise analysis method that enables noise modeling to be included in the unified training process by iteratively analyzing the noise component in every epoch. Both objective and subjective test results verify the superiority of the proposed algorithm compared to conventional methods",

In recent years, the performance of speech synthesis systems has been improved over conventional techniques thanks to deep learning-based acoustic models. Among the popular deep learning techniques, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) has been successful in modeling time-dependent sequential data efficiently. However, due to the deterministic nature of RNNs prediction, such models do not reflect the full complexity of highly structured data, like natural speech. In this regard, we propose adversarially trained variational recurrent neural network (AdVRNN) which use VRNN to better represent the variability of natural speech for acoustic modeling in speech synthesis. Also, we apply adversarial learning scheme in training AdVRNN to overcome oversmoothing problem. We conducted comparative experiments for the proposed VRNN with the conventional gated recurrent unit which is one of RNNs, for speech synthesis system. It is shown that the proposed AdVRNN based method performed better than the conventional GRU technique",

However, the model complexity and inference time cost of RNNs are much higher than feed-forward neural networks (FNN) due to the sequential nature of the learning algorithm, thus limiting its usage in many runtime applications. In this paper, we explore a novel application of deep time delay neural network (TDNN) for embedded SPSS, which requires low disk footprint, memory and latency. The TDNN could model long short-term temporal dependencies with inference cost comparable to standard FNN. Temporal subsampling enabled by TDNN could reduce computational complexity. Then we compress deep TDNN using singular value decomposition (SVD) to further reduce model complexity, which are motivated by the goal of building embedded SPSS systems which can be run efficiently on mobile devices. Both objective and subjective experimental results show that, the proposed deep TDNN with SVD compression could generate synthesized speech with better speech quality than FNN and comparable speech quality to LSTM, while drastically reduce model complexity and speech parameter generation time",

Then, we exploit a recurrent neural network based connectionist temporal classification model to automatically label and align an utterance's emotional segments with emotional labels, while non-emotional segments with Nulls.

Regularization is particularly important with deep neural networks (DNNs), which have millions of parameters. While previous studies have reported competitive performance for arousal and dominance, the prediction results for valence using acoustic features are significantly lower. We hypothesize that higher regularization can lead to better results for valence. This study focuses on exploring the role of dropout as a form of regularization for valence suggesting the need for higher regularization. We analyze the performance of regression models for valence, arousal and dominance as a function of the dropout probability. We observe that the optimum dropout rates are consistent for arousal and dominance. However, the optimum dropout rate for valence is higher. To understand the need for higher regularization for valence, we perform an empirical analysis to explore the nature of emotional cues conveyed in speech. We compare regression models with speaker-dependent and speaker-independent partitions for training and testing. The experimental evaluation suggests stronger speaker dependent traits for valence. We conclude that higher regularization is needed for valence to force the network to learn global patterns that generalize across speakers",

In daily conversations, the preferred way of describing affects is by using categorical emotion labels (e.g., sad, anger, surprise). In categorical emotion classification, multiple descriptors (with different degrees of relevance) can be assigned to a sample. Perceptual evaluations have relied on primary and secondary emotions to capture the ambiguous nature of spontaneous recordings. Primary emotion is the most relevant category felt by the evaluator. Secondary emotions capture other emotional cues also conveyed in the stimulus. In most cases, the labels collected from the secondary emotions are discarded, since assigning a single class label to a sample is preferred from an application perspective. In this work, we take advantage of both types of annotations to improve the performance of emotion classification. We collect the labels from all the annotations available for a sample and generate primary and secondary emotion labels. A classifier is then trained using multitask learning with both primary and secondary emotions.

Auditory-motor adaptation is generally assumed to occur at the sensory-motor level.

The present study investigates the influence of the modality of stimuli presentation (written word vs. a picture representing the same word) on auditory-motor adaptation and transfer. In this speech production experiment, speakers' auditory feedback was altered online, inducing adaptation. We contrasted the magnitude of adaptation in these two different modalities and we assessed transfer from /pe/ to the French word /epe/ in the same vs. different modality of presentation, using a mixed 2*2 subject design. The magnitude of adaptation was not different between modalities. This observation contrasts with recent findings showing an effect of the modality (a written word vs. a go signal) on adaptation. Moreover, transfer did occur from one modality to the other and transfer pattern depended on the modality of transfer stimuli. Overall, the results suggest that picture naming and word reading rely on sensory-motor representations that may be linked to contextual (or surface) characteristics",

Nevertheless, it performs well on the difficult task of single word identification (model accuracy 11.37%, Mozilla DeepSpeech: 4.45%). The architecture of the model is a simple two-layered wide neural network with weighted connections between the acoustic frequency band features as inputs and lexical outcomes (pointers to semantic vectors) as outputs. Model performance shows hardly any degredation when trained on speech in noise rather than on clean speech. Performance was further enhanced by adding a second network to a standard wide network.

Because stimuli are usually presented in a random sequence different for each participant, local speed effects affect the underlying ‘true' RTs of specific trials in different ways across participants. To be able to focus statistical analysis on the effects of the cognitive process under study, it is necessary to reduce the effect of confounding factors as much as possible. In this paper we propose and compare techniques and criteria for doing so, with focus on reducing (‘filtering') the local speed effects. We show that filtering matters substantially for the significance analyses of predictors in linear mixed effect regression models. The performance of filtering is assessed by the average between-participant correlation between filtered RT sequences and by Akaike's Information Criterion, an important measure of the goodness-of-fit of linear mixed effect regression models",

The SQ predicted with this method is compared with average subject ratings from the TCD-VoIP speech quality database that covers several effects of SQ degradation that can occur in VoIP applications such as clipping, packet loss, echo effects, background noise and competing speakers. Our approach is tailored to speech and therefore not applicable when quality is degraded by a competing speaker, which is reflected by an insignificant correlation between model output and subjective SQ.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "A key component of task-oriented dialogue systems is the belief state representation, since it directly affects the policy learning efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel, binary, compact, yet scalable belief state representation. We compare the standard verbose belief state representation (268 dimensions) with the domain-independent representation (57 dimensions) and the proposed representation (13 or 4 dimensions). To test those representations, the recently introduced Advantage Actor Critic (A2C) algorithm is exploited. The latter has not been tested before for any representation apart from the verbose one. We study the effect of the belief state representation within A2C under 0%, 15%, 30% and 45% semantic error rate and conclude that the novel binary representation in general outperforms both the domain-independent and the verbose belief state representation. Further, the robustness of the binary representation is tested under more realistic scenarios with mismatched semantic error rates, within the A2C and DQN algorithms. The results indicate that the proposed compact, binary representation performs better or similarly to the other representations, being an efficient and promising alternative to the full belief",

    "abstract": "Recent approaches for dialogue act recognition have shown that context from preceding utterances is important to classify the subsequent one. It was shown that the performance improves rapidly when the context is taken into account. We propose an utterance-level attention-based bidirectional recurrent neural network (Utt-Att-BiRNN) model to analyze the importance of preceding utterances to classify the current one. In our setup, the BiRNN is given the input set of current and preceding utterances. Our model outperforms previous models that use only preceding utterances as context on the used corpus. Another contribution of our research is a mechanism to discover the amount of information in each utterance to classify the subsequent one and to show that context-based learning not only improves the performance but also achieves higher confidence in the recognition of dialogue acts. We use character- and word-level features to represent the utterances. The results are presented for character and word feature representations and as an ensemble model of both representations. We found that when classifying short utterances, the closest preceding utterances contribute to a higher degree",

However, many of the VUIs use only synthetic voices to provide information for users. To realize a more natural interface, one feasible solution will be personifying VUIs by adding visual features such as face, but what kind of face is suited to a given quality of voice or what kind of voice quality is suited to a given face? In this paper, we test methods of statistical conversion from face to voice based on their subjective impressions. To this end, six combinations of two types of face features, one type of speech features, and three types of conversion models are tested using a parallel corpus developed based on subjective mapping from face features to voice features. The experimental results show that each subject judge one specific and subject-dependent voice quality as suited to different faces and that the optimal number of mixtures of face features is different from the numbers of mixtures of voice features tested",

    "abstract": "Interview is a vital part of recruitment process and is especially challenging for the beginners. In an interactive and natural interview, the interviewers would ask follow-up questions or request further elaborations when they are not satisfied with the interviewee's initial response. In this study, as only a small interview corpus is available, a pattern-based sequence to sequence (Seq2seq) model is adopted for follow-up question generation. First, word clustering is employed to automatically transform the question/answer sentences into sentence patterns, in which each sentence pattern is composed of word classes, to decrease the complexity of the sentence structures. Next, the convolutional neural tensor network (CNTN) is used to select a target sentence in an interviewee's answer turn for follow-up question generation. In order to generate the follow-up question pattern, the selected target sentence pattern is fed to a Seq2seq model to obtain the corresponding follow-up question pattern. Then the word class positions in the generated follow-up question sentence pattern is filled in with the words using a word class table obtained from the training corpus. Finally, the n-gram language model is used to rank the candidate follow-up questions and choose the most suitable one as the response to the interviewee. This study collected 3390 follow-up question and answer sentence pairs for training and evaluation. Five-fold cross validation was employed and the experimental results show that the proposed method outperformed the traditional word-based method and achieved a more favorable performance based on a statistical significance test",

Arguably the most successful approach to automatically learning text coherence is the entity grid, which relies on modelling patterns of distribution of entities across multiple sentences of a text. Originally applied to the evaluation of automatic summaries and the news genre, among its many extensions, this model has also been successfully used to assess dialogue coherence. Nevertheless, both the original grid and its extensions do not model intents, a crucial aspect that has been studied widely in the literature in connection to dialogue structure. We propose to augment the original grid document representation for dialogue with the intentional structure of the conversation. Our models outperform the original grid representation on both text discrimination and insertion, the two main standard tasks for coherence assessment across three different dialogue datasets, confirming that intents play a key role in modelling dialogue coherence",

International phonetic alphabets are used to derive the transcription. Multilingual Phone Recognition System (MPRS) is developed using the state-of-the-art DNNs. The performance of MPRS is improved using the Articulatory Features (AFs). DNNs are used to predict the AFs for place, manner, roundness, frontness and height AF groups. Further, the MPRS is also developed using oracle AFs and their performance is compared with that of predicted AFs. Oracle AFs are used to set the best performance realizable by AFs predicted from MFCC features by DNNs. In addition to the AFs, we have also explored the use of phone posteriors to further boost the performance of MPRS.We show that oracle AFs by feature fusion with MFCCs offer a remarkably low target of PER of 10.4%, which is 24.7% absolute reduction compared to baseline MPRS with MFCCs alone. The best performing system using predicted AFs has shown 2.8% reduction in absolute PER (8% reduction in relative PER) compared to baseline MPRS",

Our public forum allows users to post audio messages, listen to messages posted by others, post votes and audio comments and share content with friends through subsidized phone calls. The entertainment aspects and sharing features of the forum lead to its viral spread in Pakistan. Within 8 months, it reached 11,017 users and gathered 1,207 hours of speech data comprising 57,454 audio-posts and 130,685 audio-comments, spanning Urdu and 9 regional languages. We trained an ASR using just 9.5 hours of the corpus to obtain 24.19% WER. Community forums automatically overcome common spontaneous speech data collection challenges like speaker recruitment, natural speech elicitation, content diversity, informed consent, sampling real-world ambient noise and reach (for geographically remote linguistic communities). This technique is especially useful for gathering speech corpora for under-resourced languages hence enabling the development of speech recognition, keyword spotting, speaker ID and noise classification systems (among others) for such languages. It also allows rapid, automatic preservation of spoken languages and oral aspects of culture. This technique can be extended to collect speech data for endangered languages, oral cultures and linguistic minorities",

In Mizo language, a majority of the words contain tone information. As a result of that, it exhibits higher acoustic variability like other tonal languages in the world. In this work, we investigate the impact of tonal information on robust Mizo continuous speech recognition (CSR). First, separate baseline CSR systems are developed employing the Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) based acoustic features and salient acoustic modeling paradigms. For further improvement, the tonal information has been incorporated in each of the CSR systems. For this purpose, 3-dimensional tonal features are derived which include pitch, pitch-difference and probability of voicing values. Our experimental study reveals that with the inclusion of tonal information, the robustness of Mizo CSR system gets enhanced across all acoustic modeling paradigms. This trend is attributed to lesser degradation in the fundamental frequency information than the vocal tract information under noisy conditions",

The proposed semi-supervised learning decodes the unlabeled large training corpus using the seed model and through various protocols, selects the decoded utterances with high reliability using confidence levels (that correlate to the WER of the decoded utterances) and iterative bootstrapping. The proposed active learning protocol uses confidence level based metric to select the decoded utterances from the large unlabeled corpus for further labeling. The semi-supervised learning protocols can offer a WER reduction, from a poorly trained seed model, by as much as 50% of the best WER-reduction realizable from the seed model's WER, if the large corpus were labeled and used for acoustic-model training. The active learning protocols allow that only 60% of the entire training corpus be manually labeled, to reach the same performance as the entire data",

This paper addressed this challenge with four Indian languages, Hindi, Marathi, Bengali and Oriya by integrating articulatory information into acoustic features, thereby compensating the low resource property of these languages for improved performance. Articulatory movements were recorded during speech production using an electromagnetic articulograph and trained together with acoustic features to build automatic speech recognizers for these languages. Both speaker-dependent and -independent recognition experiments were conducted by adopting three ASR models: Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-Hidden Markov Model (HMM), Deep Neural Network (DNN)-HMM and Long Short Term Memory recurrent neural network (LSTM)-HMM. A cross-language similarity was discerned in both acoustic and articulatory domains in the pairs of Oriya-Bengali and Hindi-Marathi. Based on these observations, a multi-lingual, multi-modal speech recognizer was built by constructing a unified dictionary consisting of common and unique phonemes of all the four languages, which reduced the phoneme error rates",

Generally, a forensic expert is asked to analyze both suspect and criminal's voice samples in order to indicate whether the evidence supports the prosecution (same-speaker) or defence (different-speakers) hypotheses. This process is known as Forensic Voice Comparison (FVC). Since the emergence of the DNA typing model, the likelihood-ratio (LR) framework has become the golden standard in forensic sciences. The LR not only supports one of the hypotheses but also quantifies the strength of its support. However, the LR accepts some practical limitations due to its estimation process itself. It is particularly true when Automatic Speaker Recognition (ASpR) systems are considered as they are outputting a score in all situations regardless of the case specific conditions. Indeed, several factors are not taken into account by the estimation process like the quality and quantity of information in both voice recordings, their phonological content or also the speakers intrinsic characteristics. In our recent study, we showed the importance of the phonemic content and we highlighted interesting differences between inter-speakers effects and intra-speaker's ones.

    "abstract": "An i-vector is a fixed-length and low-rank representation of a speech utterance. It has been used extensively in text-independent speaker verification. Ideally, speech utterances from the same speaker would map to an unique i-vector. However, this is not the case due to some intrinsic and extrinsic factors like physical condition of the speaker, channel difference, noise and notably the duration of speech utterances. In particular, we found that i-vectors extracted from short utterances exhibit larger variance than that of long utterances. To address the problem, we propose a co-whitening approach, taking into account the duration, while maximizing the correlation between the i-vectors of short and long duration. The proposed co-whitening method was derived based on canonical correlation analysis (CCA). Experimental results on NIST SRE 2010 show that co-whitening method is effective in compensating the duration mismatch, leading to a reduction of up to 13.07% in equal error rate (EER)",

This study presents a new technique for domain mismatch compensation within a text-independent speaker recognition scenario. The proposed method is designed for the NIST speaker recognition evaluation 2016 (SRE16) task, where speakers from training, development and evaluation data belong to different sets of languages. An i-vector/PLDA speaker recognition system is adopted for this study. To address the mismatch problem, we propose to append auxiliary features to the i-vectors. These auxiliary features are adapted representations of the i-vectors to the specific in-domain data; therefore, the new feature vector has two parts: (1) i-vectors which represent speaker identity and (2) auxiliary features which are representations of i-vectors in the in-domain data feature space (and may not contain speaker identity information). This new concatenated feature vector (we call this a-vector) is then post-processed with support vector discriminant analysis (SVDA) for further domain compensation. Evaluations based on the SRE16 confirm the effectiveness of the proposed technique. In terms of minimum Cprimary cost, a-vector outperforms the i-vector consistently. Moreover, comparing to previous single systems introduced for SRE16, we achieved 8.5%-18% improvements in terms of equal error rate",

The likelihood loss guide can constrain the j-vector extractor for improving the verification performance. Since the strengths of j-vector and joint Bayesian analysis appear complementary the joint learning significantly outperforms traditional separate training scheme. Our experiments on the the public RSR2015 part I data corpus demonstrate that this new training scheme can produce more discriminative j-vectors and leading to performance improvement on the speaker verification task",

    "abstract": "Speaker verification with prompted random digit strings has been a challenging task due to very short test utterance. This work investigates how to combine methods from deep bottleneck features (DBF) and latent factor analysis (LFA) to result in a new state-of-the-art approach for such task. In order to provide a wider temporal context, a stacked DBF is extracted to replace the traditional MFCC feature in the derivation of the supervector representations and leads to a significant improvement for the speaker verification. The LFA is used to model these stacked DBFs in both digit and utterance scales. Based on this learned LFA model, two kinds of supervector representations are extracted for utterance and local digits respectively. Since the strengths of DBF and LFA appear complementary, the combination significantly outperforms either of its components. Experiments have been conducted on the public RSR2015 part III data corpus, the results showed that our approach can achieve 1.40% EER and 1.55% EER on male and female respectively",

    "abstract": "Over the last decade, the factor analysis based modeling of a variable length speech utterance into a fixed dimensional vector (termed as i-vector) has been prominently used for many tasks like speaker recognition, language recognition and even in speech recognition. The i-vector model is an unsupervised learning paradigm where the data is initially clustered using a Gaussian Mixture Universal Background Model (GMM-UBM). The adapted means of the Gaussian mixture components are dimensionality reduced using the Total Variability Matrix (TVM) where the latent variables are modeled with a single Gaussian distribution. In this paper, we propose to rework the theory of i-vector modeling using a supervised framework where the speech utterances are associated with a label. Class labels are introduced in the i-vector model using a mixture Gaussian prior. We show that the proposed model is a generalized i-vector model and the conventional i-vector model turns out to be a special case of this model. This model is applied for a language recognition task using the NIST Language Recognition Evaluation (LRE) 2017 dataset. In these experiments, the supervised i-vector model provides significant improvements over the conventional i-vector model (average relative improvements of 5% in terms of C_{avg}",

Our findings reveal that scientists have treated age-related voice changes as a hindrance instead of leveraging it to the advantage of the identity validator. Additionally, we found a significant dearth of publicly available corpora related to both the time span of and the number of participants in audio recordings. We also identified a significant bias toward the development of speaker recognition technologies applicable to government surveillance systems compared to speaker verification systems used in civilian IT security systems. To solve the aforementioned issues, we built an open project with the largest publicly available longitudinal speaker database, which includes 229 speakers with an average talking time exceeding 15 hours spanning across an average of 21 years per speaker.

This study differs from the majority of speaker recognition research, which focuses on speech acquisition over short distances, such as when using a telephone handset or mobile device or far-field microphone arrays, for which beamforming can enhance distant speech signals. We use two large-scale corpora collected by retransmitting speech data in reverberant environments with multiple microphones placed at different distances. We first characterize three different speaker recognition systems ranging from a traditional universal background model (UBM) i-vector system to a state-of-the-art deep neural network (DNN) speaker embedding system with a probabilistic linear discriminant analysis (PLDA) back-end. We then assess the impact of microphone distance and placement, background noise and loudspeaker orientation on the performance of speaker recognition system for distant speech data. We observe that the recently introduced DNN speaker embedding based systems are far more robust compared to i-vector based systems, providing a significant relative improvement of up to 54% over the baseline UBM i-vector system and 45.5% over prior DNN-based speaker recognition technology",

    "abstract": "In this work, we investigate training speaker recognition systems on wideband (WB) features and compare their performance with narrowband (NB) baselines. NIST speaker recognition evaluations have mainly driven speaker recognition research in the past years. Because of the target application of these evaluations, most data available to train speaker recognition systems is NB telephone speech. Meanwhile, WB data have been more scarce not being enough to train factor analysis and PLDA models. Thus, the usual practice when dealing with WB speech consists in downsampling the signal to 8 kHz, which implies potential loss of useful information. Instead, we experimented upsampling the training telephone data and leaving the WB data unchanged. We adopt two techniques to upsample telephone data: (1) using a feed-forward neural network, termed Bandwidth Extension (BWE) network, to predict WB features given NB features as input; and (2) using basic upsampling with a low-pass filter interpolator. While the former intends to estimate the high frequency information, the latter does not. The upsampled features are used to train state-of-the art i-vector and recently proposed x-vector models. We evaluated the systems on Speakers In The Wild (SITW) database obtaining 11.5% relative improvement in detection cost function (DCF) with x-vector model",

In the present paper, inspired from speech recognition studies, we build further on that framework to design a CNN-based system, which models sub-segmental speech (about 2ms speech) in the first convolution layer, with an hypothesis that such a system should learn vocal tract system related speaker discriminative information.

Conventional approaches to this task involve the development of the TDSV and wake-up-word detection systems separately. In this paper, we show that TDSV and keyword spotting (KWS) can be jointly modeled using the convolutional long short term memory (CLSTM) model architecture, where an initial convolutional feature map is further processed by a LSTM recurrent network. Given a small amount of training data for developing the CLSTM system, we show that the model provides accurate detection of the presence of the keyword in spoken utterance. For the TDSV task, the MTL model can be well regularized using the CLSTM training examples for personalized wake up task. The experiments are performed for KWS wake up detection and TDSV using the combined speech recordings from Wall Street Journal (WSJ) and LibriSpeech corpus. In these experiments with multiple keywords, we illustrate that the proposed approach of MTL significantly improves the performance of previously proposed neural network based text dependent SV systems. We also experimentally illustrate that the CLSTM model provides significant improvements over previously proposed keyword detection systems as well (average relative improvements of 30% over previous approaches)",

    "abstract": "It is known that the equal-error-rate (EER) performance of a speaker verification system is determined by the overlap region of the decision scores of true and imposter trials. Also, the cosine similarity scores of the true or imposter trials produced by the state-of-the-art i-vector front-end approximate to a Gaussian distribution and the overlap region of the two classes of trials depends mainly on their between-class distance. Motivated by the above facts, this paper presents a cosine similarity learning (CML) framework for speaker verification, which combines classical compensation techniques and the cosine similarity scoring for improving the EER performance. CML minimizes the overlap region by enlarging the between-class distance while introducing a regularization term to control the within-class variance, which is initialized by a traditional channel compensation technique such as linear discriminant analysis. Experiments are carried out to compare the proposed CML framework with several traditional channel compensation baselines on the NIST speaker recognition evaluation data sets. The results show that CML outperforms all the studied initialization compensation techniques",

We employ a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) trained on unlabeled audio with multiple and unknown speaker change points. We assume short-term speaker stationarity and hence that speech frames in close temporal proximity originated from a single speaker. In contrast, two random short speech segments from different audio streams are assumed to originate from two different speakers. Based on this hypothesis, a binary classification scenario of predicting whether an input pair of short speech segments comes from the same speaker or not, is developed. An RNN based deep siamese network is trained and the resulting embeddings, extracted from a hidden layer representation of the network, are employed as speaker embeddings. The experimental results on speaker change points detection show the efficacy of the proposed method to learn short-term speaker-specific features. We also show the consistency of these features via a simple statistics-based utterance-level speaker classification task.

At the training time, an extra operation is added after the speech enhancement network to convert the estimated signal in the time domain to the frequency domain. This operation is differentiable and is used to train the system with a loss in the frequency domain. This proposed approach replaces learning in the frequency domain, i.e., short-time Fourier transform (STFT) magnitude estimation, with learning in the original time domain. The proposed method is a spectral mapping approach in which the CNN first generates a time domain signal then computes its STFT that is used for spectral mapping. This way the CNN can exploit the additional domain knowledge about calculating the STFT magnitude from the time domain signal. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method substantially outperforms the other methods of speech enhancement.

To develop the minimum PE (MPE) criterion, one requires the knowledge of the noise probability density function (p.d.f.), which may not be available in a parametric form in speech denoising applications. Therefore, we adopt two approaches for modeling the noise p.d.f.: (i) Gaussian modeling based on adaptive variance estimation; and (ii) a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) in view of its approximation capabilities. We consider discrete cosine transform (DCT) domain shrinkage, where the optimum shrinkage parameter is obtained by minimizing an estimate of the PE. A performance assessment for real-world noise types shows that for input signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) greater than 5 dB, the proposed MPE-based point-wise shrinkage estimators outperform three benchmark techniques in terms of segmental SNR and short-time objective intelligibility (STOI) scores",

This nonnegativity property enables us to interpret them as convex polyhedral cones that lie in the positive orthant. Conic affinity could be useful when designing NMF-based systems for unseen noise conditions, which operate by selecting an appropriate noise dictionary amongst a pool of potential candidates. To that end, we examine two conic affinity measures, one based on cosine similarity, while the other is based on euclidean distance from a point to a cone.

    "abstract": "In this paper, a speech enhancement approach exploiting the efficacy of non-local means (NLM) estimation and variational mode decomposition (VMD) is proposed. The NLMestimation is effective in removing noises whenever non-local similarities are present among the samples of the signal under consideration. However, it suffers from the issue of under-averaging in those regions where amplitude and frequency variations are abrupt. Since speech is a non-stationary signal, the magnitude and frequency vary over the time. Consequently, NLM is not that effective in removing the noise components from the speech signal as observed in the case of image enhancement. To address this issue, the noisy speech signal is first decomposed into variational mode functions (VMFs) using VMD. Each of the VMFs represents a small portion of the overall frequency components of the signal. The VMFs are then combined into different groups depending on their similarities to reduce computational cost. Next, the non-local similarity present in each group of VMFs is exploited for an effective speech enhancement through NLM estimation. The enhancement performance of the proposed method is compared with two existing speech enhancement techniques. The experimental results presented in this study show that, the proposed method provides better speech enhancement performance",

Noisy features are transformed to the enhanced ones through a mapping network and the mean square errors between the enhanced and clean features are minimized.

A cycle-consistent constraint is enforced to minimize the reconstruction loss. Similarly, a backward cycle of mappings is performed in the opposite direction with the same networks and losses. With cycle-consistency, the speech structure is well preserved in the enhanced features while noise is effectively reduced such that the feature mapping network generalizes better to unseen data. In cases where only unparalleled noisy and clean data is available for training, two discriminator networks are used to distinguish the reconstructed clean and noisy features from the real ones. The discrimination losses are jointly optimized with reconstruction losses through adversarial multi-task learning.

    "title": "Bone-Conduction Sensor Assisted Noise Estimation for Improved Speech Enhancement",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "State-of-the-art noise power spectral density (PSD) estimation techniques for speech enhancement utilize the so-called speech presence probability (SPP). However, in highly non-stationary environments, SPP-based techniques could still suffer from inaccurate estimation, leading to significant amount of residual noise or speech distortion. In this paper, we propose to improve speech enhancement by deploying the bone-conduction (BC) sensor, which is known to be relatively insensitive to the environmental noise compared to the regular air-conduction (AC) microphone. A strategy is suggested to utilized the BC sensor characteristics for assisting the AC microphone in better SPP-based noise estimation. To our knowledge, no previous work has incorporated the BC sensor in this noise estimation aspect. Consequently, the proposed strategy can possibly be combined with other BC sensor assisted speech enhancement techniques. We show the feasibility and potential of the proposed method for improving the enhanced speech quality by both objective and subjective tests",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Artificial bandwidth extension (ABE) algorithms have been developed to improve quality when wideband devices receive speech signals from narrowband devices or infrastructure. The utilisation of contextual information in the form of dynamic features or explicit memory captured from neighbouring frames is common to ABE research, however the use of additional cues augments complexity and can introduce latency. Previous work shows that unsupervised, linear dimensionality reduction techniques help to reduce complexity. This paper reports a semisupervised, non-linear approach to dimensionality reduction using a stacked auto-encoder. In further contrast to previous work, it operates on raw spectra from which a low dimensional narrowband representation is learned in a data-driven manner. Three different objective speech quality measures show that the new features can be used with a standard regression model to improve ABE performance. Improvements in the mutual information between learned features and missing higher frequency components are also observed whereas improvements in speech quality are corroborated by informal listening tests",

    "abstract": "Traditional speech enhancement systems reduce noise by modifying the noisy signal, which suffer from two problems: under-suppression of noise and over-suppression of speech. As an alternative, in this paper, we use the recently introduced concatenative resynthesis approach where we replace the noisy speech with its clean resynthesis. The output of such a system can produce speech that is both noise-free and high quality. This paper generalizes our previous small-vocabulary system to large vocabulary. To do so, we employ efficient decoding techniques using fast approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) algorithms. Firstly, we apply ANN techniques on the original small vocabulary task and get 5X speedup. We then apply the techniques to the construction of a large vocabulary concatenative resynthesis system and scale the system up to 12X larger dictionary.

We extend and demonstrate significant improvements to our previous work in synthesis-based speech enhancement, which performs concatenative resynthesis of speech signals for the production of noiseless, high quality speech. Concatenative resynthesis methods perform unit selection through learned non-linear similarity functions between short chunks of clean and noisy signals. These mappings are learned using deep neural networks (DNN) trained to predict high similarity for the exact chunk of speech that is contained within a chunk of noisy speech and low similarity for all other pairings. We find here that more robust mappings can be learned with a more efficient use of the available data by selecting pairings that are not exact matches, but contain similar clean speech that matches the original in terms of acoustic, phonetic and prosodic content. The resulting output is evaluated on the small vocabulary CHiME2-GRID corpus and outperforms our original baseline system in terms of intelligibility by combining phonetic similarity with similarity of acoustic intensity, fundamental frequency and periodicity",

    "abstract": "Word count estimation (WCE) from audio recordings has a number of applications, including quantifying the amount of speech that language-learning infants hear in their natural environments, as captured by daylong recordings made with devices worn by infants. To be applicable in a wide range of scenarios and also low-resource domains, WCE tools should be extremely robust against varying signal conditions and require minimal access to labeled training data in the target domain. For this purpose, earlier work has used automatic syllabification of speech, followed by a least-squares-mapping of syllables to word counts. This paper compares a number of previously proposed syllabifiers in the WCE task, including a supervised bi-directional long short-term memory (BLSTM) network that is trained on a language for which high quality syllable annotations are available (a \"high resource language\") and reports how the alternative methods compare on different languages and signal conditions. We also explore additive noise and varying-channel data augmentation strategies for BLSTM training and show how they improve performance in both matching and mismatching languages. Intriguingly, we also find that even though the BLSTM works on languages beyond its training data, the unsupervised algorithms can still outperform it in challenging signal conditions on novel languages",

Information bottleneck (IB) based approach used for speaker diarization is applied for this task. IB system initializes the segments to be clustered uniformly with fixed duration. The issue with diarization of percussion instruments in taniavartanam is that the stroke rate varies highly across the segments. It can double or even quadruple within a short duration, thus leading to variable information rate in different segments. To address this issue, the IB system is modified to use the stroke rate information to divide the audio into segments of varying durations. These varying duration segments are then clustered using the IB approach which is then followed by Kullback-Leibler hidden Markov model (KL-HMM) based realignment of the instrument boundaries. Performance of the conventional IB system and the proposed system is evaluated on standard Carnatic music dataset. The proposed technique shows a best case absolute improvement of 8.2% over the conventional IB based system in terms of diarization error rate",

The recitation of a tabla composition using vocalic syllables(bols) plays an important role in the oral tradition of pedagogy in North Indian classical music. Previous studies have considered the phonetic features of isolated bol utterances with the corresponding isolated strokes produced on the tabla. In this work, we investigate the acoustic properties of bol recitation beyond the segmental measurements related to the phones or syllables. The recitation of a tabla composition, apart from conveying the basic \"score\" in terms of the sequence of stroke name and onset times, is typically quite expressive in nature, being marked by pitch variations, loudness dynamics and voice quality variations across a sequence or phrase. Given the distinct spaces of acoustic variation of the voice and tabla, we study acoustic-prosodic variations in the recitation and investigate the corresponding (time-aligned) supra-segmental acoustic variations in the drumming. An available large dataset of recordings of selected tabla compositions by an expert tabla player, each aligned with the corresponding bol recitation, is employed in the analyses. We find that while the recitation reliably encodes intensity variations across bols in a cycle, the observed pitch variations are meaningful only for the pitch-varying drum strokes of the left drum",

We conduct this evaluation on three different speech corpora. Adding directional information to NMF in the form of non-negative tensor factorisation (NTF) gives us the best result on the map task and vocalization corpora and the Itakura-Saito cost function performs best on the acoustic-camera corpus.

The performance of conventional audio-only SAD (A-SAD) systems is impaired by acoustic noise when they are used in practical applications. An alternative approach to address this problem is to include visual information, creating audiovisual speech activity detection (AV-SAD) solutions. In our previous work, we proposed to build an AV-SAD system using bimodal recurrent neural network (BRNN). This framework was able to capture the task-related characteristics in the audio and visual inputs and model the temporal information within and across modalities. The approach relied on long short-term memory (LSTM). Although LSTM can model longer temporal dependencies with the cells, the effective memory of the units is limited to a few frames, since the recurrent connection only considers the previous frame. For SAD systems, it is important to model longer temporal dependencies to capture the semi-periodic nature of speech conveyed in acoustic and orofacial features. This study proposes to implement a BRNN-based AV-SAD system with advanced LSTMs (A-LSTMs), which overcomes this limitation by including multiple connections to frames in the past. The results show that the proposed framework can significantly outperform the BRNN system trained with the original LSTM layers",

Directly compressing the word embedding matrix usually leads to performance degradation. In this paper, a product quantization based structured embedding approach is proposed to significantly reduce memory consumption of word embeddings without hurting LM performance. Here, each word embedding vector is cut into partial embedding vectors which are then quantized separately.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we address a constrained training for deep neural network-based acoustic model size reduction. While the L2 regularizer is used as a modeling approach to shrinking parameters, we cannot cut down the unimportant parts because it does not assume any group structure. The Group Lasso regularizer is used for the model size reduction approach. Group Lasso can set arbitrary group parameters (e.g. the column vector norms of the parameter matrices) as unimportant parts and make the parameters sparse. Therefore, we can prune the unimportant parameters whose group parameter norm is nearly zero. However, Group Lasso does not suggest a clear rule for separating parameters close to zero and large in the group parameter space and hence is unsuitable for the model size reduction. To solve these problems, we propose a mixture distribution-based regularizer which assumes distributions of norms in the group parameter space. We evaluate our method on a NTT real recorded voice search data containing 1600 hours. Our proposal achieves 27.0% reduction compared to the pruned model by Group Lasso while keeping recognition performance",

    "abstract": "The first step in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is a fixed-rate segmentation of the acoustic signal into overlapping windows of fixed length. Although this procedure allows to achieve excellent recognition accuracy, it is far from being computationally efficient, in that it may produce a highly redundant signal (i.e, almost identical spectral vectors may span many observation windows) that converts into computational overload. The reduction of such overload can be very beneficial for application such as offline ASR on mobile devices. In this paper we present a principled way for saving numerical operations during ASR by using conditional-computation methods in deep bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for acoustic modelling. The methods rely on learned binary neurons that allow hidden layers to be updated only when necessary or to keep their previous value. We (i) evaluate, for the first time, conditional computation-based recurrent architectures on a speech recognition task and (ii) propose a novel model specifically designed for speech data that inherently builds a multi-scale temporal structure in the hidden layers.

    "abstract": "Many Japanese text-to-speech (TTS) systems use word-level pitch accents as one of the prosodic features. Combination of a pronunciation dictionary including lexical pitch accents and a statistical model representing the word accent sandhi is often used to predict pitch accents from a text. However, using human transcribers to build the dictionary and training data for the model is tedious and expensive. This paper proposes a neural pitch accent recognition model. This model combines the information from audio and its transcription (word sequence in hiragana characters) via two-dimensional attention and outputs word-level pitch accents. Experimental results show a reduction in the word pitch accent prediction error rate over that with text only. It lowers the load of human annotators when building a pronunciation dictionary. As the approach is general, it can be used to do pronunciation learning in other languages as well",

By exploiting advancements in deep learning, systems are now able to better approximate the complex mapping from source sentences to target sentences. But with this ability, new challenges also arise. An example is the translation of partial sentences in low-latency speech translation. Since the model has only seen complete sentences in training, it will always try to generate a complete sentence, though the input may only be a partial sentence. We show that NMT systems can be adapted to scenarios where no task-specific training data is available. Furthermore, this is possible without losing performance on the original training data. We achieve this by creating artificial data and by using multi-task learning. After adaptation, we are able to reduce the number of corrections displayed during incremental output construction by 45%, without a decrease in translation quality",

Recent work has found that neural encoder-decoder models can learn to directly translate foreign speech in high-resource scenarios, without the need for intermediate transcription. We investigate whether this approach also works in settings where both data and computation are limited. To make the approach efficient, we make several architectural changes, including a change from character-level to word-level decoding. We find that this choice yields crucial speed improvements that allow us to train with fewer computational resources, yet still performs well on frequent words. We explore models trained on between 20 and 160 hours of data and find that although models trained on less data have considerably lower BLEU scores, they can still predict words with relatively high precision and recall-around 50% for a model trained on 50 hours of data, versus around 60% for the full 160 hour model.

This data may be abused if not protected properly, thus the security and privacy of billions of end-users is at stake. We tackle this challenge by proposing an architecture, dubbed VoiceGuard, that efficiently protects the speech processing task inside a trusted execution environment (TEE). Our solution preserves the privacy of users while at the same time it does not require the service provider to reveal model parameters. Our architecture can be extended to enable user-specific models, such as feature transformations (including fMLLR), i-vectors, or model transformations (e.g., custom output layers). It also generalizes to secure on-premise solutions, allowing vendors to securely ship their models to customers.

Single-channel dereverberation can be achieved by applying a time-frequency (TF) mask to the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) representation of a reverberant signal. Recent approaches have used deep neural networks (DNNs) to estimate such masks. Previously proposed DNN-based mask estimation methods train a DNN to minimize the mean-squared-error (MSE) between the desired and estimated masks. Recent TF mask estimation methods for signal separation directly minimize instead the MSE between the desired and estimated STFT magnitudes. We apply this direct optimization concept to dereverberation. Moreover, as reverberation exceeds the duration of a single STFT frame, we propose to use a bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) network which is able to take the relation between multiple STFT frames into account. We evaluated our method for different reverberation times and source-microphone distances using simulated as well as measured room impulse responses of different rooms.

We propose a single-channel, supervised non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) based dereverberation method, in contrast to the convolutive NMF (CNMF) based methods in literature. Recent supervised approaches use a CNMF model for reverberation and a NMF model for clean speech spectrogram to obtain enhanced speech by directly estimating the clean speech activations. In the proposed method, with a separability assumption on the room impulse response (RIR) spectrogram, the reverb speech can be decomposed into bases and activations using conventional NMF. Using these reverb activations, the clean speech activations are estimated to obtain enhanced speech. The proposed model (i) helps in imposing meaningful constraints on the RIR in both frequency- and time-domains to achieve improved enhancement (ii) leads to a framework that can include a NMF model for noise. (iii) gives a better interpretation of the effects of reverberation in the NMF context. We evaluate and compare the enhancement performance of the algorithm on reverb and noisy conditions, simulated using TIMIT utterances and REVERB challenge RIRs. The proposed method performs better than existing C-NMF based methods in objective measures, such as cepstral distance (CD) and speech-to-reverberation modulation energy ratio (SRMR)",

The temporal pooling algorithm in the DCNN is based on the assumption that the target label is assigned to all temporal locations (average pooling) or to only one temporal location with a maximum response (max-pooling). However, the acoustic event labels are holistic descriptions in a semantic level, it is difficult or even impossible to decide features from which temporal locations contribute to the event perception.

    "abstract": "We present \"DiViMe\", an open-source virtual machine aimed at packaging speech technology for real-life data and developed in the context of the \"Analyzing Children's Language Environments across the World\" Project. This first release focuses on Speech Activity Detection, Speaker Diarization and their evaluation. The present paper introduces the set of included tools and the current workflow, which is focused on making minimal assumptions regarding users' technical skills. Additionally, we show how the current DiViMe tools fare against three sets of challenging data. In a first experiment, we look at performance with samples extracted from daylong recordings gathered using the LENA{TM}, system from English-learning children. We find that the performance of the tools currently in DiViMe is not far from that achieved by the lena proprietary software. In a second experiment, we generalize to other samples of child-centered daylong files, gathered with non-LENA{TM}, hardware from non-English-learning children, showing that performance does not degrade in this condition. Finally, we report on performance in the DiHARD 2018 Challenge Test Data. Originally conceived in the \"Speech Recognition Virtual Kitchen\", DiViMe is a promising platform for packaging speech technology tools for widespread re-use, with potential impact on both fundamental and applied speech and language research",

    "abstract": "Interruptions and simultaneous talking represent important patterns of speech behavior. However, there is a lack of approaches to their automatic detection in continuous audio data. We have developed a solution for automatic labeling of multi-speaker fragments using harmonic traces analysis. Since harmonic traces in multi-speaker intervals form an irregular pattern as opposed to the structured pattern typical for a single speaker, we resorted to computer vision methods to detect multi-speaker fragments. A convolutional neural network was trained on synthetic material to differentiate between single-speaker and multi-speaker fragments. For evaluation of the proposed method the SSPNet Conflict Corpus with provided manual diarization was used. We also examined factors affecting algorithm performance. The main advantages of the proposed method are calculation simplicity and high time resolution. With our approach it is possible to detect segments with minimum duration of 0.5 seconds. The proposed method demonstrates highly accurate results and may be used for speech segmentation, speaker tracking, content analysis such as conflict detection and other practical purposes",

    "abstract": "Speaker diarization is the task of determining who speaks when in an audio stream. Most diarization systems rely on statistical models to address four sub-tasks: speech activity detection (SAD), speaker change detection (SCD), speech turn clustering and re-segmentation. First, following the recent success of recurrent neural networks (RNN) for SAD and SCD, we propose to address re-segmentation with Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Then, we propose to use affinity propagation on top of neural speaker embeddings for speech turn clustering, outperforming regular Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC). Finally, all these modules are combined and jointly optimized to form a speaker diarization pipeline in which all but the clustering step are based on RNNs. We provide experimental results on the French Broadcast dataset ETAPE where we reach state-of-the-art performance",

    "abstract": "Voice onset time (VOT), a primary cue for voicing in many languages including English and German, is known to vary greatly between speakers, but also displays robust within-speaker consistencies, at least in English. The current analysis extends these findings to German. VOT measures were investigated from voiceless alveolar and velar stops in CV syllables cued by a visual prompt in a cue-distractor task. Comparably to English, a considerable portion of German VOT variability can be attributed to the syllable's vowel length and the stop's place of articulation. Individual differences in VOT still remain irrespective of speech rate. However, significant correlations across places of articulation and between speaker-specific mean VOTs and standard deviations indicate that talkers employ a relatively unified VOT profile across places of articulation. This could allow listeners to more efficiently adapt to speaker-specific realisations",

In Estonian, creaky voice is frequently used by all speakers without any obvious evidence for its systematic use as a turn-taking cue. Rather, it signals a lack of prominence and is favored by lengthening and later timing in phrases. In this paper, we analyze the occurrence of creak with respect to properties of the respiratory cycle. We show that creak is more likely to accompany longer exhalations. Furthermore, the results suggest there is little difference in lung volume values regardless of the presence of creak, indicating that creaky voice might be employed to preserve air over the course of longer utterances.

    "abstract": "Recent research suggests that a trading relationship may exist in speech production between vowel duration and glottalisation as cues to coda stop voicing in Australian English. Younger speakers have been shown to use glottalisation to signal voicelessness more than older speakers who instead make greater use of vowel duration. This suggests a sound change in progress for the voicing cues. In addition, the vowel duration cue to voicing is greater in inherently long vowel contexts compared to inherently short vowel contexts. We report on a perceptual study designed to examine whether the weighting of these two cues found in production is replicated in perception. Older and younger listeners were presented with audio stimuli co-varying in vowel duration and glottalisation. In accord with findings from production, the vowel duration cue was weaker for contexts containing inherently short vowels than for those containing inherently long vowels. Complementarily, glottalisation had a stronger effect on the perception of coda voicelessness in inherently short vowel contexts. Older and younger listeners did not differ in their use of glottalisation as a perceptual cue to voicelessness despite previously identified age differences in production. This finding raises questions about the link between perception and production in sound change",

To tackle this hard target, we recruited 16 subjects in a sentence reading task and measured multimodal signals of electroencephalography (EEG), eye movement and speech simultaneously. The onset/offset of gazing and utterance were used for segmenting brain activation stages. Cortical modeling of causal interactions among anatomical regions was conducted on EEG signals through (i) independent component analysis to identify cortical regions of interest (ROIs); (ii) multivariate autoregressive modeling of representative cortical activity from each ROI; and (iii) quantification of the dynamic causal interactions among ROIs using the Short-time direct Directed Transfer function. The resulting brain dynamic model reveals a widely connected bilateral organization with left-lateralized semantic, orthographic and phonological sub-networks, right-lateralized prosody and motor sequencing sub-networks and bi-lateralized auditory and multisensory integration sub-networks that cooperate along interlaced and paralleled temporal stages for speech processing",

Tones were presented in sets of four standards (within-category tokens) followed by a deviant (across-category token). Mismatch negativity (MMN) was measured. Earlier behavioral data showed that exposure to this bimodal distribution improved both categorical perception and perceptual acuity for level tones [1]. In the present study we present analyses of the electrophysiological response recorded during this exposure, i.e. the development of the MMN response during distributional learning. This development over time is analyzed using Generalized Additive Mixed Models and results showed that the MMN amplitude increased for both within- and across-category tokens, reflecting higher perceptual acuity accompanying category formation.

Tone language speakers exhibit more robust brainstem encoding of lexical tones than non-tone language speakers. Studies suggest that the effects of experience with a tone language generalize to the brainstem encoding of lexical tones from other tone languages. However, the effects of learning two tone languages, with different tonal systems, on brainstem encoding of lexical pitch are unknown. In the current study, we investigated whether or not the experience with two tone languages (Mandarin and Cantonese) enhances the brainstem encoding of lexical pitch, using frequency following response (FFR). Mandarin has four lexical tones- high level, rising, dipping and falling while Cantonese has a richer tone system with three level tones (high, mid, low), two rising tones (high and low) and one falling tone. We compared speakers fluent in Cantonese vs. those fluent in both Cantonese and Mandarin on their brainstem encoding of Cantonese and Mandarin lexical tones. We found that the Cantonese-Mandarin speakers exhibited more robust brainstem encoding of the lexical tones as compared to Cantonese speakers. From the current findings, we conclude that learning two tone languages may enhance lexical pitch encoding at the brainstem",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Speech scientists have long noted that the qualities of naturally-produced vowels do not remain constant over their durations – regardless of being nominally \"monophthongs\" or \"diphthongs\". Recent acoustic corpora show that there are consistent patterns of first (F1) and second (F2) formant frequency change across different vowel categories. The three Australian English (AusE) close front vowels /iː, ɪ, ɪə/ provide a striking example: while their midpoint or mean F1 and F2 frequencies are virtually identical, their spectral change patterns distinctly differ. The present study utilizes a pre-attentive discrimination paradigm with electroencephalography to assess AusE listeners' perceptual sensitivity to close front vowels with different F1 × F2 trajectory lengths (TLs) and directions (TDs). When TLs are modest, there is an asymmetry in perceptual sensitivity: closing vowels, e.g., /iː/ whose trajectory terminates high in the F1 × F2 vowel space, are perceptually prominent, whereas centering vowels, e.g., /ɪ, ɪə/ whose trajectories end more centrally, are not. However, when TLs are exaggerated, the asymmetry in the perceptual sensitivity to the two TDs is substantially reduced. The results indicate that, despite the distinct patterns of spectral change of AusE /iː, ɪ, ɪə/ in production, its perceptual relevance is not uniform, but rather vowel-category dependent",

    "abstract": "A growing statistical learning literature suggests that listeners extract statistical information from the linguistic environment. However, distributional frequency may be insufficient for important but relatively low-frequency cues. Acquisition of linguistic knowledge may rely not merely on co-occurrences but on predictive relationships between cues and their outcomes. The present study investigates effects of predictive temporal cue structure on acquisition of a non-native acoustic cue dimension. During training, native English speakers saw coloured shape objects and heard spoken Min Chinese words with six different lexical tones. Tones were the only reliable cue to identifying the associated object. Words also contained a salient cue that did not discriminate between objects. Three tones occurred with high-frequency and three with low-frequency in training. The critical manipulation was the presentation order: either words, containing complex cue structure, preceded object outcomes (discriminative order) or objects preceded words (non-discriminative order). Generalised linear mixed models showed accuracy was significantly higher in the discriminative order than the non-discriminative order. These results demonstrate that predictive cue structure can facilitate acquisition of a non-native cue dimension. Feedback from prediction error drives learners to ignore salient non-discriminative cues and effectively learn to use the target cue dimension",

This suggests that deep neural networks (DNNs) are able to capture structure in speech data that older methods for acoustic modeling, such as Gaussian Mixture Models and shallow neural networks fail to uncover. In image recognition it is possible to link representations on the first couple of layers in DNNs to structural properties of images and to representations on early layers in the visual cortex. This raises the question whether it is possible to accomplish a similar feat with representations on DNN layers when processing speech input. In this paper we present three different experiments in which we attempt to untangle how DNNs encode speech signals and to relate these representations to phonetic knowledge, with the aim to advance conventional phonetic concepts and to choose the topology of a DNNs more efficiently. Two experiments investigate representations formed by auto-encoders. A third experiment investigates representations on convolutional layers that treat speech spectrograms as if they were images.

Specifically, an FHVAE model can learn disentangled and interpretable representations, which have been proven useful for numerous speech applications, such as speaker verification, robust speech recognition and voice conversion. However, as we will elaborate in this paper, the training algorithm proposed in the original paper is not scalable to datasets of thousands of hours, which makes this model less applicable on a larger scale. After identifying limitations in terms of runtime, memory and hyperparameter optimization, we propose a hierarchical sampling training algorithm to address all three issues. Our proposed method is evaluated comprehensively on a wide variety of datasets, ranging from 3 to 1,000 hours and involving different types of generating factors, such as recording conditions and noise types. In addition, we also present a new visualization method for qualitatively evaluating the performance with respect to the interpretability and disentanglement.

The 9-dimensional BNFs obtained from a phone classification neural network are visualised in 2-dimensional spaces using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE). The 2-dimensional BNF space is analysed with regard to phonetic features. A back-propagation method is used to create \"cardinal\" features for each phone under a particular neural network. Both the visualisations of 9-dimensional and 2-dimensional BNFs show distinctions between most phone categories. Particularly, the 2-dimensional BNF space seems to be a union of phonetic category related subspaces that preserve local structures within each subspace where the organisations of phones appear to correspond to phone production mechanisms.

The aim of this paper is two-fold: investigate whether a deep neural network-based (DNN) ASR system can adapt to only a few examples of ambiguous speech as humans have been found to do; investigate a DNN's ability to serve as a model of human perceptual learning. Crucially, we do so by looking at intermediate levels of phoneme category adaptation rather than at the output level. We visualize the activations in the hidden layers of the DNN during perceptual learning. The results show that, similar to humans, DNN systems learn speaker-adapted phone category boundaries from a few labeled examples. The DNN adapts its category boundaries not only by adapting the weights of the output layer, but also by adapting the implicit feature maps computed by the hidden layers, suggesting the possibility that human perceptual learning might involve a similar nonlinear distortion of a perceptual space that is intermediate between the acoustic input and the phonological categories.

While the range and flexibility of AAC has grown over the years, making devices accessible to children at varied economic and regional backgrounds, is still a challenge. KAVI-PTS is designed as a picture-to-speech Android application and has been made available in several Asian languages.

    "abstract": "We present a computational model of speech motor control that integrates vocal tract state prediction with sensory feedback. This hierarchical model, called FACTS, incorporates both a high-level and low-level controller. The high-level controller orchestrates linguistically-relevant speech tasks, which are represented as desired constrictions along the vocal tract (e.g., closure of the lips). The output of the high-level controller is passed to a low-level controller that can issue motor commands at the level of the speech articulators in order to accomplish the desired constrictions. In order to generate these articulatory motor commands, this low-level articulatory controller relies on an estimate of the current state of the vocal tract. This estimate combines internal predictions about the consequences of issued motor commands with auditory and somatosensory feedback from the vocal tract using an Unscented Kalman Filter based state estimation method. FACTS is able to replicate important aspects of human speech behavior, in that it reproduces: (i) stable speech behavior in the presence of noisy motor and sensory systems, (ii) partial acoustic compensation to auditory feedback perturbations, (iii) complete compensations to mechanical perturbations only when they interfere with current production goals and (iv) the observed relationship between sensory acuity and response to sensory perturbations",

Results indicated that during the visual mismatch phases all participants entrained to the visually presented word, head, without being aware that their vowel quality had changed. Here, we explore whether similar effects occur for individuals with presumed sensorineural processing disorders, patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). We also examine the effects of PD treatment on this entrainment behavior. Participants were 14 individuals with PD, with eight in ongoing speech/language therapy and six reporting no recent therapy. Participants heard pink noise over headphones and produced the word head under four viewing conditions: First, while viewing repetitions of head (baseline); next, during \"morphed\" videos shifting gradually from head to had (ramp); then videos of had (maximum hold); and finally videos of head (after effects). Analysis with a linear mixedeffects model indicated a significant F1 difference between baseline and maximum hold phases for the productions of the treated PD group, but not for the untreated group. Implications for the causes and treatment of PD speech disorders are discussed",

Voluntary events, such as tongue clicking and teeth chattering, may lead to a novel way of silent interface command. Involuntary events, such as coughing and clearing the throat, may advance the current state-of-the-art in hearing health research. The challenge of such applications is the balance between the processing capabilities of a small intra-aural device and the accuracy of classification. In this pilot study, 10 nonverbal audio events are captured inside the ear canal blocked by an intra-aural device. The performance of three classifiers is investigated: Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), Support Vector Machine and Multi-Layer Perceptron. Each classifier is trained using three different feature vector structures constructed using the mel-frequency cepstral (MFCC) coefficients and their derivatives. Fusion of the MFCCs with the auditory-inspired amplitude modulation features (AAMF) is also investigated. Classification is compared between binaural and monaural training sets as well as for noisy and clean conditions. The highest accuracy is achieved at 75.45% using the GMM classifier with the binaural MFCC+AAMF clean training set. Accuracy of 73.47% is achieved by training and testing the classifier with the binaural clean and noisy dataset",

The features studied were temporal and kinematic characteristics of lip separation within the closing and opening gestures of bilabial consonants and of the tongue body movement from /i/ to /a/ through a bilabial consonant. The results indicate larger hyper-articulation in the speech elicited with visually presented target. While individual articulatory strategies are evident, the speaker groups agree on increasing the kinematic features consistently within each gesture in response to the increased vocal effort. Another concerted strategy is keeping the tongue response considerably smaller than that of the lips, presumably to preserve acoustic prerequisites necessary for the adequate vowel identity. While the method of visually presented loudness target elicits larger span of vocal effort, the two elicitation methods achieve comparable consistency per loudness conditions",

We provide an acoustic and articulatory analysis comparing younger (20-30 years old) and older speakers (70-80 years old) of German, all of them recorded with electromagnetic articulography. We analyzed target words in contrastive focus condition. In the acoustic domain, target syllables were not prolonged in the productions of the older speakers. However, when looking at the articulatory domain, we found systematic modifications: Especially vocalic gestures, requiring movements of the lingual system, showed slower peak velocities for older subjects. Furthermore, we found age-related effects on the symmetry of articulatory gestures. Older subjects produce longer deceleration and shorter acceleration phases leading to a strong asymmetry of the movement components. Variability between and across speakers were considerably higher in the group of older speakers compared to younger ones. Our results on age-related effects on speech motor control are comparable with those from general motor control, where e.g. prolonged deceleration phases are an indicator for a decrease in sensory feedback control",

Ultrasound data were collected from 5 native speakers of Eastern Oromo. Tokens consisted of 12 repetitions per speaker of [tʰ, t, d, ɗ] and six of [ttʰ, tt, dd, ɗɗ] in the environment of a_a. Tongue images at the point of maximum constriction during the stop closure were traced following Kochetov et al. (2014) and their coordinates submitted to linear mixed effects models. Results indicated differences in tongue shape between singletons and geminates, especially for ejectives and implosives. Singleton ejectives displayed raised tongue bodies not found in geminate ejectives. Singleton implosives resembled voiceless stops, but geminate implosives were variably produced with tongue body raising. I suggest that the results can be attributed to fortition in geminates. Tongue body raising in singleton ejectives may be an enhancement strategy to the ejective contrast that is not necessary in longer geminates. The singleton implosive resembling a voiceless aspirated stop is predicted by Lloret (1994) while the geminate tongue body raising may be retraction, c.f. Payne (2006). The results support a link between tongue, larynx and gemination",

    "abstract": "The speech intelligibility of cleft palate (CP) individuals is de- graded primarily due to compensatory articulation errors and hypernasality. The present work proposes a method to enhance the CP speech intelligibility, where fricatives are substituted by compensatory articulation errors. Apart from the distortion present in the sustained fricative region, the fricative-vowel and vowel-fricative regions are also deviated due to co-articulation effect. Since important perceptual cues are embedded in the transition regions. Therefore, it is necessary to enhance the transition regions for more intelligibility. Motivated by the per- ceptual significance of the transition regions, 2D-DCT based joint spectro-temporal features are exploited for the modifica- tion. The 2D-DCT coefficients of CP speech are modified by projecting them onto the singular vectors derived from the SVD analysis of normal speech. Further, for the evaluation of speech intelligibility, objective and subjective assessment is conducted. The results show significant improvement in the speech intelli- gibility of the modified speech",

    "abstract": "In this work, we propose a tracheoesophageal (TE) speech to neutral speech conversion system using data collected from a laryngectomee. In laryngectomees, in the absence of vocal folds, it is the vibration of the esophagus that gives rise to a low-frequency pitch during speech production. This pitch is manifested as impulse-like noise in the recorded speech. We propose a method to first ‘whisperize' the TE speech prior to the linear predictive coding (LPC) based synthesis which uses pitch derived from the energy contour. In order to perform ‘whisperization', we model the LPC residual signal as the sum of white noise and impulses introduced by the esophageal vibrations. We model these impulses and white noise using Bernoulli-Gaussian distribution and Gaussian distribution, respectively. The strength and location of the impulses are estimated using Gibbs sampling in order to remove the impulse-like noise from speech to obtain whispered speech. Subjective evaluation via listening test reveals that the ‘whisperization' step in the proposed method aids in synthesizing a more natural sounding neutral speech. A different listening test shows that the listeners prefer the synthesized speech from the proposed method ∼ 93% (absolute) times more than the best baseline scheme",

A typical approach to better represent realistic scenarios, is to convolve clean speech with noise and simulated room response for model training. Despite these efforts, model performance degrades when tested against uncurated speech in natural conditions. For this corpus, audio was recorded in furnished rooms with background noise played in conjunction with foreground speech selected from the LibriSpeech corpus. Multiple sessions were recorded in each room to accommodate for all foreground speech-background noise combinations.

    "abstract": "The current trend in automatic speech recognition is to leverage large amounts of labeled data to train supervised neural network models. Unfortunately, obtaining data for a wide range of domains to train robust models can be costly. However, it is relatively inexpensive to collect large amounts of unlabeled data from domains that we want the models to generalize to. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised adaptation method that learns to synthesize labeled data for the target domain from unlabeled in-domain data and labeled out-of-domain data. We first learn without supervision an interpretable latent representation of speech that encodes linguistic and nuisance factors (e.g., speaker and channel) using different latent variables. To transform a labeled out-of-domain utterance without altering its transcript, we transform the latent nuisance variables while maintaining the linguistic variables. To demonstrate our approach, we focus on a channel mismatch setting, where the domain of interest is distant conversational speech and labels are only available for close-talking speech. Our proposed method is evaluated on the AMI dataset, outperforming all baselines and bridging the gap between unadapted and in-domain models by over 77% without using any parallel data",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We investigate the use of generative adversarial networks (GANs) in speech dereverberation for robust speech recognition. GANs have been recently studied for speech enhancement to remove additive noises, but there still lacks of a work to examine their ability in speech dereverberation and the advantages of using GANs have not been fully established. In this paper, we provide deep investigations in the use of GAN-based dereverberation front-end in ASR. First, we study the effectiveness of different dereverberation networks (the generator in GAN) and find that LSTM leads a significant improvement as compared with feed-forward DNN and CNN in our dataset. Second, further adding residual connections in the deep LSTMs can boost the performance as well. Finally, we find that, for the success of GAN, it is important to update the generator and the discriminator using the same mini-batch data during training. Moreover, using reverberant spectrogram as a condition to discriminator, as suggested in previous studies, may degrade the performance. In summary, our GAN-based dereverberation front-end achieves 14%~19% relative CER reduction as compared to the baseline DNN dereverberation network when tested on a strong multi-condition training acoustic model",

    "abstract": "To improve the speech recognition accuracy under the multi-talker scenario, we propose a novel model architecture that incorporates the attention mechanism and gated convolutional network (GCN) into our previously developed permutation invariant training based multi-talker speech recognition system (PIT-ASR). The new architecture has three components: an encoding transformer, an attention module and a frame-level senone predictor. The encoding transformer first transforms a mixed speech sequence into a sequence of embedding vectors. Then the attention mechanism extracts individual context vectors from this embedding sequence for different speaker sources. Finally the predictor generates the senone posteriors for all speaker sources independently with the knowledge from the context vectors. To get better embedding representations we explore gated convolutional networks in the encoding transformer. The experimental results on the artificially mixed two-talker WSJ0 corpus show that our proposed model can reduce the word error rate (WER) by more than 15% relatively compared to our previous PIT-ASR system",

Auditory saliency is estimated via 2D auditory saliency maps which model the mechanism for allocating human auditory attention. These maps are used to weight T-F representation of speech, namely the 2D magnitude spectrum or spectrogram, prior to features extraction for ASR. Experiments on Aurora-4 corpus demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for noise-robust ASR. In multi-stream ASR, relative word error rate (WER) reduction of up to 5.3% and 4.0% are observed when comparing the multi-stream system using the proposed method with the baseline single-stream system not using T-F representation weighting and that using conventional spectral masking noise-robust technique, respectively. Combining the multi-stream system using the proposed method and the single-stream system using the conventional spectral masking technique reduces further the WER",

    "abstract": "In recent years, different studies have proposed new methods for DNN-based feature extraction and joint acoustic model training and feature learning from raw waveform for large vocabulary speech recognition. However, conventional pre-processed methods such as MFCC and PLP are still preferred in the state-of-the-art speech recognition systems as they are perceived to be more robust. Besides, the raw waveform methods - most of which are based on the time-domain signal - do not significantly outperform the conventional methods. In this paper, we propose a frequency-domain feature-learning layer which can allow acoustic model training directly from the waveform. The main distinctions from previous works are a new normalization block and a short-range constraint on the filter weights. The proposed setup achieves consistent performance improvements compared to the baseline MFCC and log-Mel features as well as other proposed time and frequency domain setups on different LVCSR tasks. Finally, based on the learned filters in our feature-learning layer, we propose a new set of analytic filters using polynomial approximation, which outperforms log-Mel filters significantly while being equally fast",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Insufficient spectral smoothing during front-end speech parametrization results in pitch-induced distortions in the short-time magnitude spectra. This, in turn, degrades the performance of an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system for high-pitched speakers. Motivated by this fact, a non-uniform spectral smoothing algorithm is proposed in this paper in order to mitigate the acoustic mismatch resulting from pitch differences. In the proposed technique, the speech utterance is first segmented into vowel and non-vowel regions. The short-time magnitude spectrum obtained by discrete Fourier transform is then processed through a single-pole low-pass filter with different pole values for vowel and non-vowel regions. Sufficiently smoothed spectra is obtained by keeping higher values for the pole in the case of vowels while lower values are chosen for non-vowel regions. The Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients computed using the derived smoothed spectra are observed to be less affected by pitch variations. In order to validate this claim, an ASR system is developed on speech from adult speakers and evaluated on a test set which consists of children's speech to simulate large pitch differences. The experimental evaluations as well as signal domain analyses presented in this paper support the claim",

Then we design a CNN-based feature representation using amplitude and phase information. Finally, experiments were conducted on EmoDB to validate the effectiveness of phase information.

Our previous work on human perception used a listening test paradigm and correlational analysis to show that some energy is more important to intelligibility than other energy. In this paper, we propose a system called the Bubble Cooperative Network (BCN), which aims to predict important areas of individual utterances directly from clean speech. Given such a prediction, noise is added to the utterance in unimportant regions and then presented to a recognizer. The BCN is trained with a loss that encourages it to add as much noise as possible while preserving recognition performance, encouraging it to identify important regions precisely and place the noise everywhere else. Empirical evaluation shows that the BCN can obscure 97.7% of the spectrogram with noise while maintaining recognition accuracy for a simple speech recognizer that compares a noisy test utterance with a clean reference utterance. The masks predicted by a single BCN on several utterances show patterns that are similar to analyses derived from human listening tests that analyze each utterance separately, while exhibiting better generalization and less context-dependence than previous approaches",

Features are extracted at the phone instance level and combined to phone-level representations using an attention mechanism. Pair-wise distances between phone features are then projected through a feed-forward layer to predict score. The extraction stage is initialised on either a binary phone instance-pair classification task, or to mimic the model-based features, then the whole system is fine-tuned end-to-end, optimising the learning of the distance metric to the score prediction task. This method is therefore more adaptable and more sensitive to phone instance level phenomena. Its performance is compared against a DNN trained on Gaussian phone model distance features",

In this work, posteriors of forty phones, instead of several thousand sub-phonemic senones, are used to circumvent the sparsity issues in NN training. Phone posteriors are assembled with their corresponding senone posteriors estimated via a speaker-independent, DNN-based acoustic model, trained with standard American English speech data (i.e., Wall Street Journal database). Phone posteriors of both reference(standard American English speaker) and test speaker are paired together as augmented input feature vectors to train an NN based, 2-class, i.e., native vs nonnative speaker, classiﬁer. The Goodness of Pronunciation (GOP), a proven effective measure, is used as the baseline for comparison. The binary NN classiﬁer trained with such features achieves a high classification accuracy of 89.6% on native and non-native speakers' data. The classiﬁer also shows a better equal error rate (EER) than the GOP-based baseline classiﬁer in either phone or word level pronunciation, i.e., at phone level from 18.3% to 6.2% and at word level from 12.98% to 2.54%",

This field draws heavily on concepts from automatic speech recognition (ASR) to quantify how close the pronunciation of non-native speech is to native-like pronunciation. However, it is known that the formation of accent is related to pronunciation patterns of both the target language (L2) and the speaker's first language (L1). In this paper, we propose to use two native speech acoustic models, one trained on L2 speech and the other trained on L1 speech. We develop two sets of measurements that can be extracted from two acoustic models given accented speech. A new utterance-level feature extraction scheme is used to convert these measurements into a fixed-dimension vector which is used as an input to a statistical model to predict the accentedness of a speaker. On a data set consisting of speakers from 4 different L1 backgrounds, we show that the proposed system yields improved correlation with human evaluators compared to systems only using the L2 acoustic model",

This form of test allows the spoken language proficiency of a non-native speaker of English to be assessed more fully than read aloud tests. As the candidate's responses are unscripted, transcription by automatic speech recognition (ASR) is essential for automated assessment. ASR will never be 100% accurate so any assessment system must seek to minimise and mitigate ASR errors. This paper considers the impact of ASR errors on the performance of free speaking test auto-marking systems. Firstly rich linguistically related features, based on part-of-speech tags from statistical parse trees, are investigated for assessment. Then, the impact of ASR errors on how well the system can detect whether a learner's answer is relevant to the question asked is evaluated. Finally, the impact that these errors may have on the ability of the system to provide detailed feedback to the learner is analysed. In particular, pronunciation and grammatical errors are considered as these are important in helping a learner to make progress. As feedback resulting from an ASR error would be highly confusing, an approach to mitigate this problem using confidence scores is also analysed",

In this paper, shadowing is introduced not to learners but to native listeners, who are asked to shadow learners' utterances. Since shadowing is as simultaneous repetition as possible, it is expected that native listeners' perceived comprehensibility can be measured objectively as smoothness of natives' shadowings. Experiments show that 1) shadowers' subjective assessment of learners' speech and that of their shadowings are highly correlated and that 2) the former is more correlated with the GOP scores of natives' shadowings than that of learners' speech.

Our study focused on ASR performance for specific grade levels (K-10) using a word identification task. Grade-specific ASR systems were evaluated, with particular attention placed on the evaluation of kindergarten-aged children (5-6 years old). Experiments included investigation of grade-specific interactions with triphone models using feature space maximum likelihood linear regression (fMLLR), vocal tract length normalization (VTLN) and subglottal resonance (SGR) normalization. Our results indicate that kindergarten ASR performs dramatically worse than even 1st grade ASR, likely due to large speech variability at that age. As such, ASR systems may require targeted evaluations on kindergarten speech rather than being evaluated under the guise of \"child ASR.\" Additionally, results show that systems trained in matched conditions on kindergarten speech may be less suitable than mismatched-grade training with 1st grade speech.

This paper focuses on a system for the assessment of reading skills, aiming to detection of a range of fluency and pronunciation errors. Naturally, reading is a prompted task and thereby the acquisition of training data for acoustic modelling should be straightforward. However, given the prominence of errors in the training set and the importance of labelling them in the transcription, a lightly supervised approach to acoustic modelling has better chances of success. A method based on weighted finite state transducers is proposed, to model specific prompt corrections, such as repetitions, substitutions and deletions, as observed in real recordings. Iterative cycles of lightly-supervised training are performed in which decoding improves the transcriptions and the derived models. Improvements are due to increasing accuracy in phone-to-sound alignment and in the training data selection. The effectiveness of the proposed methods for relabelling and acoustic modelling is assessed through experiemnts on the CHOREC corpus, in terms of sequence error rate and alignment accuracy. Improvements over the baseline of up to 60% and 23.3% respectively are observed",

We achieved this by modeling only the correct pronunciation of each individual phoneme with a one-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) trained using a set of speech attributes features, namely the manner and place of articulation. These features are extracted from a bank of pre-trained Deep Neural Network (DNN) speech attributes classifiers. The one-class SVM model classifies each phoneme production as normal (correct) or an anomaly (incorrect). We evaluated the system using both native speech with artificial errors and disordered speech collected from children with apraxia of speech and compared it with the DNN Goodness of Pronunciation (GOP) algorithm.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Automatic assessment of depression from speech signals is affected by variabilities in acoustic content and speakers. In this study, we focused on addressing these variabilities. We used a database comprised of recordings of interviews from a large number of female speakers: 735 individuals suffering from depressive (dysthymia and major depression) and anxiety disorders (generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder with or without agoraphobia) and 953 healthy individuals. Leveraging this unique and extensive database, we built an i-vector framework. In order to capture various aspects of speech signals, we used voice quality features in addition to conventional cepstral features. The features (F0, F1, F2, F3, H1-H2, H2-H4, H4-H2k, A1, A2, A3 and CPP) were inspired by a psychoacoustic model of voice quality [1]. An i-vector-based system using Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) and another using voice quality features was developed. Voice quality features performed as well as MFCCs. A score-level fusion was then used to combine these two systems, resulting in a 6% relative improvement in accuracy in comparison with the i-vector system based on MFCCs alone. The system was robust even when the duration of the utterances was shortened to 10 seconds",

    "abstract": "Speech sound disorders (SSDs) are the most prevalent type of communication disorder among preschoolers. The earlier an SSD is identified, the earlier an intervention can be provided to potentially reduce the social/academic impact of the disorder. The challenge, lies in early identification of such disorders. In this study 29 carefully selected words were produced by 165 children from 3-6 years of age. The audio recordings, were collected by parents using a mobile application /platform. \"Ground truth\" child status as 'typically developing' vs 'at risk' was based on a percentage of consonants correct-revised growth curve model. State-of-the-art speech processing/speaker recognition models were employed along with our clinical group verification framework. Results showed that text-dependent i-Vector models were superior to both text dependent and text-independent Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) for correct classification of children. Fusing individual word, i-Vector models provides insight into word and consonant groupings that are more indicative of 'at risk' child speech",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Many individuals worldwide are at risk of hearing loss due to unsafe acoustical exposure and chronic listening experience using personal audio devices. Assistive hearing devices(AHD), such as hearing-aids(HAs) and cochlear-implants(CIs) are a common choice for the restoration and rehabilitation of the auditory function. Audio sound processors in CIs and HAs operate within limits, prescribed by audiologists, not only for acceptable sound perception but also for safety reasons. Signal processing(SP) engineers follow best design practices to ensure reliable performance and incorporate necessary safety checks within the design of SP strategies to ensure safety limits are never exceeded irrespective of acoustic environments. This paper proposes a comprehensive testing and evaluation paradigm to investigate the behavior of audio devices that addresses the safety concerns in diverse acoustic conditions. This is achieved by characterizing the performance of devices with large amounts of acoustic inputs and monitoring the output behavior. The CCi-MOBILE Research-Interface(RI) (used for CI/HA research) is used in this study as the testing paradigm. Factors such as pulse-width(PW), inter-phase gap(IPG) and a number of other parameters are estimated to evaluate the impact of AHDs on hearing comfort, subjective sound quality and characterize audio devices in terms of listening perception and biological safety",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Detection of dementia requires examinations, such as blood tests and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), that can be very stressful for the patient. Previous studies proposed screenings for easy detection of dementia that utilized acoustic and language information derived from conversations between patients and medical staff. Although these studies demonstrated effectiveness in automatically detecting dementia, the tasks used were created based on neuropsychological tests. The effect of habituation on this limited variety of tasks might have a negative impact on routine dementia screening. We propose a method to detect dementia using responses to more atypical questions asked by embodied conversational agents. Through consultations with neuropsychologists, we created a total of 13 questions. The embodied conversational agent obtained answers to these questions from 24 participants (12 dementia and 12 non-dementia). We recorded their responses and extracted speech and language features. We classified the two groups (dementia/non-dementia) by a machine learning algorithm (support vector machines and logistic regression) using the extracted features. The results showed a 0.95 detection performance in the area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC). This result demonstrates that our system using atypical questions can detect dementia",

    "abstract": "Functional articulation disorder (FAD) is a speech disorder commonly found in preschoolers, negatively affecting their day-to-day communication and in the long run their psychological development. Current FAD research mainly focused on the perceptual aspects, but not other means such as acoustic and physiological analyses. The present study aimed to evaluate the different acoustic features associated with sustained vowels and continuous speech produced by children with FAD and their age-matched controls. Speech samples produced by 67 children with FAD and 30 typically developing children. Articulatory-acoustic vowel space features, including formant centralization ratio (FCR3), F1 range ratio (F1RR), F2 range ratio (F2RR) and triangular vowel space area (TVSA), were calculated using the first two formant frequencies from vowels /a/, /i/, /u/. Voice onset time (VOT) values associated with the stop consonants were also obtained. Results indicated that children with FAD exhibited articulatory undershooting with reduced range of articulatory movements, as well as poorer control over the release of oral occlusion when producing aspirated or unaspirated stops, when compared with normal counterparts. The findings support the notion that these acoustic features can be used to differentiate misarticulated speech from healthy speech and could be used to objectively classify and evaluate FAD speech",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Hypernasality refers to the perception of excessive nasal resonances in vowels and voiced consonants. Existing speech processing based approaches concentrate only on the classification of speech into normal or hypernasal, which do not give the degree of hypernasality in terms of continuous values like nasometer. Motivated by the functionality of nasometer, in this work, a method is proposed for the evaluation of hypernasality. Speech signals representing two extremely opposite cases of nasality are used to develop the acoustic models, where oral sentences (rich in vowels, stops and fricatives) of normal speakers and nasal sentences (rich in nasals and nasalized vowels) of moderate-severe hypernasal speakers represent the groups with minimum and maximum attainable degrees of nasality, respectively. The acoustic features derived from glottal activity regions are used to model the maximum and minimum nasality classes using Gaussian mixture model and deep neural network approaches. The posterior probabilities obtained for nasal sentence class are referred to as hypernasality scores. The scores show a significant correlation (p<0.01) with respect to perceptual ratings of hypernasality, provided by expert speech-language pathologists. Further, hypernasality scores are used for the detection of hypernasality and the results are compared with the nasometer based approach",

    "abstract": "Stroke is a devastating condition that affects the ability of people to communicate through speech, leading to social isolation and poor quality of life. The quantitative evaluation of speech and orofacial movements is essential for assessing the impairment and identifying treatment targets. However, to our knowledge, a tool for the automatic orofacial assessment, which considers multiple aspects of orofacial impairment (e.g., range of motion in addition to asymmetry), has not been developed for this clinical population. In this work, we tested a video-based approach for the automatic orofacial assessment in stroke survivors, combining low-cost depth sensor and face alignment algorithms for extracting facial features. Twelve patients post-stroke and 11 control subjects were evaluated during speech and non-speech tasks. By using a small feature-set representing range of motion and asymmetry of face movements, it was possible to discriminate patients post-stroke from control subjects with high accuracy (87%). Further insights on the choice of the task and face alignment algorithm are provided, demonstrating that a non-parametric approach such as SDM can provide better results. Through this work we demonstrated the feasibility of an objective tool to support clinicians in the assessment of speech and orofacial impairment post-stroke",

The conventional methods based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) use only acoustic features. However, lexical cues are essential to identify some questions such as declarative questions. To this end we propose a new RNN-based question detection model which utilizes both acoustic and lexical information. Phonetic features which are suitable to describe interrogative cues are used as lexical information. Furthermore, we also propose a new training framework named feature-wise pre-training (FP) to combine the acoustic and phonetic features effectively. FP attempts to acquire interrogative cues in individual features instead of the combination of the features, which makes the model training more stable. The estimation models of the interrogatives are then integrated and fine-tuning is applied to obtain the unified comprehensive model. Experiments show that the proposed method offers better performance than the conventional benchmarks",

    "abstract": "Natural multi-party interaction commonly involves turning one's gaze towards the speaker who has the floor. Implementing virtual agents or robots who are able to engage in natural conversations with humans therefore requires enabling machines to exhibit this form of communicative behaviour. This task is called active speaker detection. In this paper, we propose a method for active speaker detection using visual prosody (lip and head movements) information before and after speech articulation to decrease the machine response time; and also demonstrate the discriminating power of visual prosody before and after speech articulation for active speaker detection. The results show that the visual prosody information one second before articulation is helpful in detecting the active speaker. Lip movements provide better results than head movements and fusion of both improves accuracy. We have also used visual prosody information of the first second of the speech utterance and found that it provides more accurate results than one second before articulation. We conclude that the fusion of lip movements from both regions (the first one second of speech and the one second before articulation) improves the accuracy of active speaker detection",

In this talk, we will provide a historical account of ANN architectures used for ASR since the mid-1980's, and now used in most ASR and spoken language understanding applications. We will start by recalling/revisiting key links between ANNs and statistical inference, discriminant analysis, and linear/nonlinear algebra. Finally, we will briefly discuss more recent trends towards novel DNN-based ASR approaches, including complex hierarchical systems, sparse recovery modeling, and \"end-to-end systems.\" However, and in spite of the recent progress in the area, we still lack basic understanding of the problems in hands. Although more and more tools are now available, in association with basically \"unlimited\" processing and data resources, we still fail in building principled ASR models and theories. Alternatively, we are still relying on \"ignorance-based\" models, often exposing limitations of our understanding, rather than enriching the field of ASR.

However, an LSTM-RNN with too many vanilla LSTM layers is very hard to train and there still exists the gradient vanishing issue if the network goes too deep. This issue can be partially solved by adding skip connections between layers, such as residual LSTM. In this paper, we propose a layer trajectory LSTM (ltLSTM) which builds a layer-LSTM using all the layer outputs from a standard multi-layer time-LSTM. This layer-LSTM scans the outputs from time-LSTMs and uses the summarized layer trajectory information for final senone classification. The forward-propagation of time-LSTM and layer-LSTM can be handled in two separate threads in parallel so that the network computation time is the same as the standard time-LSTM. With a layer-LSTM running through layers, a gated path is provided from the output layer to the bottom layer, alleviating the gradient vanishing issue. Trained with 30 thousand hours of EN-US Microsoft internal data, the proposed ltLSTM performed significantly better than the standard multi-layer LSTM and residual LSTM, with up to 9.0% relative word error rate reduction across different tasks",

    "abstract": "Gating is a key technique used for integrating information from multiple sources by long short-term memory (LSTM) models and has recently also been applied to other models such as the highway network. Although gating is powerful, it is rather expensive in terms of both computation and storage as each gating unit uses a separate full weight matrix. This issue can be severe since several gates can be used together in e.g. an LSTM cell. This paper proposes a semi-tied unit (STU) approach to solve this efficiency issue, which uses one shared weight matrix to replace those in all the units in the same layer. The approach is termed \"semi-tied\" since extra parameters are used to separately scale each of the shared output values. These extra scaling factors are associated with the network activation functions and result in the use of parameterised sigmoid, hyperbolic tangent and rectified linear unit functions. Speech recognition experiments using British English multi-genre broadcast data showed that using STUs can reduce the calculation and storage cost by a factor of three for highway networks and four for LSTMs, while giving similar word error rates to the original models",

    "title": "Gaussian Process Neural Networks for Speech Recognition",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) play an important role in state-of-the-art speech recognition systems. One important issue associated with DNNs and artificial neural networks in general is the selection of suitable model structures, for example, the form of hidden node activation functions to use. Due to lack of automatic model selection techniques, the choice of activation functions has been largely empirically based. In addition, the use of deterministic, fixed-point parameter estimates is prone to over-fitting when given limited training data. In order to model both models' structural and parametric uncertainty, a novel form of DNN architecture using non-parametric activation functions based on Gaussian process (GP), Gaussian process neural networks (GPNN), is proposed in this paper. Initial experiments conducted on the ARPA Resource Management task suggest that the proposed GPNN acoustic models outperformed the baseline sigmoid activation based DNN by 3.40% to 24.25% relatively in terms of word error rate. Consistent performance improvements over the DNN baseline were also obtained by varying the number of hidden nodes and the number of spectral basis functions",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Motivated by recent advances in computer vision research, this paper proposes a novel acoustic model called Densely Connected Residual Network (DenseRNet) for multichannel speech recognition. This combines the strength of both DenseNet and ResNet. It adopts the basic \"building blocks\" of ResNet with different convolutional layers, receptive field sizes and growth rates as basic components that are densely connected to form socalled denseR blocks. By concatenating the feature maps of all preceding layers as inputs, DenseRNet can not only strengthen gradient back-propagation for the vanishing-gradient problem, but also exploit multi-resolution feature maps. Preliminary experimental results on CHiME 3 have shown that DenseRNet achieves a word error rate (WER) of 7.58% on beamforming-enhanced speech with six channel real test data by cross entropy criteria training while WER is 10.23% for the official baseline. Besides, additional experimental results are also presented to demonstrate that DenseRNet exhibits the robustness to beamforming-enhanced speech as well as near and far-field speech",

In this paper, we attempt to design a RNN acoustic model that being capable of utilizing the future context effectively and directly, with the model latency and computation cost as low as possible. The proposed model is based on the minimal gated recurrent unit (mGRU) with an input projection layer inserted in it. Two context modules, temporal encoding and temporal convolution, are specifically designed for this architecture to model the future context. Experimental results on the Switchboard task and an internal Mandarin ASR task show that, the proposed model performs much better than long short-term memory (LSTM) and mGRU models, whereas enables online decoding with a maximum latency of 170 ms. This model even outperforms a very strong baseline, TDNN-LSTM, with smaller model latency and almost half less parameters",

With the teacher-student network learning, the feature representation for short utterances (explored by the student network) are normalized to their representations corresponding to long utterances (provided by the teacher network).

These envelopes are then transformed into cepstral features. The proposed features are then used as a front-end to a bidirectional long short term memory recurrent neural network to identify languages. Experimental evaluations on the AP17-OLR dataset under different conditions indicate that the proposed features exhibit substantially greater robustness under different noise and mismatch conditions, compared to baseline features.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes to apply deep neural network (DNN)-based single-channel speech enhancement (SE) to language identification. The 2017 language recognition evaluation (LRE17) introduced noisy audios from videos, in addition to the telephone conversation from past challenges. Because of that, adapting models from telephone speech to noisy speech from the video domain was required to obtain optimum performance. However, such adaptation requires knowledge of the audio domain and availability of in-domain data. Instead of adaptation, we propose to use a speech enhancement step to clean up the noisy audio as preprocessing for language identification. We used a bi-directional long short-term memory (BLSTM) neural network, which given log-Mel noisy features predicts a spectral mask indicating how clean each time-frequency bin is. The noisy spectrogram is multiplied by this predicted mask to obtain the enhanced magnitude spectrogram and it is transformed back into the time domain by using the unaltered noisy speech phase. The experiments show significant improvement to language identification of noisy speech, for systems with and without domain adaptation, while preserving the identification performance in the telephone audio domain. In the best adapted state-of-the-art bottleneck i-vector system the relative improvement is 11.3% for noisy speech",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Identifying speech parameters that have both a low level of intra-speaker variability and a high level of inter-speaker variability is key when discriminating between individuals in forensic speaker comparison cases. A substantial amount of research in the field of forensic phonetics has been devoted to identifying highly discriminant speaker parameters. To this end, the vast majority of the existing literature has focused solely on vowels and constants. However, the discriminant power of speaking tempo has yet to be examined, despite its broad use in practice and it having been recognized. This paper examines, for the first time, the discriminant power of articulation rate (AR) in British English. Approximately 3000 local ARs were measured in this study for 100 Southern Standard British English male speakers. In order to assess the evidential value of AR, likelihood ratios were calculated. The results suggest that AR performs well for same speaker comparisons. However, for different speaker comparisons, the system is performing just worse than chance. Overall, it appears that AR may not be the best speaker discriminant, although it is important to still consider AR in forensic speaker comparisons as there may be some individuals for which AR is highly idiosyncratic",

This leads to different phonetic surface patterns for final falls. Within these languages, dialectal variation affects alignment and the frequency of occurrence of nuclear tunes. We test whether the differences in compression and truncation use are a stable cross-linguistic phenomenon (and occur in other varieties of English and German) or whether they are limited to the varieties tested in [1]. Here, we investigated productions of rises and falls in Australian English and Southern German in words with different proportions of sonorant material. Australian English speakers compressed rises and falls, while Southern German speakers only compressed rises but truncated falls, consistent with Grabe's findings for Southern British English and Northern German. This indicates consistent use of strategies within a language, even though the varieties under investigation display other phonetic differences from previous varieties tested. We discuss implications of these findings for automatic labelling",

Automatic assessment is, however, dependent on reliable automatic analyses of prosodic features for comparing the productions between native (L1) and L2 speech. Here we investigate, whether estimated prosodic prominence levels of syllables can be used to predict the prosodic competence of Finnish learners of Swedish. Syllable level prominence was estimated for 99 L2 and 25 native Swedish utterances using continuous wavelet transform analysis with combinations of F0, energy and duration features. The L2 utterances were assessed by four expert raters using the revised CEFR scale for prosodic features. Correlations of prominence estimates for L2 utterances with estimates for L1 utterances and linguistic stress patterns were used as a measure of prosodic proficiency of the L2 speakers. The results show that these estimates correlate significantly with the assessments of expert raters. Overall, the results provide strong support for the use of the wavelet-based prominence estimation techniques in automatic assessment of L2 proficiency",

We address this question by drawing parallels between the way gemination is implemented in spoken language and the way it is rendered in whistled speech. Audio materials were collected with five Berber whistlers in Morocco. The spoken and whistled data were composed of pairs of words contrasting singletons to geminates in different word positions. Compared to spoken forms, whistling, while adapting to the specific constraints imposed by the medium, transposes the basic strategies used in normal speech. As in normal speech, the primary and most salient acoustic attribute differentiating whistled singletons and geminates is closure duration. But duration is not used alone. Covarying secondary attributes are conveyed which may serve to enhance the primary correlate by contributing additional properties increasing the distance between the two lexical categories. These enhancing correlates may take on distinctive function in cases where the primary correlate is not implemented. This is, for instance, the case of higher frequency values in word-initial position where duration differences cannot be acoustically implemented using whistled speech",

Results showed a consistent pattern of accenting the initial content word in the sentence, supporting an analysis of prenuclear accent as structural, or ‘rhythmic'. While no association was observed between IS and accent type (e.g., H*, L*, L+H*, L*+H), the acoustic-phonetic realization of prominence was modulated by information structure. In particular, words that carry contrastive focus generally showed more extreme f0 excursions relative to the average. In addition, there was a strong influence of speaking style or ‘affect' on both pitch accent type and the acoustic-phonetic realization of prominence. Speakers were more likely to produce L+H* accents in a lively than a neutral speaking style. Differences in affect were also strongly reflected in f0 excursion, duration and amplitude within the target word.

However since intelligibility tests are commonly conducted using monaurally recorded signals, the intelligibility is often underestimated compared to live human listeners since this segregation capability is neglected. We have previously proposed to use binaurally recorded signals to estimate the speech intelligibility and compared the estimation accuracy of several machine learning methods on this signal. We showed that random forests (RF) combined with the better ear model and Mel filter banks gives the highest accuracy compared to other methods, such as the support vector machines or logistic regression.

    "abstract": "Low speech intelligibility in noisy listening conditions makes more difficult our communication with others. Various strategies have been suggested to modify a speech signal before it is presented in a noisy listening environment with the goal to increase its intelligibility. A state-of-the art approach, referred to as Spectral Shaping and Dynamic Range Compression (SSDRC), relies on modifying spectral and temporal structure of the clean speech and has been shown to considerably improve the intelligibility of speech in noisy listening conditions. In this paper, we present a non-causal Wavenet-like model for mapping clean speech samples to samples generated by SSDRC. A successful non-linear mapping function has the potential to be used a) in improving the intelligibility of noisy speech and b) in the Wavenet-based speech synthesizers as a model based intelligibility improvement layer. Objective and subjective results show that the Wavenet-based mapping function is able to reproduce the intelligibility gains of SSDRC, while by far it improves the quality of the modified signal compared to the quality obtained by SSDRC",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Nowadays, most of the objective speech quality assessment tools (e.g., perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ)) are based on the comparison of the degraded/processed speech with its clean counterpart. The need of a \"golden\" reference considerably restricts the practicality of such assessment tools in real-world scenarios since the clean reference usually cannot be accessed. On the other hand, human beings can readily evaluate the speech quality without any reference (e.g., mean opinion score (MOS) tests), implying the existence of an objective and non-intrusive (no clean reference needed) quality assessment mechanism. In this study, we propose a novel end-to-end, non-intrusive speech quality evaluation model, termed Quality-Net, based on bidirectional long short-term memory. The evaluation of utterance-level quality in Quality-Net is based on the frame-level assessment. Frame constraints and sensible initializations of forget gate biases are applied to learn meaningful frame-level quality assessment from the utterance-level quality label. Experimental results show that Quality-Net can yield high correlation to PESQ (0.9 for the noisy speech and 0.84 for the speech processed by speech enhancement). We believe that Quality-Net has potential to be used in a wide variety of applications of speech signal processing",

    "abstract": "This paper demonstrates two novel methods to estimate the global SNR of speech signals. In both methods, Deep Neural Network-Hidden Markov Model (DNN-HMM) acoustic model used in speech recognition systems is leveraged for the additional task of SNR estimation. In the first method, SNR is estimated using the entropy of the posterior distribution obtained from DNN of an ASR system. Recent work on bayesian deep learning has shown that a DNN-HMM trained with dropout can be used to estimate model uncertainty by approximating it as a deep Gaussian process. In the second method, this approximation is used to obtain model uncertainty estimates. Noise specific regressors are used to predict the SNR from the entropy and model uncertainty. The DNN-HMM is trained on GRID corpus and tested on different noise profiles from the DEMAND noise database at SNR levels ranging from -10 dB to 30 dB",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "One of the main quality impairments in today's packet-based voice services are interruptions caused by transmission errors. Therefore, most codecs comprise concealment algorithms that attempt to reduce the perceived quality degradation of missing speech packets. In case the algorithm fails to properly synthesize the lost speech, interruptions or unnatural sounds are usually perceivable by the user. When measuring the quality of a voice network, there are excellent tools available, which can predict the perceived speech quality. However, they offer only little insight into the technical cause of a quality degradation. A packet-loss detection model could explain the influence of transmission errors on the speech quality and state a packet-loss rate. Thus, making it easier to identify technical problems in the network. In this paper, we examine a new approach for detecting (perceived) packet-loss of transmitted speech by audio analysis. After finding a lost packet, the model classifies in a second stage if the loss was perceivable as a quality degradation. In the model, we use meaningful features that are easy to interpret and obtained promising results in a simulated environment. Therefore, this detector could also be used to evaluate new packet-loss concealment algorithms and help in optimizing the same",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recent approaches to word vector representations, e.g., ‘w2vec' and ‘GloVe', have been shown to be powerful methods for capturing the semantics and syntax of words in a text. The approaches model the co-occurrences of words and recent successful applications on written text have shown how the vector representations and their interrelations represent the meaning or sentiment in the text. Most applications have targeted written language, however, in this paper, we investigate how these models port to the spoken language domain where the text is the result of (erroneous) automatic speech transcription. In particular, we are interested in the task of detecting signs of dementia in a person's spoken language. This is motivated by the fact that early signs of dementia are known to affect a person's ability to express meaning articulately for example when they engage in a conversation – something which is known to be cognitively very demanding. We analyse conversations designed to probe people's short and long-term memory and propose three different methods for how word vectors may be used in a classification setup. We show that it is possible to identify dementia from the output of a speech recogniser despite a high occurrence of recognition errors",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Bipolar Disorder is a chronic psychiatric illness characterized by pathological mood swings associated with severe disruptions in emotion regulation. Clinical monitoring of mood is key to the care of these dynamic and incapacitating mood states. Frequent and detailed monitoring improves clinical sensitivity to detect mood state changes, but typically requires costly and limited resources. Speech characteristics change during both depressed and manic states, suggesting automatic methods applied to the speech signal can be effectively used to monitor mood state changes. However, speech is modulated by many factors, which renders mood state prediction challenging. We hypothesize that emotion can be used as an intermediary step to improve mood state prediction. This paper presents critical steps in developing this pipeline, including (1) a new in the wild emotion dataset, the PRIORI Emotion Dataset, collected from everyday smartphone conversational speech recordings, (2) activation/valence emotion recognition baselines on this dataset (PCC of 0.71 and 0.41, respectively) and (3) significant correlation between predicted emotion and mood state for individuals with bipolar disorder.

A speech dataset was collected from thirteen newly diagnosed patients with ALS and thirteen age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), including time-domain CNN and frequency-domain CNN, were used to classify the intelligible speech produced by patients with ALS and those by healthy individuals. Experimental results indicated both time- and frequency-CNN outperformed standard neural network. The best sample-level sensitivity and specificity were obtained by time-CNN (71.6% and 80.9%, respectively).

We consider an interesting and widely encountered variety of code-switched speech in the form of public discourses by a popular motivational speaker who uses English, probably for effect, in her Hindi language speeches. We effectively observe three categories of segments in the discourse: Hindi, Hindi with embedded English words and English. In this work, we present the characteristics of our data and investigate the discrimination potential of lexical and prosodic cues on manually segmented fragments.

The interpolation of multiple language models trained on these language pairs enables the ASR system to hypothesize mixed word sequences from these 5 languages.

In previous work, we have proposed several automatic transcription strategies for CS speech to increase the amount of available training speech data. In this work, we explore how the acoustic modeling (AM) can benefit from monolingual speech data belonging to the high-resourced mixed language. For this purpose, we train state-of-the-art AMs, which were ineffective due to lack of training data, on a significantly increased amount of CS speech and monolingual Dutch speech. Moreover, we improve the language model (LM) by creating code-switching text, which is in practice almost non-existent, by (1) generating text using recurrent LMs trained on the transcriptions of the training CS speech data, (2) adding the transcriptions of the automatically transcribed CS speech data and (3) translating Dutch text extracted from the transcriptions of a large Dutch speech corpora.

In order to test these hypotheses, we built a lexical database of cognate pairs for English Spanish. Using statistical significance tests on a corpus of conversational code-switched English Spanish, we found that a) there is strong statistical evidence that cognates and switches occur simultaneously in the same utterance and that cognates facilitate switching when they precede a code-switch, b) there is strong statistical evidence of the relationship between part-of-speech tags and code-switching and c) speakers tend to show converging entrainment behavior with respect to their rate of code-switching in conversation",

In this work, we automatically identify and disambiguate homophones in code-switched data to improve recognition of code-switched speech. We use a WX-based common pronunciation scheme for both languages being mixed and unify the homophones during training, which results in a lower word error rate for systems built using this data. We also extend this framework to propose a metric for code-switched speech recognition that takes into account homophones in both languages while calculating WER, which can help provide a more accurate picture of errors the ASR system makes on code-switched speech",

The objective of this work is to train good quality text-to-speech (TTS) synthesisers that can seamlessly handle code-switching. To achieve this, bilingual TTSes that are capable of handling phonotactic variations across languages are trained using combinations of monolingual data in a unified framework. In addition to segmenting Indic speech data using signal processing cues in tandem with hidden Markov model-deep neural network (HMM-DNN), we propose to segment Indian English data using the same approach after NIST syllabification. Then, bilingual HTS-STRAIGHT based systems are trained by randomizing the order of data so that the systematic interactions between the two languages are captured better. Experiments are conducted by considering three language pairs: Hindi+English, Tamil+English and Hindi+Tamil. The code-switched systems are evaluated on monolingual, code-mixed and code-switched texts.

Code-switching is a global phenomenon and is widely accepted in multilingual communities.

In this work, we present an approach to reduce the perplexity (PPL) of Hindi-English code-switched data when tested over the LM trained on purely native Hindi data. For this purpose, we propose a novel textual feature which allows the LM to predict the code-switching instances. The proposed feature is referred to as code-switching factor (CS-factor). Also, we developed a tagger that facilitates the automatic tagging of the code-switching instances. This tagger is trained on a development data and assigns an equivalent class of foreign (English) words to each of the potential native (Hindi) words. For this study, the textual resource has been created by crawling the blogs from a couple of websites educating about the usage of the Internet.

    "abstract": "In the non-parallel Voice Conversion (VC) with the Iterative combination of Nearest Neighbor search step and Conversion step Alignment (INCA) algorithm, the occurrence of one-to-many and many-to-one pairs in the training data will deteriorate the performance of the stand-alone VC system. The work on handling these pairs during the training is less explored. In this paper, we establish the relationship via intermediate speaker-independent posteriorgram representation, instead of directly mapping the source spectrum to the target spectrum. To that effect, a Deep Neural Network (DNN) is used to map the source spectrum to posteriorgram representation and another DNN is used to map this posteriorgram representation to the target speaker's spectrum. In this paper, we propose to use unsupervised Vocal Tract Length Normalization (VTLN)-based warped Gaussian posteriorgram features as the speaker-independent representations. We performed experiments on a small subset of publicly available Voice Conversion Challenge (VCC) 2016 database. We obtain the lower Mel Cepstral Distortion (MCD) values with the proposed approach compared to the baseline as well as the supervised phonetic posteriorgram feature-based speaker-independent representations. Furthermore, subjective evaluation gave relative improvement of 13.3% with the proposed approach in terms of Speaker Similarity (SS)",

We first train a multi-speaker SampleRNN model conditioned on linguistic features, pitch contour and speaker identity using a multi-speaker speech corpus. Voice-converted speech is generated using linguistic features and pitch contour extracted from the source speaker and the target speaker identity.

    "abstract": "A voice conversion system typically consists of two modules, the feature conversion module that is followed by a vocoder. The exemplar-based sparse representation marks a success in feature conversion when we only have a very limited amount of training data. While parametric vocoder is generally designed to simulate the mechanics of the human speech generation process under certain simplification assumptions, it doesn't work consistently well for all target applications. In this paper, we study two effective ways to make use of the limited amount of training data for voice conversion. Firstly, we study a novel technique for sparse representation that augments the spectral features with phonetic information, or Tandem Feature. Secondly, we study the use of WaveNet vocoder that can be trained on multi-speaker and target speaker data to improve the vocoding quality. We evaluate that the proposed strategy with Tandem Feature and WaveNet vocoder and show that it provides performance improvement consistently over the traditional sparse representations framework in objective and subjective evaluations",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the approaches of building WaveNet vocoders with limited training data for voice conversion (VC). Current VC systems using statistical acoustic models always suffer from the quality degradation of converted speech. One of the major causes is the use of hand-crafted vocoders for waveform generation. Recently, with the emergence of WaveNet for waveform modeling, speaker-dependent WaveNet vocoders have been proposed and they can reconstruct speech with better quality than conventional vocoders, such as STRAIGHT. Because training a WaveNet vocoder in the speaker-dependent way requires a relatively large training dataset, it remains a challenge to build a high-quality WaveNet vocoder for VC tasks when the training data of target speakers is limited. In this paper, we propose to build WaveNet vocoders by combining the initialization using a multi-speaker corpus and the adaptation using a small amount of target data and evaluate this proposed method on the Voice Conversion Challenge (VCC) 2018 dataset which contains approximately 5 minute recordings for each target speaker. Experimental results show that the WaveNet vocoders built using our proposed method outperform conventional STRAIGHT vocoder. Furthermore, our system achieves an average naturalness MOS of 4.13 in VCC 2018, which is the highest among all submitted systems",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a technique to alleviate the quality degradation caused by collapsed speech segments sometimes generated by the WaveNet vocoder. The effectiveness of the WaveNet vocoder for generating natural speech from acoustic features has been proved in recent works. However, it sometimes generates very noisy speech with collapsed speech segments when only a limited amount of training data is available or significant acoustic mismatches exist between the training and testing data. Such a limitation on the corpus and limited ability of the model can easily occur in some speech generation applications, such as voice conversion and speech enhancement. To address this problem, we propose a technique to automatically detect collapsed speech segments. Moreover, to refine the detected segments, we also propose a waveform generation technique for WaveNet using a linear predictive coding constraint. Verification and subjective tests are conducted to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques. The verification results indicate that the detection technique can detect most collapsed segments. The subjective evaluations of voice conversion demonstrate that the generation technique significantly improves the speech quality while maintaining the same speaker similarity",

    "abstract": "During the 2000s decade, unit-selection based text-to-speech was the dominant commercial technology. Meanwhile, the TTS research community has made a big effort to push statistical-parametric speech synthesis to get similar quality and more flexibility on the generated voice. During last years, deep learning advances applied to speech synthesis have filled the gap, specially when neural vocoders substitute traditional signal-processing based vocoders. In this paper we substitute the waveform generation vocoder of MUSA, our Spanish TTS, with SampleRNN, a neural vocoder which was recently proposed as a deep autoregressive raw waveform generation model. MUSA uses recurrent neural networks to predict vocoder parameters (MFCC and logF0) from linguistic features. Then, the Ahocoder vocoder is used to recover the speech waveform out of the predicted parameters. In the first system SampleRNN is extended to generate speech conditioned on the Ahocoder generated parameters, where two configurations have been considered to train the system. First, the parameters derived from the signal using Ahocoder are used. Secondly, the system is trained with the parameters predicted by MUSA, where SampleRNN and MUSA are jointly optimized. The subjective evaluation shows that the second system outperforms both the original Ahocoder and SampleRNN as an independent neural vocoder",

With the advancement of statistical methods of waveform generation, there have been experiments with more noisy and often much larger datasets, testing the inherent flexibility of such systems. In this paper we examine the relationship between training data and speech synthesis quality. We then hypothesise that statistical text-to-speech benefits from high acoustic quality corpora with high level of prosodic variation, but that beyond the first few hours of training data we do not observe quality gains. We then describe how we engineered a training dataset containing optimized distribution of features and how these features were defined. Lastly, we present results from a series of evaluation tests. These confirm our hypothesis and show how a carefully engineered training corpus of a smaller size yields the same speech quality as much larger datasets, particularly for voices that use WaveNet",

These models have been shown to improve the generated speech quality over classical vocoders in many tasks, such as text-to-speech synthesis and voice conversion. Furthermore, conditioning WaveNets with acoustic features allows sharing the waveform generator model across multiple speakers without additional speaker codes. However, multi-speaker WaveNet models require large amounts of training data and computation to cover the entire acoustic space. This paper proposes leveraging the source-filter model of speech production to more effectively train a speaker-independent waveform generator with limited resources.

Such deep neural network-based models can generate highly realistic speech but at high computational and memory costs. We propose here a novel neural glottal vocoder which tends to bridge the gap between the traditional parametric vocoder and end-to-end speech sample generation. In the analysis, speech signals are decomposed into corresponding glottal source signals and vocal tract filters by the glottal inverse filtering. Glottal pulses are parameterized into energy, DCT coefficients (shape) and phase. The phase trajectory of successive glottal pulses is rendered with a trainable weighting matrix to keep a smooth pitch synchronous phase trajectory. We design a hybrid, i.e., both feed-forward and recurrent, neural network to reconstruct the glottal waveform including the optimized weighting matrix. Speech is then synthesized by filtering the generated glottal waveform with the vocal tract filter. The new neural glottal vocoder can generate high-quality speech with efficient computations. Subjective tests show that it gets an MOS score of 4.12 and 75% preference over the conventional glottal vocoder with a perceived quality comparable to WaveNet and natural recording in analysis-by-synthesis",

Most previous work on hybrid unit selection waveform generation relies on phonetic annotation for determining unit boundaries, or for specifying target cost, or for candidate preselection. In contrast, our waveform generator requires no phonetic information, annotation, or alignment. Unit boundaries are determined by epochs and spectral analysis provides representations which are compared directly with target features at runtime. As in unit selection, we minimise a combination of target cost and join cost, but find that greedy left-to-right nearest-neighbour search gives similar results to dynamic programming.

One of the proposed variants, FVN (Frequency domain Velvet Noise) applies the procedure to generate a velvet noise on the cyclic frequency domain of DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform). Then, by smoothing the generated signal to design the phase of an all-pass filter followed by inverse Fourier transform yields the proposed FVN. Temporally variable frequency weighted mixing of FVN generated by frozen and shuffled random number provides a unified excitation signal which can span from random noise to a repetitive pulse train.

In this work, we propose using play duration cues to learn a matrix factorization based collaborative filtering model. We first binarize play durations to obtain implicit positive and negative affinity labels. The Bayesian Personalized Ranking objective and learning algorithm are employed in our low-rank matrix factorization approach. To cope with uncertainties in the implicit affinity labels, we propose to apply a weighting function that emphasizes the importance of high confidence samples. Based on a large-scale database of Alexa music service records, we evaluate the affinity models by computing Spearman correlation between play durations and predicted affinities. Comparing different data utilizations and weighting functions, we find that employing both positive and negative affinity samples with a convex weighting function yields the best performance.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Traditionally systems for term extraction use a two stage approach of first identifying candiate terms and the scoring them in a second process for identifying actual terms. Thus, research in this field has often mainly focused on refining and improving the scoring process of term candidates, which commonly are identified using linguistic and statistical features. Machine learning techniques and especially neural networks are currently only used in the second stage, that is to score candidates and classify them. In contrast to that we have built a system that identifies terms via directly performing sequence-labeling with a BILOU scheme on word sequences. To do so we have worked with different kinds of recurrent neural networks and word embeddings. In this paper we describe how one can built a state-of-the-art term extraction systems with this single-stage technique and compare different network types and topologies and also examine the influence of the type of input embedding used for the task. We further investigated which network types and topologies are best suited when applying our term extraction systems to other domains than that of the training data of the networks",

We consider the scenario in which a large amount of transcripts are available and we would like to extract some semantic information from them; however, only a small number of transcripts have been labeled with this information. We present a method for leveraging the unlabeled data to learn a better model than could be learned from the labeled data alone. First, a recurrent neural network (RNN) encoder-decoder is trained on the task of predicting nearby turns on the full dialogue corpus; next, the RNN encoder is reused as a feature representation for the supervised learning problem. While previous work has explored the use of pre-training for non-dialogue corpora, our method is specifically geared toward the dialogue use case. We demonstrate an improvement on a clinical documentation task, particularly in the regime of small amounts of labeled data. We compare several types of encoders, both in the context of a classification task and in a human-evaluation of their learned representations. We show that our method significantly improves the classification task in the case where only a small amount of labeled data is available",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Autocorrelation functions (ACF) have been used in various pitch detection algorithms (PDA) and voicing-feature based speech activity detection (SAD) techniques. Speech is assumed to be stationary over a short-term window and a Hanning window is typically applied in the calculation of ACF. As a result of windowing, the ACF tapers as the autocorrelation lags increase. Boersma demonstrated that the tapering effect could be compensated for by dividing the ACF of the windowed signal by the autocorrelation of the windowing function itself, referred to as wACF hereafter. We recently found that wACF could cause overcompensation and therefore, result in errors in pitch detection. In this paper, a novel normalization method, eACF, is proposed that can both mitigate the tapering effect and minimize the overcompensation. The new method is evaluated on synthetic speech and on the TIMIT database with various types of additive noise at different signal-to-noise (SNR) ratios. The results show that the new method leads to better performance both in terms of pitch detection and speech activity detection. In this paper, we also investigate the scenarios where applying the wACF method is advantageous and where it is not",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Estimating the vocal tract length (VTL), given the acoustic signal of a vowel sound, is an important problem, which is useful in speaker normalization for vowel recognition, in the inversion problem and in acoustic-phonetic studies. The common approach of using the formant data to estimate VTL works for a neutral vowel approximating a uniform tube. However, for natural vowels, formant data shift considerably away from the resonant frequencies of a uniform tube. The proposed method is motivated from these observations: (a) the frequency of a spectral valley, F_v, depends inversely on VTL; (b) there is much smaller shift in F_v, across vowels, from the corresponding valley frequency of a uniform tube; (c) F_v can be estimated from the spectral envelope itself. VTL has been estimated for the Peterson and Barney (33 male and 28 female speakers) and the TIMIT (326 male and 136 female speakers) databases. When the estimated F_v is used for normalization, the spread in the formant data due to gender differences is considerably reduced. The normalization procedure is vowel and speaker intrinsic. Additionally, we report applications such as Front/Back classification, gender recognition and phonetic feature mapping",

In our datasets, the performance of CNN+RNN is evaluated and compared with standard convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The experimental results show that hybrid CNN+RNN architecture is beneficial for learning long-term patterns in spectrogram exhibited by koalas' calls in unseen conditions.

    "abstract": "Co-channel speech contain significant amounts of overlap in which the intelligibility and quality of the desired speech can be degraded. Convolutive Non-negative Matrix Factorization (CNMF) has been shown to be a successful approach in detecting overlap by extracting specific acoustic basis dimensions for each speaker from an audio stream. While the results of CNMF have been successful, it requires isolated single speech recordings for each speaker to derive their corresponding bases functions/dimensions. In our previous work, Teager-Kaiser Energy Operator (TEO)-based Pyknogram has been introduced. In this study, Pyknogram and CNMF based solutions for overlap detection within audio streams have been examined using the GRID dataset. TEO-based Pyknogram is shown to achieve a relative 8-10% lower Equal Error Rate (EER) compared to CNMF features. In addition, a secondary evaluation was also performed based on naturalistic audio streams with overlap. Specifically, we collected a real-world audio database of US Presidential debates stemming from the last 12 years that are very challenging due to various forms of overlaps, changing Signal to Interference Ratio (SIR) and, environmental noise among others. Our experiments indicate that TEO-based Pyknogram is well suited for detecting overlap in challenging real world scenarios such as the US presidential debates",

This learned pooling takes into account the inter feature-map correlations which are ignored in traditional max-pooling. This helps in learning a pooling function which aggregates the complementary information in various feature maps, leading to better bird activity detection. Experimental observations confirm this hypothesis. The performance of the proposed all-conv net is evaluated on the BAD Challenge 2017 dataset.

    "abstract": "In this paper, a deep convex matrix factorization framework is proposed for bioacoustics classification. Archetypal analysis, a form of convex non-negative matrix factorization, is used for acoustic modelling at each level of this framework. At first level, the input feature matrix is factorized into an archetypal dictionary and corresponding convex representations. The representation matrix obtained at the first level is further factorized into a dictionary and convex representations at second level. This hierarchical factorization continues until a desired depth is achieved. We observe that the dictionaries at different levels model complimentary information present in the data. The atoms of the dictionary learned at the first layer lie on convex hull of the data, thus try to model the extremal behaviour. On the contrary, atoms of the deeper dictionaries lie on the convex hull as well as inside the convex hull. Hence, these dictionaries can simultaneously model the extremal and average behaviour of the data. The convex representations obtained from these deeper dictionaries are referred as deep convex representations. Due to inherent sparsity, they result in efficient classification performance. Through experiments on two available bioacoustics datasets, we show that the proposed approach yield comparable or better results than state-of-art approaches",

    "abstract": "A technique, suitable for real-time processing, is presented for detection of glottal excitation epochs in voiced speech. It uses Hilbert envelope to enhance saliency of the glottal excitation epochs and to reduce the ripples due to the vocal tract filter. The processing comprises the steps of dynamic range compression, calculation of the Hilbert envelope and epoch marking. The first step reduces amplitude variation by applying A-law on the signal envelope. The second step calculates the Hilbert envelope using the output of an FIR filter-based Hilbert transformer and the delay-compensated signal. The third step uses a dynamic peak detector with fast rise and slow fall and nonlinear smoothing using a two-step median-mean filter to further enhance the saliency of the epochs, followed by a differentiator to mark them. The technique is tested using the CMU-ARCTIC database with simultaneously recorded speech and EGG signals. The results showed a good match in the performance of the proposed technique with those of the state-of-the-art techniques and its robustness against highpass filtering.

The results suggest that the simple two dimensional representation of tones: pitch target height and contour slope, is not able to capture context dependent variations of tonal contour within and across tone categories. In addition, the shape and timing of pitch target are also crucial both in differentiating tonal categories and explaining variations associated with syllable structure. The third and fourth dimension of the functional basis have been shown to be able to represent these higher-order properties. Thus FPCA can provide a compact yet interpretable low dimension representation for the tonal property of Thai.

However, the choice of the number of subbands and subband center frequencies for a given frequency range has been essentially empirical in the literature. Moreover, correlation of subband signals may not produce distinct peaks for feature extraction. This paper proposes a novel frequency coverage metric to calculate the required number of subbands. It also presents a new subband encoding model for correlation processing, inspired by psychoacoustic studies and statistical analysis.

Existing epoch extraction algorithms are capable of accurately extracting epoch information from clean speech signals.

The present work is focused on improving the performance of epoch extraction from telephonic speech signals by exploiting the properties of Chebyshev polynomial interpolation and by reinforcing the frequency components around the fundamental frequency through the Hilbert envelope (HE). The proposed algorithm brings a refinement of the existing Zero Frequency Filtering (ZFF) method by incorporating Chebyshev interpolation. The proposed refinements to the ZFF algorithm confirmed to provide improved epoch identification rate, identification accuracy, reduced miss rate and false alarm rate. The epoch identification rate of the proposed method is observed to be better than existing methods like Dynamic Programming Phase Slope Algorithm (DYPSA), Speech Event Detection using the Residual Excitation And a Mean-based Signal (SEDREAMS), Dynamic Plosion Index (DPI) and Single Pole Filtering (SPF) methods for telephonic speech quality",

However, there is a gap between the controlled and detailed study of the individual effects between syntax and prosody and the large-scale application of prosody in syntactic parsing with only a shallow analysis of the respective influences. In this paper, we close the gap by investigating the significance of correlations of prosodic realization with specific syntactic functions using linear mixed effects models in a very large corpus of read-out German encyclopedic texts. Using this corpus, we are able to analyze prosodic structuring performed by a diverse set of speakers while they try to optimize factual content delivery.

We use a model for automatic prosodic analysis of spoken free verse poetry which uses deep hierarchical attention networks to integrate the source text and audio and predict the assigned class. We then analyze and fine-tune the model with a particular focus on enjambments and in two ways: we drill down on classification performance by analyzing whether the model focuses on similar traits of poems as humans would, specifically, whether it internally builds a notion of enjambment. We find that our model is similarly good as humans in finding enjambments; however, when we employ the model for classifying enjambment-dominated poem types, it does not pay particular attention to those lines. Adding enjambment labels to the training only marginally improves performance, indicating that all other lines are similarly informative for the model",

However, the sub-category of information status on the lexical level exhibits no such effect. Besides, the given information of proper nouns and personal pronouns on the lexical level can attract stresses.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "This paper presents an acoustic-prosodic analysis of entrainment in a Portuguese map-task corpus. Our aim is to analyze how turn-by-turn entrainment varies with distinct structural metadata events: types of sentence-like units (SU) in consecutive turns (e.g. interrogatives followed by declaratives, or both declaratives) and with the presence of discourse markers, affirmative cue words and disfluencies in the beginning of turns. Entrainment at turn-exchanges may be observed in terms of pitch, energy, duration and voice quality. Regarding SU types, question-answer turns are the ones with stronger similarity and declarative-interrogative pairs are the ones where less entrainment occurs, as expected. Moreover, in question-answer pairs, there is also stronger evidence of entrainment with Yes/No and Tag questions than with Wh-questions. In fact, these subtypes are coded in distinctive prosodic ways (moreover, the first subtype has no associated lexical-syntactic cues in Portuguese, only prosodic). As for turn-initial structures, entrainment is stronger when the second turn begins with an affirmative cue word; less strong with ambiguous structures (such as ‘OK'), emphatic affirmative answers and negative answers; and scarce with disfluencies and discourse markers. The different degrees of local entrainment may be related with the informative structure of distinct structural metadata events",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "This study presents formant data for six speakers of Arrernte, a language of central Australia. The focus of the study is the (marginal) phonemic contrast between two sets of apical consonants: alveolar and retroflex. The apical contrast is studied for the stop, nasal and lateral manners of articulation: /t ʈ/, /n ɳ/ and /l ɭ/. The apical consonants are examined both in strong prosodic context (preceding a stressed vowel) and in weak prosodic context (preceding an unstressed vowel). Formant data are sampled 10 ms before the onset of the consonant and 10 ms after the offset of the consonant. Results show no differences in F2 or F4 in the various conditions studied and results for F1 show differences between obstruents and sonorants. F3 is lower at consonant onset than consonant offset for retroflex stops in the weak prosodic context and to a lesser extent for retroflex stops in the strong prosodic context; it is also lower for laterals in the weak prosodic context. Other effects on F3 suggest that the apical contrast is most clearly realized for the stop manner of articulation",

Patterns of F0 and intensity of learners are compared to that of native using a proposed metric - a weighted distance - in which the error around the high values of prosodic features have more weight in the computation of the final distance. Gold-standard native references are built using the k-means clustering algorithm. Therefore, we also propose a data-driven criterion called weighted variance based on the weighted similarity within the whole set of native utterances to determine the optimal number of clusters k. In comparison with baseline contour comparison metrics which resulted in a subjective-objective score correlation of 0.278, our method combining the proposed metric and criterion led to a final subjective-objective score correlation of 0.304. In comparison, subjective scores correlated at 0.480",

    "abstract": "We present an exploratory analysis of several long-term distributional measures of f0 range in the speech of university-educated speakers of Indian English from four L1 backgrounds (Telugu, Tamil, Hindi and Bengali). The aim of this study is to investigate the degree of homogeneity in Indian English prosody and any similarities between the speakers' productions in English and their L1. Following recent studies, we examine three aspects of f0 range: pitch level (relative height of habitual f0), pitch span and pitch dynamism. Overall, across varieties, pitch level measures reveal individual speaker differences and only weak L1 effects on max f0 and median f0. Some speakers show higher f0 in their L1 productions compared to their English productions. More robust patterns were found for pitch span and dynamism: for all measures (maximum-minimum f0, pitch dynamism quotient and standard deviation), significant differences were found between L1 and English (p<0.001) for Bengali and Telugu L1 speakers. The relative weakness of L1 effects would suggest a degree of homogeneity in Indian English, at least for the prosodic parameters investigated. Evidence of a shift in pitch span when talking in English, regardless of L1, further suggests a convergent speech variety",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Congenital amusia, which is a neurogenetic disorder affecting musical pitch processing, was found recently to affect not only human speech perception, but also emotional perception. Since previous studies only examined participants with non-tonal languages, they cannot easily generalize the finding to people with tonal language background, due to the fact that those people utilize pitch cues much more heavily in daily communication compared with others. To make clear the doubt, this paper investigates emotional prosody perception of Mandarin speakers with congenital amusia. We tried to recruit 19 amusics and matched control group of similar number of normal speakers and carried out emotional perception experiments in which speech and non-speech stimuli with six kinds of emotions were used, including happy, sad, fear, angry, surprise and neutral. Results showed that the amusics performed significantly worse than matched controls. This indicated that tone-language expertise cannot compensate for pitch deficits in amusia for emotional perception. Further analyses demonstrated that there was a positive correlation between emotion prosody performance and pitch perceptional ability. These findings further support previous hypothesis that music and language share cognitive and neural resources and provide a new perspective on the proposition of the relation between music and language",

    "abstract": "Speech processing technologies have seen tremendous progress since the advent of deep learning, where the most challenging problems no longer seem out of reach. In parallel, deep learning has advanced the state-of-the-art in processing the neural signals to speech in the human brain. This talk reports progress in three important areas of research: I) Decoding (reconstructing) speech from the human auditory cortex to establish a direct interface with the brain. Such an interface not only can restore communication for paralyzed patients, but also has the potential to transform human-computer interaction technologies, II) Auditory Attention Decoding, which aims to create a mind-controlled hearing aid that can track the brain-waves of a listener to identify and amplify the voice of the attended speaker in a crowd. Such a device could help hearing-impaired listeners communicate more effortlessly with others in noisy environments, and III) More accurate models of the transformations that the brain applies to speech at different stages of the human auditory pathway. This is achieved by training deep neural networks to learn the mapping from sound to the neural responses. Using a novel method to study the exact function learned by these neural networks has led to new insights on how the human brain processes speech. On the other hand, these new insights motivate distinct computational properties that can be incorporated into the neural network models to better capture the properties of speech processing in the human auditory cortex",

    "abstract": "The standard framework for developing an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system is to generate training and development data for building the system and evaluation data for the final performance analysis. All the data is assumed to come from the domain of interest. Though this framework is matched to some tasks, it is more challenging for systems that are required to operate over broad domains, or where the ability to collect the required data is limited. This paper discusses ASR work performed under the IARPA MATERIAL program, which is aimed at cross-language information retrieval and examines this challenging scenario. In terms of available data, only limited narrow-band conversational telephone speech data was provided. However, the system is required to operate over a range of domains, including broadcast data. As no data is available for the broadcast domain, this paper proposes an approach for system development based on scraping \"related\" data from the web and using ASR system confidence scores as the primary metric for developing the acoustic and language model components. As an initial evaluation of the approach, the Swahili development language is used, with the final system performance assessed on the IARPA MATERIAL Analysis Pack 1 data",

    "abstract": "Recent interest in intelligent assistants has increased demand for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems that can utilize contextual information to adapt to the user's preferences or the current device state. For example, a user might be more likely to refer to their favorite songs when giving a \"music playing\" command or request to watch a movie starring a particular favorite actor when giving a \"movie playing\" command. Similarly, when a device is in a \"music playing\" state, a user is more likely to give volume control commands. In this paper, we explore using semantic information inside the ASR word lattice by employing Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify and boost contextually relevant paths in order to improve speech recognition accuracy. We use broad semantic classes comprising millions of entities, such as songs and musical artists, to tag relevant semantic entities in the lattice.

    "abstract": "Recent work has shown that end-to-end (E2E) speech recognition architectures such as Listen Attend and Spell (LAS) can achieve state-of-the-art quality results in LVCSR tasks. One benefit of this architecture is that it does not require a separately trained pronunciation model, language model and acoustic model. However, this property also introduces a drawback: it is not possible to adjust language model contributions separately from the system as a whole. As a result, inclusion of dynamic, contextual information (such as nearby restaurants or upcoming events) into recognition requires a different approach from what has been applied in conventional systems. We introduce a technique to adapt the inference process to take advantage of contextual signals by adjusting the output likelihoods of the neural network at each step in the beam search. We apply the proposed method to a LAS E2E model and show its effectiveness in experiments on a voice search task with both artificial and real contextual information. Given optimal context, our system reduces WER from 9.2% to 3.8%. The results show that this technique is effective at incorporating context into the prediction of an E2E system",

Our method takes advantage of two distinct and complementary ways of extracting information from the asymmetric time structure of speech. It also mitigates a drawback of attention-based models that they tend to output less reliable labels due to error accumulation when the utterance becomes longer. We also show the effectiveness of a multitask learning in which the forward decoder is jointly trained with backward decoding sharing a single encoder. The proposed forward-backward decoding improved word error rates (WERs) of word-level attention models by up to 12.7% relative in speech recognition experiments using large-scale spontaneous speech corpora.

In contrast to a generatively trained i-vector extractor, a DNN speaker embedding extractor is usually trained discriminatively in the closed set classification scenario using softmax. The problem we addressed in the paper is choosing a dnn based speaker embedding backend solution for speaker verification scoring. There are several options to perform speaker verification in the dnn embedding space. One of them is using a simple heuristic speaker similarity metric for the scoring (e.g. cosine metric). Similarly in the i-vector based systems, the standard Linear Discriminant Analisys (LDA) followed by the Probabilistic Linear Discriminant Analisys (PLDA) can be used for segregating speaker information. As an alternative, the discriminative metric learning approach can be considered. This work demonstrates that performance of deep speaker embeddings based systems can be improved by using Cosine Similarity Metric Learning (CSML) with the triplet loss training scheme.

Its goal is to prevent the scattering of these samples within the embedding space to increase the intra-class compactness.When intra-class loss is jointly optimized with triplet loss, we can observe 2 major improvements: the deep embedding network can achieve a more robust and discriminative representation and the training process is more stable with a faster convergence rate.

Specifically, the discriminability of embeddings is enhanced by reducing intra-speaker variation with center loss and simultaneously increasing inter-speaker discrepancy with softmax loss. To further improve system performance when long utterances are available, at test stage long utterances are segmented into shorter ones, where utterance-level speaker embeddings are extracted by an average pooling layer.

While many studies have focused on measuring the intelligibility of these distinct speech types, their impact on listening effort is not known. The current study combined an objective measure of intelligibility, a physiological measure of listening effort (pupil size) and listeners' subjective judgements, to examine the impact of four speech types: plain (natural) speech, speech produced in noise (Lombard speech), speech enhanced to promote intelligibility and synthetic speech. For each speech type, listeners responded to sentences presented in one of three levels of speech-shaped noise. Subjective effort ratings and intelligibility scores showed an inverse ranking across speech types, with synthetic speech being the most demanding and enhanced speech the least. Pupil size measures indicated an increase in listening effort with decreasing signal-to-noise ratio for all speech types apart from synthetic speech, which required significantly more effort at the most favourable noise level. Naturally and artificially modified speech were less effortful than plain speech at the more adverse noise levels. These outcomes indicate a clear impact of speech type on the cognitive demands required for comprehension",

Target and masker stories were presented dichotically or diotically. F0 and vocal-tract length were manipulated in order to parametrically vary the distance between the target and masker voices. Consistent with the hypothesis that correct-identification performance for target words depends on selective attention, performance decreases with the distance between the target and masker voices. These results indicate that the paradigm and stimuli described here can be used to infer which voice a participant is listening to in concurrent-speech listening experiments",

    "abstract": "The speech of a familiar talker is better recognized in noise than an unfamiliar one, suggesting that listeners access talker-specific models to assist with degraded input. This study investigated whether a talker model could be accessed by presenting the face of a talker. In the experiment, participants were trained in recognizing three talkers' faces and voices to ceiling-level. Participants were then given a speech in noise recognition task consisting of four talker conditions: familiar face then familiar voice; unfamiliar face then familiar voice, familiar face then unfamiliar voice; and unfamiliar face then unfamiliar voice. A talker familiarity effect was found, i.e., speech perception was more accurate in the familiar face and familiar voice condition than all other ones. A familiar voice did not produce a talker familiarity effect when paired with an unfamiliar face. The familiar face and unfamiliar voice condition had the poorest performance, indicating that pairing a familiar face and unfamiliar voice had a disruptive effect. The results suggest that listeners develop a talker model that includes details of both the voice and the face; and that accessing this model can in some circumstances be wholly determined by face cues",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Background music in social interaction settings can hinder conversation. Yet, little is known of how specific properties of music impact speech processing. This paper addresses this knowledge gap by investigating the effect of the 1) complexity of the background music and 2) the presence versus absence of sung lyrics on spoken-word recognition in background music. To answer these questions, a word identification experiment was run in which Dutch participants listened to Dutch CVC words embedded in stretches of background music in four conditions: low/high complexity and with lyrics/music-only and at three SNRs. Music stretches with and without lyrics were sampled from the same song in order to control for factors beyond the complexity of the music and the presence of lyrics. The results showed a clear negative impact of more complex music and the presence of lyrics in background music on spoken-word recognition. The results open a path for future work and suggest that social spaces (e.g., restaurants, cafés and bars) should make careful choices of music to promote conversation",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "To increase the range of modal speech in natural ambient noise, individuals increase their vocal effort and may pass into the ‘shouted speech' register. To date, most studies concerning the influence of distance on spoken communication in outdoor natural environments have focused on the ‘productive side' of the human ability to tacitly adjust vocal output to compensate for acoustic losses due to sound propagation. Our study takes a slightly different path as it is based on an adaptive speech production/perception experiment. The setting was an outdoor natural soundscape (a plane forest in altitude). The stimuli were produced live during the interaction: each speaker adapted speech to transmit French disyllabic words in isolation to an interlocutor/listener who was situated at variable distances in the course of the experiment (30m, 60m, 90m). Speech recognition was explored by evaluating the ability of 16 normal-hearing French listeners to recognize these words and their constituent vowels and consonants. Results showed that in such conditions, speech adaptation was rather efficient as word recognition remained around 95% at 30m, 85% at 60m and 75% at 90m. We also observed striking differences in patterns of answers along several lines: different distances, speech registers, vowels and consonants",

To better understand the phonological processing deficit, which has been posited as a core trait of dyslexia, we wanted to further characterize the impact of noise on speech perception. In this paper we investigated phoneme resistance to noise for dyslexic and control adults and explored the pattern of errors produced by noise interference. Our aim was to examine differences between phoneme confusion matrices of the two populations. Disyllabic nouns were embedded in noise and participants had to perform an auditory word identification task. Error rates, phoneme resistance and phoneme confusions were compared between a dyslexic and a group of matched controls. Error rate was higher in the dyslexic group. However, no qualitative differences in the profile of errors were found. The coronals /ʃ and s/ were the most resistant phoneme in both groups while the labials /f, m and v/ were the most vulnerable. Although dyslexics showed a more scattered pattern of confusions, the matrices were correlated. Our results confirm a phonological deficit in dyslexia whereas they do not support the hypothesis of qualitative differences in phonological representation between the two groups",

In this paper we propose a method for GCI detection based on single frequency filtering (SFF) of the speech signal. The SFF output has high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) property in speech regions. The variance (across frequency) contour computed from the SFF output show rapid changes around the GCIs and these rapid changes can be observed even when the speech signal is degraded. Thus the GCI locations can be extracted even from degraded speech using the SFF analysis. The robustness of the method is demonstrated for several cases of degradation of speech signal",

The sharp transitions present in the single pole filtered envelope at the epochs are enhanced using multi-scale product computation. Further, the combined evidence derived from the multi-scale product of the filtered envelopes at different frequencies is used to locate the epochs.

    "abstract": "External broadband signal excitation applied at the speaker (or singer)'s mouth has previously been successfully used to estimate acoustic resonances of the vocal tract during speaking and singing. In this study, we used a modified, low cost, light-weight, pocket-sized and simplified version of this measurement technique, with reduced sampling time and improved low frequency detection, so that such vocal tract measurements may be easily deployed ‘in the field' and facilitate a more ‘ecological/natural' tracking of phonatory gestures. This system was investigated with 6 volunteer speakers phonating 17 English vowels and the relative impedance spectrum γ (‘gamma') was measured. Although the γ(f) signal measured here for each phonatory gesture is somewhat noisier than the original technique, it is still believed to carry some important cues associated with vocal tract configuration that produce these vowels. Features were identified both in the amplitude and phase of γ(f) and three ensemble classifiers namely random forest, gradient boosting and adaboost were trained using them. The prediction output from these classifiers were combined using soft voting to predict a class label (front-central-back; open-close). This yielded an accuracy exceeding 80% in classifying the six nominal regions of the vowel plane",

Estimation of fundamental frequency is a well studied topic in the speech research community. From the recent studies on fundamental frequency estimation from singing voice with state-of-art methods proposed for speech, there exists a significant gap in accuracy for singing voice. This is mainly because of the wider and rapid variations in pitch in singing voice compared to that in speech. To overcome this, in this paper we propose a method to derive the fundamental frequency from singing voice by exploiting the harmonics of impulse-like excitation in sequence of glottal cycles. The proposed method is compared with the eight state-of-art methods such as YIN, SWIPE, YAAPT, RAPT, SRH, SFF_CEP, PEFAC and SHRP on the LYRICS singing database. From the experimental results, it is observed that the accuracy of fundamental frequency by the proposed method is better than many state-of-art methods in various singing categories and laryngeal mechanisms",

From this, we propose a four-class classification problem and investigate the suitability of applying a 2D convolutional neural network augmented with a recurrent neural network with bidirectional long short-term memory cells to solve the proposed task of echolalia recognition. In this approach, log Mel-spectrograms are first generated from the audio recordings and then fed as input into the convolutional layers to extract high-level spectral features. The subsequent recurrent layers are applied to learn the long-term temporal context from the obtained features. Finally, we use a feed forward neural network with softmax activation to classify the dataset.

The task is to perform automatic assessment of grammatical and linguistic aspects of English spoken by German-speaking Swiss teenagers. Our developed systems consist of two components, automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text processing (TP). We explore several ways of building a DNN-HMM ASR system using out-of-domain AMI speech corpus plus a limited amount of ST data. In development experiments on the initial ST data, our final ASR system achieved the word-error-rate (WER) of 12.00%, compared to 14.89% for the official ST baseline DNN-HMM system.

We employed a system using word and character n-gram features in a random forest machine learning framework based on the system that achieved the second-highest score in the text processing track of the 2017 Spoken CALL Shared Task. This system was augmented with additional features based on comparing the learner's responses to language models trained on text written by both native English speakers and L1-German English learners. In addition, we developed a set of sequence-to-label models using bidirectional LSTM-RNNs with an attention layer. The RNN model predictions were combined with the other feature sets using feature-level and score-level fusion approaches resulting in a best-performing system that achieved a D score of 7.397 on the test set (ranking 5th out of 12 submissions to the text processing track of the Shared Task). Subsequent experiments resulted in higher D scores when the model parameters were optimized for D score instead of F-score and the paper presents an error analysis of these models in an attempt to determine which metric is more appropriate for evaluating spoken CALL systems",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel training strategy for attention-based encoder-decoder acoustic-to-word end-to-end systems. Accuracy of end-to-end systems has greatly improved thanks to careful tuning of model structure and the introduction of novel training strategies to stabilize training. For example, multi-task learning using a shared-encoder is often used to escape from bad local optima. However, multi-task learning usually relies on a linear interpolation of the losses for each sub-task and consequently, the shared-encoder is not optimized for each task. To solve the above problem, we propose a multi-task learning with augmentation strategy. We augment the training data by creating multiple copies of the original training data to suit different output targets associated with each sub-task. We use each target loss sequentially to update the parameters of the shared-encoder so as to enhance the versatility of capturing acoustic features. This strategy enables better learning of the shared-encoder as each task is trained with a dedicated loss. The parameters of the word-decoder are jointly updated via the shared-encoder when optimizing the word prediction task loss. We evaluate our proposal on various speech data sets and show that our models achieve lower word error rates than both single-task and conventional multi-task approaches",

    "abstract": "Speech recognition of foreign accented (non-native or L2) speech remains a challenge to the state-of-the-art. The most common approach to address this scenario involves the collection and transcription of accented speech and incorporating this into the training data. However, the amount of accented data is dwarfed by the amount of material from native (L1) speakers, limiting the impact of the additional material. In this work, we address this problem via data augmentation. We create modified copies of two accents, Latin American and Asian accented English speech with voice transformation (modifying glottal source and vocal tract parameters), noise addition and speed modification. We investigate both supervised (where transcription of the accented data is available) and unsupervised approaches to using the accented data and associated augmentations. We find that all augmentations provide improvements, with the largest gains coming from speed modification, then voice transformation and noise addition providing the least improvement. The improvements from training accent specific models with the augmented data are substantial. Improvements from supervised and unsupervised adaptation (or training with soft labels) with the augmented data are relatively minor. Overall, we find speed modification to be a remarkably reliable data augmentation technique for improving recognition of foreign accented speech. Our strategies with associated augmentations provide Word Error Rate (WER) reductions of up to 30% relative over a baseline trained with only the accented data",

    "abstract": "Multilingual Speech Recognition is one of the most costly AI problems, because each language (7,000+) and even different accents require their own acoustic models to obtain best recognition performance. Even though they all use the same phoneme symbols, each language and accent imposes its own coloring or \"twang\". Many adaptive approaches have been proposed, but they require further training, additional data and generally are inferior to monolingually trained models. In this paper, we propose a different approach that uses a large multilingual model that is modulated by the codes generated by an ancillary network that learns to code useful differences between the \"twangs\" or human language. We use Meta-Pi networks to have one network (the language code net) gate the activity of neurons in another (the acoustic model nets). Our results show that during recognition multilingual Meta-Pi networks quickly adapt to the proper language coloring without retraining or new data and perform better than monolingually trained networks.

However, acoustic-to-word models require a very large amount of training data and it is difficult to prepare one for a new domain such as elderly speech. To address the problem, we propose domain adaptation based on transfer learning with layer freezing. Layer freezing first pre-trains a network with the source domain data and then a part of parameters is re-trained for the target domain while the rest is fixed. In the attention-based acoustic-to-word model, the encoder part is frozen to maintain the generality and only the decoder part is re-trained to adapt to the target domain. This substantially allows for adaptation of the latent linguistic capability of the decoder to the target domain. Using a large-scale Japanese spontaneous speech corpus as source, the proposed method is applied to three target domains: a call center task and two voice search tasks by adults and by elderly. The models trained with the proposed method achieved better accuracy than the baseline models, which are trained from scratch or entirely re-trained with the target domain",

However, Turkers (crowd workers) available in online marketplaces can serve as valuable alternative resources by providing transcriptions in the target language.

After some post-processing, these transcriptions can be converted to Probabilistic Transcriptions (PT). Conventional Deep Neural Networks (DNN) trained using PTs do not necessarily improve error rates over Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) due to the presence of label noise. Previously reported results have demonstrated some success by adopting Multi-Task Learning (MTL) training for PTs. In this study, we report further improvements using Knowledge Distillation (KD) and Target Interpolation (TI) to alleviate transcription errors in PTs. In the KD method, knowledge is transfered from a well-trained multilingual DNN to the target language DNN trained using PTs. In the TI method, the confidences of the labels provided by PTs are modified using the confidences of the target language DNN.

It's widely acknowledged that the shared-hidden-layer multilingual deep neural network (SHL-MDNN) acoustic model (AM) could outperform the conventional monolingual AM, due to its effectiveness in cross-lingual knowledge transfer. In this work, two research aspects are investigated, with the goal of improving multilingual acoustic modeling. Firstly, in the SHL-MDNN architecture, the shared hidden layer configuration is replaced by a combined TDNN-BLSTM structure. Secondly, the improvement of cross-lingual knowledge transferability is achieved through adding the proposed language-dependent pre-final layer under each network output. The pre-final layer, rarely adopted in past works, is expected to increase nonlinear modeling capability between universal transformed features generated by shared hidden layers and language-specific outputs. Experiments are carried out with CUSENT, WSJ and RASC-863 corpora, covering Cantonese, English and Mandarin. A Cantonese ASR task is chosen for evaluation. Experimental results show that SHL-MTDNN-BLSTM achieves the best performance.

For example, appending auxiliary features representing speakers such as i-vectors to the input of a deep neural network (DNN) is an effective way to realize unsupervised adaptation of DNN-hybrid automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. Recently, end-to-end (E2E) models have been proposed as an alternative to conventional DNN-hybrid ASR systems. E2E models map a speech signal to a sequence of characters or words using a single neural network, which greatly simplifies the ASR pipeline. However, adaptation of E2E models has received little attention yet. In this paper, we investigate auxiliary feature based adaptation for encoder-decoder E2E models. We employ a recently proposed sequence summary network to compute auxiliary features instead of i-vectors, as it can be easily integrated into E2E models and keep the ASR pipeline simple. Indeed, the sequence summary network allows the auxiliary feature extraction module to be a part of the computational graph of the E2E model.

In this study, we explore how an end-to-end recurrent neural network (RNN) trained system with English and native languages (Spanish and Indian languages) could leverage the data of native languages to perform better for accented English speech. To this end, we examine using pre-training with native languages, as well as multitask learning in which the main task is trained with native English data and the secondary task is trained with Spanish or Indian Languages. We show that the multitask setting performs better than the former approach. We suggest a new setting for multitask learning in which the secondary task is trained with both English and the native language, using the same output set.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an algorithm to improve the naturalness of the reconstructed glossectomy patient's speech that is generated by voice conversion to enhance the intelligibility of speech uttered by patients with a wide glossectomy. While existing VC algorithms make it possible to improve intelligibility and naturalness, the result is still not satisfying. To solve the continuing problems, we propose to directly modify the speech waveforms using a spectrum differential. The motivation is that glossectomy patients mainly have problems in their vocal tract, not in their vocal cords. The proposed algorithm requires no source parameter extractions for speech synthesis, so there are no errors in source parameter extractions and we are able to make the best use of the original source characteristics. In terms of spectrum conversion, we evaluate with both GMM and DNN. Subjective evaluations show that our algorithm can synthesize more natural speech than the vocoder-based method. Judging from observations of the spectrogram, power in high-frequency bands of fricatives and stops is reconstructed to be similar to that of natural speech",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes Audio-Visual Voice Conversion (AVVC) methods using Deep BottleNeck Features (DBNF) and Deep Canonical Correlation Analysis (DCCA). DBNF has been adopted in several speech applications to obtain better feature representations. DCCA can generate much correlated features in two views and enhance features in one modality based on another view. In addition, DCCA can make projections from different views ideally to the same vector space. Firstly, in this work, we enhance our conventional AVVC scheme by employing the DBNF technique in the visual modality. Secondly, we apply the DCCA technology to DBNFs for new effective visual features. Thirdly, we build a cross-modal voice conversion model available for both audio and visual DCCA features. In order to clarify effectiveness of these frameworks, we carried out subjective and objective evaluations and compared them with conventional methods. Experimental results show that our DBNF- and DCCA-based AVVC can successfully improve the quality of converted speech waveforms",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Machine learning has previously been applied successfully to speech-driven facial animation. To account for carry-over and anticipatory coarticulation a common approach is to predict the facial pose using a symmetric window of acoustic speech that includes both past and future context. Using future context limits this approach for animating the faces of characters in real-time and networked applications, such as online gaming. An acceptable latency for conversational speech is 200ms and typically network transmission times will consume a significant part of this. Consequently, we consider asymmetric windows by investigating the extent to which decreasing the future context effects the quality of predicted animation using both deep neural networks (DNNs) and bi-directional LSTM recurrent neural networks (BiLSTMs). Specifically we investigate future contexts from 170ms (fully-symmetric) to 0ms (fully-asymmetric). We find that a BiLSTM trained using 70ms of future context is able to predict facial motion of equivalent quality as a DNN trained with 170ms, while introducing increased processing time of only 5ms. Subjective tests using the BiLSTM show that reducing the future context from 170ms to 50ms does not significantly decrease perceived realism. Below 50ms, the perceived realism begins to deteriorate, generating a trade-off between realism and latency",

    "abstract": "Natural movement plays a significant role in realistic speech animation and numerous studies have demonstrated the contribution visual cues make to the degree human observers find an animation acceptable. Natural, expressive, emotive and prosodic speech exhibits motion patterns that are difficult to predict with considerable variation in visual modalities. Recently, there have been some impressive demonstrations of face animation derived in some way from the speech signal. Each of these methods have taken unique approaches, but none have included rigid head pose in their predicted output. We observe a high degree of correspondence with facial activity and rigid head pose during speech and exploit this observation to jointly learn full face animation and head pose rotation and translation combined. From our own corpus, we train Deep Bi-Directional LSTMs (BLSTM) capable of learning long-term structure in language to model the relationship that speech has with the complex activity of the face. We define a model architecture to encourage learning of rigid head motion via the latent space of the speaker's facial activity. The result is a model that can predict lip sync and other facial motion along with rigid head motion directly from audible speech",

    "abstract": "Text-to-speech synthesis (TTS) purpose is to produce a speech signal from an input text. This implies the annotation of speech recordings with word and phonemic transcriptions. The overall quality of TTS highly depends on the accuracy of phonemic transcriptions. However, they are generally automatically produced by grapheme-to-phoneme conversion systems, which don't deal with speaker variability. In this work, we explore ways to obtain signal-dependent phonemic transcriptions. We investigate forced-alignment with enriched pronunciation lexicon and multimodal phonemic transcription. We then apply our results on error detection of grapheme-to-phoneme conversion hypotheses in order to find where the phonemic transcriptions may be erroneous. On a French TTS dataset, we show that we can detect up to 90.5% of errors of a state-of-the-art grapheme-to-phoneme conversion system by annotating less than 15.8% of phonemes as erroneous. This can help a human annotator to correct most of grapheme-to-phoneme conversion errors without checking a lot of data. In other words, our method can significantly reduce the cost of high quality TTS data creation",

To achieve this goal, feature parameters representing the spectral envelope of speech, directly related to the acoustic characteristics of the vocal tract, has been estimated from articulatory movements. Within this framework, speech can be synthesized by driving the filter obtained from a spectral envelope with noise signals. In the current study, we examined an alternative method that generates speech sounds directly from the motion pattern of articulatory organs based on the implicit relationships between articulatory movements and the source signal of speech. These implicit relationships were estimated by considering that articulatory movements are involved in phonological representations of speech that are also related to sound source information such as the temporal pattern of pitch and voiced/unvoiced flag. We developed a method for simultaneously estimating the spectral envelope and sound source parameters from articulatory data obtained with an electromagnetic articulography (EMA) sensor. Furthermore, objective evaluation of estimated speech parameters and subjective evaluation of the word error rate were performed to examine the effectiveness of our method",

In the current study, we propose a new pressure-volume model that relates pressure changes to volume changes of the human lung. Using this model, the behavior of the human lung can be integrated with articulatory synthesis.

Then, another two DNNs are constructed to map linguistic features toward the extracted unit vector of each phone. One of them employs the unit vectors of preceding phones as model input. At synthesis time, the L2 distances between the unit vectors predicted by these two DNNs and the ones derived from candidate units are integrated into the target cost and the concatenation cost of HMM-based unit selection speech synthesis respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that the unit vectors estimated using only acoustic features display phone-dependent clustering properties.

The conventional methods to calculate the target cost include two separate steps: feature extraction and standard distance measurement. The proposed DML framework aims to measure the similarity between the candidate units and the target units more reasonably and directly. Firstly, the symmetrical DML framework is pre-trained to learn the metric between pairs of candidate units and target units. The relabeling procedure is added to correct the initial designed labels of the target cost. Secondly, the acoustic features of the target units are removed, which fits the runtime of the unit-selection synthesizer. The asymmetrical DML is fine-tuned to learn the metric between candidate units and target units. Compared with the conventional methods, the proposed unified DML framework can avoid the accumulation of errors in separate steps and improve the accuracy in labeling and predicting the target cost. The evaluation results demonstrate that the naturalness of synthetic speech has been improved by adopting DML framework to predict target cost",

    "abstract": "In statistical parametric speech synthesis, approaches based on deep neural networks (DNNs) have improved qualities of the synthesized speech. General DNN-based approaches require a large amount of training data to synthesize natural speech. However, it is not practical to record speech for many hours from a single speaker. To address this problem, this paper presents a novel pre-training method of DNN-based speech synthesis systems for small data sets. In this method, a Gaussian-Categorical deep relational model (GCDRM), which represents a joint probability of two visible variables, is utilized to describe the joint distribution of acoustic features and linguistic features. During the maximum-likelihood-based training, the model attempts to obtain parameters of a deep architecture considering the bidirectional conversion between 1) generated acoustic features given linguistic features and 2) re-generated linguistic features given acoustic features generated from itself. Owing to considering whether the generated acoustic features are recognizable, our method can obtain reasonable parameters from small data sets. Experimental results show that pre-trained DNN-based systems using our proposed method outperformed randomly-initialized DNN-based systems. This method also outperformed DNN-based systems in a speaker-dependent speech recognition task",

    "abstract": "The way speech prosody encodes linguistic, paralinguistic and non-linguistic information via multiparametric representations of the speech signals is still an open issue. The Superposition of Functional Contours (SFC) model proposes to decompose prosody into elementary multiparametric functional contours through the iterative training of neural network contour generators using analysis-by-synthesis. Each generator is responsible for computing multiparametric contours that encode one given linguistic, paralinguistic and non-linguistic information on a variable scope of rhythmic units. The contributions of all generators' outputs are then overlapped and added to produce the prosody of the utterance. We propose an extension of the contour generators that allows them to model the prominence of the elementary contours based on contextual information. WSFC jointly learns the patterns of the elementary multiparametric functional contours and their weights dependent on the contours' contexts. The experimental results show that the proposed weighted SFC (WSFC) model can successfully capture contour prominence and thus improve SFC modelling performance. The WSFC is also shown to be effective at modelling the impact of attitudes on the prominence of functional contours cuing syntactic relations in French and that of emphasis on the prominence of tone contours in Chinese",

While there exist patterns of language mixing in which a dominant or matrix language (ML) may not be discernible, these more complex signatures are rarely modeled [2, 3]. We use a series of metrics to characterize the switching in corpora as asymmetrical (insertional C-S) or symmetrical (alternational C-S). We test the efficacy of a linguistic model that assumes no ML in predicting the syntax of C-S in three Spanish–English corpora that vary according to whether the ML is Spanish, English or indeterminate. Our results show that the same constraints on the grammatical junctures and on the directionality of switching hold irrespective of the symmetry of the data. The length of the alternating language spans varies according to POS with noun phrases comprising the shortest spans. This suggests that insertional C-S may be subsumed under alternational C-S, as spontaneous borrowing. These results invite researchers to reconsider the linguistic theories they adopt and to expand the typology of training data used in creating language models and processing tools for C-S",

The FBDS processing results were used — along with more classic measures such as raw percentage of speech and length/standard deviation of silent pauses — to estimate speech rate and regularity of speech rate, while a formant tracking algorithm was used to estimate speech fluidity (i.e., quality of coarticulation). A step-by-step multiple linear regression was finally computed to predict the experts' mean fluency ratings. Results show that FBDS-derived measures, raw percentage of speech and standard deviation of the first formant curve derivative can be combined together to calculate accurate estimates of speakers' fluency scores (R = .92; P < .001).

L2 learners' categorical perception is measured by fitting a sigmoid curve to the identification responses with average F0 height be the acoustic dimension. The boundary location of the two tones in L2 learners' perception space is significantly improved to a higher F0 height after training. Regression analysis indicated that 𝛿F0 and 𝛿t of the initial falling of the concave F0 shape are the key acoustic features for native speakers in discrimination. L2 learners rely on not only the initial fall but also the 𝛿F0 of the final rise to discriminate the tones. A detailed analysis using cognitive measurements reports an increasing attention on the initial fall of the F0 contour for L2 learners after perceptual training. These results confirmed that directing the attention to key acoustic features is essential for L2 learners to improve their categorical perception of novel speech contrasts",

    "abstract": "Second language (L2) speech is often annotated with the native phoneme categories. However, we often observe that an L2 speech segment generally deviates from a canonical phoneme and sometimes it is very difficult for linguists to annotate with any canonical phoneme label. We refer to these segments as non-native phonetic patterns. Existing approaches to mispronunciation detection and diagnosis (MDD) focus mainly on canonical mispronunciations, i.e. one canonical phoneme is substituted for another, aside from those deleted or inserted. To better represent L2 speech, this work explores non-native phonetic patterns (NN-PPs) of each native phoneme by an unsupervised approach. We apply an optimized k-means algorithm to cluster state-based phonemic posterior-grams, which are generated with a deep neural network. Then, to discover the NN-PPs related to each native phoneme, we perform forced alignment to divide L2 speech into segments grouped by native phonemes. We use the cluster sequences within segments derived from clustering results to represent different phonetic patterns of each native phoneme. Finally, we apply Cluster Sequence Analysis to discover each phoneme's potential NN-PPs. We verified experimentally that NN-PPs can extend the native phoneme categories to better describe L2 speech, which can enrich the existing approaches to MDD for better performance",

Two perception experiments were conducted to investigate Wuxi speakers' perception and production of coda nasals in their second language (L2) Mandarin. First, two groups of Wuxi native speakers, age around 20 and 50, produced monosyllabic words with nasal coda in Mandarin and their production was used as the stimuli for native Mandarin speakers to identify. Second, the same Wuxi speakers participated in an identification task to judge the place of articulation of the nasal coda in monosyllabic words in standard Mandarin. The results of the first experiment indicate that young Wuxi speakers' Mandarin production was identified with higher accuracy by native Mandarin speakers than older Wuxi speakers', suggesting the young speakers produced more nativelike Mandarin than the older speakers. The results of the second experiment reveal that young Wuxi speakers identified coda nasals in Mandarin more accurately than older Wuxi speakers did, suggesting Wuxi speakers' production of Mandarin coda nasals is associated with their perception",

    "title": "The Diphthongs of Formal Nigerian English: A Preliminary Acoustic Analysis",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Postcolonial varieties of English, used in countries such as Nigeria, India and Singapore, are subject to both local (\"endonormative\") and external (\"exonormative\") forces, the latter often in the form of British/American English. This gives rise to a stylistic continuum, where informal speech is more endonormatively oriented than formal/educated speech, which, nevertheless, is clearly distinguishable from British/American English. The formal end of the continuum is often regarded as the incipient local standard.Nigerian English is the most widely spoken African variety of English, but empirical/quantitative descriptions are rare. In this pilot study, we present an acoustic analysis of eight phonological diphthongs produced in formal contexts by nine educated speakers of NigE with L1 Yoruba and drawn from the ICE Nigeria corpus. Results show that the NigE speakers produced more monophthongal realisations of English phonological diphthongs than speakers of British English do, as measured by trajectory length in F1-F2 space. Phonetically, most of these vowels can be considered monophthongs. The results can be explained through two factors at work during the foundation phase of NigE: (1) historical L1 influence and (2) the native English input present in the country, which involved more monophthongal realisations of some phonological diphthongs than in present-day BrE",

    "title": "Characterizing Rhythm Differences between Strong and Weak Accented L2 Speech",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "This study examined the rhythmic characteristics of accented L2 speech by using two relatively novel measures of prosodic rhythm: The S-AMPH measure, an index of the degree of synchrony between the stress and syllable amplitude modulation rates; and the Allan Factor measure, that determines the nested clustering of temporal events (in this case peaks in the amplitude envelope) over different timescales. An extreme-group design was used to select strong versus weak foreign accent recordings from a group of Korean and French L2 English talkers saying the same 69-word English passage. For the Korean talkers, both the S-AMPH and the Allan Factor measures differed as a function of the strength of foreign accent. This was not the case for the French talkers, where neither measure differed as a function of the strength of the foreign accent. The difference in outcome between the Korean and French talkers suggests that the measures may not be indexing a general property of L2 accent (e.g., production fluency) but rather that they may be picking up a property specific to the strongly accented Korean talkers. We consider several options",

    "title": "Analysis of Phone Errors Attributable to Phonological Effects Associated With Language Acquisition Through Bottleneck Feature Visualisations",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Previous work aimed to investigate the extent to which errors attributable to phonological effects associated with language acquisition (PEALA) contribute to the output of children's ASR. Opposite to what was intuitively expected, the proportion of errors predictable from PEALA was positively correlated with recognition accuracy, therefore increased across ages. In order to interpret this finding, the present paper employs a DNN-HMM automatic speech recognition system, built on the CSLU children's speech corpus, to produce bottleneck feature (BNF) visualisations of phones and examine how these relate with respect to PEALA. The focus is drawn particularly on ASR errors caused by phone confusions, which are compared against phone substitution pairs indicated by PEALA. The ASR results confirm the previously observed interaction between errors predictable from PEALA and rising accuracy, but also suggest that these errors only account for a small percentage of the total phone substitution error. The BNF visualisations for the most part outline the age progression smoothly and demonstrate clear clusters of neighbouring phones consistently. The distance between PEALA related phones can be partitioned in four sets; two that increase with age (at a higher or lower rate), one that roughly remains constant and one that decreases with age",

    "abstract": "Learners with different native languages (L1) meet different challenges when they learn a foreign language (L2). The Speech Learning Model and the Perceptual Assimilation Model PAM-L2 have led to important insights about these challenges. Among other things, they have shown that the learnability of L2 sounds depends on their similarity to sounds in the L1: L2 sounds are more likely to lead to the formation of new phonetic categories if they differ strongly from L1 categories than if they are similar. The similarity of sounds is hard to quantify objectively, especially if the aim is to do this for many L1-L2 pairs. This limits the models' practical applicability. The multilingual pronunciation training platform CALST offers exercises for all new L2 sounds. Two implementations of category (dis)similarity are proposed to identify new sounds, one at the level of functional similarity maintaining all L2 phonemic contrasts, the other based on a more fine-grained, multilingual similarity measure, where L2 sounds are considered new if they can contrast phonemically with the most similar L1 sound in any one language. This level of granularity reflects phonetically salient differences between sounds which, when perceived and produced adequately, suffice for high intelligibility and comprehensibility in L2",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Speaker diarization (answering \"who spoke when\") is a widely researched subject within speech technology. Numerous experiments have been run on datasets built from broadcast news, meeting data and call centers - the task sometimes appears close to being solved. Much less work has begun to tackle the hardest diarization task of all: spontaneous conversations in real-world settings. Such diarization would be particularly useful for studies of language acquisition, where researchers investigate the speech children produce and hear in their daily lives. In this paper, we study audio gathered with a recorder worn by small children as they went about their normal days. As a result, each child was exposed to different acoustic environments with a multitude of background noises and a varying number of adults and peers. The inconsistency of speech and noise within and across samples poses a challenging task for speaker diarization systems, which we tackled via retraining and data augmentation techniques. We further studied sources of structured variation across raw audio files, including the impact of speaker type distribution, proportion of speech from children and child age on diarization performance. We discuss the extent to which these findings might generalize to other samples of speech in the wild",

Distinguishing children's linguistic from non-linguistic vocalisations is crucial for a number of applied and fundamental research goals and yet there are few systems available for such a classification. This paper investigates two large-scale frame-level acoustic feature sets (eGeMAPS and ComParE16) followed by a dynamic model (GRU-RNN) and two kinds of derived static feature sets on the segment level (functional-based and Bag of Audio Words) combined with a static model (SVM) and automatically learnt representations directly from original raw voice signals by using an end-to-end system, which are compared against a simple phonetically-inspired baseline. These are applied to a large database of children's vocalisations (total N = 6,298) drawn from daylong recordings gathered in Namibia, Bolivia and Vanuatu. All of the systems outperform the baseline, with the highest performance in the test set for GRU-RNN using ComParE16 features. We identify promising paths of further research, including the application of a finer-grained classification of children's vocalisations onto these data and the exploration of other feature systems",

    "abstract": "AI-powered English learning apps are used by hundreds of millions of people across the globe on a daily basis. This presents a great opportunity for the study of L2 speech. On one hand, the amount of data accessible for research is very large and rapidly growing; on the other hand, new theories and understanding of L2 speech can be continually tested and revised through real-life and real-time applications. This paper presents a study of pitch characteristics of L2 English speech using a large-scale dataset from a language learning app. Our dataset contains 180,000 spoken utterances which amount to 240 hours of speech. The results show that compared to L1, L2 English has narrower pitch range and slower rate of pitch change, but more small \"ripples\" on the pitch contour. The percentage of F0 rise time is higher in L2 and the maximum F0 in an utterance is realized later (with respect to the onset of the word on which the maximum F0 resides). These results suggest that the influence of L1 on L2 prosody is more complex than previously demonstrated and they shed light on L2 prosody assessment and learning",

    "abstract": "Although isiZulu speakers code-switch with English as a matter of course, extremely little appropriate data is available for acoustic modelling. Recently, a small five-language corpus of code-switched South African soap opera speech was compiled. We used this corpus to evaluate the application of multilingual neural network acoustic modelling to English-isiZulu code-switched speech recognition. Our aim was to determine whether English-isiZulu speech recognition accuracy can be improved by incorporating three other language pairs in the corpus: English-isiXhosa, English-Setswana and English-Sesotho. Since isiXhosa, like isiZulu, belongs to the Nguni language family, while Setswana and Sesotho belong to the more distant Sotho family, we could also investigate the merits of additional data from within and across language groups. Our experiments using both fully connected DNN and TDNN-LSTM architectures show that English-isiZulu speech recognition accuracy as well as language identification after code-switching is improved more by the incorporation of English-isiXhosa data than by the incorporation of the other language pairs. However additional data from the more distant language group remained beneficial and the best overall performance was always achieved with a multilingual neural network trained on all four language pairs",

The aim is to allow rapid deployment of a keyword spotting system in a new language to support urgent United Nations (UN) relief programmes in parts of Africa where languages are extremely under-resourced and the development of annotated speech resources is infeasible. First, we use 1920 recorded keywords (40 keyword types, 34 minutes of speech) as exemplars in a DTW-based template matching system and apply it to untranscribed broadcast speech. Then, we use the resulting DTW scores as targets to train a CNN on the same unlabelled speech. In this way we use just 34 minutes of labelled speech, but leverage a large amount of unlabelled data for training. While the resulting CNN keyword spotter cannot match the performance of the DTW-based system, it substantially outperforms a CNN classifier trained only on the keywords, improving the area under the ROC curve from 0.54 to 0.64. Because our CNN system is several orders of magnitude faster at runtime than the DTW system, it represents the most viable keyword spotter on this extremely limited dataset",

In this paper, we propose a general solution to address all kinds of environmental interferences. A novel text-dependent speech enhancement (TDSE) technique using a recurrent neural network (RNN) with long short-term memory (LSTM) is presented for improving the robustness of the small-footprint KWD task in the presence of environmental noises and interfering talkers. On our large simulated and recorded noisy and far-field evaluation sets, we show that TDSE significantly improves the quality of the target keyword speech and performs particularly well under speech interference conditions. We demonstrate that KWD with TDSE frontend significantly outperforms the baseline KWD system with or without a generic speech enhancement in terms of equal error rate (EER) in the keyword detection evaluation",

    "abstract": "Furui first demonstrated that the identity of both consonant and vowel can be perceived from the C-V transition; later, Stevens proposed that acoustic landmarks are the primary cues for speech perception and that steady-state regions are secondary or supplemental. Acoustic landmarks are perceptually salient, even in a language one doesn't speak and it has been demonstrated that non-speakers of the language can identify features such as the primary articulator of the landmark. These factors suggest a strategy for developing language-independent automatic speech recognition: landmarks can potentially be learned once from a suitably labeled corpus and rapidly applied to many other languages. This paper proposes enhancing the cross-lingual portability of a neural network by using landmarks as the secondary task in multi-task learning (MTL). The network is trained in a well-resourced source language with both phone and landmark labels (English), then adapted to an under-resourced target language with only word labels (Iban). Landmark-tasked MTL reduces source-language phone error rate by 2.9% relative and reduces target-language word error rate by 1.9%-5.9% depending on the amount of target-language training data. These results suggest that landmark-tasked MTL causes the DNN to learn hidden-node features that are useful for cross-lingual adaptation",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Due to limited resource on devices and complicated scenarios, a compact model with high precision, low computational cost and latency is expected for small-footprint keyword spotting tasks. To fulfill these requirements, in this paper, compact Feed-forward Sequential Memory Network (cFSMN) which combines low-rank matrix factorization with conventional FSMN is investigated for a far-field keyword spotting task. The effect of its architecture parameters is analyzed. Towards achieving lower computational cost, multiframe prediction (MFP) is applied to cFSMN. For enhancing the modeling capacity, an advanced MFP is attempted by inserting small DNN layers before output layers. The performance is measured by area under the curve (AUC) for detection error tradeoff (DET) curves. The experiments show that compared with a well-tuned long short-term memory (LSTM) which needs the same latency and twofold computational cost, the cFSMN achieves 18.11% and 29.21% AUC relative decreases on the test sets which are recorded in quiet and noisy environment respectively. After applying advanced MFP, the system gets 0.48% and 20.04% AUC relative decrease over conventional cFSMN on the quiet and noisy test sets respectively, while the computational cost relatively reduces 46.58%",

Many existing approaches use no annotated resources at all, yet it makes sense to leverage information from large annotated corpora in other languages, for example in the form of multilingual bottleneck features (BNFs) obtained from a supervised speech recognition system. In this work, we evaluate the benefits of BNFs for subword modeling (feature extraction) in six unseen languages on a word discrimination task. First we establish a strong unsupervised baseline by combining two existing methods: vocal tract length normalisation (VTLN) and the correspondence autoencoder (cAE). We then show that BNFs trained on a single language already beat this baseline; including up to 10 languages results in additional improvements which cannot be matched by just adding more data from a single language. Finally, we show that the cAE can improve further on the BNFs if high-quality same-word pairs are available",

    "abstract": "This study addresses the problem of learning robust frame-level feature representation for unsupervised subword modeling in the zero-resource scenario. Robustness of the learned features is achieved through effective speaker adaptation and exploiting cross-lingual phonetic knowledge. For speaker adaptation, an out-of-domain automatic speech recognition (ASR) system is used to estimate fMLLR features for untranscribed speech of target zero-resource languages. The fMLLR features are applied in multi-task learning of a deep neural network (DNN) to further obtain phonetically discriminative and speaker-invariant bottleneck features (BNFs). Frame-level labels for DNN training can be acquired based on two approaches: Dirichlet process Gaussian mixture model (DPGMM) clustering and out-of-domain ASR decoding. Moreover, system fusion is performed by concatenating BNFs extracted by different DNNs. Our methods are evaluated by ZeroSpeech 2017 Track one, where the performance is evaluated by ABX minimal pair discriminability. Experimental results demonstrate that: (1) Using an out-of-domain ASR system to perform speaker adaptation of zero-resource speech is effective and efficient; (2) Our system achieves highly competitive performance to state of the art; (3) System fusion could improve feature representation capability",

    "abstract": "The invention of the Variational Autoencoder enables the application of Neural Networks to a wide range of tasks in unsupervised learning, including the field of Acoustic Unit Discovery (AUD). The recently proposed Hidden Markov Model Variational Autoencoder (HMMVAE) allows a joint training of a neural network based feature extractor and a structured prior for the latent space given by a Hidden Markov Model. It has been shown that the HMMVAE significantly outperforms pure GMM-HMM based systems on the AUD task. However, the HMMVAE cannot autonomously infer the number of acoustic units and thus relies on the GMM-HMM system for initialization. This paper introduces the Bayesian Hidden Markov Model Variational Autoencoder (BHMMVAE) which solves these issues by embedding the HMMVAE in a Bayesian framework with a Dirichlet Process Prior for the distribution of the acoustic units and diagonal or full-covariance Gaussians as emission distributions. Experiments on Timit and Xitsonga show that the BHMMVAE is able to autonomously infer a reasonable number of acoustic units, can be initialized without supervision by a GMM-HMM system, achieves computationally efficient stochastic variational inference by using natural gradient descent and, additionally, improves the AUD performance over the HMMVAE",

We employ a convolutional neural network based localization system and investigate multiple identifiers as additional inputs to the system in order to characterize this speaker. We conduct experiments using ground truth identifiers which are obtained assuming the availability of clean speech and also in realistic conditions where the identifiers are computed from the corrupted speech.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes an end-to-end approach for single-channel speaker-independent multi-speaker speech separation, where time-frequency (T-F) masking, the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and its inverse are represented as layers within a deep network. Previous approaches, rather than computing a loss on the reconstructed signal, used a surrogate loss based on the target STFT magnitudes. This ignores reconstruction error introduced by phase inconsistency. In our approach, the loss function is directly defined on the reconstructed signals, which are optimized for best separation. In addition, we train through unfolded iterations of a phase reconstruction algorithm, represented as a series of STFT and inverse STFT layers. While mask values are typically limited to lie between zero and one for approaches using the mixture phase for reconstruction, this limitation is less relevant if the estimated magnitudes are to be used together with phase reconstruction. We thus propose several novel activation functions for the output layer of the T-F masking, to allow mask values beyond one. On the publicly-available wsj0-2mix dataset, our approach achieves state-of-the-art 12.6 dB scale-invariant signal-to-distortion ratio (SI-SDR) and 13.1 dB SDR, revealing new possibilities for deep learning based phase reconstruction and representing a fundamental progress towards solving the notoriously-hard cocktail party problem",

    "abstract": "Previous research on audio source separation based on deep neural networks (DNNs) mainly focuses on estimating the magnitude spectrum of target sources and typically, phase of the mixture signal is combined with the estimated magnitude spectra in an ad-hoc way. Although recovering target phase is assumed to be important for the improvement of separation quality, it can be difficult to handle the periodic nature of the phase with the regression approach. Unwrapping phase is one way to eliminate the phase discontinuity, however, it increases the range of value along with the times of unwrapping, making it difficult for DNNs to model. To overcome this difficulty, we propose to treat the phase estimation problem as a classification problem by discretizing phase values and assigning class indices to them. Experimental results show that our classification-based approach 1) successfully recovers the phase of the target source in the discretized domain, 2) improves signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR) over the regression-based approach in both speech enhancement task and music source separation (MSS) task and 3) outperforms state-of-the-art MSS",

The speaker dominance at each T-F unit is determined by a two-channel permutation invariant training network, which combines spectral and interchannel phase patterns at the input feature level. In addition, beamforming is tightly integrated in the proposed system by exploiting the magnitudes and phase pro-duced by T-F masking based beamforming.

    "abstract": "Large scale studies of temporal reduction are of interest to obtain linguistic knowledge and this understanding can potentially help improve speech technologies. Automatic speech recognition (ASR) supports the processing of very large corpora and can be used to enrich linguistic studies with models of speech production and perception grounded on observed commonly used pronunciations. In return, ASR can benefit from the linguistic findings by including pronunciation variants that reflect the linguistic variability. This study focuses on two temporal reduction phenomena in Peninsular and Latin American varieties of Spanish: lenition of intervocalic voiced stops V/bdg/V and coda-s. First, the two phenomena are investigated via a study of transcription errors produced by a speech recognition system designed for Peninsular Spanish which can be potentially attributed to lenition. In a second step, automatic forced alignment experiments are conducted using specific pronunciation variants with and without lenition to measure the extent of the phenomenon as a function of geographical and stylistic repartition. The results show that the distribution of pronunciation variants across Peninsular and Latin American Spanish varieties is consistent with trends depicted by classical linguistic studies. The speaking style appears to be the main factor affecting the +/-lenition variation. The findings also suggest that including such variants in ASR system's lexicon may improve performance when processing multiple Spanish varieties",

However, the majority of literature in the United Kingdom often reports on variation at a macro-level (e.g. Northern, Yorkshire, West Yorkshire) rather than at a more local level (e.g. West Yorkshire: Bradford, Calderdale, Kirklees, Leeds, Wakefield). Traditionally, for sociophoneticians, examining regional variation at a broader level is adequate for answering research questions related to language change or more general variation. For practical applications (e.g. forensic, speech technology), however, more fine-grained regional analysis is necessary. This paper analyses over 2000 FACE tokens from three metropolitan boroughs (Bradford, Kirklees and Wakefield) within West Yorkshire, in order to determine the extent to which F1~F3 vary across the region. Results suggest that for FACE, these three boroughs within West Yorkshire are more regionally stratified than previously acknowledged. These findings are of particular importance to the forensic speech science community, as experts rely on these regional nuances in order to make important judgments related to strength of the speech evidence in a case. Should decisions be made without the greater understanding of local-level variation, the strength of evidence risks being over- or under-estimated",

We show that various acoustic-prosodic and turn-taking features commonly used in the literature differ between these segments and hence can possibly influence further inference tasks. We adopt a two-step approach for the segmentation problem by taking advantage of the structural relation between the two segments. First, we use a supervised machine learning algorithm to estimate class posteriors at frame-level. Next, we use an explicit-duration hidden Markov model (EDHMM) to align the states using the posteriors from the previous step. The durational distributions for both play and talk regions are learnt from training data and modeled using the EDHMM. Our results show that speech features can be used to successfully discriminate between play and talk activities, each providing important insights into the child's condition",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "For further understanding the wide array of emotions embedded in human speech, we are introducing a strictly-guided simulated emotional speech corpus. In contrast to existing speech corpora, this was constructed by maintaining an equal distribution of 4 long vowels in New Zealand English. This balance is to facilitate emotion related formant and glottal source feature comparison studies. Also, the corpus has 5 secondary emotions and 5 primary emotions. Secondary emotions are important in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) to model natural conversations among humans and robots. But there are few existing speech resources to study these emotions, which has motivated the creation of this corpus. A large scale perception test with 120 participants showed that the corpus has approximately 70% and 40% accuracy in the correct classification of primary and secondary emotions respectively. The reasons behind the differences in perception accuracies of the two emotion types is further investigated. A preliminary prosodic analysis of corpus shows significant differences among the emotions. The corpus is made public at: github.com/tli725/JL-Corpus",

Dataset design is crucial so as to ensure that any significant variation unrelated to the task in hand is adequately normalised or marginalised. Most datasets are partitioned into training, development and evaluation subsets. Depending on the task, the nature of these three subsets should normally be close to identical. With speech signals being subject to a multitude of different influences, e.g. speaker gender and age, language, dialect, utterance length, etc., the design and validation of speech datasets can become especially challenging. Even if many sources of variation unrelated to the task in hand can easily be marginalised, other sources of more subtle variation can easily be overlooked. Imbalances between training, development and evaluation partitions, can bring into question findings derived from their use. Stringent dataset validation procedures are required. This paper reports a particularly straightforward approach to dataset validation that is based upon waveform entropy",

One main contribution is the proposed long short-term memory (LSTM) based speech denoising model. By fully utilizing the diversified simulated training data and advanced network architecture using progressive multitask learning with dense structure, the denoising model demonstrates the strong generalization capability to realistic noisy environments. The enhanced speech can boost the performance for the subsequent SAD, segmentation and clustering. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time we show significant improvements of deep learning based single-channel speech enhancement over state-of-the-art diarization systems in highly mismatch conditions. For the design of i-vector extraction, we adopt a residual convolutional neural network trained on large dataset including more than 30,000 people.

These i-vectors are clustered with a Fully Bayesian PLDA. This model, a generative model with latent variables as speaker labels, produces the diarization labels by means of Variational Bayes iterations.

For the training data, we used two well-known meeting corpora - the AMI and the ICSI datasets, together with the provided samples from the DIHARD challenge. To further enhance our system, we present three data augmentation settings: the first is a naive concatenation of isolated speaker utterances from non-diarization datasets, which generates artificial diarization prompts. The second is a simple noise addition with sampled signal-to-noise ratios. The third is using noise suppression over the development data.

    "abstract": "Multilingual grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) models are useful for multilingual speech synthesis because one model simultaneously copes with multilingual words. We propose a G2P model that combines global character vectors (GCVs) with bidirectional recurrent neural networks (BRNNs) and enables the direct conversion of text (as a sequence of characters) to pronunciation. GCVs are distributional, real-valued representations of characters and their contextual interactions that can be learned from a large-scale text corpus in an unsupervised manner. With the flexibility of learning GCVs from plain text resources, this method has an advantage: it enables monolingual G2P (MoG2P) and multilingual G2P (MuG2P) conversion. We experiment in four languages (Japanese, Korean, Thai and Chinese) with learning language-dependent (LD) and language-independent (LI) GCVs and then build MoG2P and MuG2P models with two-hidden-layer BRNNs. Our results show that both LD- and LI-GCV-based MoG2P models, whose performances are equivalent, achieved better than 97.7% syllable accuracy, which is a relative improvement from 27% to 90% depending on the language in comparison with Mecab-based models. As for MuG2P, the accuracy is around 98%, which is a slightly degraded performance compared to MoG2P. The proposed method also has the potential of the G2P conversion of non-normalized words, achieving 80% accuracy in Japanese",

To achieve this, we formulate the problem as learning disentangled speaker-specific and context-specific representations and follow the idea of [1] which uses Factorized Hierarchical Variational Autoencoder (FHVAE). After training FHVAE on multi-speaker training data, given arbitrary source and target speakers' utterance, we estimate those latent representations and then reconstruct the desired utterance of converted voice to that of target speaker. We investigate the effectiveness of the approach by conducting voice conversion experiments with varying size of training utterances and it was able to achieve reasonable performance with even just one training utterance. We also examine the speech representation and show that World vocoder outperforms Short-time Fourier Transform (STFT) used in [1].

But, for real-world applications of synthetic speech, the effort (cognitive load) required to understand the synthetic speech may be a more appropriate measure. Cognitive load has been investigated in the past, when rule-based speech synthesizers were popular, but there is little or no recent work using state-of-the-art text-to-speech. Studies on the understanding of natural speech have shown that the pupil dilates when increased mental effort is exerted to perform a task. We use pupillometry to measure the cognitive load of synthetic speech submitted to two of the Blizzard Challenge evaluations. Our results show that pupil dilation is sensitive to the quality of synthetic speech. In all cases, synthetic speech imposes a higher cognitive load than natural speech.

Cognitive load is calculated from changes in a listener's performance on a secondary task (e.g., reaction time to decide if a visually-displayed digit is odd or even). Previous related studies have only found significant differences between the best and worst quality systems but failed to separate the systems that lie in between. A paradigm that is sensitive enough to detect differences between state-of-the-art, high quality speech synthesizers would be very useful for advancing the state of the art. In our work, four speech synthesis systems from a previous Blizzard Challenge and the corresponding natural speech, were compared. Our results show that reaction times slow down as speech quality reduces, as we expected: lower quality speech imposes a greater cognitive load, taking resources away from the secondary task. However, natural speech did not have the fastest reaction times. This intriguing result might indicate that, as speech synthesizers attain near-perfect intelligibility, this paradigm is measuring something like the listener's level of sustained attention and not listening effort",

With recent advancements in synthetic speech technology suggesting that human like imitation is more obtainable, this study asked 25 listeners to evaluate both the likeability and human likeness of a corpus of 13 German male voices, produced via 5 synthesis approaches (from formant to hybrid unit selection, deep neural network systems) and 1 Human control. Results show that unlike visual artificially intelligent elements - as posed by the concept of the Uncanny Valley -likeability consistently improves along with human likeness for the synthesized voice, with recent methods achieving substantially closer results to human speech than older methods. A small scale acoustic analysis shows that the F0 of hybrid systems correlates less closely to human speech with a higher standard deviation for F0.

We use US English telephone data collected for automatic speech recognition to simulate the conditions of TTS training on low-resource languages. Our best voice achieves a human-evaluated WER of 29.0% on semantically-unpredictable sentences. This constitutes a significant improvement over our baseline voice trained on the same amount of randomly selected utterances, which performed at 42.4% WER. In addition to subjective voice evaluations with Amazon Mechanical Turk, we also explored objective voice evaluation using mel-cepstral distortion.

    "abstract": "Crowdsourcing speech recordings provides unique opportunities and challenges for personalized speech synthesis as it allows gathering of large quantities of data but with a huge variety in quality. Manual methods for data selection and cleaning quickly become infeasible, especially when producing larger quantities of voices. We present and analyze approaches for data selection and augmentation to cope with this. For differently-sized training sets, we assess speaker adaptation by transfer learning, including layer freezing and sentence selection using maximum likelihood of forced alignment. The methodological framework utilizes statistical parametric speech synthesis based on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). We compare objective scores for 576 voice models, representing all condition combinations. For a constrained set of conditions we also present results from a subjective listening test. We show that speaker adaptation improves overall quality in nearly all cases, sentence selection helps detecting recording errors and layer freezing proves to be ineffective in our system. We also found that while Mel-Cepstral Distortion (MCD) does not correlate with listener preference across the range of values, the most preferred voices also exhibited the lowest values for MCD.

It has been widely used in the large scale acoustic model estimation recently and performs better than many other neural networks. Batch normalization(BN) is a good way to accelerate network training and improve the generalization performance of neural networks. However, applying batch normalization in the LSTM model is more complicated and challenging than in the feed-forward network. In this paper, we explored some novel approaches to add batch normalization to the LSTM model in bidirectional mode. Then we investigated some ways to combine the BN-BLSTM model with dropout, which is a traditional method to alleviate the overfitting problem in neural network training. We evaluated the proposed methods on several speech recognition tasks.

    "abstract": "Batch normalization, or batchnorm, is a popular technique often used to accelerate and improve training of deep neural networks. When existing models that use this technique via batchnorm layers, are used as initial models for domain adaptation or transfer learning, the novel input feature distributions of the adapted domains, considerably change the batchnorm transformations learnt in the training mode from those which are applied in the inference mode. We empirically find that this mismatch can degrade the performance of domain adaptation for acoustic modeling. To mitigate this degradation, we propose an inference-invariant transformation of batch normalization, a method which reduces the mismatch between training mode and inference mode transformations without changing the inference results. This invariance property is achieved by adjusting the weight and bias terms of the batchnorm to compensate for differences in the mean and variance terms when using the adaptation data. Experimental results show that our proposed method performs the best on several acoustic model adaptation tasks with up to 5% relative improvement in recognition performances in both supervised and unsupervised domain adaptation settings",

    "abstract": "The widespread deployment of automatic speech recognition (ASR) system in consumer centric applications such as voice interaction and voice search demands the need for noise robustness in such systems. One approach to this problem is to achieve the desired robustness in speech representations used in the ASR. Motivated from studies on robust human speech recognition, we analyse the unsupervised data-driven temporal modulation filter learning for robust feature extraction. In this paper, we compare various unsupervised models for data driven filter learning like convolutional autoencoder (CAE), generative adversarial network (GAN) and convolutional restricted Boltzmann machine (CRBM). The unsupervised models are designed to learn a set of filters from long temporal trajectories of speech sub-band energy. The filters learnt from these models are used for modulation filtering of the input spectrogram before the ASR training. The ASR experiments are performed on Wall Street Journal (WSJ) Aurora-4 database with clean and multi condition training setup. The experimental results obtained from the modulation filtered representations shows considerable robustness to noise, channel distortions and reverberant conditions compared to other feature extraction methods. Among the three approaches compared in this paper, the GAN approach provides the most consistent improvements in ASR accuracy in different training scenarios",

However, this is time consuming and more importantly, is impossible for languages without a high-quality pronunciation lexicon. In this work, we propose an initialization strategy that uses teacher-student learning to transfer knowledge from a large, well-trained, offline end-to-end speech recognition model to an online end-to-end model, eliminating the need for a lexicon or any other linguistic resources. We also explore curriculum learning and label smoothing and show how they can be combined with the proposed teacher-student learning for further improvements.

In this work, we propose a lattice-free state-level minimum Bayes risk training (LF-sMBR), which maximizes state-level expected accuracy without relying on a lattice generation procedure. As is the case with the LF-MMI, LF-sMBR avoids redundant lattice generation by exploiting forward-backward calculation on phone N-gram space, which enables a much simpler and faster training based on an sMBR criterion. We found that special care for silence phones was essential for improving the accuracy by LF-sMBR.

Thus, we created a speech corpus made of both isolated words and short sentences pronounced by three speakers (male, female and child) and we simulated different levels of NIHL. A repetition task has been carried out with 60 participants to collect perceptual intelligibility scores. Then, an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system has been designed to predict the perceptual scores of intelligibility. The perceptual evaluation showed similar effects of NIHL simulation on the male, female and child speakers. In addition, the automatic intelligibility measure, based on automatic speech recognition scores, was proven to well predict the effects of the different severity levels of NIHL. Indeed, high correlation coefficients were obtained between the automatic and perceptual intelligibility measures on both speech repetition tasks: 0.94 for isolated words task and 0.97 for sentences task",

Despite long-lasting efforts to build speaker- and text-independent ASR systems for people with dysarthria, the performance of state-of-the-art systems is still considerably lower on this type of speech than on normal speech. The most prominent reason for the inferior performance is the high variability in pathological speech that is characterized by the spectrotemporal deviations caused by articulatory impairments due to various etiologies. To cope with this high variation, we propose to use speech representations which utilize articulatory information together with the acoustic properties. A designated acoustic model, namely a fused-feature-map convolutional neural network (fCNN), which performs frequency convolution on acoustic features and time convolution on articulatory features is trained and tested on a Dutch and a Flemish pathological speech corpus.

These techniques explore both audio, video, text and metadata cues, in order to retrieve vlogs that include a single speaker which, at some point, admits that he/she is currently affected by a given disease. The use of straightforward NLP techniques on the automatically transcribed data showed that distinguishing between narratives of present and past experiences is harder than distinguishing between narratives of self experiences and of someone else's.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In this paper we document our experiences with developing speech recognition for medical transcription – a system that automatically transcribes doctor-patient conversations. Towards this goal, we built a system along two different methodological lines – a Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) phoneme based model and a Listen Attend and Spell (LAS) grapheme based model. To train these models we used a corpus of anonymized conversations representing approximately 14,000 hours of speech. Because of noisy transcripts and alignments in the corpus, a significant amount of effort was invested in data cleaning issues. We describe a two-stage strategy we followed for segmenting the data. The data cleanup and development of a matched language model was essential to the success of the CTC based models. The LAS based models, however were found to be resilient to alignment and transcript noise and did not require the use of language models. CTC models were able to achieve a word error rate of 20.1% and the LAS models were able to achieve 18.3%. Our analysis shows that both models perform well on important medical utterances and therefore can be practical for transcribing medical conversations",

No study has evaluated the specific use of prosody regarding information structure in the discourse, in French speaking early CI children. This study aims to evaluate prosody production in these children, to determine whether they show prosodic effect on word duration. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 10 prelingually hearing impaired French speaking children (4-7 years old), without comorbidities, CI before the age of 18 months between 2009 and 2012. The speech production task consisted in playing a computer-based semi-structured game, where children interacted with their caregiver. Results were interpreted according to both chronological age and hearing age (HA). In our series, 6- and 7-year old children (HA<6.2 years) showed stronger lengthening of the focused word in the corrective narrow focus condition than in the contrastive narrow focus which in turn was stronger than in broad focus condition. Only 7-year old children adopted a strategy similar to that of adults, lengthening the end-phrase adjective to preserve the typical phrasing pattern of French. This study shows for the first time that early CI children are able to acquire important intonation structure features comparable to adult patterns",

First, the corpus was segmented at the phonemic, syllabic, lexical and inter-pausal unit levels. Second, a narrative segmentation was applied using the criteria of Labov's evaluative model, which is based on semantic and informational criteria. Duration data was then extracted automatically at each level of granularity. The mapping of discourse segmentation to acoustic-phonetic analyses was made on two structural levels: micro and macro. A positive effect of local temporal variation in discourse structuring was not found, however, the existence of a link between the narrative internal segmentation and speech rate variation was identified. This variation is long-term, progressive and gradual which suggests a manipulation of this feature. In relation to the content, temporal values can be seen as contextual cues: relevant information is presented with a slower speech rate; while minor content is presented with a faster speech rate",

    "abstract": "A computational model for vowel production has been used to simulate rising pitch glides in the time domain. Such glides reveal multi-faceted nonlinear system behaviour when the fundamental frequency f_o is near the first vocal tract resonance f_{R1}. There are multiple physical mechanisms for how the acoustic field in the vocal tract can interact with vocal fold dynamics causing this behaviour. The model used in this work includes the direct impact of the acoustic pressure on the transversal plane of the vocal folds and an acoustic perturbation component to the glottal flow. Simulations indicate that both of these mechanisms, when applied separately, cause similar perturbations in phonation parameters when f_o crosses f_{R1}. Enabling both mechanisms simultaneously tends to make the separately emerging features more prominent. In simulated glottal flow waveforms, the tendency towards a formant ripple increases when acoustic feedback to glottal flow is enabled, whereas the phenomenon occurs more rarely as a result of the direct acoustic pressure to vocal folds. In all cases, the formant ripple is more pronounced for frequencies below f_{R1}",

    "abstract": "Movements of articulators (e.g., tongue, lips and jaw) in different speaking rates are related in a complex manner. In this work, we examine the underlying function to transform articulatory movements involved in producing speech at a neutral speaking rate into those at fast and slow speaking rates (N2F and N2S). For this we use articulatory movement data collected from five subjects using an Electromagnetic articulograph at neutral, fast and slow speaking rates. As candidate transformation functions (TF), we use affine transformations with a diagonal matrix and a full matrix and a nonlinear function modeled by a deep neural network (DNN). Since the duration of an utterance in different speaking rates would typically be unequal, it is required to time align the articulatory movement trajectories, which, in turn, affects the TF learnt. Therefore, we propose an iterative algorithm to alternately optimize for the TF and the time alignments. Subject specific experiments reveal that while N2F transformation can be well described by an affine transformation with a full matrix, N2S transformation is better represented by a more complex nonlinear function modeled by a DNN. This could be because subjects exhibit gross articulatory movements during fast speech and hyper-articulate while producing slow speech",

    "abstract": "Glottal activity information can be very important in several speech processing applications, such as in speech therapy, voice disorder diagnosis, voice transformation and text-to-speech synthesis. However, the use of algorithms for estimating glottal parameters from the speech signal is very limited in those applications because of problems with robustness and accuracy. For this reason, current research studies of the glottal source are usually constrained to isolated speech sounds or short segments of speech recorded in controlled conditions and methods requiring manual intervention. An alternative way to obtain more accurate and reliable glottal parameter estimates is to use other recording equipment besides the audio microphone. Electroglottography is the most popular non-invasive measurement of vocal fold motion. It has been widely used to estimate the glottal opening and closing instants, but it does not provide direct information about the other important glottal parameters. This paper proposes an automatic method for estimation of the glottal parameters from the electroglottographic signal that permits to measure an additional parameter related to the asymmetry of the glottal flow pulse. This is a very important characteristic correlated with voice quality and widely studied in voice source analysis, commonly represented by the speed quotient parameter",

We pose the problem as a classification problem where colors of each pixel and its neighborhood is classified as belonging to inside or outside the glottis region. We further process the classification result to get the biggest cluster, which is declared as the segmented glottis. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on a dataset comprising of stroboscopic videos from 18 subjects where the glottis region is marked by the three Speech Language Pathologists (SLPs). On average, the proposed DNN based segmentation scheme achieves a localization performance of 65.33% and segmentation DICE score of 0.74 (absolute), which is better than the baseline scheme by 22.66% and 0.09 respectively.

    "abstract": "Tonal variations in continuous speech are complicated in nature and it is a challenge to identify the effect of tonal coarticulation given several influencing factors. To address the issue, the present study proposes a scheme for labeling tonal coarticulation in Mandarin continuous speech by applying Hypo- and Hyper-articulation theory. We assume that the bidirectional tonal coarticulation (both carryover and anticipatory effects) as patterns of Hypo-articulation results from the economical articulatory rule. The effects may partially disappear under the influence of specific stress patterns and become unidirectional (carryover or anticipatory). At a prosodic boundary, the effects of tonal coarticulation may completely disappear and lead to the occurrence of patterns of Hyper-articulation. Based on the scheme, we have labeled the data in the Annotated Speech Corpus of Chinese Discourse. It is shown that: three annotators are consistent at a fairly high level (86.2%) on average and the acoustic parameters of four kinds of tonal coarticulation are significantly different. Therefore, we conclude that the proposal is feasible for investigating tonal coarticulation in Mandarin continuous speech. Though the labeling scheme is language dependent, it may well have cross-linguistic implications",

    "abstract": "Automatic speech recognition in far-field reverberant environments is challenging even with the state-of-the-art recognition systems. The main issues are artifacts in the signal due to the long-term reverberation that results in temporal smearing. The autoregressive modeling approach to speech feature extraction involves representing the high energy regions of the signal which are less susceptible to noise. In this paper, we propose a novel method of speech feature extraction using multivariate AR modeling (MAR) of temporal envelopes. The sub-band discrete cosine transform coefficients obtained from multiple speech bands are used in a multivariate linear prediction setting to derive features for speech recognition. For single channel far-field speech recognition, the features are derived using multi-band linear prediction. In the case of multi-channel far-field speech recognition, we use the multi-channel data in the MAR framework. We perform several speech recognition experiments in the REVERB Challenge database for single and multi-microphone settings. In these experiments, the proposed feature extraction method provides significant improvements over baseline methods (average relative improvements of 9.7% and 3.9% in single microphone conditions for clean and multi-conditions respectively and 6.3% in multi-microphone conditions). The results with clean training on single microphone conditions further illustrates the effectiveness of the MAR features",

Even though Google Room Simulator in [1] was shown to be quite effective in reducing the Word Error Rates (WERs) for far-field applications by generating simulated far-field training sets, it requires a very large number of FFTs. Room Simulator used approximately 80% of CPU usage in our CPU/GPU training architecture [2]. In this work, we implement an efficient OverLap Addition (OLA) based filtering using the open-source FFTW3 library. Further, we investigate the effects of the Room Impulse Response (RIR) lengths. Experimentally, we conclude that we can cut the tail portions of RIRs whose power is less than 20 dB below the maximum power without sacrificing the speech recognition accuracy. However, we observe that cutting RIR tail more than this threshold harms the speech recognition accuracy for rerecorded test sets. Using these approaches, we were able to reduce CPU usage for the room simulator portion down to 9.69% in CPU/GPU training architecture. Profiling result shows that we obtain 22.4 times speed-up on a single machine and 37.3 times speed up on Google's distributed training infrastructure",

    "abstract": "Exploiting multiple microphones has been a widely-used strategy for robust automatic speech recognition (ASR). Particularly, in a general hands-free scenario, acquisition of speech usually happens using a set of distributed microphones or arrays simultaneously. Each microphone or array (defined as a stream) carries a different quality of information. The technique of stream fusion is beneficial to provide the best distant recognition performance against the effects of potential disturbances such as noise, reverberation, as well as the speaker movement. In this work, we propose a stream attention framework to improve the far-field ASR performance in the distributed multi-microphone configuration. Frame-level attention vectors have been derived by predicting the ASR performance of the acoustic modeling of individual streams using the posterior probabilities from the classifier. They are used to characterize the amount of useful information each stream contributes, for the purpose of an efficient and better-performing decoding scheme. In this paper, we investigate the ASR performance measures using our proposed stream attention system on real recorded datasets, Mixer-6 and DIRHA-WSJ.

    "abstract": "The goal of this work is to develop a meeting transcription system that can recognize speech even when utterances of different speakers are overlapped. While speech overlaps have been regarded as a major obstacle in accurately transcribing meetings, a traditional beamformer with a single output has been exclusively used because previously proposed speech separation techniques have critical constraints for application to real meetings. This paper proposes a new signal processing module, called an unmixing transducer and describes its implementation using a windowed BLSTM. The unmixing transducer has a fixed number, say J, of output channels, where J may be different from the number of meeting attendees and transforms an input multi-channel acoustic signal into J time-synchronous audio streams. Each utterance in the meeting is separated and emitted from one of the output channels. Then, each output signal can be simply fed to a speech recognition back-end for segmentation and transcription. Our meeting transcription system using the unmixing transducer outperforms a system based on a state-of-the-art neural mask-based beamformer by 10.8%. Significant improvements are observed in overlapped segments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that applies overlapped speech recognition to unconstrained real meeting audio",

Recently, it has been shown that this estimator can also be trained to perform dereverberation and denoising jointly. However, up to now a comparison of a neural beamformer and WPE is still missing, so is an investigation into a combination of the two. Therefore, we here provide an extensive evaluation of both and consequently propose variants to integrate deep neural network based beamforming with WPE. For these integrated variants we identify a consistent WER reduction on two distinct databases. In particular, our study shows that deep learning based beamforming benefits from a model-based dereverberation technique (i.e. WPE) and vice versa.

    "title": "Expressive Speech Synthesis via Modeling Expressions with Variational Autoencoder",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recent advances in neural autoregressive models have improve the performance of speech synthesis (SS). However, as they lack the ability to model global characteristics of speech (such as speaker individualities or speaking styles), particularly when these characteristics have not been labeled, making neural autoregressive SS systems more expressive is still an open issue. In this paper, we propose to combine VoiceLoop, an autoregressive SS model, with Variational Autoencoder (VAE). This approach, unlike traditional autoregressive SS systems, uses VAE to model the global characteristics explicitly, enabling the expressiveness of the synthesized speech to be controlled in an unsupervised manner. Experiments using the VCTK and Blizzard2012 datasets show the VAE helps VoiceLoop to generate higher quality speech and to control the experssions in its synthesized speech by incorporating global characteristics into the speech generating process",

    "title": "Rapid Style Adaptation Using Residual Error Embedding for Expressive Speech Synthesis",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Synthesizing expressive speech with appropriate prosodic variations, e.g., various styles, still has much room for improvement. Previous methods have explored to use manual annotations as conditioning attributes to provide variation information. However, the related training data are expensive to obtain and the annotated style codes can be ambiguous and unreliable. In this paper, we explore utilizing the residual error as conditioning attributes. The residual error is the difference between the prediction of a trained average model and the ground truth. We encode the residual error into a style embedding via a neural network-based error encoder. The embedding is then fed to the target synthesis model to provide information for modeling various style distributions more accurately. The average model and the error encoder are jointly optimized with the target synthesis model. Our proposed method has two advantages: 1) the embedding is automatically learned with no need of manual annotations, which helps overcome data sparsity and ambiguity limitations; 2) For any unseen audio utterance, the style embedding can be efficiently generated. This enables rapid adaptation to the desired style to be achieved with only one adaptation utterance. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the baseline in speech quality and style similarity",

    "abstract": "Whereas systems based on deep learning have been proposed to learn efficient representations of emotional speech data, methods such as Bag-of-Audio-Words (BoAW) have yielded similar or even better performance while providing understandable representations of the data. In those representations, however, context information is overlooked as the BoAW include only local information. In this paper, we propose to learn a novel representation ‘Bag-of-Context-Aware-Words' that encapsulates the context with neighbouring frames of BoAW; segment-level BoAW are extracted in the first layer which are then utilised to create a final instance-level bag. Such a hierarchical structure of BoAW enables the system to learn representations with context information. To evaluate the effectiveness of the method, we perform extensive experiments on a time- and value-continuous spontaneous emotion database: RECOLA. The results show that, the best segment length for valence is twice of that for arousal, suggesting that the prediction of the emotional valence requires more context information than the prediction of arousal and the performance obtained on RECOLA with the proposed Bag-of-Context-Aware-Words outperforms all previously reported results",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes an attention pooling based representation learning method for speech emotion recognition (SER). The emotional representation is learned in an end-to-end fashion by applying a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) directly to spectrograms extracted from speech utterances. Motivated by the success of GoogLeNet, two groups of filters with different shapes are designed to capture both temporal and frequency domain context information from the input spectrogram. The learned features are concatenated and fed into the subsequent convolutional layers. To learn the final emotional representation, a novel attention pooling method is further proposed. Compared with the existing pooling methods, such as max-pooling and average-pooling, the proposed attention pooling can effectively incorporate class-agnostic bottom-up and class-specific top-down, attention maps. We conduct extensive evaluations on benchmark IEMOCAP data to assess the effectiveness of the proposed representation. Results demonstrate a recognition performance of 71.8% weighted accuracy (WA) and 68% unweighted accuracy (UA) over four emotions, which outperforms the state-of-the-art method by about 3% absolute for WA and 4% for UA",

The neural network architecture contains a set of convolutional neural network (CNN) layers and bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) layers to account for both temporal and spectral variation and model contextual content. Experimental results of predicting valence and arousal on the SEMAINE database and the RECOLA database show that the proposed model significantly outperforms model using hand-engineered features, by exploiting waveforms and spectrograms as input. We also compare the effects of waveforms vs. spectrograms and find that waveforms are better at capturing arousal, while spectrograms are better at capturing valence. Moreover, combining information from both inputs provides further improvement to the performance",

In particular, deep generative models such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have gained enormous success in generating features for natural images. Inspired by this, we propose VAEs for deriving the latent representation of speech signals and use this representation to classify emotions.

Large amount of parallel data from speech and articulatory motion is required for training an AAI model in a subject dependent manner, referred to as subject dependent AAI (SD-AAI). Electromagnetic articulograph (EMA) is a promising technology to record such parallel data, but it is expensive, time consuming and tiring for a subject. In order to reduce the demand for parallel acoustic-articulatory data in the AAI task for a subject, we, in this work, propose a subject-adaptative AAI method (SA-AAI) from an existing AAI model which is trained using large amount of parallel data from a fixed set of subjects. Experiments are performed with 30 subjects' acoustic-articulatory data and AAI is trained using BLSTM network to examine the amount of data needed from a new target subject for the SA-AAI to achieve an AAI performance equivalent to that of SD-AAI. Experimental results reveal that the proposed SA-AAI performs similar to that of the SD-AAI with ∼62.5% less training data.

    "abstract": "For the benefit of spoken language training, concatenation based articulatory video synthesis has been proposed in the past to overcome the limitation in the articulatory data recording. For this, real time magnetic resonance imaging (rt-MRI) video image-frames (IFs) containing articulatory movements have been used. These IFs require a visual augmentation for better understanding. We, in this work, propose an augmentation method using pixel intensities in the regions enclosed by the articulatory boundaries obtained from air-tissue boundaries (ATBs). Since, the pixel intensities reflect the muscle movements in the articulators, the augmented IFs could provide realistic articulatory movements, when we color them accordingly. However, the ATB manual annotation is time consuming; hence, we propose to synthesize ATBs using the ATBs from a few selected frames that have been used in synthesizing the articulatory videos. We augment a set of synthesized articulatory videos for 50 words obtained from the MRI-TIMIT database. Subjective evaluation on the quality of the augmented videos using twenty-one subjects suggests that the videos are visually more appealing than the respective synthesized rt-MRI videos with a rating of 3.75 out of 5, where a score of 5 (1) indicates that the augmented video quality is excellent (poor)",

PBV prostheses are electronic adaptations of the traditional Pneumatic Artificial Larynx (PAL) device.

Following the PAL design closely, the PBV prosthesis is anticipated to substitute the medical gold standard of voice prostheses by generating a similar voice quality while remaining non-invasive and non-surgical. This paper describes a statistical approach to estimate the excitation waveform of the PBV source using the PAL as a reference. A Gaussian mixture model of the joint probability density of respiration and PAL voice features is implemented to estimate the excitation waveform of the PBV. The evaluation on a database of more than two hours of continuous speech shows a close match between f0 pattern and mel-cepstra of the estimated PBV source and the PAL. When used to re-synthesize the original speech, the intelligibility of the PBV speech remains high and is scored 7.1±0.4 compared to 7.9±0.15 of the original PAL source",

This method allows speech processing without requiring that an acoustic signal is present; however, reattachment of the EMG electrodes causes subtle changes in the recorded signal, which degrades the recognition accuracy and thus poses a major challenge for practical application of the system. Based on the growing body of recent work in domain-adversarial training of neural networks, we present a system which adapts the neural network frontend of our recognizer to data from a new recording session, without requiring supervised enrollment",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Silent Speech Interface systems apply two different strategies to solve the articulatory-to-acoustic conversion task. The recognition-and-synthesis approach applies speech recognition techniques to map the articulatory data to a textual transcript, which is then converted to speech by a conventional text-to-speech system. The direct synthesis approach seeks to convert the articulatory information directly to speech synthesis (vocoder) parameters. In both cases, deep neural networks are an evident and popular choice to learn the mapping task. Recognizing that the learning of speech recognition and speech synthesis targets (acoustic model states vs. vocoder parameters) are two closely related tasks over the same ultrasound tongue image input, here we experiment with the multi-task training of deep neural networks, which seeks to solve the two tasks simultaneously. Our results show that the parallel learning of the two types of targets is indeed beneficial for both tasks. Moreover, we obtained further improvements by using multi-task training as a weight initialization step before task-specific training. Overall, we report a relative error rate reduction of about 7% in both the speech recognition and the speech synthesis tasks",

    "title": "Transcription Correction for Indian Languages Using Acoustic Signatures",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Accurate phonetic transcription of the speech corpus has a significant impact on the performance of speech processing applications especially for low resource languages. Mismatches between the transcriptions and their utterances occur often at phoneme level due to insertion/deletion/substitution errors. This is very common in Indian languages owing to schwa deletion in the context of vowels and agglutination in the context of consonants. An attempt is made in this paper to use acoustic cues at the syllable level to remove vowels from the transcription when they are poorly articulated or absent. Hidden Markov model (HMM) based forced Viterbi alignment (FVA) and group delay (GD) based signal processing are employed in tandem to achieve this task. Disagreement between FVA (which produces vowel boundaries based on transcription) and GD boundaries (which uses signal processing cues for syllables) are used to correct the transcription. An increase in likelihood of 0.3% is observed across 3 Indian languages, namely, Gujarati, Telugu and Tamil",

    "abstract": "India being a multilingual society, a multilingual automatic speech recognition system (ASR) is widely appreciated. Despite different orthographies, Indian languages share same phonetic space. To exploit this property, a joint acoustic model has been trained for developing multilingual ASR system using a common phone-set. Three Indian languages namely Telugu, Tamil and, Gujarati are considered for the study. This work studies the amenability of two different acoustic modeling approaches for training a joint acoustic model using common phone-set. Sub-space Gaussian mixture models (SGMM) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) trained with connectionist temporal classification (CTC) objective function are explored for training joint acoustic models. From the experimental results, it can be observed that the joint acoustic models trained with RNN-CTC have performed better than SGMM system even on 120 hours of data (approx 40 hrs per language). The joint acoustic model trained with RNN-CTC has performed better than monolingual models, due to an efficient data sharing across the languages. Conditioning the joint model with language identity had a minimal advantage. Sub-sampling the features by a factor of 2 while training RNN-CTC models has reduced the training times and has performed better",

Articulatory features (AF) which capture the underlying attributes of speech production are found to be robust to channel and speaker variations. However, building an efficient articulatory classifier to extract AF requires an enormous amount of data. In low resource acoustic modeling, we propose to train the bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) articulatory classifier by pooling data from the available low resource Indian languages, namely, Gujarati, Tamil and Telugu. This is done in the context of Microsoft Indian Language challenge. Similarly, we train a multilingual bottleneck feature extractor and an SBF extractor using the pooled data. To bias, the SBF network towards the target language, a second network in the stacked architecture was trained using the target language alone. The performance of ASR system trained with stand-alone AF is observed to be at par with the multilingual bottleneck features. When the AF and the biased SBF are appended, they are found to outperform the conventional filterbank features in the multilingual deep neural network (DNN) framework and the high-resolution Mel frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) features in the time-delayed neural network(TDNN) framework",

    "abstract": "Noise statistics and speech spectrum characteristics are the essential information for the single channel speech enhancement. The signal processing-based methods mainly rely on noise statistics estimation. They perform very well for stationary noise, but have remained difficult to cope with non-stationary noise. While the deep learning-based methods mainly focus on the perception on the spectrum characteristics of speech and have a capacity in dealing with non-stationary noise. However, the performance would degrade dramatically for the unseen noise types, which could be due to the over-reliance on data and the ignorance to domain knowledge of signal process. Obviously, the hybrid signal processing/deep learning scheme may be a smart alternative. In this paper, we incorporate the powerful perceptual capabilities of deep learning in the conventional speech enhancement framework. Deep learning is used to estimate the speech presence probability and the update factor of noise statistics, which are then integrated into the Wiener filter-based speech enhancement structure to enhance the desired speech. All components are jointly optimized by a spectrum approximation objective.

In this paper, we propose an adversarial feature-mapping (AFM) method for speech enhancement which advances the feature-mapping approach with adversarial learning. An additional discriminator network is introduced to distinguish the enhanced features from the real clean ones. The two networks are jointly optimized to minimize the feature-mapping loss and simultaneously mini-maximize the discrimination loss. The distribution of the enhanced features is further pushed towards that of the clean features through this adversarial multi-task training. To achieve better performance on ASR task, senone-aware (SA) AFM is further proposed in which an acoustic model network is jointly trained with the feature-mapping and discriminator networks to optimize the senone classification loss in addition to the AFM losses. Evaluated on the CHiME-3 dataset, the proposed AFM achieves 16.95% and 5.27% relative word error rate (WER) improvements over the real noisy data and the feature-mapping baseline respectively and the SA-AFM achieves 9.85% relative WER improvement over the multi-conditional acoustic model",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in neural network (NN)-based speech enhancement schemes are shown to outperform most conventional techniques. However, the performance of such systems in adverse listening conditions such as negative signal-to-noise ratios and unseen noises is still far from that of humans. Motivated by the remarkable performance of humans under these challenging conditions, this paper investigates whether biophysically-inspired features can mitigate the poor generalization capabilities of NN-based speech enhancement systems. We make use of features derived from several human auditory periphery models for training a speech enhancement system that employs long short-term memory (LSTM) and evaluate them on a variety of mismatched testing conditions. The results reveal that biophysically-inspired auditory models such as nonlinear transmission line models improve the generalizability of LSTM-based noise suppression systems in terms of various objective quality measures, suggesting that such features lead to robust speech representations that are less sensitive to the noise type",

In our recent work, a maximum likelihood (ML) approach to parameter learning by modeling the prediction error vector as a Gaussian density was proposed. In this study, our preliminary statistical analysis reveals the super-Gaussianity and asymmetricity of the prediction error distribution. Consequently, we adopt the asymmetric Laplace distribution (ALD) instead of the Gaussian distribution (GD) to model the prediction error vectors. Then the new derivation for optimizing the the proposed ML-ALD-DNN with both DNN and ALD parameters is presented. Moreover, we can well interpret the asymmetry parameter of ALD as the balance control between noise reduction and speech preservation from both formulations and experiments. This implies that the customization of DNN models for the different noise types and levels is possible by the setting of the asymmetry parameter. Finally, our ML-ALD-DNN approach achieves better STOI and SSNR measures over both MMSE-DNN and ML-GD-DNN approaches",

    "title": "A Priori SNR Estimation Based on a Recurrent Neural Network for Robust Speech Enhancement",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Speech enhancement under highly non-stationary noise conditions remains a challenging problem. Classical methods typically attempt to identify a frequency-domain optimal gain function that suppresses noise in noisy speech. These algorithms typically produce artifacts such as \"musical noise\" that are detrimental to machine and human understanding, largely due to inaccurate estimation of noise power spectra. The optimal gain function is commonly referred to as the ideal ratio mask (IRM) in neural-network-based systems and the goal becomes estimation of the IRM from the short-time Fourier transform amplitude of degraded speech. While these data-driven techniques are able to enhance speech quality with reduced artifacts, they are frequently not robust to types of noise that they had not been exposed to in the training process. In this paper, we propose a novel recurrent neural network (RNN) that bridges the gap between classical and neural-network-based methods. By reformulating the classical decision-directed approach, the a priori and a posteriori SNRs become latent variables in the RNN, from which the frequency-dependent estimated likelihood of speech presence is used to update recursively the latent variables. The proposed method provides substantial enhancement of speech quality and objective accuracy in machine interpretation of speech",

The proposed MIL framework uses audio embeddings extracted from a pre-trained convolutional neural network as input features. We show that by using audio embeddings the MIL framework can be implemented using a simple DNN with performance comparable to recurrent neural networks. We evaluate our approach by training an audio tagging system using a subset of AudioSet, which is a large collection of weakly labeled YouTube video excerpts. Combined with a late-fusion approach, we improve the F1 score of a baseline audio tagging system by 17%. We show that audio embeddings extracted by the convolutional neural networks significantly boost the performance of all MIL models.

Although the traditional Bag of Audio Words (BoAW) and the Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) approaches can obtain more statistics information by aggregating multiple frame-level descriptors of an audio segment compared with the frame-level feature learning methods, its temporal information is unreserved. Recently, more and more Deep Neural Networks (DNN) based AER methods have been proposed to effectively capture the temporal information in audio signals and achieved better performance, however, these methods usually required the manually annotated labels and fixed-length input during feature learning process. In this paper, we proposed a novel unsupervised temporal feature learning method, which can effectively capture the temporal dynamics for an entire audio signal with arbitrary duration by building direct connections between the BoAW histograms sequence and its time indexes using a non-linear Support Vector Regression (SVR) model. Furthermore, to make the feature representation have a better signal reconstruction ability, we embedded the sparse coding approach in the conventional BoAW framework.

Environmental sounds generally involve more sound sources while exhibiting less structure in temporal spectral representations.

In this work, we investigated using auditory summary statistics as the feature for ASC tasks. The inspiration comes from a recent neuroscience study, which shows the human auditory system tends to perceive sound textures through time-averaged statistics. Based on these statistics, we further proposed to use linear discriminant analysis to eliminate redundancies among these statistics while keeping the discriminative information, providing an extreme compact representation for acoustic scenes.

This matrix is fed to a deep matrix factorization pipeline (with audio recording level max-pooling) to compute a sparse-convex discriminative representation. The proposed deep factorization model is based on archetypal analysis, a form of convex NMF, which has been shown to be well suited for audio analysis. Finally, the obtained representation is mapped to a class label using a dictionary based auto-encoder consisting of linear and symmetric encoder and decoder with an efficient learning algorithm. The encoder projects the ASe of a waveform to the label space, while the decoder ensures that the feature can be reconstructed, resulting in better generalization on the test data",

Several approaches have been published to date which either develop novel classifiers or employ well-trained static classifiers with a detection front-end. This paper takes the latter approach, by combining a proven CNN classifier acting on spectrogram image features, with time-frequency shaped energy detection that identifies seed regions within the spectrogram that are characteristic of auditory energy events. Furthermore, the shape detector is optimised to allow early detection of events as they are developing. Since some sound events naturally have longer durations than others, waiting until completion of entire events before classification may not be practical in a deployed system. The early detection capability of the system is thus evaluated for the classification of partial events. Performance for continuous event detection is shown to be good, with accuracy being maintained well when detecting partial events",

Due to the expensive training, the RNNLM's vocabulary set accommodates only small shortlist of most frequent words. This leads to suboptimal performance if an input speech contains many out-of-shortlist (OOS) words. An effective solution is to increase the shortlist size and retrain the entire network which is highly inefficient. Therefore, we propose an efficient method to expand the shortlist set of a pretrained RNNLM without incurring expensive retraining and using additional training data. Our method exploits the structure of RNNLM which can be decoupled into three parts: input projection layer, middle layers and output projection layer. Specifically, our method expands the word embedding matrices in projection layers and keeps the middle layers unchanged. In this approach, the functionality of the pretrained RNNLM will be correctly maintained as long as OOS words are properly modeled in two embedding spaces. We propose to model the OOS words by borrowing linguistic knowledge from appropriate in-shortlist words.

Since the vanilla GAN has limitations when generating discrete sequences, the proposed framework is optimized though the policy gradient algorithm.

Results show the proposed method achieved lower character error rates on both datasets compared with the maximum likelihood method, whereas it increased perplexities slightly.

However, recent studies indicate that NN language models (LM) need only limited length of history to achieve excellent performance. In this paper, we extend the previous investigation on LSTM network based n-gram modeling to the domain of automatic speech recognition (ASR). First, applying recent optimization techniques and up to 6-layer LSTM networks, we improve LM perplexities by nearly 50% relative compared to classic count models on three different domains. Then, we demonstrate by experimental results that perplexities improve significantly only up to 40-grams when limiting the LM history. Nevertheless, the ASR performance saturates already around 20-grams despite across sentence modeling. Analysis indicates that the performance gain of LSTM NNLM over count models results only partially from the longer context and cross sentence modeling capabilities. Using equal context, we show that deep 4-gram LSTM can significantly outperform large interpolated count models by performing the backing off and smoothing significantly better.

Our proposed approach achieves a 62.94% and 67.04% unweighted average recall (UAR), which is an 6.24% and 1.04% absolute improvement over the best baseline provided by the challenge organizer. We further provide a detailed comparison analyVoice control is a prominent interaction method on personal computing devices. While automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems are readily applicable for large audiences, there is room for further adaptation at the edge, ie. locally on devices, targeted for individual users. In this work, we explore improving ASR systems over time through a user's own interactions. Our online learning approach for speaker-adaptive language modeling leverages a user's most recent utterances to enhance the speaker dependent features and traits. We experiment with the Large-Vocabulary Continuous Speech Recognition corpus Tedlium v2 and demonstrate an average reduction in perplexity (PPL) of 19.18% and average relative reduction in word error rate (WER) of 2.80% compared to a state-of-the-art baseline on Tedlium v2.sis between different models",

    "title": "Efficient Language Model Adaptation with Noise Contrastive Estimation and Kullback-Leibler Regularization",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Many language modeling (LM) tasks have limited in-domain data for training. Exploiting out-of-domain data while retaining the relevant in-domain statistics is a desired property in these scenarios. Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) regularization is a popular method for acoustic model (AM) adaptation. KLD regularization assumes that the last layer is a softmax that fully activates the targets of both in-domain and out-of-domain models. Unfortunately, this softmax activation is computationally prohibitive for language modeling where the number of output classes is large, typically 50k to 100K, but may even exceed 800k in some cases. The computational bottleneck of the softmax during LM training can be reduced by an order of magnitude using techniques such as noise contrastive estimation (NCE), which replaces the cross-entropy loss function with a binary classification problem between the target output and random noise samples. In this work we combine NCE and KLD regularization and offer a fast domain adaptation method for LM training, while also retaining important attributes of the original NCE, such as self-normalization. We show on a medical domain-adaptation task that our method improves perplexity by 10.1% relative to a strong LSTM baseline",

Maladaptive psychological functioning appears in cognition, emotional experience and behaviour. In the time of the internet of things, a vast number of text and speech is available; subsequently, the interest in the automated detection of psychological functioning via language is rising. The current study indicates that depression and narcissism can be predicted through word use in personal narratives. Both conditions are characterised by an altered word count regarding anxiety and we (LIWC-based). While depressive individuals use less social words and more anxiety-related words, narcissists do the opposite. This might reflect the verbal correlate of the cognitive triad in depression. In contrast, narcissists' word use mirrors their excommunicated anxiety of being an undesired self and their inability to reach long-term goals due to a lack of impulse control. The automated recognition of mental state through word use could improve early detection of mental disease, monitoring of disease course, delivery of tailored interventions and evaluation of therapy outcome",

    "abstract": "Depression is a leading cause of disease burden worldwide, however there is an unmet need for screening and diagnostic measures that can be widely deployed in real-world environments. Voice-based diagnostic methods are convenient, non-invasive to elicit and can be collected and processed in near real-time using modern smartphones, smart speakers and other devices. Studies in voice-based depression detection to date have primarily focused on laboratory-collected voice samples, which are not representative of typical user environments or devices. This paper conducts the first investigation of voice-based depression assessment techniques on real-world data from 887 speakers, recorded using a variety of different smartphones. Evaluations on 16 hours of speech show that conservative segment selection strategies using highly thresholded voice activity detection, coupled with tailored normalization approaches are effective for mitigating smartphone channel variability and background environmental noise. Together, these strategies can achieve F1 scores comparable with or better than those from a combination of clean recordings, a single recording environment and long utterances. The scalability of speech elicitation via smartphone allows detailed models dependent on gender, smartphone manufacturer and/or elicitation task. Interestingly, results herein suggest that normalization based on these criteria may be more effective than tailored models for detecting depressed speech",

    "abstract": "Depression is a common mental health problem around the world with a large burden on economies, well-being, hence productivity, of individuals. Its early diagnosis and treatment are critical to reduce the costs and even save lives. One key aspect to achieve that goal is to use voice technologies and monitor depression remotely and relatively inexpensively using automated agents. Although there has been efforts to automatically assess depression levels from audiovisual features, use of transcriptions along with the acoustic features has emerged as a more recent research venue. Moreover, difficulty in data collection and the limited amounts of data available for research are also challenges that are hampering the success of the algorithms. One of the novel contributions in this paper is to exploit the databases from multiple languages for feature selection. Since a large number of features can be extracted from speech and given the small amounts of training data available, effective data selection is critical for success. Our proposed multi-lingual method was effective at selecting better features and significantly improved the depression assessment accuracy. We also use text-based features for assessment and propose a novel strategy to fuse the text- and speech-based classifiers which further boosted the performance",

Automatic classification of dysarthria from speech can be used as a potential clinical tool in medical treatment. This paper examines the effectiveness of glottal source parameters in dysarthric speech classification from three categories of speech signals, namely non-words, words and sentences. In addition to the glottal parameters, two sets of acoustic parameters extracted by the openSMILE toolkit are used as baseline features. A dysarthric speech classification system is proposed by training support vector machines (SVMs) using features extracted from speech utterances and their labels indicating dysarthria/healthy. Classification accuracy results indicate that the glottal parameters contain discriminating information required for the identification of dysarthria. Additionally, the complementary nature of the glottal parameters is demonstrated when these parameters, in combination with the openSMILE-based acoustic features, result in improved classification accuracy. Analysis of classification accuracies of the glottal and openSMILE features for non-words, words and sentences is carried out. Results indicate that in terms of classification accuracy the word level is best suited in identifying the presence of dysarthria",

Our aim is to show that a temporal speech parameter set consisting of articulation tempo, speech tempo and various pause-related indicators, originally defined for the sake of early detection of various dementia types such as Mild Cognitive Impairment and early Alzheimer's Disease, is able to capture specific differences in the spontaneous speech of the two groups. We tested the applicability of the temporal indicators by machine learning (i.e. by using Support-Vector Machines). Our results show that members of the two speaker groups could be identified with classification accuracy scores of between 70-80% and F-measure scores between 81% and 87%.

The main problems being addressed are the lack of training speech in the intended application domain and the relevant degradation of ASR performance for impaired speech of PWA. We adopt the TDNN-BLSTM structure for acoustic modeling and apply the technique of multi-task learning with large amount of domain-mismatched data. This leads to a significant improvement on the recognition accuracy, as compared with a conventional single-task learning DNN system. To facilitate the extraction of robust text features for quantifying language impairment in PWA speech, we propose to incorporate N-best hypotheses and confusion network representation of the ASR output. The severity of impairment is predicted from text features and supra-segmental duration features using different regression models.

Understanding how interlocutors tend to adapt to each other's speaking style through entrainment involves measuring a range of acoustic features and comparing those via multiple signal comparison methods. In this work, we present a turn-level distance measure obtained in an unsupervised manner using a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model, which we call Neural Entrainment Distance (NED). This metric establishes a framework that learns an embedding from the population-wide entrainment in an unlabeled training corpus. We use the framework for a set of acoustic features and validate the measure experimentally by showing its efficacy in distinguishing real conversations from fake ones created by randomly shuffling speaker turns. Moreover, we show real world evidence of the validity of the proposed measure.

More specifically, we present results for the assessment of the degree of Parkinson's Disease, the detection of a Cold and both the detection and assessment of the degree of Depression. To this end, we use a neural network in which all operations are performed in an FHE context. This implies replacing the activation functions by linear and second degree polynomials, as only additions and multiplications are viable. Furthermore, to guarantee that the inputs of these activation functions fall within the convergence interval of the approximation, a batch normalization layer is introduced before each activation function. After training the network with unencrypted data, the resulting model is then employed in an encrypted version of the network, to produce encrypted predictions. Our tests show that the use of this framework yields results with little to no performance degradation, in comparison to the baselines produced for the same datasets",

    "abstract": "In speech pathology, new assistive technologies using ASR and machine learning approaches are being developed for detecting speech disorder events. Classically-trained ASR model tends to remove disfluencies from spoken utterances, due to its focus on producing clean and readable text output. However, diagnostic systems need to be able to track speech disfluencies, such as stuttering events, in order to determine the severity level of stuttering. To achieve this, ASR systems must be adapted to recognise full verbatim utterances, including pseudo-words and non-meaningful part-words. This work proposes a training regime to address this problem and preserve a full verbatim output of stuttering speech. We use a lightly-supervised approach using task-oriented lattices to recognise the stuttering speech of children performing a standard reading task. This approach improved the WER by 27.8% relative to a baseline that uses word-lattices generated from the original prompt. The improved results preserved 63% of stuttering events (including sound, word, part-word and phrase repetition and revision). This work also proposes a separate correction layer on top of the ASR that detects prolongation events (which are poorly recognised by the ASR). This increases the percentage of preserved stuttering events to 70%",

We propose in this paper to investigate these results obtained on ATIS from a qualitative point of view rather than just a quantitative point of view and answer the two following questions: what kind of qualitative improvement brought DNN models to SLU on the ATIS corpus?

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Semantic frame parsing is a crucial component in spoken language understanding (SLU) to build spoken dialog systems. It has two main tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Although state-of-the-art approaches showed good results, they require large annotated training data and long training time. In this paper, we aim to alleviate these drawbacks for semantic frame parsing by utilizing the ubiquitous user information. We design a novel progressive deep neural network model to incorporate prior knowledge of user information intermediately to better and quickly train a semantic frame parser. Due to the lack of benchmark dataset with real user information, we synthesize the simplest type of user information (location and time) on ATIS benchmark data. The results show that our approach leverages such simple user information to outperform state-of-the-art approaches by 0.25% for intent detection and 0.31% for slot filling using standard training data. When using smaller training data, the performance improvement on intent detection and slot filling reaches up to 1.35% and 1.20% respectively. We also show that our approach can achieve similar performance as state-of-the-art approaches by using less than 80% annotated training data. Moreover, the training time to achieve the similar performance is also reduced by over 60%",

    "title": "An Efficient Approach to Encoding Context for Spoken Language Understanding",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In task-oriented dialogue systems, spoken language understanding, or SLU, refers to the task of parsing natural language user utterances into semantic frames. Making use of context from prior dialogue history holds the key to more effective SLU. State of the art approaches to SLU use memory networks to encode context by processing multiple utterances from the dialogue at each turn, resulting in significant trade-offs between accuracy and computational efficiency. On the other hand, downstream components like the dialogue state tracker (DST) already keep track of the dialogue state, which can serve as a summary of the dialogue history. In this work, we propose an efficient approach to encoding context from prior utterances for SLU. More specifically, our architecture includes a separate recurrent neural network (RNN) based encoding module that accumulates dialogue context to guide the frame parsing sub-tasks and can be shared between SLU and DST. In our experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on dialogues from two domains",

    "abstract": "We propose an algorithm to denoise speakers from a single microphone in the presence of non-stationary and dynamic noise. Our approach is inspired by the recent success of neural network models separating speakers from other speakers and singers from instrumental accompaniment. Unlike prior art, we leverage embedding spaces produced with source-contrastive estimation, a technique derived from negative sampling techniques in natural language processing, while simultaneously obtaining a continuous inference mask. Our embedding space directly optimizes for the discrimination of speaker and noise by jointly modeling their characteristics. This space is generalizable in that it is not speaker or noise specific and is capable of denoising speech even if the model has not seen the speaker in the training set. Parameters are trained with dual objectives: one that promotes a selective bandpass filter that eliminates noise at time-frequency positions that exceed signal power and another that proportionally splits time-frequency content between signal and noise. We compare to state of the art algorithms as well as traditional sparse non-negative matrix factorization solutions. The resulting algorithm avoids severe computational burden by providing a more intuitive and easily optimized approach, while achieving competitive accuracy",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of monaural speech separation for simultaneous speakers. Recent studies such as uPIT, cuPIT-Grid LSTM and their variants have advanced the state-of-the-art separation models. Delta and acceleration coefficients are typically used in the objective function to capture short time dynamics. We consider that such coefficients don't benefit from the temporal information over a long range such as phoneme and syllable. In this paper, we propose a shifted delta coefficient (SDC) objective to explore the temporal information over a long range of the spectral dynamics. The SDC ensures the temporal continuity of output frames within the same speaker. In addition, we propose a novel multi-task learning framework, that we call SDC-MTL, by extending the SDC objective with a subtask of predicting the time-frequency labels ({silence, single, overlapped}) of the mixture. The experimental results show 11.7% and 3.9% relative improvements on WSJ0-2mix dataset under open conditions over the uPIT and cuPIT-Grid LSTM baselines.

We propose a two-stage separation strategy to address this problem in a noise-independent way. In the proposed system, denoising and cochannel separation are performed successively by two modules, which are based on a newly-introduced convolutional neural network for speech separation.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We introduce a monaural audio source separation framework using a latent generative model. Traditionally, discriminative training for source separation is proposed using deep neural networks or non-negative matrix factorization. In this paper, we propose a principled generative approach using variational autoencoders (VAE) for audio source separation. VAE computes efficient Bayesian inference which leads to a continuous latent representation of the input data(spectrogram). It contains a probabilistic encoder which projects an input data to latent space and a probabilistic decoder which projects data from latent space back to input space. This allows us to learn a robust latent representation of sources corrupted with noise and other sources. The latent representation is then fed to the decoder to yield the separated source. Both encoder and decoder are implemented via multilayer perceptron (MLP). In contrast to prevalent techniques, we argue that VAE is a more principled approach to source separation. Experimentally, we find that the proposed framework yields reasonable improvements when compared to baseline methods available in the literature i.e. DNN and RNN with different masking functions and autoencoders. We show that our method performs better than best of the relevant methods with ∼ 2 dB improvement in the source to distortion ratio",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Many applications of single channel source separation (SCSS) including automatic speech recognition (ASR), hearing aids etc. require an estimation of only one source from a mixture of many sources. Treating this special case as a regular SCSS problem where in all constituent sources are given equal priority in terms of reconstruction may result in a suboptimal separation performance. In this paper, we tackle the one source separation problem by suitably modifying the orthodox SCSS framework and focus only on one source at a time. The proposed approach is a generic framework that can be applied to any existing SCSS algorithm, improves performance and scales well when there are more than two sources in the mixture unlike most existing SCSS methods. Additionally, existing SCSS algorithms rely on fine hyper-parameter tuning hence making them difficult to use in practice. Our framework takes a step towards automatic tuning of the hyper-parameters thereby making our method better suited for the mixture to be separated and thus practically more useful. We test our framework on a neural network based algorithm and the results show an improved performance in terms of SDR and SAR",

First, we examine the impact of mixing speech and noise files on the fly during training, which enables models to be trained on virtually infinite amount of data. We also investigate the effect of using a novel signal-to-noise ratio related loss function, instead of mean-squared error which is prone to scaling differences among utterances. We evaluate bi-directional long-short term memory (BLSTM) networks as well as a combination of convolutional and BLSTM (CNN+BLSTM) networks for mask prediction and compare performances of real and complex-valued mask prediction.

    "abstract": "A broad range of artificially intelligent applications are nowadays available resulting in a need for masses of labelled data for the underlying machine learning models. This annotated data, however, is scarce and expensive to obtain from expert-like annotators. Crowdsourcing has been shown as a viable alternative, but it has to be carried out with adequate quality control to obtain reliable labels. Whilst crowdsourcing allows for the rapid collection of large-scale annotations, another technique called Cooperative Learning, aims at reducing the overall annotation costs, by learning to select only the most important instances for manual annotation. In this regard, we investigate the advantages of this approach and combine crowdsourcing with different iterative cooperative learning paradigms for audio data annotation, incorporating an annotator trustability score to reduce the labelling effort needed and, at the same time, to achieve better classification results. Key experimental results on an emotion recognition task show a considerable relative annotation reduction compared to a ‘non-intelligent' approach of up to 85.3%. Moreover, the proposed trustability-based methods reach an unweighted average recall of 74.8%, while the baseline approach peaks at 61.2%. Therefore, the proposed trustability-based approaches efficiently reduce the manual annotation load, as well as improving the model",

    "abstract": "Visual information can be incorporated into automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems to improve their robustness in adverse acoustic conditions. Conventional audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) systems require highly specialized audio-visual (AV) data in both system training and evaluation. For many real-world speech recognition applications, only audio information is available. This presents a major challenge to a wider application of AVSR systems. In order to address this challenge, this paper proposes a semi-supervised visual feature learning approach for developing AVSR systems on a DARPA GALE Mandarin broadcast transcription task. Audio to visual feature inversion long short-term memory neural networks (LSTMs) were initially constructed using limited amounts of out of domain AV data. The acoustic features domain mismatch against the broadcast data was further reduced using multi-level domain adaptive deep networks. Visual features were then automatically generated from the broadcast speech audio and used in both AVSR system training and testing time. Experimental results suggest a CNN based AVSR system using the proposed semi-supervised cross-domain audio-to-visual feature generation technique outperformed the baseline audio only CNN ASR system by an average CER reduction of 6.8% relative. In particular, on the most difficult Phoenix TV subset, a CER reduction of 1.32% absolute (8.34% relative) was obtained",

Dithering methods however provide an alternative approach, where both accuracy and energy are retained. We propose a hybrid coding approach where low-energy samples are quantized using dithering, instead of the conventional uniform quantizer.

To improve performance, many codecs use pre- and post-filtering techniques to reduce the perceptual effect of quantization-noise. In this paper, we propose a postfiltering method to attenuate quantization noise which uses the complex spectral correlations of speech signals. Since conventional speech codecs cannot transmit information with temporal dependencies as transmission errors could result in severe error propagation, we model the correlation offline and employ them at the decoder, hence removing the need to transmit any side information. Objective evaluation indicates an average 4 dB improvement in the perceptual SNR of signals using the context-based post-filter, with respect to the noisy signal and an average 2 dB improvement relative to the conventional Wiener filter.

    "abstract": "Audio codecs are typically transform-domain based and efficiently code stationary musical signals but they struggle with speech and signals with dense transients such as applause. The temporal noise shaping (TNS) tool standardized in HE-AAC alleviates the issue of noise unmasking in these troublesome cases via signal-adaptive filtering of the transform domain quantization noise, albeit at the cost of significant additional side information in the bitstream. We present a novel alternative referred to as companding that involves QMF domain pre- and post-processing around the core transform-domain coding system: prior to transform encoding, the dynamic range of the signal is reduced locally within a QMF time slot and restored again post decoding, which naturally shapes the coding noise temporally. A primary advantage is that the companding function is fixed and hence enables signal-adaptive noise shaping with just 1-2 bits of side-information per frame. Subjective tests illustrate that the proposed tool improves the quality of hard-to-code applause excerpts compared to TNS while achieving comparable performance on speech signals.

Comparing the discrete cosine model (DCM), the DAE-based compression shows better modelling accuracy of multi-frame LSF parameters and possesses an advantage in that the coder-layer dimensions could be any value. The compressed coder-layer dimensions of the DAE govern the trade-off between the modelling distortion and the coder-layer quantization distortion.

However, very limited effort has been made to understand DNN speaker embeddings. In this study, our aim is analyzing the behavior of the speaker recognition systems based on speaker embeddings toward different front-end features, including the standard Mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC), as well as power normalized cepstral coefficients (PNCC) and perceptual linear prediction (PLP). Using a speaker recognition system based on DNN speaker embeddings and probabilistic linear discriminant analysis (PLDA), we compared different approaches to leveraging complementary information using score-, embeddings- and feature-level combination. We report our results for Speakers in the Wild (SITW) and NIST SRE 2016 datasets. We found that first and second embeddings layers are complementary in nature. By applying score and embedding-level fusion we demonstrate relative improvements in equal error rate of 17% on NIST SRE 2016 and 10% on SITW over the baseline system",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a new method to extract speaker embeddings from a deep neural network (DNN) for text-independent speaker verification. Usually, speaker embeddings are extracted from a speaker-classification DNN that averages the hidden vectors over the frames of a speaker; the hidden vectors produced from all the frames are assumed to be equally important. We relax this assumption and compute the speaker embedding as a weighted average of a speaker's frame-level hidden vectors and their weights are automatically determined by a self-attention mechanism. The effect of multiple attention heads are also investigated to capture different aspects of a speaker's input speech. Finally, a PLDA classifier is used to compare pairs of embeddings. The proposed self-attentive speaker embedding system is compared with a strong DNN embedding baseline on NIST SRE 2016. We find that the self-attentive embeddings achieve superior performance. Moreover, the improvement produced by the self-attentive speaker embeddings is consistent with both short and long testing utterances",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "This paper presents an improved deep embedding learning method based on convolutional neural network (CNN) for short-duration speaker verification (SV). Existing deep learning-based SV methods generally extract frontend embeddings from a feed-forward deep neural network, in which the long-term speaker characteristics are captured via a pooling operation over the input speech. The extracted embeddings are then scored via a backend model, such as Probabilistic Linear Discriminative Analysis (PLDA). Two improvements are proposed for frontend embedding learning based on the CNN structure: (1) Motivated by the WaveNet for speech synthesis, dilated filters are designed to achieve a tradeoff between computational efficiency and receptive-filter size; and (2) A novel cross-convolutional-layer pooling method is exploited to capture 1st-order statistics for modelling long-term speaker characteristics. Specifically, the activations of one convolutional layer are aggregated with the guidance of the feature maps from the successive layer. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed methods, extensive experiments are conducted on the modified female portion of NIST SRE 2010 evaluations, with conditions ranging from 10s-10s to 5s-4s. Excellent performance has been achieved on each evaluation condition, significantly outperforming existing SV systems using i-vector and d-vector embeddings",

    "abstract": "In this research, we propose a novel raw waveform end-to-end DNNs for text-independent speaker verification. For speaker verification, many studies utilize the speaker embedding scheme, which trains deep neural networks as speaker identifiers to extract speaker features. However, this scheme has an intrinsic limitation in which the speaker feature, trained to classify only known speakers, is required to represent the identity of unknown speakers. Owing to this mismatch, speaker embedding systems tend to well generalize towards unseen utterances from known speakers, but are overfitted to known speakers. This phenomenon is referred to as speaker overfitting. In this paper, we investigated regularization techniques, a multi-step training scheme and a residual connection with pooling layers in the perspective of mitigating speaker overfitting which lead to considerable performance improvements. Technique effectiveness is evaluated using the VoxCeleb dataset, which comprises over 1,200 speakers from various uncontrolled environments. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to verify the success of end-to-end DNNs directly using raw waveforms in text-independent scenario. It shows an equal error rate of 7.4%, which is lower than i-vector/probabilistic linear discriminant analysis and end-to-end DNNs that use spectrograms",

These models ingest time-frequency representations of speech and can be trained to discriminate between a known set speakers. While embeddings learned in this way perform well, they typically require a large number of training data points for learning. In this work we propose deeply fused speaker embeddings - speaker representations that combine neural speaker embeddings with i-vectors. We show that by combining the two speaker representations we are able to learn robust speaker embeddings in a computationally efficient manner. We compare several different fusion strategies and find that the resulting speaker embeddings show significantly different verification performance. To this end we propose a novel fusion approach that uses an attention model to combine i-vectors with neural speaker embeddings. Our best performing embedding achieves an error rate of 3.17% using a simple cosine distance classifier. Combining our embeddings with a powerful Joint Bayesian classifier, we are able to further improve the performance of our speaker embeddings to 2.22%, which gave a 7.8% relative improvement over the baseline i-vector system",

    "abstract": "This paper explores novel ideas in building end-to-end deep neural network (DNN) based text-dependent speaker verification (SV) system. The baseline approach consists of mapping a variable length speech segment to a fixed dimensional speaker vector by estimating the mean of hidden representations in DNN structure. The distance between two utterances is obtained by computing L2 norm between the vectors. This approach performs worse than the conventional Gaussian Mixture Model-Universal Background Model (GMM-UBM) based system in publicly available corpora. We believe that poor performance is due to the employed averaging operation, which may not capture the phonetic information of an utterance. Past studies indicate that techniques exploiting phonetic information in addition to speaker is beneficial for this task. This paper therefore proposes to incorporate content information of the speech signal by computing distance function with linguistic units co-occuring between enrollment and test data. The whole network is optimized by employing a triplet-loss objective in an end-to-end fashion to output SV scores. Experiments on the RSR2015 dataset show that the proposed approach outperforms GMM-UBM system by 48% and 36% relative equal error rate for fixed-phrase and Random-digit conditions respectively",

Therefore it might not perform well in real-life applications. Factor analysis, proven in the fields of language identification and speaker verification, could clear a path towards more robust emotion recognition. This paper proposes an iVector-based approach operating on acoustic MFCC features with a separate modeling of the speaker and emotion variabilities respectively. The speech analysis extracts two fixed-length low-dimensional feature vectors corresponding to the two mentioned sources of variation. To model the speaker-related nuisance variability speaker factors are extracted using an eigenvoice matrix. After compensating for this speaker variability in the supervector space, the emotion factors (one per targeted emotion) are extracted using an emotion variability matrix. The emotion factors are then fed to a basic emotion classifier. Leave-one-speaker-out cross-validation on the Berlin Database of Emotional Speech EMO-DB (German) and IEMOCAP (English) datasets lead to results that are competitive with the current state-of-the-art.

Through experiments on speech emotion recognition with various levels of regularization strength, we discover that the shaking mechanism alone contributes much more to constraining the optimization of network parameters than to boosting the generalization power. However, stochastically relaxing the shaking regularization serves to conveniently strike a balance between them.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Continuous emotion recognition (CER) is the task of determining the emotional content of speech from audio or multimedia recordings. Training targets for machine learning must be generated by human annotation, generally as a time series of emotional parameter values. In typical contemporary CER systems and challenges, the mean over a pool of annotators is taken to represent this ground truth, but is this an appropriate model for the emotional content of speech? Using the RECOLA dataset, the primary contribution of this research is to show that a correlation exists between the time-varying disagreement from independent groups of annotators. Because the groups are completely isolated except via the speech signal, this agreement-about-disagreement demonstrates that there is a component of annotator disagreement which arises systematically from the signal itself, which qualitatively implies that the perceived emotional content of speech can exhibit some degree of inherent ambiguity. Additionally, we show that these human annotations exhibit a degree of temporal smoothness. Neither of these characteristics is represented by the standard series-of-means ground-truth model, so we propose two alternative ground-truth models: a mean-variance model that incorporates ambiguity and a more general Gaussian process model that incorporates ambiguity and temporal smoothness in a well-defined probability distribution",

The triplet loss makes intra-class distance shorter and inter-class distance longer and supervised loss incorporates class label information. In view of variable-length inputs, we explore three different strategies to handle this problem and meanwhile make better use of temporal dynamic process information.

In this paper, an improved DNN technique based on convolutional neural networks is presented and compared to existing methods for speech enhancement and speaker verification in the presence of reverberation. This new technique is first shown to enhance speech quality as compared to other existing methods. Then, a more thorough set of experiments is presented that assesses cross-corpora speaker verification performance on data that contains real reverberation and noise. A discussion of the applicability In this work, an approach of emotion recognition is proposed for variable-length speech segments by applying deep neutral network to spectrograms directly. The spectrogram carries comprehensive para-lingual information that are useful for emotion recognition. We tried to extract such information from spectrograms and accomplish the emotion recognition task by combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). To handle the variable-length speech segments, we proposed a specially designed neural network structure that accepts variable-length speech sentences directly as input. Compared to the traditional methods that split the sentence into smaller fixed-length segments, our method can solve the problem of accuracy degradation introduced in the speech segmentation process. We evaluated the emotion recognition model on the IEMOCAP dataset over four emotions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the fixed-length neural network on both weighted accuracy (WA) and unweighted accuracy (UA).and generalizability of such techniques is given",

Once trained, they allow synthetic generation of examples sampled from the learned distribution. We investigate the application of GANs to generate synthetic feature vectors used for speech emotion recognition. Specifically, we investigate two set ups: (i) a vanilla GAN that learns the distribution of a lower dimensional representation of the actual higher dimensional feature vector and (ii) a conditional GAN that learns the distribution of the higher dimensional feature vectors conditioned on the labels or the emotional class to which it belongs.

Conventional methods to learn these emotional descriptors primarily focus on separate models to recognize each of these attributes. Recent work has shown that learning these attributes together regularizes the models, leading to better feature representations. This study explores new forms of regularization by adding unsupervised auxiliary tasks to reconstruct hidden layer representations. This auxiliary task requires the denoising of hidden representations at every layer of an auto-encoder. The framework relies on ladder networks that utilize skip connections between encoder and decoder layers to learn powerful representations of emotional dimensions. The results show that ladder networks improve the performance of the system compared to baselines that individually learn each attribute and conventional denoising autoencoders. Furthermore, the unsupervised auxiliary tasks have promising potential to be used in a semi-supervised setting, where few labeled sentences are available",

    "abstract": "Knowledge distillation, or teacher-student training, has been effectively used to improve the performance of a relatively simpler deep learning model (the student) using a more complex model (the teacher). It is usually done by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) between the output distributions of the student and the teacher at each frame. However, the gain from frame-level knowledge distillation is limited for sequence models such as Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC), due to the mismatch between the sequence-level criterion used in teacher model training and the frame-level criterion used in distillation. In this paper, sequence-level knowledge distillation is proposed to achieve better distillation performance. Instead of calculating a teacher posterior distribution given the feature vector of the current frame, sequence training criterion is employed to calculate the posterior distribution given the whole utterance and the teacher model. Experiments are conducted on both English Switchboard corpus and a large Chinese corpus.

    "abstract": "Connectionist temporal classification (CTC) has shown great potential in end-to-end (E2E) acoustic modeling. The current state-of-the-art architecture for a CTC-based E2E model is based on a deep bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) network that provides frame-wise outputs estimated from both forward and backward directions (BLSTM-CTC). Since this architecture can lead to a serious time latency problem in decoding, it cannot be applied to real-time speech recognition tasks. Considering that the CTC label of one current frame can only be affected by a few neighboring frames, we argue that using BLSTM traversing on a whole utterance from both directions is not necessary. In this paper, we use a very deep residual time-delay (VResTD) network for CTC-based E2E acoustic modeling (VResTD-CTC). The VResTD network provides frame-wise outputs with local bidirectional information without needing to wait for the whole utterance. Speech recognition experiments on Corpus of Spontaneous Japanese were carried out to test our proposed VResTD-CTC and the state-of-the-art BLSTM-CTC model. Comparable performance was obtained while the proposed VResTD-CTC does not suffer from the decoding time latency problem",

    "abstract": "Learning an ASR acoustic model directly from raw waveforms using CNNs has proved to be effective, where convolutional layers with learnable filters are able to automatically extract useful features. However, these filters, with independent parameters, can be highly redundant resulting in inefficient systems. In this paper, we propose a novel method to generate CNN filter parameters by first sampling from a low-dimensional parameter space and then using a trainable scalar vector to perform a linear combination. This filter sampling and combination method (denoted as FSC) not only naturally enforces parameter sharing in the low-dimensional sampling space, but also adds to the learning capacity of filters. The FSC-CNN model has a significantly smaller number of parameters and is more efficient compared to conventional CNN models, which makes it feasible for small-footprint ASR. Experimental results on the WSJ LVCSR task show that FSC-CNNs are able to achieve a WER of 3.67 with a standard decoder set-up with only 1.19M nonlinear-layer parameters (better than a strong baseline CNN model with 3.2x more parameters).

This modality, however, is significantly more challenging than off-line ASR, since real-time/low-latency constraints inevitably hinder the use of future information, that is known to be very helpful to perform robust predictions. A popular solution to mitigate this issue consists of feeding neural acoustic models with context windows that gather some future frames. This introduces a latency which depends on the number of employed look-ahead features. This paper explores a different approach, based on estimating the future rather than waiting for it. Our technique encourages the hidden representations of a unidirectional recurrent network to embed some useful information about the future. Inspired by a recently proposed technique called Twin Networks, we add a regularization term that forces forward hidden states to be as close as possible to cotemporal backward ones, computed by a \"twin\" neural network running backwards in time. The experiments, conducted on a number of datasets, recurrent architectures, input features and acoustic conditions, have shown the effectiveness of this approach. One important advantage is that our method does not introduce any additional computation at test time if compared to standard unidirectional recurrent networks",

Second, we find that previous approaches to incorporate position information into the model are unsuitable and explore other representations and hybrid models to this end. Third, to stress the importance of local context in the acoustic signal, we propose a Gaussian biasing approach that allows explicit control over the context range. Experiments find that our model approaches a strong baseline based on LSTMs with network-in-network connections while being much faster to compute.

In the first level, several small separate BPC-dependent DNNs are applied to different broad phonetic classes and in the second level the outputs of these DNNs are fused to obtain senone-dependent posterior probabilities, which can be used for frame level classification or integrated into Viterbi decoding for phone recognition.

Here we further examine the weighting strategy of pitch induced and loudness induced contour identification on Mandarin tone perception by CI users. Twenty-seven versions of the disyllabic utterance /Lao3 Shi/ with orthogonally manipulated loudness-contour and pitch-contour of the voiced portion of the second monosyllable /Shi/ served as the stimuli to both CI and NH subjects. In Mandarin, if /Shi/ is pronounced with high-flat-pitched Tone 1 the word means \"teacher\", with rising Tone 2 it means \"well-behaved\", or with falling Tone 4 it means \"always\". CI users generally had poorer word-recognition scores and their inter-subject variance was large. While NH subjects recognized tone reliably based on pitch-contour, half of the CI users relied on pitch-contour, the other half on loudness-contour, implying systematic differences in pitch coding in their CI processing. This paradigm of orthogonal manipulation of pitch and loudness contours could be developed into improved audiometric tests of Mandarin tone perception and pitch coding with CIs",

    "title": "Implementing DIANA to Model Isolated Auditory Word Recognition in English",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "DIANA, an end-to-end computational model of spoken word recognition, was previously used to simulate auditory lexical decision experiments in Dutch. A single test conducted for North American English showed promising results as well. However, this simulation used a relatively small amount of data collected in the pilot phase of the Massive Auditory Lexical Decision (MALD) project. Additionally, already existing acoustic models were implemented. In this paper, we expand the analysis of MALD data by including a larger sample of both stimuli and participants. Acknowledging that most speech humans hear is conversational speech, we also test new acoustic models created using spontaneous speech corpora. Simulations successfully replicate expected trends in word competition and show plausible competitors as the signal unfolds, but acoustic model accuracy should be improved. Despite the number of responses per word being relatively small (never more than five), correlations between model estimates and participants' responses are moderate. Future directions in acoustic model training and simulating MALD data are discussed",

    "title": "Effects of Homophone Density on Spoken Word Recognition in Mandarin Chinese",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Homophones, words that sound same, influence spoken word recognition. Whether the effects of homophone density (i.e., number of same-sounding words) on spoken word recognition are facilitatory or inhibitory or complex is a matter of ongoing debate. In addition, there are limited studies investigating the effects of homophone density, probably due to paucity of homophones in the examined languages (e.g., English). In comparison, languages such as Mandarin Chinese have abundant homophony that makes it a suitable tool to investigate the effects of homophone density. In the current study, an auditory naming task was conducted using Mandarin Chinese to investigate the effects of homophone density on spoken word recognition. Using mixed modeling, a significant inhibitory effect of homophone density (β = 0.0098, t = 2.10) on reaction time was found. Participants were slower in naming words with high homophone density, possibly due to competition posed by more number of homophones, as compared to the words with low homophone density. Further, an interaction between homophone density and syllable frequency was found i.e., for high syllable frequency, homophone density effects were inhibitory but for low syllable frequency, the inhibitory effect was reduced. Taken together, the effects of homophone density are not straightforward but complex",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The present study investigated whether duration of lip movement could improve intelligibility of lexical pitch contours under noisy condition. Eighteen Chinese speakers were asked to identify a Mandarin lexical tone in one pair of tones under auditory only (AO) and audiovisual (AV) condition. Two types of tone pairs were used in the study: maximum contrastive pair (falling vs. dipping tones, the durational difference of lip movement was 100ms) and minimum contrastive pair (rising vs. falling tones, the difference was 33ms). The results showed that duration of lip movement enhanced discrimination in the maximum pair whereas the similar lengths of rising and dipping tones attenuated such visual benefit. The finding suggested that visual timing information could be a specific cue for audiovisual lexical tone perception",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "During speech development, babies learn to perceive and produce speech units, especially syllables and phonemes. However, the mechanisms underlying the acquisition of speech units still remain unclear. We propose a Bayesian model of speech communication, named \"COSMO SylPhon\", for studying the acquisition of both syllables and phonemes. In this model, speech development involves a sensory learning phase mainly related to perception development and a motor learning phase mainly related to production development. We analyze how an agent can learn speech units during these two phases through an unsupervised learning process based on syllable stimuli. We show that the learning process enables to efficiently learn the distribution of syllabic stimuli provided in the environment. Importantly, we show that if agents are equipped with a bootstrap process inspired by the Frame-Content Theory of speech development, they learn to associate consonants to specific articulatory gestures, providing the basis for consonantal articulatory invariance",

    "title": "Experience-dependent Influence of Music and Language on Lexical Pitch Learning Is Not Additive",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Research studies provide evidence for the facilitative effects of musical and linguistic experience on lexical pitch learning. However, the effect of interaction of linguistic and musical pitch experience on lexical pitch processing is a matter of ongoing research. In the current study, we sought to examine the effect of combination of musical and linguistic pitch experience on learning of novel lexical pitch. Using a 10-session pseudoword-picture association training paradigm, we compared the learning performance of musicians and non-musicians who either spoke a non-tone language, spoke one tone language, or spoke two tone languages. Among the non-tone language speakers, we found that musicians showed enhanced learning of novel lexical pitch as compared to non-musicians. In comparison, among the tone-language speakers, we found no significant difference in the learning performance of musicians and non-musicians no matter they spoke one or more tone languages. We conclude that though musical experience facilitates linguistic pitch learning, the effects of combination of musical and linguistic pitch experience are not additive i.e. possessing both types of pitch experience is no better than possessing either one of them and knowing two tone languages does not facilitate the learning of a new tone language beyond the knowledge of one",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We tested the influence of fundamental oscillation (fo) on human and machine speaker recognition performance in vocalic test utterances. In experiment I, we trained a Gaussian-Mixture model on 15 speakers (80 multi-word utterances each) and tested it with sustained vowel utterances (/a:/, /i:/ and /u:/) under six fo conditions, three changing (fall, rise, fall-rise) and three steady-state (high, mid, low). Results revealed better performance for the steady-state compared to the changing conditions and within the steady-state condition, performance was poorest for high fo. In experiment II, we tested 9 human listeners on a subset of 4 speakers from experiment I. They went through two training tasks (training 1: multi-word utterances; training 2: words). In the test, they recognized speakers based on the same vocalic utterances as in experiment I (for these 4 speakers). Results showed that performance was about equally high for the changing and steady-state vowels, however, in the steady-state condition performance was best for high fo vowels. The experiments suggest that (a) fo has an influence on the strength of speaker specific characteristics in vowels and (b) humans - compared to machines - pay attention to different acoustic information in vocalic utterances for speaker recognition",
