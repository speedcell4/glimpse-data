However, previous works did not explicitly model argument relationships. We use a simple maximum entropy classifier to capture the two categories of argument relationships and test its performance on the Chinese Proposition Bank (CPB).

We propose to use vector-space semantic models for selecting PPDB paraphrases that preserve the meaning of specific text fragments. This is the first work that addresses the substitutability of PPDB paraphrases in context. We show that vector-space models of meaning can be successfully applied to this task and increase the benefit brought by the use of the PPDB resource in applications",

Our models are based on simple convolutional neural networks directly on raw text, avoiding any manual identification of complex sentiment or syntactic features, while performing better than such feature-based models from previous work. More importantly, we use the challenging task of politeness prediction as a testbed to next present a much-needed understanding of what these successful networks are actually learning. For this, we present several network visualizations based on activation clusters, first derivative saliency, and embedding space transformations, helping us automatically identify several subtle linguistics markers of politeness theories. Further, this analysis reveals multiple novel, high-scoring politeness strategies which, when added back as new features, reduce the accuracy gap between the original featurized system and the neural model, thus providing a clear quantitative interpretation of the success of these neural networks",

We present several empirical analyses of this data in order to illustrate the range of affordances it presents to research in NLP, computational social science and the digital humanities. We find that fanfiction deprioritizes main protagonists in comparison to canonical texts, has a statistically significant difference in attention allocated to female characters, and offers a framework for developing models of reader reactions to stories",

In this paper, we put \"pronouns in their context\", exploring the relationship between self-reference and age, gender, and depression depending on syntactic position and verbal governor. We find that pronouns are overall more predictive when taking dependency relations and verb semantic categories into account, and, the direction of the relationship can change depending on the semantic class of the verbal governor",

Combining these methods, we can predict the label sequence with considering label dependencies and information of whole input sequence.

Understanding the evolution of language and culture requires disentangling these underlying causes. Here we show how two different distributional measures can be used to detect two different types of semantic change. The first measure, which has been used in many previous works, analyzes global shifts in a word's distributional semantics; it is sensitive to changes due to regular processes of linguistic drift, such as the semantic generalization of promise (\"I promise.\" \"It promised to be exciting.\"). The second measure, which we develop here, focuses on local changes to a word's nearest semantic neighbors; it is more sensitive to cultural shifts, such as the change in the meaning of cell (\"prison cell\" \"cell phone\"). Comparing measurements made by these two methods allows researchers to determine whether changes are more cultural or linguistic in nature, a distinction that is essential for work in the digital humanities and historical linguistics",

A method called snapshot learning is also proposed to facilitate learning from supervised sequential signals by applying a companion cross-entropy objective function to the conditioning vector. The experimental and analytical results demonstrate firstly that competition occurs between the conditioning vector and the LM, and the differing architectures provide different trade-offs between the two. Secondly, the discriminative power and transparency of the conditioning vector is key to providing both model interpretability and better performance. Thirdly, snapshot learning leads to consistent performance improvements independent of which architecture is used",

    "abstract": "The production of color language is essential for grounded language generation. Color descriptions have many challenging properties: they can be vague, compositionally complex, and denotationally rich. We present an effective approach to generating color descriptions using recurrent neural networks and a Fourier-transformed color representation. Our model outperforms previous work on a conditional language modeling task over a large corpus of naturalistic color descriptions. In addition, probing the model's output reveals that it can accurately produce not only basic color terms but also descriptors with non-convex denotations (\"greenish\"), bare modifiers (\"bright\", \"dull\"), and compositional phrases (\"faded teal\") not seen in training",

The translation process is easy if it can be accomplished only by replacing non-terminals in translation rules with other rules. However it is sometimes necessary to adjoin translation rules. Flexible non-terminals have been proposed as a promising solution for this problem. A flexible non-terminal provides several insertion position candidates for the rules to be adjoined, but it increases the computational cost of decoding. In this paper we propose a neural network based insertion position selection model to reduce the computational cost by selecting the appropriate insertion positions. The experimental results show the proposed model can select the appropriate insertion position with a high accuracy. It reduces the decoding time and improves the translation quality owing to reduced search space",

    "title": "Advanced Markov Logic Techniques for Scalable Joint Inference in NLP",
    "volume": "tutorial",
    "abstract": "In the early days of the statistical NLP era, many language processing tasks were tackled using the so-called pipeline architecture: the given task is broken into a series of sub-tasks such that the output of one sub-task is an input to the next sub-task in the sequence. The pipeline architecture is appealing for various reasons, including modularity, modeling convenience, and manageable computational complexity. However, it suffers from the error propagation problem: errors made in one sub-task are propagated to the next sub-task in the sequence, leading to poor accuracy on that sub-task, which in turn leads to more errors downstream. Another disadvantage associated with it is lack of feedback: errors made in a sub-task are often not corrected using knowledge uncovered while solving another sub-task down the pipeline.Realizing these weaknesses, researchers have turned to joint inference approaches in recent years. One such approach involves the use of Markov logic, which is defined as a set of weighted first-order logic formulas and, at a high level, unifies first-order logic with probabilistic graphical models. It is an ideal modeling language (knowledge representation) for compactly representing relational and uncertain knowledge in NLP. In a typical use case of MLNs in NLP, the application designer describes the background knowledge using a few first-order logic sentences and then uses software packages such as Alchemy, Tuffy, and Markov the beast to perform learning and inference (prediction) over the MLN. However, despite its obvious advantages, over the years, researchers and practitioners have found it difficult to use MLNs effectively in many NLP applications. The main reason for this is that it is hard to scale inference and learning algorithms for MLNs to large datasets and complex models, that are typical in NLP.In this tutorial, we will introduce the audience to recent advances in scaling up inference and learning in MLNs as well as new approaches to make MLNs a \"black-box\" for NLP applications (with only minor tuning required on the part of the user). Specifically, we will introduce attendees to a key idea that has emerged in the MLN research community over the last few years, lifted inference , which refers to inference techniques that take advantage of symmetries (e.g., synonyms), both exact and approximate, in the MLN . We will describe how these next-generation inference techniques can be used to perform effective joint inference. We will also present our new software package for inference and learning in MLNs, Alchemy 2.0, which is based on lifted inference, focusing primarily on how it can be used to scale up inference and learning in large models and datasets for applications such as semantic similarity determination, information extraction and question answering",

    "title": "Lifelong Machine Learning for Natural Language Processing",
    "volume": "tutorial",
    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) has been successfully used as a prevalent approach to solving numerous NLP problems. However, the classic ML paradigm learns in isolation. That is, given a dataset, an ML algorithm is executed on the dataset to produce a model without using any related or prior knowledge. Although this type of isolated learning is very useful, it also has serious limitations as it does not accumulate knowledge learned in the past and use the knowledge to help future learning, which is the hallmark of human learning and human intelligence. Lifelong machine learning (LML) aims to achieve this capability. Specifically, it aims to design and develop computational learning systems and algorithms that learn as humans do, i.e., retaining the results learned in the past, abstracting knowledge from them, and using the knowledge to help future learning. In this tutorial, we will introduce the existing research of LML and to show that LML is very suitable for NLP tasks and has potential to help NLP make major progresses",

    "title": "Neural Networks for Sentiment Analysis",
    "volume": "tutorial",
    "abstract": "Sentiment analysis has been a major research topic in natural language processing (NLP). Traditionally, the problem has been attacked using discrete models and manually-defined sparse features. Over the past few years, neural network models have received increased research efforts in most sub areas of sentiment analysis, giving highly promising results. A main reason is the capability of neural models to automatically learn dense features that capture subtle semantic information over words, sentences and documents, which are difficult to model using traditional discrete features based on words and ngram patterns. This tutorial gives an introduction to neural network models for sentiment analysis, discussing the mathematics of word embeddings, sequence models and tree structured models and their use in sentiment analysis on the word, sentence and document levels, and fine-grained sentiment analysis. The tutorial covers a range of neural network models (e.g. CNN, RNN, RecNN, LSTM) and their extensions, which are employed in four main subtasks of sentiment analysis:Sentiment-oriented embeddings;Sentence-level sentiment;Document-level sentiment;Fine-grained sentiment.The content of the tutorial is divided into 3 sections of 1 hour each. We assume that the audience is familiar with linear algebra and basic neural network structures, introduce the mathematical details of the most typical models. First, we will introduce the sentiment analysis task, basic concepts related to neural network models for sentiment analysis, and show detail approaches to integrate sentiment information into embeddings. Sentence-level models will be described in the second section. Finally, we will discuss neural network models use for document-level and fine-grained sentiment",

    "title": "Continuous Vector Spaces for Cross-language NLP Applications",
    "volume": "tutorial",
    "abstract": "The mathematical metaphor offered by the geometric concept of distance in vector spaces with respect to semantics and meaning has been proven to be useful in many monolingual natural language processing applications. There is also some recent and strong evidence that this paradigm can also be useful in the cross-language setting. In this tutorial, we present and discuss some of the most recent advances on exploiting the vector space model paradigm in specific cross-language natural language processing applications, along with a comprehensive review of the theoretical background behind them.First, the tutorial introduces some fundamental concepts of distributional semantics and vector space models. More specifically, the concepts of distributional hypothesis and term-document matrices are revised, followed by a brief discussion on linear and non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques and their implications to the parallel distributed approach to semantic cognition. Next, some classical examples of using vector space models in monolingual natural language processing applications are presented. Specific examples in the areas of information retrieval, related term identification and semantic compositionality are described.Then, the tutorial focuses its attention on the use of the vector space model paradigm in cross-language applications. To this end, some recent examples are presented and discussed in detail, addressing the specific problems of cross-language information retrieval, cross-language sentence matching, and machine translation. Some of the most recent developments in the area of Neural Machine Translation are also discussed.Finally, the tutorial concludes with a discussion about current and future research problems related to the use of vector space models in cross-language settings. Future avenues for scientific research are described, with major emphasis on the extension from vector and matrix representations to tensors, as well as the problem of encoding word position information into the vector-based representations",

    "title": "Methods and Theories for Large-scale Structured Prediction",
    "volume": "tutorial",
    "abstract": "Many important NLP tasks are casted as structured prediction problems, and try to predict certain forms of structured output from the input. Examples of structured prediction include POS tagging, named entity recognition, PCFG parsing, dependency parsing, machine translation, and many others. When apply structured prediction to a specific NLP task, there are the following challenges:1. Model selection: Among various models/algorithms with different characteristics, which one should we choose for a specific NLP task?2. Training: How to train the model parameters effectively and efficiently?3. Overfitting: To achieve good accuracy on test data, it is important to control the overfitting from the training data. How to control the overfitting risk for structured prediction?This tutorial will provide a clear overview of recent advances in structured prediction methods and theories, and address the above issues when we apply structured prediction to NLP tasks. We will introduce large margin methods (e.g., perceptrons, MIRA), graphical models (e.g., CRFs), and deep learning methods (e.g., RNN, LSTM), and show the respective advantages and disadvantages for NLP applications. For the training algorithms, we will introduce online/ stochastic training methods, and we will introduce parallel online/stochastic learning algorithms and theories to speed up the training (e.g., the Hogwild algorithm). For controlling the overfitting from training data, we will introduce the weight regularization methods, structure regularization, and implicit regularization methods",

    "title": "Practical Neural Networks for NLP: From Theory to Code",
    "volume": "tutorial",
    "abstract": "This tutorial aims to bring NLP researchers up to speed with the current techniques in deep learning and neural networks, and show them how they can turn their ideas into practical implementations. We will start with simple classification models (logistic regression and multilayer perceptrons) and cover more advanced patterns that come up in NLP such as recurrent networks for sequence tagging and prediction problems, structured networks (e.g., compositional architectures based on syntax trees), structured output spaces (sequences and trees), attention for sequence-to-sequence transduction, and feature induction for complex algorithm states. A particular emphasis will be on learning to represent complex objects as recursive compositions of simpler objects. This representation will reflect characterize standard objects in NLP, such as the composition of characters and morphemes into words, and words into sentences and documents. In addition, new opportunities such as learning to embed \"algorithm states\" such as those used in transition-based parsing and other sequential structured prediction models (for which effective features may be difficult to engineer by hand) will be covered.Everything in the tutorial will be grounded in code — we will show how to program seemingly complex neural-net models using toolkits based on the computation-graph formalism. Computation graphs decompose complex computations into a DAG, with nodes representing inputs, target outputs, parameters, or (sub)differentiable functions (e.g., \"tanh\", \"matrix multiply\", and \"softmax\"), and edges represent data dependencies. These graphs can be run \"forward\" to make predictions and compute errors (e.g., log loss, squared error) and then \"backward\" to compute derivatives with respect to model parameters. In particular we'll cover the Python bindings of the CNN library. CNN has been designed from the ground up for NLP applications, dynamically structured NNs, rapid prototyping, and a transparent data and execution model",
