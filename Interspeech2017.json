    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The ASVspoof initiative was created to promote the development of countermeasures which aim to protect automatic speaker verification (ASV) from spoofing attacks. The first community-led, common evaluation held in 2015 focused on countermeasures for speech synthesis and voice conversion spoofing attacks. Arguably, however, it is replay attacks which pose the greatest threat. Such attacks involve the replay of recordings collected from enrolled speakers in order to provoke false alarms and can be mounted with greater ease using everyday consumer devices. ASVspoof 2017, the second in the series, hence focused on the development of replay attack countermeasures. This paper describes the database, protocols and initial findings. The evaluation entailed highly heterogeneous acoustic recording and replay conditions which increased the equal error rate (EER) of a baseline ASV system from 1.76% to 31.46%. Submissions were received from 49 research teams, 20 of which improved upon a baseline replay spoofing detector EER of 24.77%, in terms of replay/non-replay discrimination. While largely successful, the evaluation indicates that the quest for countermeasures which are resilient in the face of variable replay attacks remains very much alive",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "This paper presents an experimental comparison of different features for the detection of replay spoofing attacks in Automatic Speaker Verification systems. We evaluate the proposed countermeasures using two recently introduced databases, including the dataset provided for the ASVspoof 2017 challenge. This challenge provides researchers with a common framework for the evaluation of replay attack detection systems, with a particular focus on the generalization to new, unknown conditions (for instance, replay devices different from those used during system training). Our cross-database experiments show that, although achieving this level of generalization is indeed a challenging task, it is possible to train classifiers that exhibit stable and consistent results across different experiments. The proposed approach for the ASVspoof 2017 challenge consists in the score-level fusion of several base classifiers using logistic regression. These base classifiers are 2-class Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) representing genuine and spoofed speech respectively. Our best system achieves an Equal Error Rate of 10.52% on the challenge evaluation set. As a result of this set of experiments, we provide some general conclusions regarding feature extraction for replay attack detection and identify which features show the most promising results",

    "abstract": "Replay attacks presents a great risk for Automatic Speaker Verification (ASV) system. In this paper, we propose a novel replay detector based on Variable length Teager Energy Operator-Energy Separation Algorithm-Instantaneous Frequency Cosine Coefficients (VESA-IFCC) for the ASV spoof 2017 challenge. The key idea here is to exploit the contribution of IF in each subband energy via ESA to capture possible changes in spectral envelope (due to transmission and channel characteristics of replay device) of replayed speech. The IF is computed from narrowband components of speech signal, and DCT is applied in IF to get proposed feature set. We compare the performance of the proposed VESA-IFCC feature set with the features developed for detecting synthetic and voice converted speech. This includes the CQCC, CFCCIF and prosody-based features. On the development set, the proposed VESA-IFCC features when fused at score-level with a variant of CFCCIF and prosody-based features gave the least EER of 0.12%. On the evaluation set, this combination gave an EER of 18.33%. However, post-evaluation results of challenge indicate that VESA-IFCC features alone gave the relatively least EER of 14.06% (i.e., relatively 16.11% less compared to baseline CQCC) and hence, is a very useful countermeasure to detect replay attacks",

    "abstract": "The ongoing ASVspoof 2017 challenge aims to detect replay attacks for text dependent speaker verification. In this paper, we propose multiple replay spoofing countermeasure systems, with some of them boosting the CQCC-GMM baseline system after score level fusion. We investigate different steps in the system building pipeline, including data augmentation, feature representation, classification and fusion. First, in order to augment training data and simulate the unseen replay conditions, we converted the raw genuine training data into replay spoofing data with parametric sound reverberator and phase shifter. Second, we employed the original spectrogram rather than CQCC as input to explore the end-to-end feature representation learning methods. The spectrogram is randomly cropped into fixed size segments, and then fed into a deep residual network (ResNet). Third, upon the CQCC features, we replaced the subsequent GMM classifier with deep neural networks including fully-connected deep neural network (FDNN) and Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory neural network (BLSTM). Experiments showed that data augmentation strategy can significantly improve the system performance.

    "abstract": "This work describes the techniques used for spoofed speech detection for the ASVspoof 2017 challenge. The main focus of this work is on exploiting the differences in the speech-specific nature of genuine speech signals and spoofed speech signals generated by replay attacks. This is achieved using glottal closure instants, epoch strength, and the peak to side lobe ratio of the Hilbert envelope of linear prediction residual. Apart from these source features, the instantaneous frequency cosine coefficient feature, and two cepstral features namely, constant Q cepstral coefficients and mel frequency cepstral coefficients are used. A combination of all these features is performed to obtain a high degree of accuracy for spoof detection. Initially, efficacy of these features are tested on the development set of the ASVspoof 2017 database with Gaussian mixture model based systems. The systems are then fused at score level which acts as the final combined system for the challenge. The combined system is able to outperform the individual systems by a significant margin. Finally, the experiments are repeated on the evaluation set of the database and the combined system results in an equal error rate of 13.95%",

It addresses a replay spoofing attack against a speaker recognition system by detecting that the analysed signal has passed through multiple analogue-to-digital (AD) conversions. Specifically, we show that most of the cues that enable to detect the replay attacks can be found in the high-frequency band of the replayed recordings. The described anti-spoofing countermeasures are based on (1) modelling the subband spectrum and (2) using the proposed features derived from the linear prediction (LP) analysis. The results of the investigated methods show a significant improvement in comparison to the baseline system of the ASVspoof 2017 Challenge.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The ASVspoof 2017 challenge aims to assess spoofing and countermeasures attack detection accuracy for automatic speaker verification. It has been proven that constant Q cepstral coefficients (CQCCs) processes speech in different frequencies with variable resolution and performs much better than traditional features. When coupled with a Gaussian mixture model (GMM), it is an excellently effective spoofing countermeasure. The baseline CQCC+GMM system considers short-term impacts while ignoring the whole influence of channel. In the meanwhile, dimension of the feature is relatively higher than the traditional feature and usually with a higher variance. This paper explores different features for ASVspoof 2017 challenge. The mean and variance of the CQCC features of an utterance is used as the representation of the whole utterance. Feature selection method is introduced to avoid high variance and overfitting for spoofing detection. Experimental results on ASVspoof 2017 dataset show that feature selection followed by Support Vector Machine (SVM) gets an improvement compared to the baseline. It is also shown that pitch feature contributes to the performance improvement, and it obtains a relative improvement of 37.39% over the baseline CQCC+GMM system",

However, little such data exists for code-switching. In this paper, we describe crowd-sourcing universal part-of-speech tags for the Miami Bangor Corpus of Spanish-English code-switched speech. We split the annotation task into three subtasks: one in which a subset of tokens are labeled automatically, one in which questions are specifically designed to disambiguate a subset of high frequency words, and a more general cascaded approach for the remaining data in which questions are displayed to the worker following a decision tree structure. Each subtask is extended and adapted for a multilingual setting and the universal tagset. The quality of the annotation process is measured using hidden check questions annotated with gold labels.

We investigate the use of a deep neural network (DNN) to discriminate between the different channel conditions available in the ASVSpoof 2017 dataset, namely recording, playback and session conditions. The high-level feature vectors derived from this network are used to discriminate between genuine and spoofed audio. Two kinds of low-level features are utilized: state-of-the-art constant-Q cepstral coefficients (CQCC), and our proposed high-frequency cepstral coefficients (HFCC) that derive from the high-frequency spectrum of the audio. The fusion of both features proved to be effective in generalizing well across diverse replay attacks seen in the evaluation of the ASVSpoof 2017 challenge, with an equal error rate of 11.5%, that is 53% better than the baseline Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) applied on CQCC",

Unfortunately, they are still highly prone to different kinds of spoofing attacks such as speech synthesis, voice conversion, and fake audio recordings etc. Inspired by the success of ResNet in image recognition, we investigated the effectiveness of using ResNet for automatic spoofing detection. Experimental results on the ASVspoof2017 data set show that ResNet performs the best among all the single-model systems. Model fusion is a good way to further improve the system performance. Nevertheless, we found that if the same feature is used for different fused models, the resulting system can hardly be improved. By using different features and models, our best fused model further reduced the Equal Error Rate (EER) by 18% relatively, compared with the best single-model system",

    "abstract": "The ASVspoof 2017 challenge is about the detection of replayed speech from human speech. The proposed system makes use of the fact that when the speech signals are replayed, they pass through multiple channels as opposed to original recordings. This channel information is typically embedded in low signal to noise ratio regions. A speech signal processing method with high spectro-temporal resolution is required to extract robust features from such regions. The single frequency filtering (SFF) is one such technique, which we propose to use for replay attack detection. While SFF based feature representation was used at front-end, Gaussian mixture model and bi-directional long short-term memory models are investigated at the backend as classifiers. The experimental results on ASVspoof 2017 dataset reveal that, SFF based representation is very effective in detecting replay attacks. The score level fusion of back end classifiers further improved the performance of the system which indicates that both classifiers capture complimentary information",

    "abstract": "On small datasets, discriminatively trained bottleneck features from deep networks commonly outperform more traditional spectral or cepstral features. While these features are typically trained with small, fully-connected networks, recent studies have used more sophisticated networks with great success. We use the recent deep CNN (VGG) network for bottleneck feature extraction — previously used only for low-resource tasks — and apply it to the Switchboard English conversational telephone speech task. Unlike features derived from traditional MLP networks, the VGG features outperform cepstral features even when used with BLSTM acoustic models trained on large amounts of data. We achieve the best BBN single system performance when combining the VGG features with a BLSTM acoustic model. When decoding with an n-gram language model, which are used for deployable systems, we have a realistic production system with a WER of 7.4%. This result is competitive with the current state-of-the-art in the literature. While our focus is on realistic single system performance, we further reduce the WER to 6.1% through system combination and using expensive neural network language model rescoring",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Student-teacher training allows a large teacher model or ensemble of teachers to be compressed into a single student model, for the purpose of efficient decoding. However, current approaches in automatic speech recognition assume that the state clusters, often defined by Phonetic Decision Trees (PDT), are the same across all models. This limits the diversity that can be captured within the ensemble, and also the flexibility when selecting the complexity of the student model output. This paper examines an extension to student-teacher training that allows for the possibility of having different PDTs between teachers, and also for the student to have a different PDT from the teacher. The proposal is to train the student to emulate the logical context dependent state posteriors of the teacher, instead of the frame posteriors. This leads to a method of mapping frame posteriors from one PDT to another. This approach is evaluated on three speech recognition tasks: the Tok Pisin and Javanese low resource conversational telephone speech tasks from the IARPA Babel programme, and the HUB4 English broadcast news task",

We continued the work BBN conducted on the use of multilingual data for improving Babel evaluation systems, but focused on training time-delay neural network (TDNN) based chain models. As done for the Babel evaluations, we used multilingual data in two ways: first, to train multilingual deep neural networks (DNN) for extracting bottle-neck (BN) features, and second, for initializing training on target languages Our results show that TDNN chain models trained on multilingual DNN bottleneck features yield significant gains over their counterparts trained on MFCC plus i-vector features. By initializing from models trained on multilingual data, TDNN chain models can achieve great improvements over random initializations of the network weights on target languages. Two other important findings are: 1) initialization with multilingual TDNN chain models produces larger gains on target languages that have less training data; 2) inclusion of target languages in multilingual training for either BN feature extraction or initialization have limited impact on performance measured on the target languages. Our results also reveal that for TDNN chain models, the combination of multilingual BN features and multilingual initialization achieves the best performance on all target languages",

This then raises two issues: what is human performance, and how far down can we still drive speech recognition error rates? In trying to assess human performance, we performed an independent set of measurements on the Switchboard and CallHome subsets of the Hub5 2000 evaluation and found that human accuracy may be considerably better than what was earlier reported, giving the community a significantly harder goal to achieve. We also report on our own efforts in this area, presenting a set of acoustic and language modeling techniques that lowered the WER of our system to 5.5%/10.3% on these subsets, which is a new performance milestone (albeit not at what we measure to be human performance). On the acoustic side, we use a score fusion of one LSTM with multiple feature inputs, a second LSTM trained with speaker-adversarial multi-task learning and a third convolutional residual net (ResNet).

    "abstract": "Recent work in automatic recognition of conversational telephone speech (CTS) has achieved accuracy levels comparable to human transcribers, although there is some debate how to precisely quantify human performance on this task, using the NIST 2000 CTS evaluation set. This raises the question what systematic differences, if any, may be found differentiating human from machine transcription errors. In this paper we approach this question by comparing the output of our most accurate CTS recognition system to that of a standard speech transcription vendor pipeline. We find that the most frequent substitution, deletion and insertion error types of both outputs show a high degree of overlap. The only notable exception is that the automatic recognizer tends to confuse filled pauses (\"uh\") and backchannel acknowledgments (\"uhhuh\"). Human tend not to make this error, presumably due to the distinctive and opposing pragmatic functions attached to these words. Furthermore, we quantify the correlation between human and machine errors at the speaker level, and investigate the effect of speaker overlap between training and test data. Finally, we report on an informal \"Turing test\" asking humans to discriminate between automatic and human transcription error cases",

Our study aims to further understand the multimodal manifestation of social stress for adolescents with ASD versus neurotypically developing (TD) peers. We investigate this through objective measures of speech behavior and physiology (mean heart rate) acquired during three tasks: a low-stress conversation, a medium-stress interview, and a high-stress presentation. Measurable differences are found to exist for speech behavior and heart rate in relation to task-induced stress. Additionally, we find the acoustic measures are particularly effective for distinguishing between diagnostic groups. Individuals with ASD produced higher prosodic variability, agreeing with previous reports. Moreover, the most informative features captured an individual's vocal changes between low and high social-stress, suggesting an interaction between vocal production and social stressors in ASD",

As humans perceive emotion differently based on personality, cognitive state and past experiences, it is important to collect rankings from multiple individuals to assess the emotional content in corpora, which are later aggregated with rules such as majority vote. With the increased use of crowdsourcing services for perceptual evaluations, collecting large amount of data is now feasible. It becomes important to question the amount of data needed to create well-trained classifiers. How different are the aggregated labels collected from five raters compared to the ones obtained from twenty evaluators? Is it worthwhile to spend resources to increase the number of evaluators beyond those used in conventional/laboratory studies? This study evaluates the consensus labels obtained by incrementally adding new evaluators during perceptual evaluations. Using majority vote over categorical emotional labels, we compare the changes in the aggregated labels starting with one rater, and finishing with 20 raters. The large number of evaluators in a subset of the MSP-IMPROV database and the ability to filter annotators by quality allows us to better understand label aggregation as a function of the number of annotators",

For this study, we consider head motion and speech data from 24 subjects while they tell a fixed set of five stories. The head motion, captured using a motion capture system, is converted to Euler angles and translations in X, Y and Z-directions to represent head gestures. Pitch and short-time energy in voiced segments are used to represent the prosodic patterns. To capture the statistical relationship between head gestures and prosodic patterns, mutual information (MI) is computed at various delays between the two using data from 24 subjects in six native languages. The estimated MI, averaged across all subjects, is found to be maximum when the head gestures lag the prosodic patterns by 30msec. This is found to be true when subjects tell stories in English as well as in their native language. We observe a similar pattern in the root mean squared error of predicting head gestures from prosodic patterns using Gaussian mixture model. These results indicate that there could be an asynchrony between head gestures and prosody during spontaneous speech where head gestures follow the corresponding prosodic patterns",

They had to use only sentences of the form ‘The [target word] goes there.'. They did this in two conditions: silence and noise. Their speech and articulatory/hand movements (motion capture) were recorded. The analyses show that the participants' speech features were modified in noise (Lombard effect). They also spoke slower and made more pauses and errors. Their pointing gestures lasted longer and started later showing an adaptation of gesture production to speech. The condition did not influence speech/gesture coordination. The apex (part of the gesture that shows) mainly occurred at the same time as the target word and not as the demonstrative showing that speakers group speech and gesture carrying complementary rather than redundant information",

    "abstract": "A new approach for acoustic feedback cancellation is presented. The challenge in acoustic feedback cancellation is a strong correlation between the local speech and the loudspeaker signal. Due to this correlation, the convergence rate of adaptive algorithms is limited. Therefore, a novel stepsize control of the adaptive filter is presented. The stepsize control exploits reverberant signal periods to update the adaptive filter. As soon as local speech stops, the reverberation energy of the system decays exponentially. This means that during reverberation there is only excitation of the filter but no local speech. Thus, signals are not correlated and the filter can converge without correlation problems. Consequently, the stepsize control accelerates the adaption process during reverberation and slows it down at the beginning of speech activity. It is shown, that with a particular gain control, the reverb-based stepsize control can be interpreted as the theoretical optimum stepsize. However, for this purpose a precise estimation of the system distance is required. One estimation method is presented. The proposed estimator has a rescue mechanism to detect enclosure dislocations. Both, simulations and real world testing show that the acoustic feedback canceler is capable of improving stability and convergence rate, even at high system gains",

Phonetically, pharyngeal consonants are argued to have a primary constriction below the pharynx, and are thus posited to be pharyngealized laryngeals. Under this view, the pharyngeal constriction is secondary, not primary. Phonologically, it has been established that pharyngealized sounds trigger pharyngealization spread, and proposals for grouping pharyngeal and pharyngealized consonants together cite similar, but not identical, spread patterns triggered by pharyngeals. In this study, Real-time Magnetic Resonance Imaging is employed to investigate the phonetic correlates of the pharyngeal constriction in both pharyngeal and pharyngealized sounds in Saudi, Lebanese, and Jordanian Arabic as exemplified by one speaker from each dialect. Our findings demonstrate a difference in the location of constriction among both types of sounds. These distinctions in place possibly account for the differences in the spread patterns triggered by each type of sound",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "This work investigates the influence of the gradual opening of the glottis along its length during the production of fricatives in intervocalic contexts. Acoustic simulations reveal the existence of a transient zone in the articulatory space where the frication noise level is very sensitive to small perturbations of the glottal opening. This corresponds to the configurations where both frication noise and voiced contributions are present in the speech signal. To avoid this unstability, speakers may adopt different strategies to ensure the voiced/voiceless contrast of fricatives. This is evidenced by experimental data of simultaneous glottal opening measurements, performed with ePGG, and audio recordings of vowel-fricative-vowel pseudowords. Voiceless fricatives are usually longer, in order to maximize the number of voiceless time frames over voiced frames due to the crossing of the transient regime. For voiced fricatives, the speaker may avoid the unstable regime by keeping low frication noise level, and thus by favoring the voicing characteristic, or by doing very short crossings into the unstable regime. It is also shown that when speakers are asked to sustain voiced fricatives longer than in natural speech, they adopt the strategy of keeping low frication noise level to avoid the unstable regime",

    "abstract": "This paper presents results of a simultaneous acoustic and articulatory investigation of word-medial and word-final geminate/singleton coronal stop contrasts in Moroccan Arabic (MA). The acoustic analysis revealed that, only for the word-medial contrast, the two MA speakers adopted comparable strategies in contrasting geminates with singletons, mainly by significantly lengthening closure duration in geminates, relative to singletons. In word-final position, two speaker-specific contrasting patterns emerged. While one speaker also lengthened the closure duration for final geminates, the other speaker instead lengthened only the release duration for final geminates, relative to singletons. Consonant closure and preceding vowel were significantly longer for the geminate only in medial position, not in final position. These temporal differences were even more clearly delineated in the articulatory signal, captured via ultrasound, to which we applied the novel approach of using TRACTUS [Temporally Resolved Articulatory Configuration Tracking of UltraSound: 15] to index temporal properties of closure gestures for these geminate/singleton contrasts",

    "abstract": "We investigate the durational properties of Moroccan Arabic identical consonant sequences contrasting singleton (S) and geminate (G) dental fricatives, in six combinations of four-level length contrasts across word boundaries (#) (one timing slot for #S, two for #G and S#S, three for S#G and G#S, and four for G#G). The aim is to determine the nature of the mapping between discrete phonological timing units and phonetic durations. Acoustic results show that the largest and most systematic jump in duration is displayed between the singleton fricative on the one hand and the other sequences on the other hand. Looking at these sequences, S#S is shown to have the same duration as #G. When a geminate is within the sequence, a temporal reorganization is observed: G#S is not significantly longer than S#S and #G; and G#G is only slightly longer than S#G. Instead of a four-way hierarchy, our data point towards a possible upper limit of three-way length contrasts for consonants: S < G=S#S=G#S < S#G=G#G. The interplay of a number of factors resulting in this mismatch between phonological length and phonetic duration are discussed, and a working hypothesis is provided for why duration contrasts are rarely ternary, and almost never quaternary",

The results show the durations and spectral characteristics of the vowels, including major patterns of allophony (i.e. coarticulation and context effects). This updates the phonology over the previous description from the 1970s, showing that there is an additional front low vowel phoneme in the speech of young people today, as well as a vowel length contrast.

    "abstract": "Tonal coarticulation is universally found to be greater in extent in the carryover direction compared to the anticipatory direction ([1], [2], [3], [4], [5]) leading to assimilatory processes. In general, carryover coarticulation has been understood to be due to intertio-mechanical forces, and, anticipatory effects are seen to be a consequence of parallel activation of articulatory plans ([6]). In this paper, we report on results from a set of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) trained to predict adjacent tones in disyllabic sequences. Our results confirm the universal pattern of greater carryover effects in Mizo leading to tonal assimilation. In addition, we report on results from single-layered ANN models and Support Vector Machines (SVM) that predict the identity of V from V (anticipatory) consistently better than V from V (carryover) in Assamese non-harmonic #…V CV …# sequences. The directionality in the performance of the V and V models, help us conclude that the directionality effect of coarticulation in Assamese non-harmonic sequences is greater in the anticipatory direction, which is the same direction as in the harmonic sequences. We argue that coarticulatory propensity exhibits a great deal of sensitivity to the nature of contrast in a language",

The ecological validity of these tests is questionable, as they do not represent real-world end-use scenarios. In this paper, we examine a novel approach to TTS evaluation in an imagined end-use, via a complex interaction with an avatar. 6 different voice conditions were tested: Natural speech, Unit Selection and Parametric Synthesis, in neutral and expressive realizations. Results were compared to a traditional audio-only evaluation baseline. Participants in both studies rated the voices for naturalness and expressivity. The baseline study showed canonical results for naturalness: Natural speech scored highest, followed by Unit Selection, then Parametric synthesis. Expressivity was clearly distinguishable in all conditions. In the avatar interaction study, participants rated naturalness in the same order as the baseline, though with smaller effect size; expressivity was not distinguishable. Further, no significant correlations were found between cognitive or affective responses and any voice conditions. This highlights 2 primary challenges in designing more valid TTS evaluations: in real-world use-cases involving interaction, listeners generally interact with a single voice, making comparative analysis unfeasible, and in complex interactions, the context and content may confound perception of voice quality",

This paper investigated the effectiveness of integrating articulatory movement data to deep learning-based TTS. The integration of articulatory information was achieved in two ways: (1) direct integration, where articulatory and acoustic features were the output of a deep neural network (DNN), and (2) direct integration plus forward-mapping, where the output articulatory features were mapped to acoustic features by an additional DNN; These forward-mapped acoustic features were then combined with the output acoustic features to produce the final acoustic features. Articulatory (tongue and lip) and acoustic data collected from male and female speakers were used in the experiment.

We propose three LM adaptation approaches for Deep NN and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): (1) Adapting the softmax layer in the Neural Network (NN); (2) Adding a non-linear adaptation layer before the softmax layer that is trained only in the adaptation phase; (3) Training the extra non-linear adaptation layer in pre-training and adaptation phases. Aiming to improve upon a hierarchical Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) second-pass LM baseline, which factors the model into word-cluster and word models, we build an NN LM that predicts only word clusters. Adapting the LSTM LM by training the adaptation layer in both training and adaptation phases (Approach 3), we reduce the cluster perplexity by 30% on a held-out dataset compared to an unadapted LSTM LM.

This is achieved by reducing the vocabulary, at each time step, to the target words in the batch and then replacing the softmax by the noise contrastive estimation approach, where these words play the role of targets and noise samples at the same time. In doing so, the proposed approach can be fully formulated and implemented using optimal dense matrix operations. Applying B-NCE to train different NNLMs on the Large Text Compression Benchmark (LTCB) and the One Billion Word Benchmark (OBWB) shows a significant reduction of the training time with no noticeable degradation of the models performance.

    "abstract": "Recurrent neural network language models (RNNLMs) are powerful language modeling techniques. Significant performance improvements have been reported in a range of tasks including speech recognition compared to n-gram language models. Conventional n-gram and neural network language models are trained to predict the probability of the next word given its preceding context history. In contrast, bidirectional recurrent neural network based language models consider the context from future words as well. This complicates the inference process, but has theoretical benefits for tasks such as speech recognition as additional context information can be used. However to date, very limited or no gains in speech recognition performance have been reported with this form of model. This paper examines the issues of training bidirectional recurrent neural network language models (bi-RNNLMs) for speech recognition. A bi-RNNLM probability smoothing technique is proposed, that addresses the very sharp posteriors that are often observed in these models. The performance of the bi-RNNLMs is evaluated on three speech recognition tasks: broadcast news; meeting transcription (AMI); and low-resource systems (Babel data). On all tasks gains are observed by applying the smoothing technique to the bi-RNNLM. In addition consistent performance gains can be obtained by combining bi-RNNLMs with n-gram and uni-directional RNNLMs",

Features related to the articulation, phonation, and prosody dimensions of speech were used to train different i-vector extractors.

The i-vectors of the healthy control (HC) speakers are averaged to form a single i-vector that represents the HC group, i.e., the reference i-vector. A similar process is done to create a reference of the group with PD patients. Then the i-vectors of test speakers are compared to these reference i-vectors using the cosine distance. Three analyses are performed using this distance: classification between PD patients and HC, prediction of the neurological state of PD patients according to the MDS-UPDRS-III scale, and prediction of a modified version of the Frenchay Dysarthria Assessment. The Spearman's correlation between this cosine distance and the MDS-UPDRS-III scale was 0.63. These results show the suitability of this approach to monitor the neurological state of people with Parkinson's Disease",

The present study aims to automate this assessment procedure, in an attempt to make the assessment objective and less labor-intensive. In the automated analysis, glottal airflow is estimated from the analyzed voice signal with an inverse filtering algorithm. Automatic assessment is realized by a regressor that predicts from temporal and spectral features of the glottal airflow. A regressor trained on overtone amplitudes and harmonic richness factors extracted from a set of continuous-speech utterances was applied to a set of sustained-vowel utterances, giving severity predictions (on a scale of ratings from 0 to 100) with an average error magnitude of 14",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder usually diagnosed in or beyond toddlerhood. ASD is defined by repetitive and restricted behaviours, and deficits in social communication. The early speech-language development of individuals with ASD has been characterised as delayed. However, little is known about ASD-related characteristics of pre-linguistic vocalisations at the feature level. In this study, we examined pre-linguistic vocalisations of 10-month-old individuals later diagnosed with ASD and a matched control group of typically developing individuals (N = 20). We segmented 684 vocalisations from parent-child interaction recordings. All vocalisations were annotated and signal-analytically decomposed. We analysed ASD-related vocalisation specificities on the basis of a standardised set (eGeMAPS) of 88 acoustic features selected for clinical speech analysis applications. 54 features showed evidence for a differentiation between vocalisations of individuals later diagnosed with ASD and controls. In addition, we evaluated the feasibility of automated, vocalisation-based identification of individuals later diagnosed with ASD. We compared linear kernel support vector machines and a 1-layer bidirectional long short-term memory neural network. Both classification approaches achieved an accuracy of 75% for subject-wise identification in a subject-independent 3-fold cross-validation scheme. Our promising results may be an important contribution en-route to facilitate earlier identification of ASD",

    "abstract": "Speech impairments are one of the earliest manifestations in patients with Parkinson's disease. Particularly, articulation deficits related to the capability of the speaker to start/stop the vibration of the vocal folds have been observed in the patients. Those difficulties can be assessed by modeling the transitions between voiced and unvoiced segments from speech. A robust strategy to model the articulatory deficits related to the starting or stopping vibration of the vocal folds is proposed in this study. The transitions between voiced and unvoiced segments are modeled by a convolutional neural network that extracts suitable information from two time-frequency representations: the short time Fourier transform and the continuous wavelet transform. The proposed approach improves the results previously reported in the literature. Accuracies of up to 89% are obtained for the classification of Parkinson's patients vs. healthy speakers. This study is a step towards the robust modeling of the speech impairments in patients with neuro-degenerative disorders",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Most state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems use a single deep neural network (DNN) to map the acoustic space to the decision space. However, different phonetic classes employ different production mechanisms and are best described by different types of features. Hence it may be advantageous to replace this single DNN with several phone class dependent DNNs. The appropriate mathematical formalism for this is a manifold. This paper assesses the use of a non-linear manifold structure with multiple DNNs for phone classification. The system has two levels. The first comprises a set of broad phone class (BPC) dependent DNN-based mappings and the second level is a fusion network. Various ways of designing and training the networks in both levels are assessed, including varying the size of hidden layers, the use of the bottleneck or softmax outputs as input to the fusion network, and the use of different broad class definitions. Phone classification experiments are performed on TIMIT. The results show that using the BPC-dependent DNNs provides small but significant improvements in phone classification accuracy relative to a single global DNN. The paper concludes with visualisations of the structures learned by the local and global DNNs and discussion of their interpretations",

The narrowband speech spectrogram is segmented into patches, which are represented as 2-D cosine carriers modulated in amplitude and frequency. Separation of carrier and amplitude/frequency modulations is achieved by 2-D demodulation using Riesz transform, which is the 2-D extension of Hilbert transform. The demodulated AM component reflects contributions of the vocal tract to spectrogram. The frequency modulated carrier (FM-carrier) signal exhibits properties of the excitation. The time-frequency coherence is defined with respect to FM-carrier and a coherence map is constructed, in which highly coherent regions represent nearly periodic and deterministic components of speech, whereas the incoherent regions correspond to unstructured components. The coherence map shows a clear distinction between deterministic and stochastic components in speech characterized by jitter, shimmer, lip radiation, type of excitation, etc. Binary masks prepared from the time-frequency coherence function are used for periodic-aperiodic decomposition of speech. Experimental results are presented to validate the efficiency of the proposed method",

For such applications, the relation between place of articulation of fricatives and their spectral characteristics is investigated using English fricatives available in the XRMB database, which provides simultaneously acquired speech signal and articulogram. Place of articulation is estimated from the articulogram as the position of maximum constriction in the oral cavity, using an automated graphical technique. The magnitude spectrum is smoothed by critical band based median and mean filters for improving the consistency of the spectral parameters. Out of several spectral parameters investigated, spectral moments and spectral slope appear to be related to the place of articulation of the fricative segment of the utterances as measured from articulogram. The data are used to train and test a Gaussian mixture model to estimate the place of articulation with spectral parameters as the inputs.

While prior works have applied Gaussian mixture models, we demonstrate that a mixture of generalized Gaussian models more accurately follows the observations. The proposed estimation method is based on measuring the ratio of L -norms between spectral bands. Such ratios follow the Beta-distribution when the input signal is generalized Gaussian, whereby the estimated parameters can be used to determine the underlying parameters of the mixture of generalized Gaussian distributions",

A classifier ensemble detects voiced/unvoiced utterances, then a correction method is proposed to improve the perception and production of voiced fricatives in a word-final position. Realizations of voiced fricatives contained in French sentences uttered by French and German speakers were analyzed to find out the deviations between the acoustic cues realized by the two groups of speakers. The correction method consists in substituting the erroneous devoiced fricative by TD-PSOLA concatenative synthesis that uses exemplars of voiced fricatives chosen from a French speaker corpus. To achieve a seamless concatenation the energy of the replacement fricative was adjusted with respect to the energy levels of the learner's and French speaker's preceding vowels. Finally, a perception experiment with the corrected stimuli has been carried out with French native speakers to check the appropriateness of the fricative revoicing. The results showed that the proposed revoicing strategy proved to be very efficient and can be used as an acoustic feedback",

In a dialect identification task, each group of children responded to 120 talkers from the same dialects representing three generations, ranging in age from old adults to children. There was a robust discrepancy in the children's dialect identification performance: WI children were able to identify talker dialect quite well (although still not as well as the adults) whereas NC children were at chance level. WI children were also more sensitive to cross-generational changes in both dialects as a function of diachronic sound change.

    "abstract": "Alveolar flaps are non-contrastive allophonic variants of alveolar stops in American English. A lexical decision experiment was conducted with Japanese learners of English (JE) to investigate whether second-language (L2) learners are sensitive to such allophonic variations when recognizing words in L2. The stimuli consisted of 36 isolated bisyllabic English words containing word-medial /t/, half of which were flap-favored words, e.g. city, and the other half were [t]-favored words, e.g. faster. All stimuli were recorded with two surface forms: /t/ as a flap, e.g. city with a flap, or as [t], e.g. city with [t]. The stimuli were counterbalanced so that participants only heard one of the two surface forms of each word. The accuracy data indicated that flap-favored words pronounced with a flap, e.g. city with a flap, were recognized significantly less accurately than flap-favored words with [t], e.g. city with [t], and [t]-favored words with [t], e.g. faster with [t]. These results suggest that JE learners prefer canonical forms over frequent forms produced with context-dependent allophonic variations. These results are inconsistent with previous studies that found native speakers' preference for frequent forms, and highlight differences in the effect of allophonic variations on the perception of native-language and L2 speech",

In order to assess the relative contribution of these language-specific properties to perceived accentedness and comprehensibility, speech produced by Spanish learners of Dutch was manipulated using transplantation and resynthesis techniques. Thus, eight manipulation conditions reflecting all possible combinations of L1 and L2 intonation, rhythm, and speech rate were created, resulting in 320 utterances that were rated by 50 Dutch natives on their degree of foreign accent and ease of comprehensibility Our analyses show that all manipulations result in lower accentedness and higher comprehensibility ratings. Moreover, both measures are not affected in the same way by different combinations of prosodic features: For accentedness, Dutch listeners appear most influenced by intonation, and intonation combined with speech rate. This holds for comprehensibility ratings as well, but here the combination of all three properties, including rhythm, also significantly affects ratings by native speakers. Thus, our study reaffirms the importance of differentiating between different aspects of perception and provides insight into those features that are most likely to affect how native speakers perceive second language learners",

Native listeners of Japanese (NJ) and L2 learners of Japanese with L1 backgrounds in Mandarin Chinese (NC), Seoul Korean (NK), American English (NE), and French (NFr) participated in a perception experiment. The results showed that the proportion of \"long\" responses increased as a function of vowel duration for all groups, giving s-shaped curves. Meanwhile, the presence or absence of a pitch fall within a syllable affected only NJ and NC's perception. Their category boundary occurred at a shorter duration for vowels with a pitch fall than without a pitch fall. Among the four groups of L2 learners, only NC use pitch fall to distinguish words in the L1. Thus, it is possible to think that the role of pitch fall as an L1 cue relates to its use as a cue for L2 length identification. L2 learners tend to attend to an important phonetic feature as a cue for perceiving an L1 category differentiating L1 words even in the L2 as implied by the Feature Hypothesis",

The preliminary results showed that, as the native speakers did, Chinese EFL learners employed different durational patterns to express the alternative meanings of the ambiguous sentences by altering prosodic phrasing. That is, the duration of the pre-boundary items were lengthened and pause were inserted at the boundary. But the perception experiment showed that the utterances produced by Chinese EFL learners couldn't be effectively perceived by the native speakers due to their different use of pre-boundary lengthening and pause.

As a result, the acoustic model is trained using examples that are virtually never repeated. We evaluate performance of this approach based on room simulation using a factored complex Fast Fourier Transform (CFFT) acoustic model introduced in our earlier work, which uses CFFT layers and LSTM AMs for joint multichannel processing and acoustic modeling.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel speech dereverberation framework that utilizes deep neural network (DNN)-based spectrum estimation to construct linear inverse filters. The proposed dereverberation framework is based on the state-of-the-art inverse filter estimation algorithm called weighted prediction error (WPE) algorithm, which is known to effectively reduce reverberation and greatly boost the ASR performance in various conditions. In WPE, the accuracy of the inverse filter estimation, and thus the dereverberation performance, is largely dependent on the estimation of the power spectral density (PSD) of the target signal. Therefore, the conventional WPE iteratively performs the inverse filter estimation, actual dereverberation and the PSD estimation to gradually improve the PSD estimate. However, while such iterative procedure works well when sufficiently long acoustically-stationary observed signals are available, WPE's performance degrades when the duration of observed/accessible data is short, which typically is the case for real-time applications using online block-batch processing with small batches. To solve this problem, we incorporate the DNN-based spectrum estimator into the framework of WPE, because a DNN can estimate the PSD robustly even from very short observed data. We experimentally show that the proposed framework outperforms the conventional WPE, and improves the ASR performance in real noisy reverberant environments in both single-channel and multichannel cases",

From the automatic speech recognition (ASR) perspective, one of the speakers is the target speaker, and the other speaker is a directional noise source. When the number of microphones is small, we often accept microphone intervals that are larger than the spatial aliasing limit because the performance of the beamformer is better. Unfortunately, such a configuration results in significant leakage of directional noise in certain frequency bands because the spatial aliasing makes the beamformer and post-filter inaccurate there. Thus, we introduce a factorial model to compensate only the degraded bands with information from the reliable bands in a probabilistic framework integrating our proposed metrics and speech model. In our experiments, the proposed method reduced the errors from 29.8% to 24.9%",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recognition of distant (far-field) speech is a challenge for ASR due to mismatch in recording conditions resulting from room reverberation and environment noise. Given the remarkable learning capacity of deep neural networks, there is increasing interest to address this problem by using a large corpus of reverberant far-field speech to train robust models. In this study, we explore how an end-to-end RNN acoustic model trained on speech from different rooms and acoustic conditions (different domains) achieves robustness to environmental variations. It is shown that the first hidden layer acts as a domain separator, projecting the data from different domains into different subspaces. The subsequent layers then use this encoded domain knowledge to map these features to final representations that are invariant to domain change. This mechanism is closely related to noise-aware or room-aware approaches which append manually-extracted domain signatures to the input features. Additionally, we demonstrate how this understanding of the learning procedure provides useful guidance for model adaptation to new acoustic conditions. We present results based on AMI corpus to demonstrate the propagation of domain information in a deep RNN, and perform recognition experiments which indicate the role of encoded domain knowledge on training and adaptation of RNN acoustic models",

    "abstract": "A speech coding for a full-band speech analysis/synthesis system is described. In this work, full-band speech is defined as speech with a sampling frequency above 40 kHz, whose Nyquist frequency covers the audible frequency range. In prior works, speech coding has generally focused on the narrow-band speech with a sampling frequency below 16 kHz. On the other hand, statistical parametric speech synthesis currently uses the full-band speech, and low-dimensional representation of speech parameters is being used. The purpose of this study is to achieve speech coding without deterioration for full-band speech. We focus on a high-quality speech analysis/synthesis system and mel-cepstral analysis using frequency warping. In the frequency warping function, we directly use three auditory scales. We carried out a subjective evaluation using the WORLD vocoder and found that the optimum number of dimensions was around 50. The kind of frequency warping did not significantly affect the sound quality in the dimensions",

    "title": "Robust Source-Filter Separation of Speech Signal in the Phase Domain",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In earlier work we proposed a framework for speech source-filter separation that employs phase-based signal processing. This paper presents a further theoretical investigation of the model and optimisations that make the filter and source representations less sensitive to the effects of noise and better matched to downstream processing. To this end, first, in computing the Hilbert transform, the log function is replaced by the generalised logarithmic function. This introduces a tuning parameter that adjusts both the dynamic range and distribution of the phase-based representation. Second, when computing the group delay, a more robust estimate for the derivative is formed by applying a regression filter instead of using sample differences. The effectiveness of these modifications is evaluated in clean and noisy conditions by considering the accuracy of the fundamental frequency extracted from the estimated source, and the performance of speech recognition features extracted from the estimated filter. In particular, the proposed filter-based front-end reduces Aurora-2 WERs by 6.3% (average 0–20 dB) compared with previously reported results. Furthermore, when tested in a LVCSR task (Aurora-4) the new features resulted in 5.8% absolute WER reduction compared to MFCCs without performance loss in the clean/matched condition",

All currently available pitch tracking algorithms perform a short-term analysis of a speech signal to extract the f under the assumption that the pitch does not change within a single analysis frame, a simplification that introduces errors when the f changes rather quickly over time. This paper proposes a new algorithm that warps the time axis of an analysis frame to counteract intra-frame f changes and thus to improve the total tracking results. The algorithm was evaluated on a set of 4718 sentences from 20 speakers (10 male, 10 female) and with added white and babble noise.

Detecting the VOPs in a given speech sequence, independent of the text contexts and recording environments, is a challenging area of research. Performance of existing VOP detection methods have not yet been extensively studied in varied environmental conditions. In this paper, we have exploited the non-local means estimation to detect those regions in the speech sequence which are of high signal-to-noise ratio and exhibit periodicity. Mostly, those regions happen to be the vowel regions. This helps in overcoming the ill-effects of environmental degradations. Next, for each short-time frame of estimated speech sequence, we cumulatively sum the magnitude of the corresponding Fourier transform spectrum. The cumulative sum is then used as the feature to detect the VOPs. The experiments conducted on TIMIT database show that the proposed approach provides better results in terms of detection and spurious rate when compared to a few existing methods under clean and noisy test conditions",

The noise component is often not accurately modeled in modern vocoders (e.g. STRAIGHT). For more natural sounding speech synthesis, four time-domain envelopes (Amplitude, Hilbert, Triangular and True) are investigated and enhanced, and then applied to the noise component of the excitation in our continuous vocoder. The performance evaluation is based on the study of time envelopes. In an objective experiment, we investigated the Phase Distortion Deviation of vocoded samples.

In this study, a novel SE method that integrates the discrete wavelet packet transform (DWPT) and a novel subspace-based method, robust principal component analysis (RPCA), is proposed to enhance noise-corrupted signals directly in the time domain. We evaluate the proposed SE method on the Mandarin hearing in noise test (MHINT) sentences.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Vowel onset point (VOP) refers to the starting event of a vowel, that may be reflected in different aspects of the speech signal. The major issue in VOP detection using existing methods is the confusion among the vowels and other categories of sounds preceding them. This work explores the usefulness of sonority information to reduce this confusion and improve VOP detection. Vowels are the most sonorant sounds followed by semivowels, nasals, voiced fricatives, voiced stops. The sonority feature is derived from the vocal-tract system, excitation source and suprasegmental aspects. As this feature has the capability to discriminate among different sonorant sound units, it reduces the confusion among onset of vowels with that of other sonorant sounds. This results in improved detection and resolution of VOP detection for continuous speech. The performance of proposed sonority information based VOP detection is found to be 92.4%, compared to 85.2% by the existing method. Also the resolution of localizing VOP within 10 ms is significantly enhanced and a performance of 73.0% is achieved as opposed to 60.2% by the existing method",

Analytic filter bank provides a simple, fast, and flexible method to construct time-frequency representations of signals.

Applications of analytic filter bank to different speech analysis tasks including pitch period estimation and pitch synchronous analysis of formant frequencies and bandwidths are demonstrated. In addition, a new feature vector called group delay vector is introduced. It is shown that this representation provides comparable, or even better results, than those obtained by spectral magnitude feature vectors in the analysis and classification of vowels.

The CLDNNs take advantage of frequency modeling with CNNs, temporal modeling with LSTM, and discriminative training with DNNs. Based on the CLDNN architecture, several novel attention-based mechanisms are proposed and applied on the LSTM layer to predict the importance of each time step. We evaluate the proposed method on the truncated version of the 2016 TUT acoustic scenes dataset which consists of recordings from 15 different scenes.

A five-dimensional (5D) feature is computed by employing non-negative matrix factorization with a fixed basis dictionary, constructed using spectra of five colored noises. Deep Neural Network (DNN) is used as the classifier. We consider two baseline features-1) Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), 2) features computed from a data driven dictionary. Experiments reveal that the features from the colored noise dictionary perform better (on average) than that using the data driven dictionary, with a relative improvement in the average V/UV accuracy of 10.30%, within, and 10.41%, across, data from seven subjects.

    "abstract": "Using context in automatic speech recognition allows the recognition system to dynamically task-adapt and bring gains to a broad variety of use-cases. An important mechanism of context-inclusion is on-the-fly rescoring of hypotheses with contextual language model content available only in real-time In systems where rescoring occurs on the lattice during its construction as part of beam search decoding, hypotheses eligible for rescoring may be missed due to pruning. This can happen for many reasons: the language model and rescoring model may assign significantly different scores, there may be a lot of noise in the utterance, or word prefixes with a high out-degree may necessitate aggressive pruning to keep the search tractable. This results in misrecognitions when contextually-relevant hypotheses are pruned before rescoring, even if a contextual rescoring model favors those hypotheses by a large margin We present a technique to adapt the beam search algorithm to preserve hypotheses when they may benefit from rescoring. We show that this technique significantly reduces the number of search pruning errors on rescorable hypotheses, without a significant increase in the search space size. This technique makes it feasible to use one base language model, but still achieve high-accuracy speech recognition results in all contexts",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Connectionist Temporal Classification has recently attracted a lot of interest as it offers an elegant approach to building acoustic models (AMs) for speech recognition. The CTC loss function maps an input sequence of observable feature vectors to an output sequence of symbols. Output symbols are conditionally independent of each other under CTC loss, so a language model (LM) can be incorporated conveniently during decoding, retaining the traditional separation of acoustic and linguistic components in ASR For fixed vocabularies, Weighted Finite State Transducers provide a strong baseline for efficient integration of CTC AMs with n-gram LMs. Character-based neural LMs provide a straight forward solution for open vocabulary speech recognition and all-neural models, and can be decoded with beam search. Finally, sequence-to-sequence models can be used to translate a sequence of individual sounds into a word string We compare the performance of these three approaches, and analyze their error patterns, which provides insightful guidance for future research and development in this important area",

However, training good DLMs can be time consuming especially for production-size models and corpora. Although several parallel training algorithms have been proposed to improve training efficiency, there is no clear guidance on which one to choose for the task in hand due to lack of systematic and fair comparison among them. In this paper we aim at filling this gap by comparing four popular parallel training algorithms in speech recognition, namely asynchronous stochastic gradient descent (ASGD), blockwise model-update filtering (BMUF), bulk synchronous parallel (BSP) and elastic averaging stochastic gradient descent (EASGD), on 1000-hour LibriSpeech corpora using feed-forward deep neural networks (DNNs) and convolutional, long short-term memory, DNNs (CLDNNs). Based on our experiments, we recommend using BMUF as the top choice to train acoustic models since it is most stable, scales well with number of GPUs, can achieve reproducible results, and in many cases even outperforms single-GPU SGD. ASGD can be used as a substitute in some cases",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are widely used in most current automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. To guarantee good recognition performance, DNNs usually require significant computational resources, which limits their application to low-power devices. Thus, it is appealing to reduce the computational cost while keeping the accuracy. In this work, in light of the success in image recognition, binary DNNs are utilized in speech recognition, which can achieve competitive performance and substantial speed up. To our knowledge, this is the first time that binary DNNs have been used in speech recognition. For binary DNNs, network weights and activations are constrained to be binary values, which enables faster matrix multiplication based on bit operations. By exploiting the hardware population count instructions, the proposed binary matrix multiplication can achieve 5~7 times speed up compared with highly optimized floating-point matrix multiplication. This results in much faster DNN inference since matrix multiplication is the most computationally expensive operation. Experiments on both TIMIT phone recognition and a 50-hour Switchboard speech recognition show that, binary DNNs can run about 4 times faster than standard DNNs during inference, with roughly 10.0% relative accuracy reduction",

This fact indicates that the performance of automatic speech recognition can be improved by taking the contextual factors into account, which can be estimated from speech acoustics. In this study, we attempt to find global and acoustic features that are associated with those contextual factors, then integrate those features into Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) language models for speech recognition. In experiments, using Japanese spontaneous speech corpora, we examine how i-vector and openSMILE are associated with contextual factors. Then, we use those features in the reranking process of RNN-based language models.

    "abstract": "Language models (LMs) have gained dramatic improvement in the past years due to the wide application of neural networks. This raises the question of how far we are away from the perfect language model and how much more research is needed in language modelling. As for perplexity giving a value for human perplexity (as an upper bound of what is reasonably expected from an LM) is difficult. Word error rate (WER) has the disadvantage that it also measures the quality of other components of a speech recognizer like the acoustic model and the feature extraction. We therefore suggest evaluating LMs in a generative setting (which has been done before on selected hand-picked examples) and running a human evaluation on the generated sentences. The results imply that LMs need about 10 to 20 more years of research before human performance is reached. Moreover, we show that the human judgement scores on the generated sentences and perplexity are closely correlated. This leads to an estimated perplexity of 12 for an LM that would be able to pass the human judgement test in the setting we suggested",

Pure prosody based approaches usually have low computation needs, introduce little latency (delay) and they are also more robust to ASR errors. Text based approaches usually yield better performance, they are however resource demanding (both regarding their training and computational needs), often introduce high time latency and are more sensitive to ASR errors. The present paper proposes a lightweight prosody based punctuation approach following a new paradigm: we argue in favour of an all-inclusive modelling of speech prosody instead of just relying on distinct acoustic markers: first, the entire phonological phrase structure is reconstructed, then its close correlation with punctuations is exploited in a sequence modelling approach with recurrent neural networks. With this tiny and easy to implement model we reach performance in Hungarian punctuation comparable to large, text based models for other languages by keeping resource requirements minimal and suitable for real-time operation with low latency",

The present work investigated three factors affecting the intelligibility of low-pass filtered speech, i.e., vowels, temporal fine-structure, and fundamental frequency (F0) contour. Mandarin sentences were processed to generate three types (i.e., vowel-only, fine-structure-only, and F0-contour-flattened) of low-pass filtered stimuli. Listening experiments with normal-hearing listeners showed that among the three factors assessed, the vowel-only low-pass filtered speech was the most intelligible, which was followed by the fine-structure-based low-pass filtered speech.

    "abstract": "The current study explores how native and non-native speakers cope with simultaneous articulatory and acoustic distortion in speech perception. The articulatory distortion was generated by asking a speaker to articulate target speech as fast as possible (fast speech). The acoustic distortion was created by dividing speech signals into small segments with equal time duration (e.g., 50 ms) from the onset of speech, and flipping every segment on a temporal axis, and putting them back together (locally time-reversed speech). This study explored how \"locally time-reversed fast speech\" was intelligible as compared to \"locally time-reversed normal speech\" measured in Ishida, Samuel, and Arai (2016). Participants were native English speakers and native Japanese speakers who spoke English as a second language. They listened to English words and pseudowords that contained a lot of stop consonants. These items were spoken fast and locally time-reversed at every 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, or 60 ms. In general, \"locally time-reversed fast speech\" became gradually unintelligible as the length of reversed segments increased. Native speakers generally understood locally time-reversed fast spoken words well but not pseudowords, while non-native speakers hardly understood both words and pseudowords.

Listeners were subsequently more likely to identify sounds along a continuum between [f] and [s], and to interpret minimal word pairs, in a manner consistent with this exposure.

This was done by determining how the spectral profile of speech is affected by different emotional expressions using three different expressive speech databases. We then examined if these changes were correlated with scores produced by an objective intelligibility metric. We found a relatively consistent shift in spectral energy for different emotions across the databases and a high correlation between the extent of these changes and the objective intelligibility scores. Moreover, the pattern of intelligibility scores is consistent with human perception studies (although there was considerable individual variation).

Two experiments tested whether long-term tracking of rate influences perception of the temporal Dutch vowel contrast /ɑ/-/a:/. In Experiment 1, one low-rate group listened to ‘neutral' rate speech from talker A and to slow speech from talker B. Another high-rate group was exposed to the same neutral speech from A, but to fast speech from B. Between-group comparison of the ‘neutral' trials revealed that the low-rate group reported a higher proportion of /a:/ in A's ‘neutral' speech, indicating that A sounded faster when B was slow. Experiment 2 tested whether one's own speech rate also contributes to effects of long-term tracking of rate. Here, talker B's speech was replaced by playback of participants' own fast or slow speech. No evidence was found that one's own voice affected perception of talker A in larger speech contexts.

Studies using the ‘thin-slicing' approach show that accurate judgments of the speaker's emotional state can be made from minimal quantities of speech. The present experiment tested the performance of listeners exposed to thin-sliced samples of spoken Brazilian Portuguese selected to exemplify four emotions ( anger, fear, sadness, happiness). Rather than attaching verbal labels to the audio samples, participants were asked to pair the excerpts with averaged facial images illustrating the four emotion categories. Half of the listeners were native speakers of Brazilian Portuguese, while the others were native English speakers who knew no Portuguese. Both groups of participants were found to be accurate and consistent in assigning the audio samples to the expected emotion category, but some emotions were more reliably identified than others. Fear was misidentified most frequently. We conclude that the phonetic cues to speakers' emotional states are sufficiently salient and differentiated that listeners need only a few syllables upon which to base judgments, and that as a species we owe our perceptual sensitivity in this area to the survival value of being able to make rapid decisions concerning the psychological states of others",

In a perceptual experiment, we corroborate the finding that the quality of this illusory vowel is language-dependent, but also that this default choice can be overridden by coarticulatory information present on the consonant cluster. In a second step, we analyse recordings of JP and BP speakers producing ‘epenthesized' versions of stimuli from the perceptual task. Results reveal that the default vowel corresponds to the vowel with the most reduced acoustic characteristics and whose formants are acoustically closest to formant transitions present in consonantal clusters.

This paper reports an analogous experiment to determine whether lifting the slope of the speech spectrum by 6 dB/octave affects the perception of speaker size with voiced speech (words). The results showed that voiced speech with high-frequency enhancement was perceived to arise from smaller speakers. On average, the point of subjective equality in MFF discrimination was reduced by about 5%. However, there were large individual differences; some listeners were effectively insensitive to spectral enhancement of 6 dB/octave; others showed a consistent effect of the same enhancement.

Experimental results show that the recognition rates for emotions and perceived emotional strength degrade as signal-to-noise ratio decreases. Interestingly, misperceptions seem to be more pronounced for negative and low-arousal emotions such as calmness or anger, while positive emotions such as happiness appear to be more robust to noise.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Previous studies showed for German and other (West) Germanic language, including English, that perceived syllable prominence is primarily controlled by changes in duration and F0, with the latter cue being more powerful than the former. Our study is an initial approach to develop this prominence hierarchy further by putting numbers on the interplay of duration and F0. German listeners indirectly judged through lexical identification the relative prominence levels of two neighboring syllables. Results show that an increase in F0 of between 0.49 and 0.76 st is required to outweigh the prominence effect of a 30% increase in duration of a neighboring syllable. These numbers are fairly stable across a large range of absolute F0 and duration levels and hence useful in speech technology",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "This study explores the relationship between identification, degree of nasality and vowel quality in oral, nasal and nasalized vowels in Brazilian Portuguese. Despite common belief that the language possesses contrastive nasal vowels, literature examination shows that nasal vowels may be followed by a nasal resonance, while nasalized vowels must be followed by a nasal consonant. It is argued that the nasal resonance may be the remains of a consonant that nasalizes the vowel, making nasal vowels simply coarticulatorily nasalized (e.g. [1]). If so, vowel nasality should not be more informative for the perception of a word containing a nasal vowel than for a word containing a nasalized vowel, as nasality is attributed to coarticulation. To test this hypothesis, randomized stimuli containing the first syllable of words with oral, nasal and nasalized vowels were presented to BP listeners who had to identify the stimuli original word. Preliminary results demonstrate that accuracy decreased for nasal and nasalized stimuli. A comparison between patterns of response to measured degrees of vowel acoustic nasality and formant values demonstrate that vowel quality differences may play a more relevant role in word identification than type of nasality in a vowel",

No age-related phonetic cues were provided within the target words; instead, the non-related prime words contained a sociophonetic variable involved in ongoing change. We found that age-associated words are recognized faster when preceded by an age-congruent phonetic variant in the prime word.

    "abstract": "Several technologies, such as electromagnetic midsagittal articulography (EMA) or real-time magnetic resonance (RT-MRI), enable studying the static and dynamic aspects of speech production. The resulting knowledge can, in turn, inform the improvement of speech production models, e.g., for articulatory speech synthesis, by enabling the identification of which articulators and gestures are involved in producing specific sounds The amount of data available from these technologies, and the need for a systematic quantitative assessment, advise tackling these matters through data-driven approaches, preferably unsupervised, since annotated data is scarce. In this context, a method for statistical identification of critical articulators has been proposed, in the literature, and successfully applied to EMA data. However, the many differences regarding the data available from other technologies, such as RT-MRI, and language-specific aspects create a challenging setting for its direct and wider applicability In this article, we address the steps needed to extend the applicability of the proposed statistical analyses, initially applied to EMA, to an existing RT-MRI corpus and test it for a different language, European Portuguese. The obtained results, for three speakers, and considering 33 phonemes, provide phonologically meaningful critical articulator outcomes and show evidence of the applicability of the method to RT-MRI",

    "abstract": "Recent developments in real-time magnetic resonance imaging (rtMRI) have enabled the study of vocal tract dynamics during production of running speech at high frame rates (e.g., 83 frames per second). Such large amounts of acquired data require scalable automated methods to identify different articulators (e.g., tongue, velum) for further analysis. In this paper, we propose a convolutional neural network with an encoder-decoder architecture to jointly detect the relevant air-tissue boundaries as well as to label them, which we refer to as ‘semantic edge detection'. We pose this as a pixel labeling problem, with the outline contour of each articulator of interest as positive class and the remaining tissue and airway as negative classes. We introduce a loss function modified with additional penalty for misclassification at air-tissue boundaries to account for class imbalance and improve edge localization. We then use a greedy search algorithm to draw contours from the probability maps of the positive classes predicted by the network. The articulator contours obtained by our method are comparable to the true labels generated by iteratively fitting a manually created subject-specific template. Our results generalize well across subjects and different vocal tract postures, demonstrating a significant improvement over the structured regression baseline",

Vocal tract airway tissue boundary segmentation in the mid-sagittal plane is necessary as an initial step for extraction of the cross-sectional area function. This segmentation problem is however challenging due to poor resolution of real-time speech MRI, grainy noise and the rapidly varying vocal tract shape. We present a novel approach to vocal tract airway tissue boundary tracking by training a statistical shape and appearance model for human vocal tract. We manually segment a set of vocal tract profiles and utilize a statistical approach to train a shape and appearance model for the tract. An active contour approach is employed to segment the airway tissue boundaries of the vocal tract while restricting the curve movement to the trained shape and appearance model. Then the contours in subsequent frames are tracked using dense motion estimation methods.

To alleviate this difficulty, we propose an objective critical distance (OCD) that can be determined from the spectral envelope of a speech signal. OCD is defined as that spacing between the adjacent formants when the level of the spectral valley between them reaches the mean spectral value. The measured OCD lies in the same range of 3 to 3.5 Bark as the subjective critical distance for similar experimental conditions giving credibility to the definition.

While few studies investigated the effect on onset f0 from the aspiration of affricates. The differences between stops and affricates in aspiration leave space for further investigations. We examined the effect of affricate's aspiration on the realization of onset f0 of following vowels in the form of isolated syllables and continuous speech by reference to a minimal pair of syllables which differ only in aspiration. Besides, we conducted tone identification tests using two sets of tone continua based on the same minimal pair of syllables. Experimental results showed that the aspirated syllables increased the onset f0 of following vowels compared with unaspirated counterparts in both kinds of contexts. While the magnitude of differences varied with tones. And the perception results showed that aspirated syllables tended to be perceived as tones that have relative lower onset f0, which in turn supported the production result.

Previous studies have focused on audiovisual recalibration of consonant categories. The present study explores whether vowel categorization, which is known to show less sharply defined category boundaries, also benefit from visual cues Participants were exposed to videos of a speaker pronouncing one out of two vowels, paired with audio that was ambiguous between the two vowels. After exposure, it was found that participants had recalibrated their vowel categories. In addition, individual variability in audiovisual recalibration is discussed. It is suggested that listeners' category sharpness may be related to the weight they assign to visual information in audiovisual speech perception. Specifically, listeners with less sharp categories assign more weight to visual information during audiovisual speech recognition",

We studied five measures of persuasiveness. Results showed that for all but one measure, viewing the video with accompanying gestures made the speech more persuasive.

Two experiments were conducted to evaluate how listeners use the information of talker gender to adjust their expectation towards speakers' pitch range and uncover intended tonal targets in Cantonese tone perception. Results from an audio-only tone identification task showed that tone categorization along the same pitch continuum shifted under different conditions of voice gender. Listeners generally heard a tone of lower pitch when the word was produced by a female voice, while they heard a tone of higher pitch when the word was produced at the same pitch level by a male voice. Results from an audio-visual tone identification task showed that tone categorization along the same pitch continuum shifted under different conditions of face gender, despite the fact that the photos of different genders were disguised for the same set of stimuli in identical voices with identical pitch heights.

Although previous studies have demonstrated visual [1, 2] and somatosensory interactions [3, 4] with auditory processing, it is not clear whether somatosensory information can contribute to the processing of audio-visual speech perception. This study explored the neural consequence of somatosensory interactions in audio-visual speech processing. We assessed whether somatosensory orofacial stimulation influenced event-related potentials (ERPs) in response to an audio-visual speech illusion (the McGurk Effect [1]). 64 scalp sites of ERPs were recorded in response to audio-visual speech stimulation and somatosensory stimulation. In the audio-visual condition, an auditory stimulus /ba/ was synchronized with the video of congruent facial motion (the production of /ba/) or incongruent facial motion (the production of the /da/: McGurk condition). These two audio-visual stimulations were randomly presented with and without somatosensory stimulation associated with facial skin deformation. We found ERPs differences associated with the McGurk effect in the presence of the somatosensory conditions. ERPs for the McGurk effect reliably diverge around 280 ms after auditory onset. The results demonstrate a change of cortical potential of audio-visual processing due to somatosensory inputs and suggest that somatosensory information encoding facial motion also influences speech processing",

The difference in pupil diameter trajectories across the two conditions was analyzed with Functional Data Analysis. In line with the expectations, the results indicate greater dilation in the mismatch condition starting from around 800 ms after the stimulus onset.

By asking 40 subjects to select the most fitted textures from 36 figures with different textures after listening 30 speech samples with different phonations, we measured the correlations between acoustic parameters showing voice source variations and the parameters of selected textural image differences showing coarseness, contrast, directionality, busyness, complexity and strength. From the texture classifications, voice characteristics can be roughly characterized by textural differences: modal — gauzy, banded and smeared, creaky — porous, crystalline, cracked and scaly, breathy — smeared, freckled and stained. We have also found significant correlations between voice source acoustic parameters and textural parameters. These correlations suggest the possibility of cross-modal mapping between voice source characteristics and textural parameters, which enables visualization of speech information with source variations reflecting human sentiment perception",

In this paper, Lombard speech effects were investigated in pilot data from four adult speakers with normal vocal function who read a phonetically balanced paragraph in the presence of different ambient acoustic noise levels. Whereas the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the microphone signal decreased in the presence of increasing ambient noise level, the SNR of the accelerometer sensor remained high. Lombard speech properties were thus robustly computed from the accelerometer signal and observed in all four speakers who exhibited increases in average estimates of sound pressure level (+2.3 dB), fundamental frequency (+21.4 Hz), and cepstral peak prominence (+1.3 dB) from quiet to loud ambient conditions.

During simultaneous recording of speech and EGG signals, the speech signal will be delayed by the duration corresponding to the speech wave propagation from the glottis to the microphone relative to the EGG signal. Even in same session of recording, the delay between the speech and the EGG signals is varying due to the natural movement of speaker's head and movement of microphone in case MIC is held by hand. To study and model the information within glottal cycles, precise synchronization of speech and EGG signals is of utmost necessity. In this work, we propose a method for synchronization of speech and EGG signals based on the glottal activity information present in the signals. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated by estimation of delay between the two signals (speech signals and corresponding EGG signals) and synchronizing these signals by compensating the estimated delay.

In this paper we propose a scalable data-driven approach to construct a set of salient units made of sequences of phones called M-phones. We illustrate that since the decomposition of a word sequence into a sequence of M-phones is ambiguous, those units are well suited to be used with a connectionist temporal classification (CTC) approach which does not rely on an explicit frame-level segmentation of the word sequence into a sequence of acoustic units.

    "abstract": "Different training and adaptation techniques for multilingual Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) are explored in the context of hybrid systems, exploiting Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and Hidden Markov Models (HMM). In multilingual DNN training, the hidden layers (possibly extracting bottleneck features) are usually shared across languages, and the output layer can either model multiple sets of language-specific senones or one single universal IPA-based multilingual senone set. Both architectures are investigated, exploiting and comparing different language adaptive training (LAT) techniques originating from successful DNN-based speaker-adaptation. More specifically, speaker adaptive training methods such as Cluster Adaptive Training (CAT) and Learning Hidden Unit Contribution (LHUC) are considered. In addition, a language adaptive output architecture for IPA-based universal DNN is also studied and tested Experiments show that LAT improves the performance and adaptation on the top layer further improves the accuracy. By combining state-level minimum Bayes risk (sMBR) sequence training with LAT, we show that a language adaptively trained IPA-based universal DNN outperforms a monolingually sequence trained model",

Similarly, DNN based acoustic model adaptation to new environmental conditions is another challenging topic. In this paper we present an analysis of acoustic model adaptation in presence of a disjoint speech enhancement component, identifying an optimal setting for improving the speech recognition performance. Adaptation is derived from a consolidated technique that introduces in the training process a regularization term to prevent overfitting. We propose to optimize the adaptation of the clean acoustic models towards the enhanced speech by tuning the regularization term based on the degree of enhancement.

However, almost all adaptation methods for DNNs have to consider various heuristic conditions such as mini-batch sizes, learning rate scheduling, stopping criteria, and initialization conditions because of the inherent property of a stochastic gradient descent (SGD)-based training process. Unfortunately, those heuristic conditions are hard to be properly tuned. To alleviate those difficulties, in this paper, we propose a least squares regression-based speaker adaptation method in a DNN framework utilizing posterior mean of each class. Also, we show how the proposed method can provide a unique solution which is quite easy and fast to calculate without SGD. The proposed method was evaluated in the TED-LIUM corpus.

    "abstract": "It is challenging to obtain large amounts of native (matched) labels for audio in under-resourced languages. This could be due to a lack of literate speakers of the language or a lack of universally acknowledged orthography. One solution is to increase the amount of labeled data by using mismatched transcription, which employs transcribers who do not speak the language (in place of native speakers), to transcribe what they hear as nonsense speech in their own language (e.g., Mandarin). This paper presents a multi-task learning framework where the DNN acoustic model is simultaneously trained using both a limited amount of native (matched) transcription and a larger set of mismatched transcription. We find that by using a multi-task learning framework, we achieve improvements over monolingual baselines and previously proposed mismatched transcription adaptation techniques. In addition, we show that using alignments provided by a GMM adapted by mismatched transcription further improves acoustic modeling performance.

Therefore, if word vectors that take prosodic information into account can be obtained, it would be expected to improve the quality of synthesized speech. In this paper, to obtain word-level vectors that take prosodic information into account, we propose a novel prosody aware word-level encoder. A novel point of the proposed technique is to train a word-level encoder by using a large speech corpus constructed for automatic speech recognition. A word-level encoder that estimates the F0 contour for each word from the input word sequence is trained. The outputs of the bottleneck layer in the trained encoder are used as the word-level vector. By training the relationship between words and their prosodic information by using large speech corpus, the outputs of the bottleneck layer would be expected to contain prosodic information.

In the context of text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis, a front-end is a key component for extracting multi-level linguistic features from text, where syllable acts as a link between low- and high-level features. This paper describes the use of global syllable vectors as features to build a front-end, particularly evaluated in Chinese. The global syllable vectors directly capture global statistics of syllable-syllable co-occurrences in a large-scale text corpus. They are learned by a global log-bilinear regression model in an unsupervised manner, whilst the front-end is built using deep bidirectional recurrent neural networks in a supervised fashion. Experiments are conducted on large-scale Chinese speech and treebank text corpora, evaluating grapheme to phoneme (G2P) conversion, word segmentation, part of speech (POS) tagging, phrasal chunking, and pause break prediction. Results show that the proposed method is efficient for building a compact and robust front-end with high performance.

Constructing a matrix recording the co-occurrence of textual objects with acoustic events and reducing its dimensionality with matrix decomposition results in a set of context-independent representations of word types. These are applied to the task of acoustic modelling for speech synthesis; objective and subjective results indicate that these representations are useful for the generation of acoustic parameters in a text-to-speech (TTS) system.

We introduce a DNN voice built entirely from spontaneous conversational speech data and capable of producing a continuum of vocal efforts, prolongations and filled pauses with a corpus-based method. Results of a listener evaluation indicate that decreased vocal effort, filled pauses and prolongation of function words increase the degree of perceived uncertainty of conversational utterances expressing the speaker's beliefs. We demonstrate that the effect of these three cues are not merely additive, but that interaction effects, in particular between the two types of disfluencies and between vocal effort and prolongations need to be considered when aiming to communicate a specific level of uncertainty. The implications of these findings are relevant for adaptive and incremental conversational systems using expressive speech synthesis and aspiring to communicate the attitude of uncertainty",

The system uses a client-server architecture, whereby information about each manual edit is posted to the server. Such information can be used to dynamically update the one-best ASR output for all utterances currently in the editing pipeline. We propose to make updates in three different ways; by finding a new one-best path through an existing ASR lattice consistent with the correction received; by identifying further instances of out-of-vocabulary terms entered by the user; and by adapting the language model on the fly.

    "abstract": "I will describe the current status of a long-term effort at developing dialogue systems that go beyond simple task execution models to systems that involve collaborative problem solving. Such systems involve open-ended discussion and the tasks cannot be accomplished without extensive interaction (e.g., 10 turns or more). The key idea is that dialogue itself arises from an agent's ability for collaborative problem solving (CPS). In such dialogues, agents may introduce, modify and negotiate goals; propose and discuss the merits possible paths to solutions; explicitly discuss progress as the two agents work towards the goals; and evaluate how well a goal was accomplished. To complicate matters, user utterances in such settings are much more complex than seen in simple task execution dialogues and requires full semantic parsing. A key question we have been exploring in the past few years is how much of dialogue can be accounted for by domain-independent mechanisms. I will discuss these issues and draw examples from a dialogue system we have built that, except for the specialized domain reasoning required in each case, uses the same architecture to perform three different tasks: collaborative blocks world planning, when the system and user build structures and may have differing goals; biocuration, in which a biologist and the system interact in order to build executable causal models of biological pathways; and collaborative composition, where the user and system collaborate to compose simple pieces of music",

Despite prior speech-based depression studies that have used a variety of speech elicitation methods, there has been little evaluation of the best elicitation mode. One approach to understand this better is to analyze an existing database from the perspective of articulation effort, word affect, and linguistic complexity measures as proxies for depression sub-symptoms (e.g. psychomotor retardation, negative stimulus suppression, cognitive impairment). Here a novel measure for quantifying articulation effort is introduced, and when applied experimentally to the DAIC corpus shows promise for identifying speech data that are more discriminative of depression. Interestingly, experiment results demonstrate that by selecting speech with higher articulation effort, linguistic complexity, or word-based arousal/valence, improvements in acoustic speech-based feature depression classification performance can be achieved, serving as a guide for future elicitation design",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of time-varying channels in speech-recognition-based human-robot interaction using Locally-Normalized Filter-Bank features (LNFB), and training strategies that compensate for microphone response and room acoustics. Testing utterances were generated by re-recording the Aurora-4 testing database using a PR2 mobile robot, equipped with a Kinect audio interface while performing head rotations and movements toward and away from a fixed source. Three training conditions were evaluated called Clean, 1-IR and 33-IR. With Clean training, the DNN-HMM system was trained using the Aurora-4 clean training database. With 1-IR training, the same training data were convolved with an impulse response estimated at one meter from the source with no rotation of the robot head. With 33-IR training, the Aurora-4 training data were convolved with impulse responses estimated at one, two and three meters from the source and 11 angular positions of the robot head. The 33-IR training method produced reductions in WER greater than 50% when compared with Clean training using both LNFB and conventional Mel filterbank features. Nevertheless, LNFB features provided a WER 23% lower than MelFB using 33-IR training. The use of 33-IR training and LNFB features reduced WER by 64% compared to Clean training and MelFB features",

To further improve the efficacy of such interactions, user-adaptation strategies based on the individual needs of a child are required. In this regard, the proposed study assesses the suitability of a range of speech-based classification approaches for automatic detection of autism severity according to the commonly used Social Responsiveness Scale second edition (SRS-2). Autism is characterised by socialisation limitations including child language and communication ability. When compared to neurotypical children of the same age these can be a strong indication of severity. This study introduces a novel dataset of 803 utterances recorded from 14 autistic children aged between 4–10 years, during Wizard-of-Oz interactions with a humanoid robot. Our results demonstrate the suitability of support vector machines (SVMs) which use acoustic feature sets from multiple Interspeech COMPARE challenges. We also evaluate deep spectrum features, extracted via an image classification convolutional neural network (CNN) from the spectrogram of autistic speech instances. At best, by using SVMs on the acoustic feature sets, we achieved a UAR of 73.7% for the proposed 3-class task",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "According to accounts of inter-speaker coordination based on internal predictive models, speakers tend to imitate each other each time they need to coordinate their behavior. According to accounts based on the notion of dynamical coupling, imitation should be observed only if it helps stabilizing the specific coordinative pattern produced by the interlocutors or if it is a direct consequence of inter-speaker coordination. To compare these accounts, we implemented an artificial agent designed to repeat a speech utterance while coordinating its behavior with that of a human speaker performing the same task. We asked 10 Italian speakers to repeat the utterance /topkop/ simultaneously with the agent during short time intervals. In some interactions, the agent was parameterized to cooperate with the speakers (by producing its syllables simultaneously with those of the human) while in others it was parameterized to compete with them (by producing its syllables in-between those of the human). A positive correlation between the stability of inter-speaker coordination and the degree of f0 imitation was observed only in cooperative interactions. However, in line with accounts based on prediction, speakers imitate the f0 of the agent regardless of whether this is parameterized to cooperate or to compete with them",

    "abstract": "Performative time and pitch scaling is a new research paradigm for prosodic analysis by synthesis. In this paper, a system for real-time recorded speech time and pitch scaling by the means of hands or feet gestures is designed and evaluated. Pitch is controlled with the preferred hand, using a stylus on a graphic tablet. Time is controlled using rhythmic frames, or constriction gestures, defined by pairs of control points. The \"Arsis\" corresponds to the constriction (weak beat of the syllable) and the \"Thesis\" corresponds to the vocalic nucleus (strong beat of the syllable). This biphasic control of rhythmic units is performed by the non-preferred hand using a button. Pitch and time scales are modified according to these gestural controls with the help of a real-time pitch synchronous overlap-add technique (RT-PSOLA). Rhythm and pitch control accuracy are assessed in a prosodic imitation experiment: the task is to reproduce intonation and rhythm of various sentences. The results show that inter-vocalic durations differ on average of only 20 ms. The system appears as a new and effective tool for performative speech and singing synthesis.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In conversation, speakers spontaneously produce manual gestures that can facilitate listeners' comprehension of speech. However, various factors may affect listeners' ability to use gesture cues. Here we examine a situation where a speaker is referring to physical objects in the contextual here-and-now. In this situation, objects for potential reference will compete with gestures for visual attention. In two experiments, a speaker provided instructions to pick up objects in the visual environment (\" Pick up the candy\"). On some trials, the speaker produced a \"pick up\" gesture that reflected the size/shape of the target object. Gaze position was recorded to evaluate how listeners allocated attention to scene elements. Experiment 1 showed that, although iconic gestures (when present) were rarely fixated directly, peripheral uptake of these cues speeded listeners' visual identification of intended referents as the instruction unfolded. However, the benefit was mild and occurred primarily for small/hard-to-identify objects. In Experiment 2, background noise was added to reveal whether challenging auditory environments lead listeners to allocate additional visual attention to gesture cues in a compensatory manner. Interestingly, background noise actually reduced listeners' use of gesture cues. Together the findings highlight how situational factors govern the use of visual cues during multimodal communication",

In the context of human-computer interaction, these responses can be used by an artificial agent to build rapport in conversations with users. In the past, multiple approaches have been proposed to detect backchannel cues and to predict the most natural timing to place those backchannel utterances. Most of these are based on manually optimized fixed rules, which may fail to generalize. Many systems rely on the location and duration of pauses and pitch slopes of specific lengths. In the past, we proposed an approach by training artificial neural networks on acoustic features such as pitch and power and also attempted to add word embeddings via word2vec. In this work, we refined this approach by evaluating different methods to add timed word embeddings via word2vec. Comparing the performance using various feature combinations, we could show that adding linguistic features improves the performance over a prediction system that only uses acoustic features",

The main goal is to establish the nature of an increment whose processing will result in a reliable overall system performance. We explore scenarios where increments are tokens or syntactically, semantically or prosodically motivated chunks. Combing local classification with meta-classifiers at a late fusion decision level we obtained state-of-the-art classification performance. Experiments were carried out on manually corrected transcriptions and on potentially erroneous ASR output. Chunk-based classification yields better results on the manual transcriptions, whereas token-based classification shows a more robust performance on the ASR output. It is also demonstrated that layered hierarchical and cascade training procedures result in better classification performance than the single-layered approach based on a joint classification predicting complex class labels",

    "title": "Clear Speech — Mere Speech? How Segmental and Prosodic Speech Reduction Shape the Impression That Speakers Create on Listeners",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Research on speech reduction is primarily concerned with analyzing, modeling, explaining, and, ultimately, predicting phonetic variation. That is, the focus is on the speech signal itself. The present paper adds a little side note to this fundamental line of research by addressing the question whether variation in the degree of reduction also has a systematic effect on the attributes we ascribe to the speaker who produces the speech signal. A perception experiment was carried out for German in which 46 listeners judged whether or not speakers showing 3 different combinations of segmental and prosodic reduction levels (unreduced, moderately reduced, strongly reduced) are appropriately described by 13 physical, social, and cognitive attributes. The experiment shows that clear speech is not mere speech, and less clear speech is not just reduced either. Rather, results revealed a complex interplay of reduction levels and perceived speaker attributes in which moderate reduction can make a better impression on listeners than no reduction. In addition to its relevance in reduction models and theories, this interplay is instructive for various fields of speech application from social robotics to charisma coaching",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the relationship between perceived hostility and speech timing features within extracts from Montreuil's City Council sessions in 2013, marked by a tense political context at this time. A dataset of 118 speech extracts from the mayor (Dominique Voynet) and four of her political opponents during the City Council has been analyzed through the combination of perception tests and speech timing phenomena, estimated from classical timing-related measurements and custom metrics. We also develop a methodological framework for the phonetic analysis of nonscripted speech: a double perceptive evaluation of the original dataset (22 participants) allowed us to measure the difference of hostility perceived (dHost) between the original audio extracts and their read transcriptions, and the five speakers produced the same utterances in a controlled reading task to make the direct comparison with original extracts possible. Correlations between dHost and speech timing features differences between each original utterance and its control counterpart show that perceived hostility is mainly influenced by local deviations to the expected accentuation pattern in French combined with the insertion of silent pauses. Moreover, a finer-grained analysis of rhythmic features reveals different strategies amongst speakers, especially regarding the realization of interpausal speech rate variation and final syllables lengthening",

    "abstract": "A great number of investigations on person characterization rely on the assessment of the Big-Five personality traits, a prevalent and widely accepted model with strong psychological foundation. However, in the context on characterizing unfamiliar individuals from their voices only, it may be hard for assessors to determine the Big-Five traits based on their first impression. In this study, a 28-item semantic differential rating scale has been completed by a total of 33 listeners who were presented with 15 male voice stimuli. A factor analysis on their responses enabled us to identify five perceptual factors of person attribution: (social and physical) attractiveness, confidence, apathy, serenity, and incompetence. A discussion on the relations of these dimensions of speaker attribution to the Big-Five factors is provided and speech features relevant to the automatic prediction of our dimensions are analyzed, together with SVM regression performance. Although more data are needed to validate our findings, we believe that our approach can lead to establish a space of person attributions with dimensions that can easily be detected from utterances in zero-acquaintance scenarios",

Specifically we examine pitch accent realisations in the GECO corpus of German conversations. Pitch accents are represented as 6-dimensional vectors where each dimension corresponds to a characteristic of the accent's shape. Convergence/divergence is then measured by calculating the distance between pitch accent realisations of conversational partners. A decrease of distance values over time indicates convergence, an increase divergence. The corpus comprises dialogue sessions in two modalities: partners either saw each other during the conversation or not. Linear mixed model analyses show convergence as well as divergence effects in the realisations of H*L accents. This convergence/divergence is strongly related to the modality and to how much speakers like their partners: generally, seeing the partner comes with divergence, whereas when the dialogue partners cannot see each other, there is convergence. The effect varies, however, depending on the extent to which a speaker likes their partner. Less liking entails a greater change in the realisations over time — stronger divergence when partners could see each other, and stronger convergence when they could not",

    "abstract": "Automatic personality analysis has gained attention in the last years as a fundamental dimension in human-to-human and human-to-machine interaction. However, it still suffers from limited number and size of speech corpora for specific domains, such as the assessment of children's personality. This paper investigates a semi-supervised training approach to tackle this scenario. We devise an experimental setup with age and language mismatch and two training sets: a small labeled training set from the Interspeech 2012 Personality Sub-challenge, containing French adult speech labeled with personality OCEAN traits, and a large unlabeled training set of Portuguese children's speech. As test set, a corpus of Portuguese children's speech labeled with OCEAN traits is used. Based on this setting, we investigate a weak supervision approach that iteratively refines an initial model trained with the labeled data-set using the unlabeled data-set. We also investigate knowledge-based features, which leverage expert knowledge in acoustic-prosodic cues and thus need no extra data. Results show that, despite the large mismatch imposed by language and age differences, it is possible to attain improvements with these techniques, pointing both to the benefits of using a weak supervision and expert-based acoustic-prosodic features across age and language",

    "abstract": "Recent work on end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) has shown that the connectionist temporal classification (CTC) loss can be used to convert acoustics to phone or character sequences. Such systems are used with a dictionary and separately-trained Language Model (LM) to produce word sequences. However, they are not truly end-to-end in the sense of mapping acoustics directly to words without an intermediate phone representation. In this paper, we present the first results employing direct acoustics-to-word CTC models on two well-known public benchmark tasks: Switchboard and CallHome. These models do not require an LM or even a decoder at run-time and hence recognize speech with minimal complexity. However, due to the large number of word output units, CTC word models require orders of magnitude more data to train reliably compared to traditional systems. We present some techniques to mitigate this issue. Our CTC word model achieves a word error rate of 13.0%/18.8% on the Hub5-2000 Switchboard/CallHome test sets without any LM or decoder compared with 9.6%/16.0% for phone-based CTC with a 4-gram LM.

However, one of the problems with two-dimensional LSTMs, such as Grid-LSTMs, is that the processing in both time and frequency occurs sequentially, thus increasing computational complexity. In this work, we look at minimizing the dependence of the Grid-LSTM with respect to previous time and frequency points in the sequence, thus reducing computational complexity. Specifically, we compare reducing computation using a bidirectional Grid-LSTM (biGrid-LSTM) with non-overlapping frequency sub-band processing, a PyraMiD-LSTM [3] and a frequency-block Grid-LSTM (fbGrid-LSTM) for parallel time-frequency processing.

The scarce availability of multi-speaker articulatory data makes it difficult to learn a mapping which generalizes from a limited number of training speakers and reliably reconstructs the articulatory movements of unseen speakers. In this paper, we propose a Multi-task Learning (MTL)-based approach that explicitly separates the modeling of each training speaker AI peculiarities from the modeling of AI characteristics that are shared by all speakers. Our approach stems from the well known Regularized MTL approach and extends it to feed-forward deep neural networks (DNNs). Given multiple training speakers, we learn for each an acoustic-to-articulatory mapping represented by a DNN. Then, through an iterative procedure, we search for a canonical speaker-independent DNN that is \"similar\" to all speaker-dependent DNNs. The degree of similarity is controlled by a regularization parameter. We report experiments on the University of Wisconsin X-ray Microbeam Database under different training/testing experimental settings. The results obtained indicate that our MTL-trained canonical DNN largely outperforms a standardly trained (i.e., single task learning-based) speaker independent DNN",

It is expected that this variable represents a common factor which is inherent in the different domains, such as acoustic and articulatory feature spaces. mPCCA is an expansion of PCCA and it can model a much more complex structure. In mPCCA, covariance matrices of a joint probabilistic distribution of acoustic-articulatory data are structuralized reasonably by using transformation coefficients of the linear transforms. Even if the number of components in mPCCA increases, the structuralized covariance matrices can be expected to avoid over-fitting. Training and mapping processes of the mPCCA-based mapping model are reasonably derived by using the EM algorithm.

    "abstract": "Real-time magnetic resonance imaging (rtMRI) provides information about the dynamic shaping of the vocal tract during speech production. This paper introduces and evaluates a method for quantifying articulatory strategies using rtMRI. The method decomposes the formation and release of a constriction in the vocal tract into the contributions of individual articulators such as the jaw, tongue, lips, and velum. The method uses an anatomically guided factor analysis and dynamical principles from the framework of Task Dynamics. We evaluated the method within a test-retest repeatability framework. We imaged healthy volunteers (n = 8, 4 females, 4 males) in two scans on the same day and quantified inter-study agreement with the intraclass correlation coefficient and mean within-subject standard deviation. The evaluation established a limit on effect size and intra-group differences in articulatory strategy which can be studied using the method",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates replacing i-vectors for text-independent speaker verification with embeddings extracted from a feed-forward deep neural network. Long-term speaker characteristics are captured in the network by a temporal pooling layer that aggregates over the input speech. This enables the network to be trained to discriminate between speakers from variable-length speech segments. After training, utterances are mapped directly to fixed-dimensional speaker embeddings and pairs of embeddings are scored using a PLDA-based backend. We compare performance with a traditional i-vector baseline on NIST SRE 2010 and 2016. We find that the embeddings outperform i-vectors for short speech segments and are competitive on long duration test conditions. Moreover, the two representations are complementary, and their fusion improves on the baseline at all operating points. Similar systems have recently shown promising results when trained on very large proprietary datasets, but to the best of our knowledge, these are the best results reported for speaker-discriminative neural networks when trained and tested on publicly available corpora",

    "abstract": "Probabilistic linear discriminant analysis (PLDA) is the de facto standard for backends in i-vector speaker recognition. If we try to extend the PLDA paradigm using non-linear models, e.g., deep neural networks, the posterior distributions of the latent variables and the marginal likelihood become intractable. In this paper, we propose to approach this problem using stochastic gradient variational Bayes. We generalize the PLDA model to let i-vectors depend non-linearly on the latent factors. We approximate the evidence lower bound (ELBO) by Monte Carlo sampling using the reparametrization trick. This enables us to optimize of the ELBO using backpropagation to jointly estimate the parameters that define the model and the approximate posteriors of the latent factors. We also present a reformulation of the likelihood ratio, which we call Q-scoring. Q-scoring makes possible to efficiently score the speaker verification trials for this model. Experimental results on NIST SRE10 suggest that more data might be required to exploit the potential of this method",

In this paper, we explore the problem of performance degradation under such a situation of insufficient channel information. In order to exploit limited in-domain dataset effectively, we propose an unsupervised domain adaptation approach using Autoencoder based Domain Adaptation (AEDA). The proposed approach combines an autoencoder with a denoising autoencoder to adapt resource-rich development dataset to test domain.

In this paper, we observe the use of creaky voice in spontaneous Estonian in connection to syllabic properties of words, lexical stress, word class, lengthening, and timing in phrases The results indicate that creak occurs less in syllables with primary stress than in unstressed syllables. However, syllables with secondary stress are most frequently creaky. In content words, the primary stressed syllables creak less frequently and unstressed syllables more frequently compared to function words. The stress-related pattern is similar in both function and content words, but more contrastive in content words.

A set of utterances with varied narrow focus placement as well as broad focus and deaccented renditions were produced by six speakers of English.

Z-normalized F0, EE, OQ and RD parameters (selected through correlation and factor analysis) were used to generate speaker specific baseline voice profiles and to explore cross-speaker variation in focal and non-focal (post- and prefocal) syllables. As expected, source parameter values were found to differ in the focal and postfocal portions of the utterance. For four of the six speakers the measures revealed a trend of tenser phonation on the focal syllable (an increase in EE and F0 and typically, a decrease in OQ and RD) as well as increased laxness in the postfocal part of the utterance. For two of the speakers, however, the measurements showed a different trend. These speakers had very high F0 and often high EE on the focal accent. In these cases, RD and OQ values tended to be raised rather than lowered. The possible reasons for these differences are discussed",

Generally, glottal stops have more strong glottal and ventricular constriction at the coda position than at the onset. However, the primary source characteristics of glottal stops are irregular glottal cycles, abrupt glottal closing, and reduced open cycle. These changes will not only affect the vocal quality parameters but may also significantly affect the vocal tract characteristics due to changes in the subglottal coupling behavior. This motivates to analyze the dynamic vocal tract characteristics in terms of source behavior, apart from the excitation source features computed from the Linear Prediction (LP) residual for the acoustic characterization of the word-final glottal stops. The dominant resonance frequency (DRF) of the vocal tract using Hilbert Envelope of Numerator Group Delay (HNGD) are extracted at every sample instants as a cue to study this deviation. The gradual increase in the DRF and significantly lower duration for which subglottal coupling is occurring is observed for the glottal stop region for both the languages",

    "abstract": "Iterative adaptive inverse filtering (IAIF) [1] remains among the state-of-the-art algorithms for estimating glottal flow from the recorded speech signal. Here, we re-examine IAIF in light of its foundational, classical model of voiced (non-nasalized) speech, wherein the overall spectral tilt is caused only by lip-radiation and glottal effects, while the vocal-tract transfer function contains formant peaks but is otherwise not tilted. In contrast, IAIF initially models and cancels the formants after only a first-order preemphasis of the speech signal, which is generally not enough to completely remove spectral tilt Iterative optimal preemphasis (IOP) is therefore proposed to replace IAIF's initial step. IOP is a rapidly converging algorithm that models a signal (then inverse-filters it) with one real pole (zero) at a time, until spectral tilt is flattened. IOP-IAIF is evaluated on sustained /a/ in a range of voice qualities from weak-breathy to shouted-tense. Compared with standard IAIF, IOP-IAIF yields: (i) an acceptable glottal flow even for a weak breathy voice that the standard algorithm failed to handle; (ii) generally smoother glottal flows that nevertheless retain pulse shape and closed phase; and (iii) enhanced separation of voice qualities in both normalized amplitude quotient (NAQ) and glottal harmonic spectra",

The input for both algorithms is a speech signal of an arbitrary length containing a single obstruent, and the output is a pair of times which constitutes the pre-aspiration boundaries. We train both models on a set of manually annotated examples. Results suggest that the structured model is superior to the frame-based model as it yields higher accuracy in predicting the boundaries and generalizes to new speakers and new languages.

To address this issue, we have previously proposed EL speech enhancement systems using statistical F pattern prediction methods based on a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), making it possible to predict the underlying F pattern of EL speech from its spectral feature sequence. Our previous work revealed that the naturalness of the predicted F pattern can be improved by incorporating a physically based generative model of F patterns into the GMM-based statistical F prediction system within a Product-of-Expert framework. However, one drawback of this method is that it requires an iterative procedure to obtain a predicted F pattern, making it difficult to realize a real-time system. In this paper, we propose yet another approach to physically based statistical F pattern prediction by using a HMM-GMM framework. This approach is noteworthy in that it allows to generate an F pattern that is both statistically likely and physically natural without iterative procedures.

A prosodic feature extractor called the statistical phrase/accent command estimation (SPACE) has recently been proposed. This extractor is based on a statistical model formulated as a stochastic counterpart of the Fujisaki model, a well-founded mathematical model representing the control mechanism of vocal fold vibration. The key idea of this approach is that a phrase/accent command pair sequence is modeled as an output sequence of a path-restricted hidden Markov model (HMM) so that estimating the state transition amounts to estimating the phrase/accent commands. Since the phrase and accent commands are related to linguistic information, we may expect to improve the command estimation accuracy by using them as auxiliary information for the inference. To model the relationship between the phrase/accent commands and linguistic information, we construct a deep neural network (DNN) that maps the linguistic feature vectors to the state posterior probabilities of the HMM. Thus, given a pitch contour and linguistic information, we can estimate phrase/accent commands via state decoding. We call this method \"DNN-SPACE.\" Experimental results revealed that using linguistic information was effective in improving the command estimation accuracy",

Despite its elusiveness, it allows valuable extra time for computing or information highlighting in incremental spoken dialogue systems. The elusiveness of the matter, however, poses a challenge for extracting lengthening instances from corpus data: we suspect a recall problem, as human annotators might not be able to consistently label lengthening instances. We address this issue by filtering corpus data for instances of lengthening, using a simple classification method, based on a threshold for normalized phone duration. The output is then manually labeled for disfluency. This is compared to an existing, fully manual disfluency annotation, showing that recall is significantly higher with semi-automatic pre-classification. This shows that it is inevitable to use semi-automatic pre-selection to gather enough candidate data points for manual annotation and subsequent lengthening analyses. Also, it is desirable to further increase the performance of the automatic classification. We evaluate in detail human versus semi-automatic annotation and train another classifier on the resulting dataset to check the integrity of the disfluent – non-disfluent distinction",

    "title": "Progressive Neural Networks for Transfer Learning in Emotion Recognition",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Many paralinguistic tasks are closely related and thus representations learned in one domain can be leveraged for another. In this paper, we investigate how knowledge can be transferred between three paralinguistic tasks: speaker, emotion, and gender recognition. Further, we extend this problem to cross-dataset tasks, asking how knowledge captured in one emotion dataset can be transferred to another. We focus on progressive neural networks and compare these networks to the conventional deep learning method of pre-training and fine-tuning. Progressive neural networks provide a way to transfer knowledge and avoid the forgetting effect present when pre-training neural networks on different tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that: (1) emotion recognition can benefit from using representations originally learned for different paralinguistic tasks and (2) transfer learning can effectively leverage additional datasets to improve the performance of emotion recognition systems",

    "title": "Jointly Predicting Arousal, Valence and Dominance with Multi-Task Learning",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "An appealing representation of emotions is the use of emotional attributes such as arousal (passive versus active), valence (negative versus positive) and dominance (weak versus strong). While previous studies have considered these dimensions as orthogonal descriptors to represent emotions, there are strong theoretical and practical evidences showing the interrelation between these emotional attributes. This observation suggests that predicting emotional attributes with a unified framework should outperform machine learning algorithms that separately predict each attribute. This study presents methods to jointly learn emotional attributes by exploiting their interdependencies. The framework relies on multi-task learning (MTL) implemented with deep neural networks (DNN) with shared hidden layers. The framework provides a principled approach to learn shared feature representations that maximize the performance of regression models. The results of within-corpus and cross-corpora evaluation show the benefits of MTL over single task learning (STL). MTL achieves gains on concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) as high as 4.7% for within-corpus evaluations, and 14.0% for cross-corpora evaluations. The visualization of the activations of the last hidden layers illustrates that MTL creates better feature representation. The best structure has shared layers followed by attribute-dependent layers, capturing better the relation between attributes",

    "abstract": "Estimating continuous emotional states from speech as a function of time has traditionally been framed as a regression problem. In this paper, we present a novel approach that moves the problem into the classification domain by discretizing the training labels at different resolutions. We employ a multi-task deep bidirectional long-short term memory (BLSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) trained with cost-sensitive Cross Entropy loss to model these labels jointly. We introduce an emotion decoding algorithm that incorporates long- and short-term temporal properties of the signal to produce more robust time series estimates. We show that our proposed approach achieves competitive audio-only performance on the RECOLA dataset, relative to previously published works as well as other strong regression baselines. This work provides a link between regression and classification, and contributes an alternative approach for continuous emotion recognition",

    "abstract": "One of the challenges in Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) \"in the wild\" is the large mismatch between training and test data (e.g. speakers and tasks). In order to improve the generalisation capabilities of the emotion models, we propose to use Multi-Task Learning (MTL) and use gender and naturalness as auxiliary tasks in deep neural networks. This method was evaluated in within-corpus and various cross-corpus classification experiments that simulate conditions \"in the wild\". In comparison to Single-Task Learning (STL) based state of the art methods, we found that our MTL method proposed improved performance significantly. Particularly, models using both gender and naturalness achieved more gains than those using either gender or naturalness separately. This benefit was also found in the high-level representations of the feature space, obtained from our method proposed, where discriminative emotional clusters could be observed",
