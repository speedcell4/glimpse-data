    "title": "Certified Policy Verification and Synthesis for MDPs under Distributional Reach-Avoidance Properties",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) are a classical model for decision making in the presence of uncertainty. Often they are viewed as state transformers with planning objectives defined with respect to paths over MDP states. An increasingly popular alternative is to view them as distribution transformers, giving rise to a sequence of probability distributions over MDP states. For instance, reachability and safety properties in modeling robot swarms or chemical reaction networks are naturally defined in terms of probability distributions over states. Verifying such distributional properties is known to be hard and often beyond the reach of classical state-based verification techniques. In this work, we consider the problems of certified policy (i.e. controller) verification and synthesis in MDPs under distributional reach-avoidance specifications. By certified we mean that, along with a policy, we also aim to synthesize a (checkable) certificate ensuring that the MDP indeed satisfies the property. Thus, given the target set of distributions and an unsafe set of distributions over MDP states, our goal is to either synthesize a certificate for a given policy or synthesize a policy along with a certificate, proving that the target distribution can be reached while avoiding unsafe distributions. To solve this problem, we introduce the novel notion of distributional reach-avoid certificates and present automated procedures for (1) synthesizing a certificate for a given policy, and (2) synthesizing a policy together with the certificate, both providing formal guarantees on certificate correctness. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the ability of our method to solve several non-trivial examples, including a multi-agent robot-swarm model, to synthesize certified policies and to certify existing policies",

    "title": "Truth Table Net: Scalable, Compact & Verifiable Neural Networks with a Dual Convolutional Small Boolean Circuit Networks Form",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We introduce \"Truth Table net\"' (TTnet), a novel Deep Neural Network (DNN) architecture designed to provide excellent scalability/compactness trade-offs among DNNs, allowing in turn to tackle the DNN challenge of fast formal verification. TTnet is constructed using Learning Truth Table (LTT) filters, analogous to how a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) is built upon convolutional filters. The differentiable LTT filters are unique by their dual form: they are both a neural network-based function and a small-sized truth table that can be computed within a practical time frame. This characteristic guarantees, by design and independently of the overall architecture, the ability to practically extract an efficient (in terms of the number of logical gates) and functionally equivalent Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) Boolean logic gate implementation. This CNF circuit is even optimal when the LTT truth table's input bit size n < 12. In particular, TTnet architecture is the first differentiable DNN with as dual form a compact logic gate representation that can scale to datasets larger than CIFAR-10: we achieve an accuracy of 41% on the ImageNet dataset while ensuring that each LTT filter truth table is fully computable within 2^{16} operations. We further compare the compactness and scalability performances of TTnet Boolean logic circuit representation to state-of-the-art differentiable logic DNNs across tabular, MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets. We emphasize that TTnet is the first solution to the open problem of designing differentiable convolutional neural networks with an exact dual logic gate circuit representation, bridging the gap between symbolic AI and trainable DCNNs. Finally, as improving DNNs compactness in Boolean logic circuit form reduces the complexity of their formal verification, we demonstrate TTnet effectiveness in exact sound and complete formal verification. Notably, our model achieves robustness verification in 10ms vs 100s for traditional state-of-the-art DNNs solvers",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have enabled remarkable advances in automated task-solving with multi-agent systems. However, most existing LLM-based multi-agent approaches rely on predefined agents to handle simple tasks, limiting the adaptability of multi-agent collaboration to different scenarios. Therefore, we introduce AutoAgents, an innovative framework that adaptively generates and coordinates multiple specialized agents to build an AI team according to different tasks. Specifically, AutoAgents couples the relationship between tasks and roles by dynamically generating multiple required agents based on task content and planning solutions for the current task based on the generated expert agents. Multiple specialized agents collaborate with each other to efficiently accomplish tasks. Concurrently, an observer role is incorporated into the framework to reflect on the designated plans and agents' responses and improve upon them. Our experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that AutoAgents generates more coherent and accurate solutions than the existing multi-agent methods. This underscores the significance of assigning different roles to different tasks and of team cooperation, offering new perspectives for tackling complex tasks.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) has emerged as a widely adopted paradigm in multi-agent reinforcement learning, emphasizing the utilization of global information for learning an enhanced joint Q-function or centralized critic. In contrast, our investigation delves into harnessing global information to directly enhance individual Q-functions or individual actors. Notably, we discover that applying identical global information universally across all agents proves insufficient for optimal performance. Consequently, we advocate for the customization of global information tailored to each agent, creating agent-personalized global information to bolster overall performance. Furthermore, we introduce a novel paradigm named Personalized Training with Distilled Execution (PTDE), wherein agent-personalized global information is distilled into the agent's local information. This distilled information is then utilized during decentralized execution, resulting in minimal performance degradation. PTDE can be seamless integrated with state-of-the-art algorithms, leading to notable performance enhancements across diverse benchmarks, including the SMAC benchmark, Google Research Football (GRF) benchmark, and Learning to Rank (LTR) task",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In Emergent Communication (EC) agents learn to communicate with one another, but the protocols that they develop are specialised to their training community. This observation led to research into Zero-Shot Coordination (ZSC) for learning communication strategies that are robust to agents not encountered during training. However, ZSC typically assumes that no prior data is available about the agents that will be encountered in the zero-shot setting. In many cases, this presents an unnecessarily hard problem and rules out communication via preestablished conventions. We propose a novel AI challenge called a Cooperative Language Acquisition Problem (CLAP) in which the ZSC assumptions are relaxed by allowing a 'joiner' agent to learn from a dataset of interactions between agents in a target community. We propose and compare two methods for solving CLAPs: Behaviour Cloning (BC), and Emergent Communication pretraining and Translation Learning (ECTL), in which an agent is trained in self-play with EC and then learns to translate between an emergent protocol and the target community's protocol",

    "title": "Improving Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning with Stable Prefix Policy",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), the epsilon-greedy method plays an important role in balancing exploration and exploitation during the decision-making process in value-based algorithms. However, the epsilon-greedy exploration process will introduce conservativeness when calculating the expected state value when the agents are more in need of exploitation during the approximate policy convergence, which may result in a suboptimal policy convergence. Besides, eliminating the epsilon-greedy algorithm leaves no exploration and may lead to unacceptable local optimal policies. To address this dilemma, we use the previously collected trajectories to construct a Monte-Carlo Trajectory Tree, so that an existing optimal template, a sequence of state prototypes, can be planned out. The agents start by following the planned template and act according to the policy without exploration, Stable Prefix Policy. The agents will adaptively dropout and begin to explore by following the epsilon-greedy method when the policy still needs exploration. We scale our approach to various value-based MARL methods and empirically verify our method in a cooperative MARL task, SMAC benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves not only better performance but also faster convergence speed than baseline algorithms within early time steps",

This problem is computationally complex, especially when dealing with large numbers of agents, as is common in realistic applications like autonomous vehicle coordination. Finding an optimal solution is often computationally infeasible, making the use of approximate, suboptimal algorithms essential. Adding to the complexity, agents might act in a self-interested and strategic way, possibly misrepresenting their goals to the MAPF algorithm if it benefits them. Although the field of mechanism design offers tools to align incentives, using these tools without careful consideration can fail when only having access to approximately optimal outcomes. In this work, we introduce the problem of scalable mechanism design for MAPF and propose three strategyproof mechanisms, two of which even use approximate MAPF algorithms. We test our mechanisms on realistic MAPF domains with problem sizes ranging from dozens to hundreds of agents. We find that they improve welfare beyond a simple baseline",

    "abstract": "We introduce Energy Reactive Modules Games (ERMGs), an extension of Reactive Modules Games (RMGs) in which actions incur an energy cost (which may be positive or negative), and the choices that players make are restricted by the energy available to them. In ERMGs, each action is associated with an energy level update, which determines how their energy level is affected by the performance of the action. In addition, agents are provided with an initial energy allowance. This allowance plays a crucial role in shaping an agent's behaviour, as it must be taken into consideration when one is determining their strategy: agents may only perform actions if they have the requisite energy. We begin by studying rational verification for ERMGs and then introduce Endogenous ERMGs, where agents can choose to transfer their energy to other agents. This exchange may enable equilibria that are impossible to achieve without such transfers. We study the decision problem of whether a stable outcome exists under both the Nash equilibrium and Core solution concepts",

    "title": "Parameterized Complexity of Kidney Exchange Revisited",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "As of January 2023, there are more than 90,000 people on the national transplant waiting list in need of a kidney in the United States. These patients often have a friend or family member who is willing to donate, but whose kidney type might not be compatible. To help match these patients to suitable donors, patient-donor compatibility can be modeled as a directed graph. Specifically, in the Kidney Exchange problem, the input is a directed graph G, a subset B of vertices (altruistic donors), and two integers l_p and l_c. An altruistic donor is a donor who is not paired with a patient, and the remaining vertices are patient-donor pairs. Whenever a donor is compatible with a patient from a patient-donor pair, we place a directed edge from the donor vertex to the patient-donor pair. Here the donor vertex can be either altruistic or non-altruistic. The goal is to find a collection of vertex-disjoint cycles and paths covering the maximum number of patients such that each cycle has length at most l_c, and such that each path has length at most l_p and begins at a vertex in B. The path and cycle lengths are bounded so that the surgeries for a given path or cycle can be performed simultaneously. Kidney Exchange has received a great deal of attention in recent years. We contribute to this line of work by closing two open problems from IJCAI '18 and IJCAI '22: \"Is Kidney Exchange FPT when parameterized by (i) the treewidth (omega) of G and (ii) the number of vertex types in G?'' Two vertices have the same vertex type if they have the same in- and out-neighborhoods. We show that Kidney Exchange is FPT parameterized by the number of vertex types. On the other hand, we show W[1]-hardness with respect to omega. We also design a randomized 4^t * n^O(1)-time algorithm parameterized by t, the number of patients helped, significantly improving upon the previous state of the art, which was 161^t * n^O(1)",

In this context, we propose competitive evolution (CompetEvo), which co-evolves agents' designs and tactics in confrontation. We build arenas consisting of three animals and their evolved derivatives, placing agents with different morphologies in direct competition with each other. The results reveal that our method enables agents to evolve a more suitable design and strategy for fighting compared to fixed-morph agents, allowing them to obtain advantages in combat scenarios.

    "abstract": "If given the choice, what strategy should agents use to switch partners in strategic social interactions? While many analyses have been performed on specific switching heuristics, showing how and when these lead to more cooperation, no insights have been provided into which rule will actually be learnt by agents when given the freedom to do so. Starting from a baseline model that has demonstrated the potential of rewiring for cooperation, we provide answers to this question over the full spectrum of social dilemmas. Multi-agent Q-learning with Boltzmann exploration is used to learn when to sever or maintain an association. In both the Prisoner's Dilemma and the Stag Hunt games we observe that the Out-for-Tat rewiring rule, breaking ties with other agents choosing socially undesirable actions, becomes dominant, confirming at the same time that cooperation flourishes when rewiring is fast enough relative to imitation. Nonetheless, in the transitory region before full cooperation, a Stay strategy, keeping a connection at all costs, remains present, which shows that loyalty needs to be overcome for full cooperation to emerge. In conclusion, individuals learn cooperation-promoting rewiring rules but need to overcome a kind of loyalty to achieve full cooperation in the full spectrum of social dilemmas",

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on the problem of learning compressed state representations for multi-agent tasks. Under the assumption of rich observation, we pinpoint that the state representations should be compressed both spatially and temporally to enable efficient prioritization of task-relevant features, while existing works typically fail. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel method named Spatio-Temporal stAte compRession (STAR) that explicitly defines both spatial and temporal compression operations on the learned state representations to encode per-agent task-relevant features. Specifically, we first formalize this problem by introducing Task Informed Partially Observable Stochastic Game (TI-POSG). Then, we identify the spatial representation compression in it as encoding the latent states from the joint observations of all agents, and achieve this by learning representations that approximate the latent states based on the information theoretical principle. After that, we further extract the task-relevant features of each agent from these representations by aligning them based on their reward similarities, which is regarded as the temporal representation compression. Structurally, we implement these two compression by learning a set of agent-specific decoding functions and incorporate them into a critic shared by agents for scalable learning. We evaluate our method by developing decentralized policies on 12 maps of the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge benchmark, and the superior performance demonstrates its effectiveness",

In this work, we make the first attempt to investigate the possibility of self-adaptively determining the optimal hyperparameter values in the PSRO framework. Our contributions are three-fold: (1) Using several hyperparameters, we propose a parametric PSRO that unifies the gradient descent ascent (GDA) and different PSRO variants. (2) We propose the self-adaptive PSRO (SPSRO) by casting the hyperparameter value selection of the parametric PSRO as a hyperparameter optimization (HPO) problem where our objective is to learn an HPO policy that can self-adaptively determine the optimal hyperparameter values during the running of the parametric PSRO. (3) To overcome the poor performance of online HPO methods, we propose a novel offline HPO approach to optimize the HPO policy based on the Transformer architecture.

Each empirical game captures both self-play and cross-play factors across seeds. These empirical games provide the basis for constructing a sampling distribution, using bootstrapping, over a variety of game analysis statistics. We use this approach to evaluate state-of-the-art deep MARL algorithms on a class of negotiation games. From statistics on individual payoffs, social welfare, and empirical best-response graphs, we uncover strategic relationships among self-play, population-based, model-free, and model-based MARL methods. We also investigate the effect of run-time search as a meta-strategy operator, and find via meta-game analysis that the search version of a meta-strategy generally leads to improved performance",

    "title": "Fraud Risk Mitigation in Real-Time Payments: A Strategic Agent-Based Analysis",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Whereas standard financial mechanisms for payment may take days to finalize, real-time payments (RTPs) provide immediate processing and final receipt of funds. The speed of settlement benefits customers, but raises vulnerability to fraud. We seek to understand how bank nodes may strategically mitigate fraud risk in RTPs, through investment in fraud detection and restricting payments eligible for real-time processing. To study this, we introduce an agent-based model of the payment network supporting both real-time and standard payments, and define a game among banks and fraudsters. Using empirical game-theoretic analysis, we identify Nash equilibria in nine game configurations defined by network attributes. Our analysis finds that as banks become more liable for fraud, they continue to allow RTPs but are more likely to employ both restrictions and a high level of fraud detection. Fraudsters, in response, switch from targeting only RTPs to attempting fraud with any type of payment and tend to exploit banks where they have historically been most successful. We also conduct a strategic feature gains assessment to further understand the benefit offered by each of the bank's risk mitigation measures, which confirms the importance of selective RTP restrictions. Finally, we find that in equilibrium bank strategic decisions negatively affect fraudsters while minimally impacting customers",

    "title": "Diversifying Training Pool Predictability for Zero-shot Coordination: A Theory of Mind Approach",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The challenge in constructing artificial social agents is to enable adaptation ability to novel agents, and is called zero-shot coordination (ZSC). A promising approach is to train the adaptive agents by interacting with a diverse pool of collaborators, assuming that the greater the diversity in other agents seen during training, the better the generalisation. In this paper, we explore an alternative procedure by considering the behavioural predictability of collaborators, i.e. whether their actions and intentions are predictable, and use it to select a diverse set of agents for the training pool. More specifically, we develop a pool of agents through self-play training during which agents' behaviour evolves and has diversity in levels of behavioural predictability (LoBP) through its evolution. We construct an observer to compute the level of behavioural predictability for each version of the collaborators. To do so, the observer is equipped with the theory of mind (ToM) capability to learn to infer the actions and intentions of others. We then use an episodic memory based on the LoBP metric to maintain agents with different levels of behavioural predictability in the pool of agents. Since behaviours that emerge at the later training phase are more complex and meaningful, the memory is updated with the latest versions of training agents. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that LoBP-based diversity training leads to better ZSC than other diversity training methods",

    "title": "Individual Fairness under Group Fairness Constraints in Bipartite Matching - One Framework to Approximate Them All",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We study the probabilistic assignment of items to platforms that satisfies both group and individual fairness constraints. Each item belongs to specific groups and has a preference ordering over platforms. Each platform enforces group fairness by limiting the number of items per group that can be assigned to it. There could be multiple optimal solutions that satisfy the group fairness constraints, but this alone ignores item preferences. Our approach explores a `best of both worlds fairness' solution to get a randomized matching, which is ex-ante individually fair and ex-post group-fair. Thus, we seek a `probabilistic individually fair' distribution over `group-fair' matchings where each item has a `high' probability of matching to one of its top choices. This distribution is also ex-ante group-fair. Users can customize fairness constraints to suit their requirements. Our first result is a polynomial-time algorithm that computes a distribution over `group-fair' matchings such that the individual fairness constraints are approximately satisfied and the expected size of a matching is close to OPT. We empirically test this on real-world datasets. We present two additional polynomial-time bi-criteria approximation algorithms that users can choose from to balance group fairness and individual fairness trade-offs. For disjoint groups, we provide an exact polynomial-time algorithm adaptable to additional lower `group fairness' bounds. Extending our model, we encompass `maxmin group fairness,' amplifying underrepresented groups, and `mindom group fairness,' reducing the representation of dominant groups",

While Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has emerged as a compelling approach to address this challenge, existing MARL approaches tend to overlook the constrained optimization nature of this problem, failing in guaranteeing safety constraints. In this paper, we formalize the active voltage control problem as a constrained Markov game and propose a safety-constrained MARL algorithm. We expand the primal-dual optimization RL method to multi-agent settings, and augment it with a novel approach of double safety estimation to learn the policy and to update the Lagrange-multiplier. In addition, we proposed different cost functions and investigated their influences on the behavior of our constrained MARL method. We evaluate our approach in the power distribution network simulation environment with real-world scale scenarios.

    "title": "Enhancing Cooperation through Selective Interaction and Long-term Experiences in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The significance of network structures in promoting group cooperation within social dilemmas has been widely recognized. Prior studies attribute this facilitation to the assortment of strategies driven by spatial interactions. Although reinforcement learning has been employed to investigate the impact of dynamic interaction on the evolution of cooperation, there remains a lack of understanding about how agents develop neighbour selection behaviours and the formation of strategic assortment within an explicit interaction structure. To address this, our study introduces a computational framework based on multi-agent reinforcement learning in the spatial Prisoner's Dilemma game. This framework allows agents to select dilemma strategies and interacting neighbours based on their long-term experiences, differing from existing research that relies on preset social norms or external incentives. By modelling each agent using two distinct Q-networks, we disentangle the coevolutionary dynamics between cooperation and interaction. The results indicate that long-term experience enables agents to develop the ability to identify non-cooperative neighbours and exhibit a preference for interaction with cooperative ones. This emergent self-organizing behaviour leads to the clustering of agents with similar strategies, thereby increasing network reciprocity and enhancing group cooperation",

Human social systems have large and flexible strategy spaces, conflicting interests, power asymmetry, and interdependence among members, which together make it challenging for agents to learn collective action. In this paper, we explore the ability of community-based agents to learn collective action within a novel model of complex social systems. We first present this social model, called the Junior High Game (JHG). The JHG embodies key elements of human social systems that require players to act collectively. We then describe an agent, called CAB, which is based on community detection and formation algorithms. Via simulations and user studies, we evaluate the ability of CAB agents to interact in JHG societies consisting of humans and AI agents. These evaluations both identify requirements for successful collective behaviors in the JHG and identify important unsolved problems for developing AI agents capable of collective action in complex social systems",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Altruistic cooperation is costly yet socially desirable. As a result, agents struggle to learn cooperative policies through independent reinforcement learning (RL). Indirect reciprocity, where agents consider their interaction partner's reputation, has been shown to stabilise cooperation in homogeneous, idealised populations. However, more realistic settings are comprised of heterogeneous agents with different characteristics and group-based social identities. We study cooperation when agents are stratified into two such groups, and allow reputation updates and actions to depend on group information. We consider two modelling approaches: evolutionary game theory, where we comprehensively search for social norms (i.e., rules to assign reputations) leading to cooperation and fairness; and RL, where we consider how the stochastic dynamics of policy learning affects the analytically identified equilibria. We observe that a defecting majority leads the minority group to defect, but not the inverse. Moreover, changing the norms that judge inand out-group interactions can steer a system towards either fair or unfair cooperation. This is made clearer when moving beyond equilibrium analysis to independent RL agents, where convergence to fair cooperation occurs with a narrower set of norms. Our results highlight that, in heterogeneous populations with reputations, carefully defining interaction norms is fundamental to tackle both dilemmas of cooperation and of fairness",

In such games, there are two important failure modes: problems of control (where an agent fails to act in line their principal's preferences) and problems of cooperation (where the agents fail to work well together). In this paper we formalise and analyse these problems, further breaking them down into issues of alignment (do the players have similar preferences?) and capabilities (how competent are the players at satisfying those preferences?).

Two of these techniques are based on dynamic programming, where we show a powerful connection between the coalitions selected for evaluation and the performance of the algorithms. These algorithms use offline phases to optimize the choice of coalitions to evaluate. The third one uses branch-and-bound and integer partition graph search to explore the solution space. Our techniques bring a new way of approaching the problem and a new level of precision to the field.

    "abstract": "With the expansion of the scale of robotics applications, the multi-goal multi-agent pathfinding (MG-MAPF) problem began to gain widespread attention. This problem requires each agent to visit pre-assigned multiple goal points at least once without conflict. Some previous methods have been proposed to solve the MG-MAPF problem based on Decoupling the goal Vertex visiting order search and the Single-agent pathfinding (DVS). However, this paper demonstrates that the methods based on DVS cannot always obtain the optimal solution. To obtain the optimal result, we propose the Multi-Goal Conflict-Based Search (MGCBS), which is based on Decoupling the goal Safe interval visiting order search and the Single-agent pathfinding (DSS). Additionally, we present the Time-Interval-Space Forest (TIS Forest) to enhance the efficiency of MGCBS by maintaining the shortest paths from any start point at any start time step to each safe interval at the goal points. The experiment demonstrates that our method can consistently obtain optimal results and execute up to 7 times faster than the state-of-the-art method in our evaluation",

To address the issue, we model the problem as an online matching within a bipartite graph and tackle two minimax problems: one focuses on minimizing the highest waiting time of a task, while the other aims to minimize the highest workload of a service provider. We show that the second problem can be expressed as a linear program and thus solved efficiently while maintaining a reasonable approximation to the objective of the first problem.

    "abstract": "Nash Equilibrium (NE) is the canonical solution concept of game theory, which provides an elegant tool to understand the rationalities. Though mixed strategy NE exists in any game with finite players and actions, computing NE in two- or multi-player general-sum games is PPAD-Complete. Various alternative solutions, e.g., Correlated Equilibrium (CE), and learning methods, e.g., fictitious play (FP), are proposed to approximate NE. For convenience, we call these methods as ``inexact solvers'', or ``solvers'' for short. However, the alternative solutions differ from NE and the learning methods generally fail to converge to NE. Therefore, in this work, we propose REinforcement Nash Equilibrium Solver (RENES), which trains a single policy to modify the games with different sizes and applies the solvers on the modified games where the obtained solution is evaluated on the original games. Specifically, our contributions are threefold. i) We represent the games as alpha-rank response graphs and leverage graph neural network (GNN) to handle the games with different sizes as inputs; ii) We use tensor decomposition, e.g., canonical polyadic (CP), to make the dimension of modifying actions fixed for games with different sizes; iii) We train the modifying strategy for games with the widely-used proximal policy optimization (PPO) and apply the solvers to solve the modified games, where the obtained solution is evaluated on original games. Extensive experiments on large-scale normal-form games show that our method can further improve the approximation of NE of different solvers, i.e., alpha-rank, CE, FP and PRD, and can be generalized to unseen games",

Although population-based learning shows its potential in producing diverse behaviors, most previous works still focus on improving the exploration of a single joint policy. In this paper, we show that with a suitable exploration method, maintaining a population of joint policies rather than one joint policy can significantly improve exploration. Our key idea is to guide each member of the population to explore different regions of the environment. To this end, we propose a member-aware exploration objective which explicitly guides each member to maximize deviation from the explored regions of other members, thus forcing them to explore different regions. In addition, we further propose an exploration-enhanced policy constraint to guide each member to learn a joint policy that is both different from other members and promotes exploration, thus increasing the probability of exploring different regions. Under reward-free setting, our method achieves 72% average improvement in the number of explored states compared to classical exploration methods in the multiple-particle environment. Moreover, under sparse-reward setting, we show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in the multiple-particle environment, the Google Research Football, and StarCraft II micromanagement tasks",

Temporally extended goals may be specified at run-time (top-level goals), and as subgoals in plans.

To better balance parameter sharing and agents diversity, we propose a novel Agent-Driven Modular Network (ADMN), where agents share a base network consisting of multiple specialized modules, and each agent has its own routing to connect these modules. In ADMN, modules are shared among agents to improve the training efficiency, while the combination of different modules brings rich diversity. The agent routing at different time steps is learned end-to-end to achieve a dynamic and adaptive balance. Specifically, we also propose an information-theoretical regularization between the routing of agents and their behavior to further guarantee the identifiability of different routing.

In this work, we introduce the guidance graph as a versatile representation of guidance for lifelong MAPF, framing Guidance Graph Optimization as the task of optimizing its edge weights. We present two GGO algorithms to automatically generate guidance for arbitrary lifelong MAPF algorithms and maps.

    "title": "Towards a Pretrained Model for Restless Bandits via Multi-arm Generalization",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Restless multi-arm bandits (RMABs) is a class of resource allocation problems with broad application in areas such as healthcare, online advertising, and anti-poaching. We explore several important question such as how to handle arms opting-in and opting-out over time without frequent retraining from scratch, how to deal with continuous state settings with nonlinear reward functions, which appear naturally in practical contexts. We address these questions by developing a pre-trained model (PreFeRMAB) based on a novel combination of three key ideas: (i) to enable fast generalization, we use train agents to learn from each other's experience; (ii) to accommodate streaming RMABs, we derive a new update rule for a crucial $\\lambda$-network; (iii) to handle more complex continuous state settings, we design the algorithm to automatically define an abstract state based on raw observation and reward data. PreFeRMAB allows general zero-shot ability on previously unseen RMABs, and can be fine-tuned on specific instances in a more sample-efficient way than retraining from scratch. We theoretically prove the benefits of multi-arm generalization and empirically demonstrate the advantages of our approach on several challenging, real-world inspired problems",

    "title": "Pluggable Watermarking of Deepfake Models for Deepfake Detection",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Deepfake model misuse poses major security concerns. Existing passive and active Deepfake detection methods both suffer from a lack of generalizability and robustness. In this study, we propose a pluggable and efficient active model watermarking framework for Deepfake detection. This approach facilitates the embedding of identification watermarks across a variety of Deepfake generation models, enabling easy extraction by authorities for detection purposes. Specifically, our method leverages the universal convolutional structure in generative model decoders. It employs convolutional kernel sparsification for adaptive watermark embedding positioning and introduces convolutional kernel normalization to seamlessly integrate watermark parameters with those of the generative model. For watermark extraction, we jointly train a watermark extractor based on a Deepfake detection model and use BCH encoding to identify watermark images effectively. Finally, we apply our approach to eight major types of Deepfake generation models. Experiments show our method successfully detects Deepfakes with an average accuracy exceeding 94% even in heavy lossy channels. This approach operates independently of the generation model's training without affecting the original model's performance. Furthermore, our model requires training a very limited number of parameters, and it is resilient against three major adaptive attacks.

    "title": "Discriminative Feature Decoupling Enhancement for Speech Forgery Detection",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The emergence of AIGC has brought attention to the issue of generating realistic deceptive content. While AIGC has the potential to revolutionize content creation, it also facilitates criminal activities. Specifically, the manipulation of speech has been exploited in tele-fraud and financial fraud schemes, posing a significant threat to societal security. Current deep learning-based methods for detecting forged speech extract mixed features from the original speech, which often contain redundant information. Moreover, these methods fail to consider the distinct characteristics of human voice-specific features and the diversity of background environmental sounds. This paper introduces a framework called Discriminative fEature dEcoupling enhanceMent (DEEM) for detecting speech forgery. Initially, the framework decouples the original speech into human voice features and background sound features. Subsequently, DEEM enhances voice-specific features through temporal dimension aggregation and improves continuity-related features in the background sound map via spectral-dimension aggregation. By employing the decoupling enhancement features, extensive experiments demonstrate that DEEM achieves an accuracy improvement of over 5% on FoR dataset compared to the state-of-the-art methods",

    "title": "BadFusion: 2D-Oriented Backdoor Attacks against 3D Object Detection",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "3D object detection plays an important role in autonomous driving; however, its vulnerability to backdoor attacks has become evident. By injecting \"triggers\" to poison the training dataset, backdoor attacks manipulate the detector's prediction for inputs containing these triggers. Existing backdoor attacks against 3D object detection primarily poison 3D LiDAR signals, where large-sized 3D triggers are injected to ensure their visibility within the sparse 3D space, rendering them easy to detect and impractical in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we delve into the robustness of 3D object detection, exploring a new backdoor attack surface through 2D cameras. Given the prevalent adoption of camera and LiDAR signal fusion for high-fidelity 3D perception, we investigate the latent potential of camera signals to disrupt the process. Although the dense nature of camera signals enables the use of nearly imperceptible small-sized triggers to mislead 2D object detection, realizing 2D-oriented backdoor attacks against 3D object detection is non-trivial. The primary challenge emerges from the fusion process that transforms camera signals into a 3D space, compromising the association with the 2D trigger to the target output. To tackle this issue, we propose an innovative 2D-oriented backdoor attack against LiDAR-camera fusion methods for 3D object detection, named BadFusion, for preserving trigger effectiveness throughout the entire fusion process. The evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of BadFusion, achieving a significantly higher attack success rate compared to existing 2D-oriented attacks",

    "abstract": "Machine unlearning aims to enable models to forget specific data instances when receiving deletion requests. Current research centers on efficient unlearning to erase the influence of data from the model and neglects the subsequent impacts on the remaining data. Consequently, existing unlearning algorithms degrade the model's performance after unlearning, known as over-unlearning. This paper addresses this critical yet under-explored issue by introducing machine Unlearning via Null Space Calibration (UNSC), which can accurately unlearn target samples without over-unlearning. On the contrary, by calibrating the decision space during unlearning, UNSC can significantly improve the model's performance on the remaining samples. In particular, our approach hinges on confining the unlearning process to a specified null space tailored to the remaining samples, which is augmented by strategically pseudo-labeling the unlearning samples. Comparison against several established baselines affirms the superiority of our approach",

    "abstract": "The demand for open and trustworthy AI models points towards widespread publishing of model weights. Consumers of these model weights must be able to act accordingly with the information provided. That said, one of the simplest AI classification models, Logistic Regression (LR), has an unwieldy interpretation of its model weights, with greater difficulties when extending LR to generalised additive models. In this work, we show via a User Study that skilled participants are unable to reliably reproduce the action of small LR models given the trained parameters. As an antidote to this, we define Linearised Additive Models (LAMs), an optimal piecewise linear approximation that augments any trained additive model equipped with a sigmoid link function, requiring no retraining. We argue that LAMs are more interpretable than logistic models -- survey participants are shown to solve model reasoning tasks with LAMs much more accurately than with LR given the same information. Furthermore, we show that LAMs do not suffer from large performance penalties in terms of ROC-AUC and calibration with respect to their logistic counterparts on a broad suite of public financial modelling data",

First, a collection of experimental participants (the selectors) were asked to recommend an algorithm for making employment decisions. Second, a different collection of participants (the workers) were told about the setup, and a subset were ostensibly selected by the algorithm to perform an image labeling task. For both selector and worker participants, algorithmic choices differed principally in the inclusion of features that were non-volitional, and either directly relevant to the task, or for which relevance is not evident except for these features resulting in higher accuracy. We find that the selectors had a clear predilection for the more accurate algorithms, which they also judged as more fair. Worker sentiments were considerably more nuanced. Workers who were hired were largely indifferent among the algorithms. In contrast, workers who were not hired exhibited considerably more positive sentiments for algorithms that included non-volitional but relevant features. However, workers with disadvantaged values of non-volitional features exhibited more negative sentiment towards their use than the average, although the extent of this appears to depend considerably on the nature of such features",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs), characterized by being trained on broad amounts of data in a self-supervised manner, have shown impressive performance across a wide range of tasks. Indeed, their generative abilities have aroused interest on the application of LLMs across a wide range of contexts. However, neural networks in general, and LLMs in particular, are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where an imperceptible change to the input can mislead the output of the model. This is a serious concern that impedes the use of LLMs on high-stakes applications, such as healthcare, where a wrong prediction can imply serious consequences. Even though there are many efforts on making LLMs more robust to adversarial attacks, there are almost no works that study how and where these vulnerabilities that make LLMs prone to adversarial attacks happen. Motivated by these facts, we explore how to localize and understand vulnerabilities, and propose a method, based on Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) techniques, to guide this process. Specifically, this method enables us to detect vulnerabilities related to a concrete task by (i) obtaining the subset of the model that is responsible for that task, (ii) generating adversarial samples for that task, and (iii) using MI techniques together with the previous samples to discover and understand the possible vulnerabilities. We showcase our method on a pretrained GPT-2 Small model carrying out the task of predicting 3-letter acronyms to demonstrate its effectiveness on locating and understanding concrete vulnerabilities of the model",

This requires implementing fairness constraints into the sequential decision-making processes of these platforms to ensure equal treatment. However, this can be challenging as these processes often need to solve NP-complete problems with exponentially large decision spaces at each time step. To overcome this, we propose a general framework incorporating robustness and fairness into NP-complete problems, such as optimizing product ranking and maximizing sub-modular functions. Our framework casts the problem as a max-min game between a primal player aiming to maximize the platform's objective and a dual player in charge of group fairness constraints. We show that one can trace the entire Pareto fairness curve by changing the thresholds on the fairness constraints. We provide theoretical guarantees for our method and empirically evaluate it, demonstrating its effectiveness",

While various datasets for synthetic speech analysis have been developed, they often focus on specific areas, limiting their utility for comprehensive research.

Moreover, we propose a TEmporal Speech LocalizaTion network, called TEST, aiming at simultaneously performing authenticity detection, multiple fake segments localization, and synthesis algorithms recognition, without any complex post-processing. TEST effectively integrates LSTM and Transformer to extract more powerful temporal speech representations and utilizes dense prediction on multi-scale pyramid features to estimate the synthetic spans. Our model achieves an average mAP of 83.55% and an EER of 5.25% at the utterance level. At the segment level, it attains an EER of 1.07% and a 92.19% F1 score.

    "title": "SwiftThief: Enhancing Query Efficiency of Model Stealing by Contrastive Learning",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Model-stealing attacks are emerging as a severe threat to AI-based services because an adversary can create models that duplicate the functionality of the black-box AI models inside the services with regular query-based access. To avoid detection or query costs, the model-stealing adversary must consider minimizing the number of queries to obtain an accurate clone model. To achieve this goal, we propose SwiftThief, a novel model-stealing framework that utilizes both queried and unqueried data to reduce query complexity. In particular, SwiftThief uses contrastive learning, a recent technique for representation learning. We formulate a new objective function for model stealing consisting of self-supervised (for abundant unqueried inputs from public datasets) and soft-supervised (for queried inputs) contrastive losses, jointly optimized with an output matching loss (for queried inputs). In addition, we suggest a new sampling strategy to prioritize rarely queried classes to improve attack performance. Our experiments proved that SwiftThief could significantly enhance the efficiency of model-stealing attacks compared to the existing methods, achieving similar attack performance using only half of the query budgets of the competing approaches. Also, SwiftThief showed high competence even when a defense was activated for the victims",

It has become increasingly popular due to its distinct privacy advantages. However, FL models can suffer from biases against certain demographic groups (e.g., racial and gender groups) due to the heterogeneity of data and party selection. Researchers have proposed various strategies for characterizing the group fairness of FL algorithms to address this issue. However, the effectiveness of these strategies in the face of deliberate adversarial attacks has not been fully explored. Although existing studies have revealed various threats (e.g., model poisoning attacks) against FL systems caused by malicious participants, their primary aim is to decrease model accuracy, while the potential of leveraging poisonous model updates to exacerbate model unfairness remains unexplored. In this paper, we propose a new type of model poisoning attack, EAB-FL, with a focus on exacerbating group unfairness while maintaining a good level of model utility. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our attack, even with state-of-the-art fairness optimization algorithms and secure aggregation rules employed.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility of alterfactual explanations for black box image classifiers. Traditional explanation mechanisms from the field of Counterfactual Thinking are a widely-used paradigm for Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), as they follow a natural way of reasoning that humans are familiar with. However, most common approaches from this field are based on communicating information about features or characteristics that are especially important for an AI's decision. However, to fully understand a decision, not only knowledge about relevant features is needed, but the awareness of irrelevant information also highly contributes to the creation of a user's mental model of an AI system. To this end, a novel approach for explaining AI systems called alterfactual explanations was recently proposed on a conceptual level. It is based on showing an alternative reality where irrelevant features of an AI's input are altered. By doing so, the user directly sees which input data characteristics can change arbitrarily without influencing the AI's decision. In this paper, we show for the first time that it is possible to apply this idea to black box models based on neural networks. To this end, we present a GAN-based approach to generate these alterfactual explanations for binary image classifiers. Further, we present a user study that gives interesting insights on how alterfactual explanations can complement counterfactual explanations",

However, to the best of our knowledge, a philosophically justified formal theory for this process does not yet exist. This paper begins the development of such a theory, focusing on learning from testimony. We make four main contributions. First, we provide a set of axioms that any such theory must satisfy. Second, we provide justification for belief functions, as opposed to traditional probability theory, for modeling norm learning. Third, we construct a novel learning function that satisfies these axioms. Fourth, we provide a complexity analysis of this formalism and proof that deontic rules are sound under its semantics.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In the rapidly evolving landscape of eCommerce, Artificial Intelligence (AI) based pricing algorithms, particularly those utilizing Reinforcement Learning (RL), are becoming increasingly prevalent. This rise has led to an inextricable pricing situation with the potential for market collusion. Our research employs an experimental oligopoly model of repeated price competition, systematically varying the environment to cover scenarios from basic economic theory to subjective consumer demand preferences. We also introduce a novel demand framework that enables the implementation of various demand models, allowing for a weighted blending of different models. In contrast to existing research in this domain, we aim to investigate the strategies and emerging pricing patterns developed by the agents, which may lead to a collusive outcome. Furthermore, we investigate a scenario where agents cannot observe their competitors' prices. Finally, we provide a comprehensive legal analysis across all scenarios. Our findings indicate that RL-based AI agents converge to a collusive state characterized by the charging of supracompetitive prices, without necessarily requiring inter-agent communication. Implementing alternative RL algorithms, altering the number of agents or simulation settings, and restricting the scope of the agents' observation space does not significantly impact the collusive market outcome behavior",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "With the rapidly increasing application of large language models (LLMs), their abuse has caused many undesirable societal problems such as fake news, academic dishonesty, and information pollution. This makes AI-generated text (AIGT) detection of great importance. Among existing methods, white-box methods are generally superior to black-box methods in terms of performance and generalizability, but they require access to LLMs' internal states and are not applicable to black-box settings. In this paper, we propose to estimate word generation probabilities as pseudo white-box features via multiple re-sampling to help improve AIGT detection under the black-box setting. Specifically, we design POGER, a proxy-guided efficient re-sampling method, which selects a small subset of representative words (e.g., 10 words) for performing multiple re-sampling in black-box AIGT detection. Experiments on datasets containing texts from humans and seven LLMs show that POGER outperforms all baselines in macro F1 under black-box, partial white-box, and out-of-distribution settings and maintains lower re-sampling costs than its existing counterparts",

    "abstract": "With the wide proliferation of Deep Neural Networks in high-stake applications, there is a growing demand for explainability behind their decision-making process. Concept learning models attempt to learn high-level 'concepts' - abstract entities that align with human understanding, and thus provide interpretability to DNN architectures. However, in this paper, we demonstrate that present SOTA concept learning approaches suffer from two major problems - lack of concept fidelity wherein the models fail to learn consistent concepts among similar classes and limited concept interoperability wherein the models fail to generalize learned concepts to new domains for the same task. Keeping these in mind, we propose a novel self-explaining architecture for concept learning across domains which - i) incorporates a new concept saliency network for representative concept selection, ii) utilizes contrastive learning to capture representative domain invariant concepts, and iii) uses a novel prototype-based concept grounding regularization to improve concept alignment across domains. We demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach over current SOTA concept learning approaches on four widely used real-world datasets. Empirical results show that our method improves both concept fidelity measured through concept overlap and concept interoperability measured through domain adaptation performance.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "While in-processing fairness approaches show promise in mitigating bias predictions, their potential impact on privacy leakage remains under-explored. We aim to address this gap by assessing the privacy risks of fairness-enhanced binary classifiers with membership inference attacks (MIAs). Surprisingly, our results reveal that these fairness interventions exhibit increased resilience against existing attacks, indicating that enhancing fairness does not necessarily lead to privacy compromises. However, we find current attack methods are ineffective as they typically degrade into simple threshold models with limited attack effectiveness. Following this observation, we discover a novel threat dubbed Fairness Discrepancy Membership Inference Attacks (FD-MIA) that exploits prediction discrepancies between fair and biased models. This attack reveals more potent vulnerabilities and poses significant privacy risks to model privacy. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets, attack methods, and representative fairness approaches confirm our findings and demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed attack method. Our study exposes the overlooked privacy threats in fairness studies, advocating for thorough evaluations of potential security vulnerabilities before model deployments",

The reported analysis sheds light on the factors causing such contrasting behavior, suggesting that distance to the decision boundary across groups as a key factor.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Attribution algorithms play an instrumental role in human interpretation of AI models. The methods measure the importance of the input features to the model output decision, which can be displayed as an attribution map for image classifiers. Perturbation tests are the state-of-the-art approach to evaluate the quality of an attribution map. Unfortunately, we observe that perturbation tests fail to consider attribution magnitude, which translates into inconsistent quality scores. In this paper, we propose Magnitude Aligned Scoring (MAS), a new attribution quality metric that measures the alignment between the magnitude of the attributions and the model response. In particular, the metric accounts for both the relative ordering and the magnitude of the pixels within an attribution. In the experimental evaluation, we compare the MAS metric with existing metrics across a wide range of models, datasets, attributions, and evaluations. The results demonstrate that the MAS metric is 4x more sensitive to attribution changes, 2x more consistent, and 1.6x more invariant to baseline modifications.

    "abstract": "Explanatory Artificial Intelligence plays a vital role in machine learning, due to its widespread application in decision-making scenarios, e.g., credit lending. Counterfactual Explanation (CFE) is a new kind of explanatory method that involves asking \"what if \", i.e. what would have happened if model inputs slightly change. To answer the question, Counterfactual Explanation aims at finding a minimum perturbation in model inputs leading to a different model decision. Compared with model-agnostic approaches, model-specific CFE approaches designed only for specific type of models usually have better performance in finding optimal counterfactual perturbations, owing to access to the inner workings of models. To deal with this dilemma, this work first proposes CMAES-based Counterfactual Explanations (CMACE): an effective model-agnostic counterfactual generating approach based on Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) and a warm starting scheme that provides good initialization of the counterfactual's mean and covariance parameters for CMA-ES taking advantage of prior information of training samples. CMACE significantly outperforms another state-of-art (SOTA) model-agnostic approach (Bayesian Counterfactual Generator, BayCon) with various experimental settings. Extensive experiments also demonstrate that CMACE is superior to a SOTA model-specific approach (Flexible Optimizable Counterfactual Explanations for Tree Ensembles, FOCUS) that is designed for tree-based models using gradient-based optimization",

Recent works further implement federated learning with SSL to learn from rapidly growing decentralized unlabeled images (e.g., from cameras and phones), often resulting from privacy constraints. Extensive attention has been paid to designing new frameworks or methods that achieve better performance for the SSL-based FL. However, such an effort has not yet taken the security of SSL-based FL into consideration. We aim to explore backdoor attacks in the context of SSL-based FL via an in-depth empirical study. In this paper, we propose a novel backdoor attack BADFSS against SSL-based FL. First, BADFSS learns a backdoored encoder via supervised contrastive learning on poison datasets constructed based on local datasets. Then, BADFSS employs attention alignment to enhance the backdoor effect and maintain the consistency between backdoored and global encoders. Moreover, we perform empirical evaluations of the proposed backdoor attacks on four datasets and compared BADFSS with three existing backdoor attacks that are transferred into federated self-supervised learning.

Although robust learning techniques that consider adversarial risks against worst-case perturbations can effectively increase a model's robustness, they may not always be the most suitable approach. This is due to the fact that in certain scenarios, perturbations are more likely to occur probabilistically rather than being intentionally crafted by attackers. To address this challenge, we propose a novel risk-averse robust learning method based on entropic value-at-risk, called PRASS (Probabilistical Risk-Averse Robust Learning with Stochastic Search). Our approach leverages principles of stochastic optimisation and considers perturbing distributions rather than solely worst-case adversaries. By applying adaptive stochastic search to parameterised distributions, we further enhance the scalability of PRASS to handle distributional robustness.

In this paper, we propose the first general black-box adversarial attack framework, i.e., General Attack via Fake Social Interaction (GAFSI), against detectors based on different graph structures. Specifically, as sharing is an important social interaction for GNN-based fake news detectors to construct the graph, we simulate sharing behaviors to fool the detectors. Firstly, we propose a fraudster selection module to select engaged users leveraging local and global information. In addition, a post injection module guides the selected users to create shared relations by sending posts. The sharing records will be added to the social context, leading to a general attack against different detectors. Experimental results on empirical datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GAFSI",

However, for the diffusion counterparts, the methodology and efficacy of adding extra metric functions remain unclear. One major challenge is the mismatch between the noise predicted by a DDPM at each step and the desired clean image that the metric function works well on. To address this problem, we propose Cas-DM, a network architecture that cascades two network modules to effectively apply metric functions to the diffusion model training. The first module, similar to a standard DDPM, learns to predict the added noise and is unaffected by the metric function. The second cascaded module learns to predict the clean image, thereby facilitating the metric function computation. Experiment results show that the proposed diffusion model backbone enables the effective use of the LPIPS loss, improving the image quality (FID, sFID) of diffusion models on various established benchmarks",

However, recent methods exhibit limitations as they struggle to capture subtle differences between different parts within an object and adaptively handle MGT. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a Class-semantic Guided Attention Shift (SegAS) method. SegAS transforms adaptive MGT into dynamic combinations of invariant discriminant representations across different levels to effectively enhance adaptability to multi-granularity downstream tasks. Specifically, SegAS incorporates a hardness-based Attention Part Filtering Strategy (ApFS) to dynamically decompose objects into complementary parts based on the object structure and relevance to the instance. Then, SegAS shifts attention to the optimal discriminant region of each part under the guidance of hierarchical class semantics. Finally, a diversity loss is employed to emphasize the importance and distinction of different partial features.

Despite significant advancements, the inherent opacity of DL models engenders public distrust, impeding their widespread adoption. For explainable autonomous driving, current studies primarily concentrate on extracting features from input scenes to predict driving actions and their corresponding explanations. However, these methods underutilize semantics and correlation information within actions and explanations (collectively called categories in this work), leading to suboptimal performance. To address this issue, we propose Semantic-Guided Dynamic Correlation Learning (SGDCL), a novel approach that effectively exploits semantic richness and dynamic interactions intrinsic to categories. SGDCL employs a semantic-guided learning module to obtain category-specific representations and a dynamic correlation learning module to adaptively capture intricate correlations among categories. Additionally, we introduce an innovative loss term to leverage fine-grained co-occurrence statistics of categories for refined regularization. We extensively evaluate SGDCL on two well-established benchmarks, demonstrating its superiority over seven state-of-the-art baselines and a large vision-language model. SGDCL significantly promotes explainable autonomous driving with up to 15.3% performance improvement and interpretable attention scores, bolstering public trust in AD",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Popular transformer-based detectors detect objects in a one-to-one manner, where both the bounding box and category of each object are predicted only by the single query, leading to the box-sensitive category predictions. Additionally, the initialization of positional queries solely based on the predicted confidence scores or learnable embeddings neglects the significant spatial interrelation between different queries. This oversight leads to an imbalanced spatial distribution of queries (SDQ). In this paper, we propose a new MLP-DINO model to address these issues. Firstly, we present a new Query-Independent Category Supervision (QICS) approach for modeling categories information, decoupling the sensitive bounding box prediction process to improve the detection performance. Additionally, to further improve the category predictions, we introduce a deep MLP model into transformer-based detection framework to capture the long-range and short-range information simultaneously. Thirdly, to balance the SDQ, we design a novel Graph-based Query Selection (GQS) method that distributes each query point in a discrete manner by graphing the spatial information of queries to cover a broader range of potential objects, significantly enhancing the hit-rate of queries. Experimental results on COCO indicate that our MLP-DINO achieves 54.6% AP with only 44M parame ters under 36-epoch setting, greatly outperforming the original DINO by +3.7% AP with fewer parameters and FLOPs.

However, the self-attention mechanism underlying the transformer leads to quadratic computational cost with respect to image size,limiting its widespread adoption in state-of-the-art vision backbones. In this paper we introduce an efficient and effective attention module we call Composite Attention. It features parallel branches, enabling the modeling of various global dependencies. In each composite attention module, one branch employs a dynamic channel attention module to capture global channel dependencies, while the other branch utilizes an efficient spatial attention module to extract long-range spatial interactions.

However, the majority of existing methods suffer from the limitations of context loss and information redundancy, particularly in simulated textual environments enriched with manually annotated tags or virtual descriptions. To mitigate these issues, we propose a novel Visual-Textual Prompt Hashing (VTPH) that aims to bridge the gap between simulated textual and visual modalities within a unified prompt optimization paradigm for cross-modal retrieval. By seamlessly integrating robust reasoning capabilities inherent in large-scale models, we design the visual and textual alignment prompt mechanisms to collaboratively enhance the contextual awareness and semantic capabilities embedded within simulated textual features. Furthermore, an affinity-adaptive contrastive learning strategy is dedicated to dynamically recalibrating the semantic interaction between visual and textual modalities by modeling the nuanced heterogeneity and semantic gaps between simulated and real-world textual environments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to integrate both visual and textual prompt learning into cross-modal hashing, facilitating the efficacy of semantic coherence between diverse modalities. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets consistently demonstrate the superiority and robustness of our VTPH method over state-of-the-art competitors",

    "abstract": "Cross-Domain Few-shot Semantic Segmentation (CD-FSS) aims to train generalized models that can segment classes from different domains with a few labeled images. Previous works have proven the effectiveness of feature transformation in addressing CD-FSS. However, they completely rely on support images for feature transformation, and repeatedly utilizing a few support images for each class may easily lead to overfitting and overlooking intra-class appearance differences. In this paper, we propose a Doubly Matching Transformation-based Network (DMTNet) to solve the above issue. Instead of completely relying on support images, we propose Self-Matching Transformation (SMT) to construct query-specific transformation matrices based on query images themselves to transform domain-specific query features into domain-agnostic ones. Calculating query-specific transformation matrices can prevent overfitting, especially for the meta-testing stage where only one or several images are used as support images to segment hundreds or thousands of images. After obtaining domain-agnostic features, we exploit a Dual Hypercorrelation Construction (DHC) module to explore the hypercorrelations between the query image with the foreground and background of the support image, based on which foreground and background prediction maps are generated and supervised, respectively, to enhance the segmentation result. In addition, we propose a Test-time Self-Finetuning (TSF) strategy to more accurately self-tune the query prediction in unseen domains. Extensive experiments on four popular datasets show that DMTNet achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art approaches. Code is available at https://github.com/ChenJiayi68/DMTNet",

    "abstract": "We focus on the domain adaptation problem for 3D semantic segmentation, addressing the challenge of data variability in point clouds collected by different LiDARs. Existing benchmarks often mix different types of datasets, which blurs and complicates segmentation evaluations. Here, we introduce a Multi-LiDARs Domain Adaptation Segmentation (MLDAS) dataset, which contains point-wise semantic annotated point clouds captured simultaneously by a 128-beam LiDAR, a 64-beam LiDAR, a 32-beam LiDAR. We select 31,875 scans from 2 representative scenarios: campus and urban street. Furthermore, we evaluate the current 3D segmentation unsupervised domain adaptation methods on the proposed dataset and propose Hierarchical Segmentation Network with Spatial Consistency (HSSC) as a novel knowledge transfer method to mitigate the domain gap significantly using spatial-temporal consistency constraints.

Previous FSS methods have shown sensitivity to background noise due to inherent bias, attention bias, and spatial-aware bias. In this study, we propose a Transformer-Based Adaptive Prototype Matching Network to establish robust matching relationships by improving the semantic and spatial perception of query features. The model includes three modules: target enhancement module (TEM), dual constraint aggregation module (DCAM), and dual classification module (DCM). In particular, TEM mitigates inherent bias by exploring the relevance of multi-scale local context to enhance foreground features. Then, DCAM addresses attention bias through the dual semantic-aware attention mechanism to strengthen constraints. Finally, the DCM module decouples the segmentation task into semantic alignment and spatial alignment to alleviate spatial-aware bias.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Although various knowledge distillation (KD) methods for CNN-based detectors have been proven effective in improving small students, build- ing baselines and recipes for DETR-based detec- tors remains a challenge. This paper concentrates on the transformer decoder of DETR-based detec- tors and explores KD methods suitable for them. However, the random order of the decoder outputs poses a challenge for knowledge distillation as it provides no direct correspondence between the pre- dictions of the teacher and the student. To this end, we propose MixMatcher that aligns the de- coder outputs of DETR-based teacher and student, by mixing two teacher-student matching strategies for combined advantages. The first strategy, Adap- tive Matching, applies bipartite matching to adap- tively match the outputs of the teacher and the stu- dent in each decoder layer. The second strategy, Fixed Matching, fixes the correspondence between the outputs of the teacher and the student with the same object queries as input, which alleviates in- stability of bipartite matching in Adaptive Match- ing. Using both strategies together produces bet- ter results than using either strategy alone. Based on MixMatcher, we devise Decoder Distillation for DEtection TRansformer (D3ETR), which dis- tills knowledge in decoder predictions and attention maps from the teacher to student. D3ETR shows superior performance on various DETR-based de- tectors with different backbones. For instance, D3ETR improves Conditional DETR-R50-C5 by 8.3 mAP under 12 epochs training setting with Conditional DETR-R101-C5 serving as the teacher. The code will be released",

Nevertheless, current video editing tasks mainly suffer from the dilemma between the high fine-tuning cost and the limited generation capacity. Compared with images, we conjecture that videos necessitate more constraints to preserve the temporal consistency during editing. Towards this end, we propose EVE, a robust and Efficient zero-shot Video Editing method. Under the guidance of depth maps and temporal consistency constraints, EVE derives satisfactory video editing results with an affordable computational and time cost. Moreover, recognizing the absence of a publicly available video editing dataset for fair comparisons, we construct a new benchmark named ZVE-50 dataset.

To address this challenge, this paper presents MetaISP - a streamlined model that achieves superior reconstruction quality by adaptively modulating its parameters and architecture in response to diverse inputs. Our rationale revolves around obtaining corresponding spatial and channel-wise correction matrices for various inputs within distinct feature spaces, which assists in assigning optimal attention. This is achieved by predicting dynamic weights for each input image and combining these weights with multiple learnable basis matrices to construct the correction matrices. The proposed MetaISP makes it possible to obtain best performance while being computationally efficient. SOTA results are achieved on two large-scale datasets, e.g. 23.80dB PSNR on ZRR, exceeding the previous SOTA 0.19dB with only 9.2% of its parameter count and 10.6% of its FLOPs; 25.06dB PSNR on MAI21, exceeding the previous SOTA 0.17dB with only 0.9% of its parameter count and 2.7% of its FLOPs",

To overcome this limitation, we propose the Denoising diffusion-augmented Hybrid Video Anomaly Detection (DHVAD) framework. The proposed Denoising diffusion-based Reconstruction Unit (DRU) enhances the understanding of semantically accurate normality as a crucial component in DHVAD. Meanwhile, we propose a detection strategy that integrates the advantages of a prediction-based Frame Prediction Unit (FPU) with DRU by exploring the spatial-temporal consistency seamlessly. The competitive performance of DHVAD compared with state-of-the-art methods on three benchmark datasets proves the effectiveness of our framework. The extended experimental analysis demonstrates that our framework can gain a better understanding of the normality in terms of semantic accuracy for VAD and efficiently leverage the strengths of both components",

While advancements in NLP models have led to extensive research into their backdoor vulnerabilities, the potential for these advancements to introduce new backdoor threats remains unexplored. This paper proposes Imperio, which harnesses the language understanding capabilities of NLP models to enrich backdoor attacks. Imperio provides a new model control experience. Demonstrated through controlling image classifiers, it empowers the adversary to manipulate the victim model with arbitrary output through language-guided instructions. This is achieved using a language model to fuel a conditional trigger generator, with optimizations designed to extend its language understanding capabilities to backdoor instruction interpretation and execution. Our experiments across three datasets, five attacks, and nine defenses confirm Imperio's effectiveness. It can produce contextually adaptive triggers from text descriptions and control the victim model with desired outputs, even in scenarios not encountered during training. The attack reaches a high success rate without compromising the accuracy of clean inputs and exhibits resilience against representative defenses.

    "abstract": "Unsupervised person search aims to localize a particular target person from a gallery set of scene images without annotations, which is extremely challenging due to the unexpected variations of the unlabeled domains. However, most existing methods dedicate to developing multi-stage models to adapt domain variations while using clustering for iterative model training, which inevitably increase model complexity. To address this issue, we propose a Fast One-stage Unsupervised person Search (FOUS) which complementaryly integrates domain adaption with label adaption within an end-to-end manner without iterative clustering. To minimize the domain discrepancy, FOUS introduced an Attention-based Domain Alignment Module (ADAM) which can not only align various domains for both detection and ReID tasks but also construct an attention mechanism to reduce the adverse impacts of low-quality candidates resulting from unsupervised detection. Moreover, to avoid the redundant iterative clustering mode, FOUS adopts a prototype-guided labeling method which minimizes redundant correlation computations for partial samples and assigns noisy coarse label groups efficiently. The coarse label groups will be continuously refined via label-flexible training network with an adaptive selection strategy. With the adapted domains and labels, FOUS can achieve the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on two benchmark datasets, CUHK-SYSU and PRW. The code is available at https://github.com/whbdmu/FOUS",

This paper presents an effective and efficient framework for image restoration, termed CSNet, based on ``channel + spatial\" hybrid frequency modulation. Different feature channels include different degradation patterns and degrees, however, most current networks ignore the importance of channel interactions. To alleviate this issue, we propose a frequency-based channel feature modulation module to facilitate channel interactions through the channel-dimension Fourier transform. Furthermore, based on our observations, we develop a multi-scale frequency-based spatial feature modulation module to refine the direct-current component of features using extremely lightweight learnable parameters. This module contains a densely connected coarse-to-fine learning paradigm for enhancing multi-scale representation learning. In addition, we introduce a frequency-inspired loss function to achieve omni-frequency learning.

Despite the significant progress in SR, Transformer-based SR methods (e.g., SwinIR) still suffer from the problems of heavy computation cost and low-frequency preference, while ignoring the reconstruction of rich high-frequency information, hence hindering the representational power of Transformers. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel Frequency-aware Transformer (FreqFormer) for lightweight image SR. Specifically, a Frequency Division Module (FDM) is first introduced to separately handle high- and low-frequency information in a divide-and-conquer manner. Moreover, we present Frequency-aware Transformer Block (FTB) to extracting both spatial frequency attention and channel transposed attention to recover high-frequency details.

However, a persistent challenge exists in lacking a unified approach to apply diffusion models to visual perception tasks with diverse semantic granularity requirements.

In this paper, we propose Vermouth, a simple yet effective framework comprising a pre-trained Stable Diffusion (SD) model containing rich generative priors, a unified head (U-head) capable of integrating hierarchical representations, and an Adapted-Expert providing discriminative priors. Comprehensive investigations unveil potential characteristics of Vermouth, such as varying granularity of perception concealed in latent variables at distinct time steps and various U-net stages. We emphasize that there is no necessity for incorporating a heavyweight or intricate decoder to transform diffusion models into potent representation learners. Extensive comparative evaluations against tailored discriminative models showcase the efficacy of our approach on zero-shot sketch-based image retrieval (ZS-SBIR), few-shot classification, and open-vocabulary (OV) semantic segmentation tasks.

However, previous related work rarely considers both situations at the same time. This implies the deployment of multiple models and thus more computational burden. The main reasons for this lack of an integrated model are caused by two factors: (1) The lack of a dataset including both physical and digital attacks which the same ID covers the real face and all attack types; (2) Given the large intra-class variance between these two attacks, it is difficult to learn a compact feature space to detect both attacks simultaneously. To address these issues, we collect a Unified physical-digital Attack dataset, called UniAttackData. The dataset consists of 1,800 participations of 2 and 12 physical and digital attacks, respectively, resulting in a total of 28,706 videos. Then, we propose a Unified Attack Detection framework based on Vision-Language Models (VLMs), namely UniAttackDetection, which includes three main modules: the Teacher-Student Prompts (TSP) module, focused on acquiring unified and specific knowledge respectively; the Unified Knowledge Mining (UKM) module, designed to capture a comprehensive feature space; and the Sample-Level Prompt Interaction (SLPI) module, aimed at grasping sample-level semantics. These three modules seamlessly form a robust unified attack detection framework.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In text recognition, self-supervised pre-training emerges as a good solution to reduce dependence on expansive annotated real data. Previous studies primarily focus on local visual representation by leveraging mask image modeling or sequence contrastive learning. However, they omit modeling the linguistic information in text images, which is crucial for recognizing text. To simultaneously capture local character features and linguistic information in visual space, we propose Symmetric Superimposition Modeling (SSM). The objective of SSM is to reconstruct the direction-specific pixel and feature signals from the symmetrically superimposed input. Specifically, we add the original image with its inverted views to create the symmetrically superimposed inputs. At the pixel level, we reconstruct the original and inverted images to capture character shapes and texture-level linguistic context. At the feature level, we reconstruct the feature of the same original image and inverted image with different augmentations to model the semantic-level linguistic context and the local character discrimination. In our design, we disrupt the character shape and linguistic rules. Consequently, the dual-level reconstruction facilitates understanding character shapes and linguistic information from the perspective of visual texture and feature semantics. Experiments on various text recognition benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of SSM, with 4.1\\% average performance gains and 86.6% new state-of-the-art average word accuracy on Union14M benchmarks.

To address this, we introduce the first large-scale license plate deblurring dataset named License Plate Blur (LPBlur), captured by a dual-camera system and processed through a post-processing pipeline to avoid misalignment issues. Then, we propose a License Plate Deblurring Generative Adversarial Network (LPDGAN) to tackle the license plate deblurring: 1) a Feature Fusion Module to integrate multi-scale latent codes; 2) a Text Reconstruction Module to restore structure through textual modality; 3) a Partition Discriminator Module to enhance the model's perception of details in each letter.

On the one hand, we introduce a cross-scale comprehensive information capture module, which improves the information utilization of the original PAN image through fully-supervised reconstruction. On the other hand, we pioneer a domain adaptation strategy to tackle the problem of low generalization across different scales. Considering the instinct domain gap between different scales, we leverage the maximum mean discrepancy loss and the inherent pixel-level correlations between features at different scales to reduce the scale variance, thus boosting the generalization ability of our model. Experiments on various satellites demonstrate the superiority of our method over the state-of-the-arts in terms of information retention.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Traditional text-image person retrieval methods heavily rely on fully matched and identity-annotated multimodal data, representing an ideal yet limited scenario. The issues of handling incomplete multimodal data and the complexities of labeling multimodal data are common challenges encountered in real-world applications. In response to these challenges encountered, we consider a more robust and pragmatic setting termed unsupervised incomplete text-image person retrieval, where person images and text descriptions are not fully matched and lack the supervision of identity labels. To tackle these two problems, we propose the Enhancing Cross-modal Completion and Alignment (ECCA) method. Specifically, we propose a feature-level cross-modal completion strategy for incomplete data. This approach leverages the available cross-modal high semantic similarity features to construct relational graphs for missing modal data, which can generate more reliable completion features. Additionally, to address the cross-modal matching ambiguity, we propose weighted inter-instance granularity alignment as well as enhanced prototype-wise granularity alignment modules that can map semantically similar image-text pairs more compact in the common embedding space. Extensive experiments on public datasets, fully demonstrate the consistent superiority of our method over SOTA text-image person retrieval methods",

    "title": "TSESNet: Temporal-Spatial Enhanced Breast Tumor Segmentation in DCE-MRI Using Feature Perception and Separability",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Accurate segmentation of breast tumors in dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance images (DCE-MRI) is critical for early diagnosis of breast cancer. However, this task remains challenging due to the wide range of tumor sizes, shapes, and appearances. Additionally, the complexity is further compounded by the high dimensionality and ill-posed artifacts present in DCE-MRI data. Furthermore, accurately modeling features in DCE-MRI sequences presents a challenge that hinders the effective representation of essential tumor characteristics. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel Temporal-Spatial Enhanced Network (TSESNet) for breast tumor segmentation in DCE-MRI. TSESNet leverages the spatial and temporal dependencies of DCE-MRI to provide a comprehensive representation of tumor features. To address sequence modeling challenges, we propose a Temporal-Spatial Contrastive Loss (TSCLoss) that maximizes the distance between different classes and minimizes the distance within the same class, thereby improving the separation between tumors and the background. Moreover, we design a novel Temporal Series Feature Fusion (TSFF) module that effectively integrates temporal MRI features from multiple time points, enhancing the model's ability to handle temporal sequences and improving overall performance. Finally, we introduce a simple and effective Tumor-Aware (TA) module that enriches feature representation to accommodate tumors of various sizes. We conducted comprehensive experiments to validate the proposed method and demonstrate its superior performance compared to recent state-of-the-art segmentation methods on two breast cancer DCE-MRI datasets",

However, existing works not only fail to fully utilize all the available modal information in the 3D domain but also lack sufficient granularity in representing the features of each modality. In this paper, we propose a unified multimodal 3D open-vocabulary scene understanding network, namely UniM-OV3D, aligning point clouds with image, language and depth. To better integrate global and local features of the point clouds, we design a hierarchical point cloud feature extraction module that learns fine-grained feature representations. Further, to facilitate the learning of coarse-to-fine point-semantic representations from captions, we propose the utilization of hierarchical 3D caption pairs, capitalizing on geometric constraints across various viewpoints of 3D scenes.

    "abstract": "In recent years, advanced U-like networks have demonstrated remarkable performance in medical image segmentation tasks. However, their drawbacks, including excessive parameters, high computational complexity, and slow inference speed, pose challenges for practical implementation in scenarios with limited computational resources. Existing lightweight U-like networks have alleviated some problems, but they often have pre-designed structures and consist of non-detachable modules, limiting their application scenarios. In this paper, we propose three plug-and-play decoders by employing different discretization methods of the neural memory Ordinary Differential Equation (nmODE). These decoders integrate features at various levels of abstraction by processing information from skip connections and performing numerical operations on upward paths. Through experiments on the PH2, ISIC2017, and ISIC2018 datasets, we embed these decoders into different U-like networks, demonstrating their effectiveness in significantly reducing the number of parameters and computation while maintaining performance. In summary, the proposed discretized nmODE decoder is capable of reducing the number of parameters by about 20% ~ 50% and computation by up to 74%, while being adaptive to all U-like networks.

    "abstract": "Multi-modal large language models(MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress and demonstrated powerful knowledge comprehension and reasoning abilities. However, the mastery of domain-specific knowledge, which is essential for evaluating the intelligence of MLLMs, continues to be a challenge. Current multi-modal benchmarks for domain-specific knowledge concentrate on multiple-choice questions and are predominantly available in English, which imposes limitations on the comprehensiveness of the evaluation. To this end, we introduce CMMU, a novel benchmark for multi-modal and multi-type question understanding and reasoning in Chinese. CMMU consists of 3,603 questions in 7 subjects, covering knowledge from primary to high school. The questions can be categorized into 3 types: multiple-choice, multiple-response, and fill-in-the-blank, bringing greater challenges to MLLMs. In addition, we propose an evaluation strategy called Positional Error Variance for assessing multiple-choice questions. The strategy aims to perform a quantitative analysis of position bias. We evaluate seven open-source MLLMs along with GPT4-V, Gemini-Pro, and Qwen-VL-Plus. The results demonstrate that CMMU poses a significant challenge to the recent MLLMs. The data and code are available at https://github.com/FlagOpen/CMMU",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Current Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks mainly employ textual instructions to guide agents. However, being inherently abstract, the same textual instruction can be associated with different visual signals, causing severe ambiguity and limiting the transfer of prior knowledge in the vision domain from the user to the agent. To fill this gap, we propose Vision-and-Language Navigation with Multi-modal Prompts (VLN-MP), a novel task augmenting traditional VLN by integrating both natural language and images in instructions. VLN-MP not only maintains backward compatibility by effectively handling text-only prompts but also consistently shows advantages with different quantities and relevance of visual prompts. Possible forms of visual prompts include both exact and similar object images, providing adaptability and versatility in diverse navigation scenarios. To evaluate VLN-MP under a unified framework, we implement a new benchmark that offers: (1) a training-free pipeline to transform textual instructions into multi-modal forms with landmark images; (2) diverse datasets with multi-modal instructions for different downstream tasks; (3) a novel module designed to process various image prompts for seamless integration with state-of-the-art VLN models. Extensive experiments on four VLN benchmarks (R2R, RxR, REVERIE, CVDN) show that incorporating visual prompts would significantly boost navigation performance. While maintaining efficiency with text-only prompts, VLN-MP enables agents to navigate in the pre-explore setting and outperform text-based models, showing its broader applicability.

    "title": "Improving Adversarial Robustness via Feature Pattern Consistency Constraint",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are well-known for their vulnerability to adversarial attacks, posing significant security concerns. In response to these threats, various defense methods have emerged to bolster the model's robustness. However, most existing methods either focus on learning from adversarial perturbations, leading to overfitting to the adversarial examples, or aim to eliminate such perturbations during inference, inevitably increasing computational burdens. Conversely, clean training, which strengthens the model's robustness by relying solely on clean examples, can address the aforementioned issues. In this paper, we align with this methodological stream and enhance its generalizability to unknown adversarial examples. This enhancement is achieved by scrutinizing the behavior of latent features within the network. Recognizing that a correct prediction relies on the correctness of the latent feature's pattern, we introduce a novel and effective Feature Pattern Consistency Constraint (FPCC) method to reinforce the latent feature's capacity to maintain the correct feature pattern. Specifically, we propose Spatial-wise Feature Modification and Channel-wise Feature Selection to enhance latent features. Subsequently, we employ the Pattern Consistency Loss to constrain the similarity between the feature pattern of the latent features and the correct feature pattern. Our experiments demonstrate that the FPCC method empowers latent features to uphold correct feature patterns even in the face of adversarial examples, resulting in inherent adversarial robustness surpassing state-of-the-art models",

    "abstract": "Conventional super-resolution (SR) schemes make heavy use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which involve intensive multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations, and require specialized hardware such as graphics processing units. This contradicts the regime of edge AI that often runs on devices strained by power, computing, and storage resources. Such a challenge has motivated a series of lookup table (LUT)-based SR schemes that employ simple LUT readout and largely elude CNN computation. Nonetheless, the multi-megabyte LUTs in existing methods still prohibit on-chip storage and necessitate off-chip memory transport. This work tackles this storage hurdle and innovates hundred-kilobyte LUT (HKLUT) models amenable to on-chip cache. Utilizing an asymmetric two-branch multistage network coupled with a suite of specialized kernel patterns, HKLUT demonstrates an uncompromising performance and superior hardware efficiency over existing LUT schemes.

However, the lack of mining of temporal dependent relationships and diversified event patterns within videos limit the performance of existing methods. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel prototype-guided and dynamic-aware long-distance frame prediction paradigm for VAD. Specifically, we develop a prototype-guided dynamics matching network (PDM-Net) to enhance the discriminant and robustness of anomaly detector. To explore the temporal contexts, we equip PDM-Net with a long short-term dynamic prototype alignment learning mechanism, which stores long-term dynamic prototypes into memory bank and learns how to recall long-term dynamic prototypes with short-term dynamics. As a result, the short input sequences can recall long-term dynamic prototypes stored in the memory bank to achieve the task of long-distance frame prediction. Besides, a feature discrimination module is adopted to extract the representative dynamic features of various normal events meanwhile preserving the diversity of normal patterns.

However, current methods usually grapple with issues arising from the disparity between low-level pixel data and high-level semantic descriptions, which results in inpainted sections not harmonizing with the original image (either structurally or texturally). In this study, we introduce a Structure-Aware Inpainting Learning scheme and an Asymmetric Cross Domain Attention to address these cross-domain misalignment challenges. The proposed structure-aware learning scheme employs features of an intermediate modality as structure guidance to bridge the gap between text information and low-level pixels. Meanwhile, asymmetric cross-domain attention enhances the texture consistency between inpainted and unmasked regions.

    "abstract": "Open Set Domain Adaptation (OSDA) aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, where known classes exist across domains while unknown classes are present only in the target domain. Existing methods rely on the clustering structure to identify the unknown classes, which empirically induces a large identification error if the unknown classes are a mixture of multiple components. To break through this barrier, we formulate OSDA from the view of correlation and propose a correlation metric-based framework called Balanced Correlation Learning (BCL). BCL employs Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) to characterize the separation between unknown and known classes, where HSIC is reformulated as the nodes' relation on graph. By considering the label prior as variable, theoretical results are derived to analytically show a sufficient condition for desired learning direction for OSDA. Methodologically, the class-balanced HSIC is proposed to preserve domain-invariant and class-discriminative features. With the guarantee of correlation learning, the entropy-based principle can effectively identify the unknown classes via uncertainty. Empirically, extensive evaluations are conducted, where BCL achieves significant performance improvements",

Traditional convolutional neural networks (CNN)-based single-image super-resolution (SISR) networks, however, are not effective for spherical ODIs. This is due to the uneven pixel density distribution and varying texture complexity in different regions that arise when projecting from a sphere to a plane. Additionally, the computational and memory costs associated with large-sized ODIs present a challenge for real-world application. To address these issues, we propose an efficient distortion-adaptive super-resolution network (ODA-SRN). Specifically, ODA-SRN employs a series of specially designed Distortion Attention Block Groups (DABG) as its backbone. Our Distortion Attention Blocks (DABs) utilize multi-segment parameterized convolution to generate dynamic filters, which compensate for distortion and texture fading during feature extraction. Moreover, we introduce an upsampling scheme that accounts for the dependence of pixel position and distortion degree to achieve pixel-level distortion offset. A comprehensive set of results demonstrates that our ODA-SRN significantly improves the super-resolution performance for ODIs, both quantitatively and qualitatively, when compared to other state-of-the-art methods",

Although knowledge distillation could impair the feature via imitation, the mixed feature with ambiguous semantics hinders the distillation. To this end, we propose an asymmetric distillation framework by feeding teacher model extra raw data to enlarge the benefit of teacher. Moreover, a joint mutual information loss and a selective relabel strategy are utilized to alleviate the influence of hard mixed samples.

    "abstract": "In recent years, short-form videos have gained popularity and the editing of these videos, particularly when motion is synchronized with music, is highly favored due to its beat-matching effect. However, detecting motion rhythm poses a significant challenge as it is influenced by multiple factors that make it difficult to define using explicit rules. While traditional methods attempt to define motion rhythm, they often yield unsatisfactory results. On the other hand, learning-based methods can extract motion rhythm without relying on explicit rules but require high-quality datasets. Unfortunately, existing datasets simply substitute music rhythm for motion rhythm which are not equivalent. To address these challenges, we present the motion rhythm dataset AIST-M2B, which is annotated with meticulously curated motion rhythm labels derived from the profound correlation between motion and music in professional dance. We propose a novel network architecture called M2BNet that is specifically trained on AIST-M2B to effectively extract intricate motion rhythms by incorporating both human body structure and temporal information. Additionally, we introduce a pioneering algorithm for enhancing motion rhythm synchronization with beats.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Due to spatial redundancy in remote sensing images, sparse tokens containing rich information are usually involved in self-attention (SA) to reduce the overall token numbers within the calculation, avoiding the high computational cost issue in Vision Transformers. However, such methods usually obtain sparse tokens by hand-crafted or parallel-unfriendly designs, posing a challenge to reach a better balance between efficiency and performance. Different from them, this paper proposes to use learnable meta tokens to formulate sparse tokens, which effectively learn key information meanwhile improving the inference speed. Technically, the meta tokens are first initialized from image tokens via cross-attention. Then, we propose Dual Cross-Attention (DCA) to promote information exchange between image tokens and meta tokens, where they serve as query and key (value) tokens alternatively in a dual-branch structure, significantly reducing the computational complexity compared to self-attention. By employing DCA in the early stages with dense visual tokens, we obtain the hierarchical architecture LeMeViT with various sizes. Experimental results in classification and dense prediction tasks show that LeMeViT has a significant 1.7 × speedup, fewer parameters, and competitive performance compared to the baseline models, and achieves a better trade-off between efficiency and performance.

As the scene of moving pedestrian changes, the captured person image inevitably bring in lots of background noise and foreground noise on the person feature, which are completely unrelated to the person identity, leading to severe performance degeneration. To address this issue, we present a Scene-Adaptive Person Search (SEAS) model by introducing bilateral modulations to simultaneously eliminate scene noise and maintain a consistent person representation to adapt to various scenes. In SEAS, a Background Modulation Network (BMN) is designed to encode the feature extracted from the detected bounding box into a multi-granularity embedding, which reduces the input of background noise from multiple levels with norm-aware. Additionally, to mitigate the effect of foreground noise on the person feature, SEAS introduces a Foreground Modulation Network (FMN) to compute the clutter reduction offset for the person embedding based on the feature map of the scene image. By bilateral modulations on both background and foreground within an end-to-end manner, SEAS obtains consistent feature representations without scene noise. SEAS can achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on two benchmark datasets, CUHK-SYSU with 97.1% mAP and PRW with 60.5% mAP. The code is available at https://github.com/whbdmu/SEAS",

    "title": "TFLOP: Table Structure Recognition Framework with Layout Pointer Mechanism",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Table Structure Recognition (TSR) is a task aimed at converting table images into a machine-readable format (e.g. HTML), to facilitate other applications such as information retrieval. Recent works tackle this problem by identifying the HTML tags and text regions, where the latter is used for text extraction from the table document. These works however, suffer from misalignment issues when mapping text into the identified text regions. In this paper, we introduce a new TSR framework, called TFLOP (TSR Framework with LayOut Pointer mechanism), which reformulates the conventional text region prediction and matching into a direct text region pointing problem. Specifically, TFLOP utilizes text region information to identify both the table's structure tags and its aligned text regions, simultaneously. Without the need for region prediction and alignment, TFLOP circumvents the additional text region matching stage, which requires finely-calibrated post-processing. TFLOP also employs span-aware contrastive supervision to enhance the pointing mechanism in tables with complex structure. As a result, TFLOP achieves the state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks such as PubTabNet, FinTabNet, and SynthTabNet. In our extensive experiments, TFLOP not only exhibits competitive performance but also shows promising results on industrial document TSR scenarios such as documents with watermarks or in non-English domain.

Adversarial purification methods are promising approaches for defending against comprehensive attacks, including unseen ones. However, re-ID testing identities (IDs) are unseen, requiring more sophisticated purification than other classification tasks for adversarial defense. We propose IntensPure, an adversarial purification method in person re-ID that quantifies attack intensity via ID stability and attribute inconsistency to customize purification strength. Based on the estimated attack intensity, IntensPure employs secondary domain adaptive diffusion focused on purifying the low- and mid-frequency coefficients vulnerable to re-ID attacks. This method significantly reduces computational costs compared to the conventional diffusion method. For elaborate purification, IntensPure performs a directional diffusion process and refinements, leveraging the directional characteristics of secondary images. The experimental results on diverse attacks demonstrate that IntensPure outperforms the existing methods in terms of rank-1 accuracy",

    "title": "Bridging Stereo Geometry and BEV Representation with Reliable Mutual Interaction for Semantic Scene Completion",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "3D semantic scene completion (SSC) is an ill-posed perception task that requires inferring a dense 3D scene from limited observations. Previous camera-based methods struggle to predict accurate semantic scenes due to inherent geometric ambiguity and incomplete observations. In this paper, we resort to stereo matching technique and bird's-eye-view (BEV) representation learning to address such issues in SSC. Complementary to each other, stereo matching mitigates geometric ambiguity with epipolar constraint while BEV representation enhances the hallucination ability for invisible regions with global semantic context. However, due to the inherent representation gap between stereo geometry and BEV features, it is non-trivial to bridge them for dense prediction task of SSC. Therefore, we further develop a unified occupancy-based framework dubbed BRGScene, which effectively bridges these two representations with dense 3D volumes for reliable semantic scene completion. Specifically, we design a novel Mutual Interactive Ensemble (MIE) block for pixel-level reliable aggregation of stereo geometry and BEV features. Within the MIE block, a Bi-directional Reliable Interaction (BRI) module, enhanced with confidence re-weighting, is employed to encourage fine-grained interaction through mutual guidance. Besides, a Dual Volume Ensemble (DVE) module is introduced to facilitate complementary aggregation through channel-wise recalibration and multi-group voting. Our method outperforms all published camera-based methods on SemanticKITTI for semantic scene completion. Our code is available on https://github.com/Arlo0o/StereoScene",

    "abstract": "Event-driven image deblurring is an innovative approach involving the input of events obtained from the event camera alongside blurred frames to facilitate the deblurring process. Unlike conventional cameras, event cameras in event-driven imaging exhibit low-latency characteristics and are immune to motion blur, resulting in significant advancements in image deblurring. In this paper, we propose a pioneering event-based coarse-to-fine image deblurring network named CFFNet. In contrast to existing deblurring methods, our approach incorporates event data, generating multiple coarse frames from a single frame before further refining them into a sharp image. We introduce an Event Image Fusion Block (EIFB) for the coarse fusion of events and images, producing coarse frames at different time points. Additionally, we propose a Bidirectional Frame Fusion Block (BFFB) for the fine fusion of coarse frames. CFFNet effectively harnesses the spatiotemporal information of event data through a comprehensive fusion process from coarse to fine.

    "abstract": "Invertible Rescaling Networks (IRNs) and their variants have witnessed remarkable achievements in various image processing tasks like image rescaling. However, we observe that IRNs with deeper networks are difficult to train, thus hindering the representational ability of IRNs. To address this issue, we propose Invertible Residual Rescaling Models (IRRM) for image rescaling by learning a bijection between a high-resolution image and its low-resolution counterpart with a specific distribution. Specifically, we propose IRRM to build a deep network, which contains several Residual Downscaling Modules (RDMs) with long skip connections. Each RDM consists of several Invertible Residual Blocks (IRBs) with short connections. In this way, RDM allows rich low-frequency information to be bypassed by skip connections and forces models to focus on extracting high-frequency information from the image. Extensive experiments show that our IRRM performs significantly better than other state-of-the-art methods with much fewer parameters and complexity. Particularly, our IRRM has respectively PSNR gains of at least 0.3 dB over HCFlow and IRN in the x4 rescaling while only using 60% parameters and 50% FLOPs.

    "abstract": "Recently developed generative methods, including invertible rescaling network (IRN) based and generative adversarial network (GAN) based methods, have demonstrated exceptional performance in image rescaling. However, IRN-based methods tend to produce over-smoothed results, while GAN-based methods easily generate fake details, which thus hinders their real applications. To address this issue, we propose Boundary-aware Decoupled Flow Networks (BDFlow) to generate realistic and visually pleasing results. Unlike previous methods that model high-frequency information as standard Gaussian distribution directly, our BDFlow first decouples the high-frequency information into semantic high-frequency that adheres to a Boundary distribution and non-semantic high-frequency counterpart that adheres to a Gaussian distribution. Specifically, to capture semantic high-frequency parts accurately, we use Boundary-aware Mask (BAM) to constrain the model to produce rich textures, while non-semantic high-frequency part is randomly sampled from a Gaussian distribution. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our BDFlow significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods while maintaining lower complexity. Notably, our BDFlow improves the PSNR by 4.4 dB and the SSIM by 0.1 on average over GRAIN, utilizing only 74% of the parameters and 20% of the computation.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Contrastive learning has shown impressive success in enhancing feature discriminability for various visual tasks in a self-supervised manner, but the standard contrastive paradigm (features+l2 normalization) has limited benefits when applied in domain adaptation. We find that this is mainly because the class weights (weights of the final fully connected layer) are ignored in the domain adaptation optimization process, which makes it difficult for features to cluster around the corresponding class weights. To solve this problem, we propose the simple but powerful Probabilistic Contrastive Learning (PCL), which moves beyond the standard paradigm by removing l2 normalization and replacing the features with probabilities. PCL can guide the probability distribution towards a one-hot configuration, thus minimizing the discrepancy between features and class weights. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of PCL and observe consistent performance gains on five tasks, i.e., Unsupervised/Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation (UDA/SSDA), Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL), UDA Detection and Semantic Segmentation. Notably, for UDA Semantic Segmentation on SYNTHIA, PCL surpasses the sophisticated CPSL-D by 2% in terms of mean IoU with a much lower training cost (PCL: 1*3090, 5 days v.s.

To tackle the above limitations, we propose OTOcc, a novel 3D occupancy prediction framework that models semantic conversion from 2D pixels to 3D voxels as Optimal Transport (OT) problem, offering accurate semantic mapping to adapt to sparse scenarios without attention or depth estimation. Specifically, the unit transportation cost between each demander (voxel) and supplier (pixel) pair is defined as the weighted occupancy prediction loss. Then, we utilize the Sinkhorn-Knopp Iteration to find the best mapping matrices with minimal transportation costs. To reduce the computational cost, we propose a block reading technique with multi-perspective feature representation, which also brings fine-grained scene understanding. Extensive experiments show that OTOcc not only has the competitive prediction performance but also has about more than 4.58% reduction in computational overhead compared to state-of-the-art methods",

    "abstract": "Pedestrian trajectory prediction has emerged as a core component of human-robot interaction and autonomous driving. Fast and accurate prediction of surrounding pedestrians contributes to making decisions and improves safety and efficiency. However, pedestrians' future trajectories will interact with their surrounding traffic participants. As the density of pedestrians increases, the complexity of such interactions also increases significantly, leading to an inevitable decrease in the accuracy of pedestrian trajectory prediction. To address this issue, we propose DenseKoopman, a plug-and-play framework for dense pedestrian trajectory prediction. Specifically, we introduce the Koopman operator theory to find an embedding space for a global linear approximation of a nonlinear pedestrian motion system. By encoding historical trajectories as linear state embeddings in the Koopman space, we transforms nonlinear trajectory data for pedestrians in dense scenes. This linearized representation greatly reduces the complexity of dense pedestrian trajectory prediction. Extensive experiments on pedestrian trajectory prediction benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework. We also conducted an analysis of the data transformation to explore how our DenseKoopman framework works with each validation method and uncovers motion patterns that may be hidden within the trajectory data.

Firstly, instead of simply superimposing rain layers, we integrate various rainy patterns and design a phenomenal pipeline that incorporates multiple degradation types. Secondly, we construct a Patterns-aware Rain Removal Network (PRRN), which learns from both synthetic and real data simultaneously. In addition, to eliminate the inevitable distribution differences between synthetic and real data, we design a new Multi-representation Inter-domain Alignment Module (MIAM) in PRRN.

Differently, we focus on improving the quality of the multi-scale features to enhance the fused multi-scale feature representation. To this end, we design a Wavelet-based Scale-specific Recurrent Feedback Network (WSRFNet), which refines multi-scale features using recurrent feedback mechanism. Specifically, to avoid information loss when introducing feedback to multi-scale features, we propose a wavelet-based feedback pyramid module (WFPM), which is based on a reversible downsampling operation, i.e., Haar wavelet transform. Unlike scale-agnostic feedback used in previous feedback methods, we develop a scale-specific refinement module (SRM), which utilizes scale-specific feedback to pointedly refine features of different scales.

    "abstract": "Text-based Person Search aims to retrieve a specified person using a given text query. Current methods predominantly rely on paired labeled image-text data to train the cross-modality retrieval model, necessitating laborious and time-consuming labeling. In response to this challenge, we present the Cross-modal Generation and Alignment via Attribute-guided Prompt framework (GAAP) for fully unsupervised text-based person search, utilizing only unlabeled images. Our proposed GAAP framework consists of two key parts: Attribute-guided Prompt Caption Generation and Attribute-guided Cross-modal Alignment module. The Attribute-guided Prompt Caption Generation module generates pseudo text labels by feeding the attribute prompts into a large-scale pre-trained vision-language model. These synthetic texts are then meticulously selected through a sample selection, ensuring the reliability for subsequent fine-tuning. The Attribute-guided Cross-modal Alignment module encompasses three sub-modules for feature alignment across modalities. Firstly, Cross-Modal Center Alignment (CMCA) aligns the samples with different modality centroids. Subsequently, to address ambiguity arising from local attribute similarities, an Attribute-guided Image-Text Contrastive Learning module (AITC) is proposed to facilitate the alignment of relationships among different pairs by considering local attribute similarities. Lastly, the Attribute-guided Image-Text Matching (AITM) module is introduced to mitigate noise in pseudo captions by using the image-attribute matching score to soften the hard matching labels.

    "abstract": "Conditional human motion synthesis (HMS) aims to generate human motion sequences that conform to specific conditions. Text and audio represent the two predominant modalities employed as HMS control conditions. While existing research has primarily focused on single conditions, the multi-condition human motion synthesis remains underexplored. In this study, we propose a multi-condition HMS framework, termed MCM, based on a dual-branch structure composed of a main branch and a control branch. This framework effectively extends the applicability of the diffusion model, which is initially predicated solely on textual conditions, to auditory conditions. This extension encompasses both music-to-dance and co-speech HMS while preserving the intrinsic quality of motion and the capabilities for semantic association inherent in the original model. Furthermore, we propose the implementation of a Transformer-based diffusion model, designated as MWNet, as the main branch. This model adeptly apprehends the spatial intricacies and inter-joint correlations inherent in motion sequences, facilitated by the integration of multi-wise self-attention modules. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves competitive results in single-condition and multi-condition HMS tasks",

    "title": "Enhancing Boundary Segmentation for Topological Accuracy with Skeleton-based Methods",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Topological consistency plays a crucial role in the task of boundary segmentation for reticular images, such as cell membrane segmentation in neuron electron microscopic images, grain boundary segmentation in material microscopic images and road segmentation in aerial images. In these fields, topological changes in segmentation results have a serious impact on the downstream tasks, which can even exceed the misalignment of the boundary itself. To enhance the topology accuracy in segmentation results, we propose the Skea-Topo Aware loss, which is a novel loss function that takes into account the shape of each object and topological significance of the pixels. It consists of two components. First, a skeleton-aware weighted loss improves the segmentation accuracy by better modeling the object geometry with skeletons. Second, a boundary rectified term effectively identifies and emphasizes topological critical pixels in the prediction errors using both foreground and background skeletons in the ground truth and predictions. Experiments prove that our method improves topological consistency by up to 7 points in VI compared to 13 state-of-art methods, based on objective and subjective assessments across three different boundary segmentation datasets.

    "title": "Accelerating Diffusion Models for Inverse Problems through Shortcut Sampling",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Diffusion models have recently demonstrated an impressive ability to address inverse problems in an unsupervised manner. While existing methods primarily focus on modifying the posterior sampling process, the potential of the forward process remains largely unexplored. In this work, we propose Shortcut Sampling for Diffusion(SSD), a novel approach for solving inverse problems in a zero-shot manner. Instead of initiating from random noise, the core concept of SSD is to find a specific transitional state that bridges the measurement image y and the restored image x. By utilizing the shortcut path of \"input - transitional state - output\", SSD can achieve precise restoration with fewer steps. To derive the transitional state during the forward process, we introduce Distortion Adaptive Inversion. Moreover, we apply back projection as additional consistency constraints during the generation process. Experimentally, we demonstrate SSD's effectiveness on multiple representative IR tasks. Our method achieves competitive results with only 30 NFEs compared to state-of-the-art zero-shot methods(100 NFEs) and outperforms them with 100 NFEs in certain tasks.

    "title": "Where Elegance Meets Precision: Towards a Compact, Automatic, and Flexible Framework for Multi-modality Image Fusion and Applications",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Multi-modality image fusion aims to integrate images from multiple sensors, producing an image that is visually appealing and offers more comprehensive information than any single one. To ensure high visual quality and facilitate accurate subsequent perception tasks, previous methods have often cascaded networks using weighted loss functions. However, such simplistic strategies struggle to truly achieve the \"Best of Both Worlds\", and the adjustment of numerous hand-crafted parameters becomes burdensome. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a Compact, Automatic and Flexible framework, dubbed CAF, designed for infrared and visible image fusion, along with subsequent tasks. Concretely, we recast the combined problem of fusion and perception into a single objective, allowing mutual optimization of information from both tasks. Then we also utilize the perception task to inform the design of fusion loss functions, facilitating the automatic identification of optimal fusion objectives tailored to the task. Furthermore, CAF can support seamless integration with existing approaches easily, offering flexibility in adapting to various tasks and network structures. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of CAF, which not only produces visually admirable fused results but also realizes 1.7 higher detection mAP@.5 and 2.0 higher segmentation mIoU than the state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "Recently, significant progress has been made in the research of 3D object detection. However, most prior studies have focused on the utilization of center-based or anchor-based label assignment schemes. Alternative label assignment strategies remain unexplored in 3D object detection. We find that the center-based label assignment often fails to generate sufficient positive samples for training, while the anchor-based label assignment tends to encounter an imbalanced issue when handling objects with different scales. To solve these issues, we introduce a dynamic cross label assignment (DCLA) scheme, which dynamically assigns positive samples for each object from a cross-shaped region, thus providing sufficient and balanced positive samples for training. Furthermore, to address the challenge of accurately regressing objects with varying scales, we put forth a rotation-weighted Intersection over Union (RWIoU) metric to replace the widely used L1 metric in regression loss.

    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed the success of generative adversarial networks and diffusion models in multi-model trajectory prediction. However, prevailing algorithms only explicitly consider human interaction, but ignore the modeling of human intention, yielding that the generated results deviate largely from real trajectories in some complex scenes. In this paper, we analyze the conditions of multi-modal trajectory prediction from two objective perspectives and propose a novel end-to-end framework based on the diffusion model to predict more precise and socially-acceptable trajectories for humans. Firstly, a spatial-temporal aggregation module is built to extract the extrinsic interaction features for capturing socially-acceptable behaviors. Secondly, we explicitly construct the intrinsic intention module to obtain intention features for precise prediction. Finally, we estimate a noise trajectory distribution with these two features as the initiation of diffusion model and leverage denoising process to obtain the final trajectories. Furthermore, to reduce the noise of the initiative trajectory estimation, we present a novel sample consistency loss to constrain multiple predictions.

Whereas, existing works essentially directly optimize the single-level objective w.r.t. the surrogate model, which always leads to poor interpretability of attack mechanism and limited generalization performance over unknown victim models. In this work, we propose the BilEvel Transfer AttacK (BETAK) framework by establishing an initialization derived bilevel optimization paradigm, which explicitly reformulates the nested constraint relationship between the Upper-Level (UL) pseudo-victim attacker and the Lower-Level (LL) surrogate attacker. Algorithmically, we introduce the Hyper Gradient Response (HGR) estimation as an effective feedback for the transferability over pseudo-victim attackers, and propose the Dynamic Sequence Truncation (DST) technique to dynamically adjust the back-propagation path for HGR and reduce computational overhead simultaneously. Meanwhile, we conduct detailed algorithmic analysis and provide convergence guarantee to support non-convexity of the LL surrogate attacker. Extensive evaluations demonstrate substantial improvement of BETAK (e.g., 53.41% increase of attack success rates against IncRes-v2_ens victim) against different victims and defense methods in targeted and untargeted attack scenarios",

Existing methods focus on learning invariance across domains to enhance model robustness, and data augmentation has been widely used to learn invariant predictors, with most methods performing augmentation in the input space.

Nonetheless, feature semantics is seldom considered and existing feature augmentation methods suffer from a limited variety of augmented features. We decompose features into class-generic, class-specific, domain-generic, and domain-specific components. We propose a cross-domain feature augmentation method named XDomainMix that enables us to increase sample diversity while emphasizing the learning of invariant representations to achieve domain generalization. Experiments on widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance.

With the improving capabilities of open-source LVLMs, researchers have increasingly turned to generate VLIT data by using open-source LVLMs and achieved significant progress. However, such data generation approaches are bottlenecked by the following challenges: 1) Since multi-modal models tend to be influenced by prior language knowledge, directly using LVLMs to generate VLIT data would inevitably lead to low content relevance between generated data and images. 2) To improve the ability of the models to generate VLIT data, previous methods have incorporated an additional training phase to boost the generative capacity. This process hurts the generalization of the models to unseen inputs (i.e., \"exposure bias\" problem). In this paper, we propose a new Content Correlated VLIT data generation via Contrastive Learning (C3L). Specifically, we design a new content relevance module which enhances the content relevance between VLIT data and images by computing Image Instruction Correspondence Scores S(I2C). Moreover, a contrastive learning module is introduced to further boost the VLIT data generation capability of the LVLMs. A large number of automatic measures on four benchmarks show the effectiveness of our method",

Brain network analysis is one of the essential tools for exploring brain mechanisms from MRI, providing valuable insights into the brain's organization, and stimulating the understanding of brain cognition and pathology of neurodegenerative diseases. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are commonly used for brain network analysis, but they are limited by the scarcity of medical data. Although Graph Contrastive Learning methods have been developed to address this, they often involve graph augmentations that distort the anatomical brain structures. To address these challenges, an augmentation-free contrastive learning method, named Self-Promoted Clustering-based Contrastive Learning(SPCCL), is proposed in this paper. Specifically, by introducing a clustering-based contrastive Learning loss and a self-promoted contrastive pairs creation scheme, the proposed SPCCL can be pre-trained from additional healthy subjects' data that are relatively easier to acquire than disorder ones. The proposed SPCCL leverages these additional data with respect to the integrity of the original brain structure, making it a promising approach for effective brain network analysis.

    "abstract": "Text-driven 3D indoor scene generation holds broad applications, ranging from gaming and smart homes to AR/VR applications. Fast and high-fidelity scene generation is paramount for ensuring user-friendly experiences. However, existing methods are characterized by lengthy generation processes or necessitate the intricate manual specification of motion parameters, which introduces inconvenience for users. Furthermore, these methods often rely on narrow-field viewpoint iterative generations, compromising global consistency and overall scene quality. To address these issues, we propose FastScene, a framework for fast and higher-quality 3D scene generation, while maintaining the scene consistency. Specifically, given a text prompt, we generate a panorama and estimate its depth, since the panorama encompasses information about the entire scene and exhibits explicit geometric constraints. To obtain high-quality novel views, we introduce the Coarse View Synthesis (CVS) and Progressive Novel View Inpainting (PNVI) strategies, ensuring both scene consistency and view quality. Subsequently, we utilize Multi-View Projection (MVP) to form perspective views, and apply 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for scene reconstruction. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate FastScene surpasses other methods in both generation speed and quality with better scene consistency. Notably, guided only by a text prompt, FastScene can generate a 3D scene within a mere 15 minutes, which is at least one hour faster than state-of-the-art methods, making it a paradigm for user-friendly scene generation",

The \"split-and-merge\" paradigm is a pivotal approach to parse table structure, where the table separation line detection is crucial.

In this paper, we adhere to the \"split-and-merge\" paradigm and propose SEMv3 (SEM: Split, Embed and Merge), a method that is both fast and robust for detecting table separation lines.

Moreover, in the merge stage, we define a series of merge actions to efficiently describe the table structure based on table grids. Extensive ablation studies demonstrate that our proposed KOR module can detect table separation lines quickly and accurately.

    "abstract": "Accurate and timely mapping of flood extent from high resolution satellite imagery plays a crucial role in disaster management such as damage assessment and relief activities. However, current state-of-the-art solutions are based on U-Net, which cannot segment the flood pixels accurately due to the ambiguous pixels (e.g., tree canopies, clouds) that prevent a direct judgement from only the spectral features. Thanks to the digital elevation model (DEM) data readily available from sources such as United States Geological Survey (USGS), this work explores the use of an elevation map to improve flood extent mapping. We propose, EvaNet, an elevation-guided segmentation model based on the encoder-decoder architecture with two novel techniques: (1) a loss function encoding the physical law of gravity that if a location is flooded (resp. dry), then its adjacent locations with a lower (resp. higher) elevation must also be flooded (resp. dry); (2) a new (de)convolution operation that integrates the elevation map by a location-sensitive gating mechanism to regulate how much spectral features flow through adjacent layers. Extensive experiments show that EvaNet significantly outperforms the U-Net baselines, and works as a perfect drop-in replacement for U-Net in existing solutions to flood extent mapping.

CTMIH addresses the problem by training on transformed and masked images, aiming to learn transform-invariant hash code in an unsupervised manner to mitigate performance degradation caused by image deterioration. CTMIH utilizes Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture applied to image patches to capture distant semantic relevance. CTMIH introduces cross-view debiased contrastive loss to align hash tokens from augmented views of the same image and presents semantic mask reconstruction loss at the patch level to recover masked patch tokens.

    "abstract": "Unsupervised domain adaptive object detection (DAOD) aims to adapt detectors from a labeled source domain to an unlabelled target domain. Existing DAOD works learn feature representations with both class discriminative and domain invariant by jointly minimizing the loss across domain alignment and detection tasks. However, joint resolution of different tasks may lead to conflicts, with one contributing factor being gradient conflicts during optimization. If left untouched, such disagreement may degrade adaptation performance. In this work, we propose an efficient optimization strategy named Conflict-Alleviated Gradient descent (CAGrad) which aims to alleviate the conflict between two tasks (i.e., alignment and classification). Particularly, we alter the gradients by projecting each onto the normal plane of the other. The projection operation changes conflicting gradients from obtuse angles to acute angles, thus alleviating the conflict and achieving gradient harmonization. We further validate our theoretical analysis and methods on several domain adaptive object detection tasks, including cross-camera, weather, scene, and synthetic to real-world adaptation. Extensive experiments on multiple DAOD benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our CAGrad",

    "title": "Motion-Aware Heatmap Regression for Human Pose Estimation in Videos",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We present an approach to solving 2D human pose estimation in videos. The problem of human pose estimation in videos differs from estimating human poses in static images since videos contain a lot of motion related information. Thus, we investigate how to utilize by the information of the human body movements across in a sequence of video frames for estimating human poses in videos. To do this, we introduce a novel heatmap regression method what we call motion-aware heatmap regression. Our approach computes motion vectors in joint keypoints from adjacent frames. We then design a new style of heatmap that we call Motion-Aware Heatmaps to reflect the motion uncertainty of each joint point. Unlike traditional heatmaps, our motion-aware heatmaps not only consider the current joint locations but also account how joints move over time. Furthermore, we introduce a simple yet effective framework designed to incorporate motion information into heatmap regression. We evaluate our motion-aware heatmap regression on PoseTrack(2018, 21) and Sub-JHMDB datasets. Our results validate that the proposed motion-aware heatmaps significantly improve the precision of human pose estimation in videos, particularly in challenging scenarios such as videos like sports game footage with substantial human motions.

    "title": "Learning a Spiking Neural Network for Efficient Image Deraining",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recently, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have demonstrated substantial potential in computer vision tasks. In this paper, we present an Efficient Spiking Deraining Network, called ESDNet. Our work is motivated by the observation that rain pixel values will lead to a more pronounced intensity of spike signals in SNNs. However, directly applying deep SNNs to image deraining task still remains a significant challenge. This is attributed to the information loss and training difficulties that arise from discrete binary activation and complex spatiotemporal dynamics. To this end, we develop a spiking residual block to convert the input into spike signals, then adaptively optimize the membrane potential by introducing attention weights to adjust spike responses in a data-driven manner, alleviating information loss caused by discrete binary activation. By this way, our ESDNet can effectively detect and analyze the characteristics of rain streaks by learning their fluctuations. This also enables better guidance for the deraining process and facilitates high-quality image reconstruction. Instead of relying on the ANN-SNN conversion strategy, we introduce a gradient proxy strategy to directly train the model for overcoming the challenge of training. Experimental results show that our approach gains comparable performance against ANN-based methods while reducing energy consumption by 54%.

However, limited by the representational capability of these priors, existing approaches often struggle to capture diverse target structure morphologies. To address this, we propose SPGNet to guide segmentation by fully exploiting category-specific shape knowledge. The key idea is to enable the network to perceive data shape distributions by learning from statistical shape models. We uncover shape relationships via clustering and obtain statistical prior knowledge using principal component analysis. Our dual-path network comprises a segmentation path and a shape-prior path that collaboratively discern and harness shape prior distribution to improve segmentation robustness. The shape-prior path further serves to refine shapes iteratively by cropping features from the segmentation path, guiding the segmentation path and directing attention specifically to the edges of shapes which could be most significantly susceptible to segmentation error.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Multi-modal 3D object detectors are dedicated to exploring secure and reliable perception systems for autonomous driving (AD). Although achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on clean benchmark datasets, they tend to overlook the complexity and harsh conditions of real-world environments. With the emergence of visual foundation models (VFMs), opportunities and challenges are presented for improving the robustness and generalization of multi-modal 3D object detection in AD. Therefore, we propose RoboFusion, a robust framework that leverages VFMs like SAM to tackle out-of-distribution (OOD) noise scenarios. We first adapt the original SAM for AD scenarios named SAM-AD. To align SAM or SAM-AD with multi-modal methods, we then introduce AD-FPN for upsampling the image features extracted by SAM. We employ wavelet decomposition to denoise the depth-guided images for further noise reduction and weather interference. At last, we employ self-attention mechanisms to adaptively reweight the fused features, enhancing informative features while suppressing excess noise. In summary, RoboFusion significantly reduces noise by leveraging the generalization and robustness of VFMs, thereby enhancing the resilience of multi-modal 3D object detection. Consequently, RoboFusion achieves SOTA performance in noisy scenarios, as demonstrated by the KITTI-C and nuScenes-C benchmarks. Code is available at https://github.com/adept-thu/RoboFusion",

Existing convolution neural network (CNN) based methods tend to focus on discriminative regions of objects, while transformer-based methods overemphasize deep global features powerful for classification and lack the capability to perceive object details, leading to prediction results far from the object boundary. In this paper, we propose a novel Consistency and Integration Model with Adaptive Thresholds (CIAT) that exploits the spatial-semantic consistency between shallow and deep features to activate more object regions and detects the object regions adaptively in different images. First, we introduce a simple plug-and-play consistency and integration module of shallow-deep features (CISD), which utilizes shallow features efficiently to enhance the entire object perception. Then, we design an online adaptive threshold (OAT) based on Bayesian decision theory, which computes a reasonable segmentation threshold adaptive for the localization map of each image, making the predicted bounding box closer to the ground truth.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recent generative methods have shown promising blind face restoration performance. They usually project the degraded images to the latent space and then decode high-quality faces either by single-stage latent optimization or directly from the encoding. Generating fine-grained facial details faithful to inputs remains challenging. Most existing methods produce either overly smooth outputs or alter the identity. This could be attributed to the typical trade-off between quality and resolution in the latent space. If the latent is highly compressed, the decoded output is more robust to degradations but shows worse fidelity. On the other hand, a more flexible latent space can capture intricate details better, but is extremely difficult to optimize for highly degraded faces. We introduce a diffusion-based-prior inside a VQGAN architecture that focuses on learning the distribution over uncorrupted latent embeddings. We iteratively recover the clean embedding conditioning on the degraded counterpart. Furthermore, to ensure the reverse diffusion trajectory does not deviate from the underlying identity, we train a separate Identity Recovery Network and use its output to constrain the reverse diffusion. Specifically, using a learnable latent mask, we add gradients from a face-recognition network to a subset of latent features that correlates with the finer identity-related details in the pixel space, leaving the other features untouched. Disentanglement between perception and fidelity in the latent space allows us to achieve the best of both worlds.

    "abstract": "Few-Shot Class Incremental Learning (FSCIL) aims to continually learn new classes with few training samples without forgetting already learned old classes. Existing FSCIL methods generally fix the backbone network in incremental sessions to achieve a balance between suppressing forgetting old classes and learning new classes. However, the fixed backbone network causes insufficient learning of new classes from a few samples. Benefiting from the powerful visual and textual understanding ability of Vision-Language (VL) pre-training models, we propose a Fine-grained Feature Mining Prompt Learning (FineFMPL) approach to adapt the VL model to FSCIL, which comprehensively learns and memorizes fine-grained discriminative information of emerging classes. Concretely, the visual probe prompt is firstly proposed to guide the image encoder of VL model to extract global-level coarse-grained features and object-level fine-grained features, and visual prototypes are preserved based on image patch significance, which contains the discriminative characteristics exclusive to the class. Secondly, the textual context prompt is constructed by cross-modal mapping of visual prototypes, feeding into the text encoder of VL model to memorize the class information as textual prototypes. Finally, integrating visual and textual prototypes based on fine-grained feature mining into the model improves the recognition performance of all classes in FSCIL.

Specifically, we introduce a Brightness Adaptive Gate (BAG) module, which is designed to dynamically select features from brightness-related channels for normalization, while preserving brightness-independent structural information within the source images. Furthermore, we propose a brightness consistency loss function to optimize the BAG module. The entire framework is tuned via alternating training strategies.

To address above issues, we propose a multi-granularity graph convolution framework to jointly optimize the aligned task features, as well as to assist the pseudo label estimation. Specifically, the multi-granularity feature alignment module (MFA) in the designed two-branch framework, employs cluster-level bi-directional interaction of various granularity information to narrow down the large feature gap. Further, upon the MFA module, we introduce the multi-granularity graph-convolution-based pseudo-label estimation module, to enhance feature representations for distinguishing diverse identities.

    "abstract": "The rise of online shopping and social media has spurred the Video-to-Shop Retrieval (VSR) task, which involves identifying fashion items (e.g., clothing) in videos and matching them with identical products provided by stores. In real-world scenarios, human movement in dynamic video scenes can cause substantial morphological alterations of fashion items with aspects of occlusion, shifting viewpoints (parallax), and partial visibility (truncation). This results in those high-quality frames being overwhelmed by a vast of redundant ones, which makes the retrieval less effectiveness. To this end, this paper introduces a framework, named Self-supervised Fashion-aware CLIP (SF-CLIP), for effective VSR. The SF-CLIP enables the discovery of salient frames with high fashion expressiveness via generating pseudo-labels from three key aspects of fashion expressiveness to assess occlusion, parallax, and truncation. With such pseudo-labels, the ability of CLIP is expanded to facilitate the discovery of salient frames. Furthermore, to encompass the comprehensive representations among salient frames, a dual-branch graph-based fusion module is proposed to extract and integrate inter-frame features.

However, such a two-stage procedure will lead to a task-based information gap that decreases the performance, because the region features in the detection task are suboptimal representations and cannot provide all the necessary information for subsequent captions generation. Besides, the region features are usually represented from the last layer of the detectors that lose the local details of images. In this paper, we propose a novel One-Stage Image Captioner (OSIC) with dynamic multi-sight learning, which directly transforms the images into descriptive sentences in one stage for eliminating the information gap. Specifically, to obtain rich features, multi-level features are captured by Swin Transformer, and then fed into a novel dynamic multi-sight embedding module to exploit both the global structure and local texture of input images. To enhance the global modeling capacity of the visual encoder, we propose a new dual-dimensional refining to non-locally model the features interaction.

However, most existing methods do not consider this property into neural networks for image deraining, thus affecting recovery performance. Motivated by this property, we find that there exists significant patch recurrence property of a rainy image, that is, similar patches tend to recur many times in one image and its multi-scale images and external images. To better model this property for image detaining, we develop a multi-scale graph network with exemplars, called MSGNN, that contains two branches: 1) internal data-based supervised branch is used to model the internal relations of similar patches from the rainy image itself and its multi-scale images and 2) external data-participated unsupervised branch is used to model the external relations of the similar patches in the rainy image and exemplar. Specifically, we construct a graph model by searching the k-nearest neighboring patches from both the rainy images in a multi-scale framework and the exemplar. After obtaining the corresponding k neighboring patches from the multi-scale images and exemplar, we build a graph and aggregate them in an attentional manner so that the graph can provide more information from similar patches for image deraining. We embed the proposed graph in a deep neural network and train it in an end-to-end manner.

    "abstract": "Neural implicit surfaces with signed distance functions (SDFs) achieve superior quality in 3D geometry reconstruction. However, training SDFs is time-consuming because it requires a great number of samples to calculate accurate weight distributions and a considerable amount of samples sampled from the distribution for integrating the rendering results. Some existing sampling strategies focus on this problem. During the training, they assume a spatially-consistent convergence speed of kernel size, thus still suffering from low convergence or errors. Instead, we introduce an error-aware sampling method based on thin intervals of valid weight distributions, dubbed adaptive shells, to reduce the number of samples while still maintaining the reconstruction accuracy. To this end, we first extend Laplace-based neural implicit surfaces with learned spatially-varying kernel sizes which indicates the range of valid weight distributions. Then, the adaptive shell for each ray is determined by an efficient double-clipping strategy with spatially-varying SDF values and kernel sizes, fitting larger kernel sizes to wider shells. Finally, we calculate the error-bounded cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of shells to conduct efficient importance sampling, achieving low-variance rendering with fewer calculations. Extensive results in various scenes demonstrate the superiority of our sampling technique, including significantly reducing sample counts and training time, even improving the reconstruction quality.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Despite the impressive success in visual control challenges, Visual Reinforcement Learning (VRL) policies have struggled to generalize to other scenarios. Existing works attempt to empirically improve the generalization capability, lacking theoretical support. In this work, we explore how to learn domain-invariant representations for VRL from an information-theoretical perspective. Specifically, we identify three Mutual Information (MI) terms. These terms highlight that a robust representation should preserve domain invariant information (return and dynamic transition) under significant observation perturbation. Furthermore, we relax the MI terms to derive three components for implementing a practical Mutual Information-based Invariant Representation (MIIR) algorithm for VRL. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MIIR achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance and the best sample efficiency in the DeepMind Control suite, Robotic Manipulation, and Carla",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Semantic scene completion aims to infer the 3D geometric structures with semantic classes from camera or LiDAR, which provide essential occupancy information in autonomous driving. Prior endeavors concentrate on constructing the network or benchmark in a fully supervised manner. While the dense occupancy grids need point-wise semantic annotations, which incur expensive and tedious labeling costs. In this paper, we build a new label-efficient benchmark, named ScribbleSC, where the sparse scribble-based semantic labels are combined with dense geometric labels for semantic scene completion. In particular, we propose a simple yet effective approach called Scribble2Scene, which bridges the gap between the sparse scribble annotations and fully-supervision. Our method consists of geometric-aware auto-labelers construction and online model training with an offline-to-online distillation module to enhance the performance. Experiments on SemanticKITTI demonstrate that Scribble2Scene achieves competitive performance against the fully-supervised counterparts, showing 99% performance of the fully-supervised models with only 13.5% voxels labeled.

In this paper, we introduce optimal graph learning to generate a cross-domain graph that effectively connects the two domains, and two domain-specific graphs to capture domain-specific structures. On the one hand, we incorporate the three graphs into the label propagation (LP) classifier to enhance its robustness to distribution difference. On the other hand, we leverage the three graphs to introduce graph embedding losses, promoting the learning of locally discriminative and domain-invariant features. Furthermore, we maximize the nuclear norm of predictions in LP to enhance class diversity, thereby improving its robustness to class imbalance problem. Correspondingly, we develop an efficient algorithm to solve the associated optimization problem.

    "abstract": "The success of contrastive learning models like CLIP, known for aligning 2D image-text pairs, has inspired the development of triplet alignment for Large 3D Point Cloud Models (3D-PCM). Examples like ULIP integrate images, text, and point clouds into a unified semantic space. However, despite showing impressive zero-shot capabilities, frozen 3D-PCM still falls short compared to fine-tuned methods, especially when downstream 3D datasets are significantly different from upstream data. Addressing this, we propose a Data-Efficient, Training-Free 3D Adaptation method named PointTFA that adjusts ULIP outputs with representative samples. PointTFA comprises the Representative Memory Cache (RMC) for selecting a representative support set, Cloud Query Refactor (CQR) for reconstructing a query cloud using the support set, and Training-Free 3D Adapter (3D-TFA) for inferring query categories from the support set. A key advantage of PointTFA is that it introduces no extra training parameters, yet outperforms vanilla frozen ULIP, closely approaching few-shot fine-tuning training methods in downstream cloud classification tasks like ModelNet10 & 40 and ScanObjectNN.

However, DETR suffers from unstable training dynamics. It consumes more data and epochs to converge compared with CNN-based detectors. This paper aims to stabilize DETR training through the online distillation. It utilizes a teacher model, accumulated by Exponential Moving Average (EMA), and distills its knowledge into the online model in following three aspects. First, the matching relation between object queries and ground truth (GT) boxes in the teacher is employed to guide the student, so queries within the student are not only assigned labels based on their own predictions, but also refer to the matching results from the teacher. Second, the teacher's initial query is given to the online student, and its prediction is directly constrained by the corresponding output from the teacher. Finally, the object queries from teacher's different decoding stages are used to build the auxiliary groups to accelerate the convergence. For each GT, two queries with the least matching costs are selected into this extra group, and they predict the GT box and participate the optimization. Extensive experiments show that the proposed OD-DETR successfully stabilizes the training, and significantly increases the performance without bringing in more parameters",

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of user-adaptive 3D gaze estimation. The performance of person-independent gaze estimation is limited due to interpersonal anatomical differences. Our goal is to provide a personalized gaze estimation model specifically adapted to a target user. Previous work on user-adaptive gaze estimation requires some labeled images of the target person data to fine-tune the model at test time. However, this can be unrealistic in real-world applications, since it is cumbersome for an end-user to provide labeled images. In addition, previous work requires the training data to have both gaze labels and person IDs. This data requirement makes it infeasible to use some of the available data. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a new problem called efficient label-free user adaptation in gaze estimation. Our model only needs a few unlabeled images of a target user for the model adaptation. During offline training, we have some labeled source data without person IDs and some unlabeled person-specific data. Our proposed method uses a meta-learning approach to learn how to adapt to a new user with only a few unlabeled images. Our key technical innovation is to use a generalization bound from domain adaptation to define the loss function in meta-learning, so that our method can effectively make use of both the labeled source data and the unlabeled person-specific data during training.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Open-World Object Detection (OWOD) has garnered widespread attention due to its ability to recall unannotated objects. Existing works generate pseudo-labels for the model using heuristic priors, which limits the model's performance. In this paper, we leverage the knowledge of the large-scale visual model to provide supervision for unknown categories. Specifically, we use the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to generate raw pseudo-labels for potential objects and refine them through Intersection over Union (IOU) and the shortest bounding box side length. Nevertheless, the abundance of pseudo-labels still exacerbates the competition issue in the one-to-many label assignment. To address this, we propose the Dual Matching Label Assignment (DMLA) strategy. Furthermore, we propose the Class-Awareness Neutralizer (CAN) to reduce the model's bias towards known categories. Evaluation results on open-world object detection benchmarks, including MS COCO and Pascal VOC, show that our method achieves nearly 200% the unknown recall rate of previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, reaching 41.5 U-Recall. Additionally, our approach does not add any extra parameters, maintaining the inference speed advantage of Faster R-CNN, leading the SOTA methods based on deformable DETR at a speed of over 10 FPS.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Most existing RGB-T tracking networks extract modality features in a separate manner, which lacks interaction and mutual guidance between modalities. This limits the network's ability to adapt to the diverse dual-modality appearances of targets and the dynamic relationships between the modalities. Additionally, the three-stage fusion tracking paradigm followed by these networks significantly restricts the tracking speed. To overcome these problems, we propose a unified single-stage Transformer RGB-T tracking network, namely USTrack, which unifies the above three stages into a single ViT (Vision Transformer) backbone through joint feature extraction, fusion and relation modeling. With this structure, the network can not only extract the fusion features of templates and search regions under the interaction of modalities, but also significantly improve tracking speed through the single-stage fusion tracking paradigm. Furthermore, we introduce a novel feature selection mechanism based on modality reliability to mitigate the influence of invalid modalities for final prediction.

In this work, we design a novel Dual Enhancement Network (DENet) to comprehensively tackle different kinds of scene discrepancies in a coherent and synergistic framework. The proposed DENet enjoys several merits. First, we design a mutual aggregation module to reconcile the intrinsic tension between the support prototypes and query point features, and the intra-semantic diversity is diminished in a bidirectional manner.

    "title": "Beyond Alignment: Blind Video Face Restoration via Parsing-Guided Temporal-Coherent Transformer",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Multiple complex degradations are coupled in low-quality video faces in the real world. Therefore, blind video face restoration is a highly challenging ill-posed problem, requiring not only hallucinating high-fidelity details but also enhancing temporal coherence across diverse pose variations. Restoring each frame independently in a naive manner inevitably introduces temporal incoherence and artifacts from pose changes and keypoint localization errors. To address this, we propose the first blind video face restoration approach with a novel parsing-guided temporal-coherent transformer (PGTFormer) without pre-alignment. PGTFormer leverages semantic parsing guidance to select optimal face priors for generating temporally coherent artifact-free results. Specifically, we pre-train a temporal-spatial vector quantized auto-encoder on high-quality video face datasets to extract expressive context-rich priors. Then, the temporal parse-guided codebook predictor (TPCP) restores faces in different poses based on face parsing context cues without performing face pre-alignment. This strategy reduces artifacts and mitigates jitter caused by cumulative errors from face pre-alignment. Finally, the temporal fidelity regulator (TFR) enhances fidelity through temporal feature interaction and improves video temporal consistency. Extensive experiments on face videos show that our method outperforms previous face restoration baselines. The code will be released on https://github.com/kepengxu/PGTFormer",

Existing methods compute the similarity between the query image and exemplars in the 2D spatial domain and perform regression to obtain the counting number.

To address this issue, we propose a network learning Spatial Similarity Distribution (SSD) for few-shot object counting, which preserves the spatial structure of exemplar features and calculates a 4D similarity pyramid point-to-point between the query features and exemplar features, capturing the complete distribution information for each point in the 4D similarity space.

    "abstract": "Prototypical part network (ProtoPNet) and its variants have drawn wide attention and been applied to various tasks due to their inherent self-explanatory property. Previous ProtoPNets are primarily built upon convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Therefore, it is natural to investigate whether these explainable methods can be advantageous for the recently emerged Vision Transformers (ViTs). However, directly utilizing ViT-backed models as backbones can lead to prototypes paying excessive attention to background positions rather than foreground objects (i.e., the \"distraction\" problem). To address the problem, this paper proposes prototypical part Transformer (ProtoPFormer) for interpretable image recognition. Based the architectural characteristics of ViTs, we modify the original ProtoPNet by creating separate global and local branches, each accompanied by corresponding prototypes that can capture and highlight representative holistic and partial features. Specifically, the global prototypes can guide local prototypes to concentrate on the foreground and effectively suppress the background influence. Subsequently, local prototypes are explicitly supervised to concentrate on different discriminative visual parts. Finally, the two branches mutually correct each other and jointly make the final decisions. Moreover, extensive experiments demonstrate that ProtoPFormer can consistently achieve superior performance on accuracy, visualization results, and quantitative interpretability evaluation over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines.

Inspired by recent Test-time Prompt Tuning (TPT) on the image domain, this work attempts to extend TPT to video data for zero-shot activity recognition. However, monotonous spatial augmentation and short class names cannot meet the need to capture diverse and complicated semantics of human behavior during prompt tuning. To this end, this work proposes a Dual Temporal-Sync Test-time Prompt Tuning (DTS-TPT) framework for zero-shot activity recognition. DTS-TPT tunes the learnable prompts appended to text inputs on video feature sequences of different temporal scales in multiple steps during test time. In each tuning step, we minimize the semantic consistency among the predictions from video feature sequences randomly augmented via AugMix with both original class names and the corresponding description generated through LLM.

    "title": "Reschedule Diffusion-based Bokeh Rendering",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Bokeh rendering for images shot with small apertures has drawn much attention in practice. Very recently people start to explore diffusion models for bokeh rendering, aiming to leverage the models' surging power of image generation. However, we can clearly observe two big issues with the images rendered by diffusion models: large fluctuation and severe color deviation. To address these issues, we propose in this paper a prior-aware sampling approach, which can adaptively control the noise scale through learned priors, and a prior-aware noise scheduling strategy, which can greatly reduce the number of inference steps without sacrificing performance. Extensive experiments show that our method can effectively alleviate the fluctuation problem of sampling results while ensuring similar color styles to the input image. In addition, our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, sometimes even with only two steps of sampling.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "3D Vision-Language Pre-training (3D-VLP) aims to provide a pre-train model which can bridge 3D scenes with natural language, which is an important technique for embodied intelligence. However, current 3D-VLP datasets are hindered by limited scene-level diversity and insufficient fine-grained annotations (only 1.2K scenes and 280K textual annotations in ScanScribe), primarily due to the labor-intensive of collecting and annotating 3D scenes. To overcome these obstacles, we construct SynVL3D, a comprehensive synthetic scene-text corpus with 10K indoor scenes and 1M descriptions at object, view, and room levels, which has the advantages of diverse scene data, rich textual descriptions, multi-grained 3D-text associations, and low collection cost. Utilizing the rich annotations in SynVL3D, we pre-train a simple and unified Transformer for aligning 3D and language with multi-grained pretraining tasks. Moreover, we propose a synthetic-to-real domain adaptation in downstream task fine-tuning process to address the domain shift. Through extensive experiments, we verify the effectiveness of our model design by achieving state-of-the-art performance on downstream tasks including visual grounding, dense captioning, and question answering.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Nighttime self-supervised monocular depth estimation has received increasing attention in recent years. However, using night images for self-supervision is unreliable because the photometric consistency assumption is usually violated in the videos taken under complex lighting conditions. Even with domain adaptation or photometric loss repair, performance is still limited by the poor supervision of night images on trainable networks. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised nighttime monocular depth estimation method that does not use any night images during training. Our framework utilizes day images as a stable source for self-supervision and applies physical priors (e.g., wave optics, reflection model and read-shot noise model) to compensate for some key day-night differences. With day-to-night data distribution compensation, our framework can be trained in an efficient one-stage self-supervised manner. Though no nighttime images are considered during training, qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that our method achieves SoTA depth estimating results on the challenging nuScenes-Night and RobotCar-Night compared with existing methods",

    "abstract": "The joint classification of multisource remote sensing data is a prominent research field. However, most of the existing works are tailored for two specific data sources, which fail to effectively address the diverse combinations of data sources in practical applications. The importance of designing a unified network with applicability has been disregarded. In this paper, we propose a unified and self-supervised Symbiotic Diffusion framework (named SymDiffuser), which achieves the joint classification of any pair of different remote sensing data sources in a single model. The SymDiffuser captures the inter-modal relationship through establishing reciprocal conditional distributions across diverse sources step by step. The fusion process of multisource data is consistently represented within the framework from a data distribution perspective. Subsequently, features under the current conditional distribution at each time step is integrated during the downstream phase to accomplish the classification task. Such joint classification methodology transcends source-specific considerations, rendering it applicable to remote sensing data from any diverse sources.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Traditional image steganography focuses on concealing one image within another, aiming to avoid steganalysis by unauthorized entities. Coverless image steganography (CIS) enhances imperceptibility by not using any cover image. Recent works have utilized text prompts as keys in CIS through diffusion models. However, this approach faces three challenges: invalidated when private prompt is guessed, crafting public prompts for semantic diversity, and the risk of prompt leakage during frequent transmission. To address these issues, we propose DiffStega, an innovative training-free diffusion-based CIS strategy for universal application. DiffStega uses a password-dependent reference image as an image prompt alongside the text, ensuring that only authorized parties can retrieve the hidden information. Furthermore, we develop Noise Flip technique to further secure the steganography against unauthorized decryption. To comprehensively assess our method across general CIS tasks, we create a dataset comprising various image steganography instances. Experiments indicate substantial improvements in our method over existing ones, particularly in aspects of versatility, password sensitivity, and recovery quality.

    "abstract": "Recently, heatmap regression methods based on 1D landmark representations have shown prominent performance on locating facial landmarks. However, previous methods ignored to make deep explorations on the good potentials of 1D landmark representations for sequential and structural modeling of multiple landmarks to track facial landmarks. To address this limitation, we propose a Transformer architecture, namely 1DFormer, which learns informative 1D landmark representations by capturing the dynamic and the geometric patterns of landmarks via token communications in both temporal and spatial dimensions for facial landmark tracking. For temporal modeling, we propose a confidence-enhanced multi-head attention mechanism with a recurrently token mixing strategy to adaptively and robustly embed long-term landmark dynamics into their 1D representations; for structure modeling, we design intra-group and inter-group geometric encoding mechanisms to encode the component-level as well as global-level facial structure patterns as a refinement for the 1D representations of landmarks through token communications in the spatial dimension via 1D convolutional layers. Experimental results on the 300VW and the TF databases show that 1DFormer successfully models the long-range sequential patterns as well as the inherent facial structures to learn informative 1D representations of landmark sequences, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on facial landmark tracking.

    "abstract": "As Artificial Intelligence evolves, the neural models vulnerable to adversarial attacks may produce fatal results in critical applications. This paper mainly discusses the robustness of the compressed neural models facing adversarial attacks. A few studies discuss the interaction between model compression and adversarial attack. However, they focus on the robustness against the traditional attacks designed for the dense models, not the attacks intended explicitly for the compressed models, using sparsity and quantization techniques. Compressed models often have fewer parameters and smaller sizes that are more friendly to resource-limited devices than dense models, so they are widely deployed in various edge and mobile devices. However, introducing the sparsity and quantization into neural models further imposes higher attack risks. A specific adversarial attack method (Spear) is proposed to generate the particular adversarial attack samples for evaluating the robustness of the compressed models. The Spear attack finds minimal perturbations to create the attack samples to maximize the different behaviors between the compressed and dense reference models. We demonstrate the proposed Spear attack technique can generally be applied to various networks and tasks through quantitative and ablation experiments",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Pathological slides are commonly gigapixel images with abundant information and are therefore significant for clinical diagnosis. However, the ultra-large size makes both training and evaluation extremely time-consuming. Most existing methods need to crop the slide into patches, which also leads to large memory requirements. In this paper, we propose the Self-reform Multilayer Transformer (SMT) to accelerate the pathological image diagnosis and prognosis. Inspired by the pathologists' diagnostic procedure, SMT is designed to achieve layer-by-layer focus on critical regions. In the forward process, the first layer takes thumbnails as inputs and measures the significance of each patch that deserves focusing. Images from focused regions are cropped with a higher magnification and used as the input of the next layer. By analogy, the third layer inputs are focused images of second layer, which contain abundant cellular features. In addition to the forward focusing, the backward reform strategy is proposed to improve the precision of former layers. This cyclic process achieves iterative interactions for better performance on both classification and focusing. In this way, only a small part of critical patches are required in SMT for diagnosis and prognosis. Sufficient experiments demonstrate that SMT achieves hundreds times faster speed, while achieving comparable accuracy and less storage compared with existing SOTA methods",

However, current methods mainly focus on specific tasks such as RGB and RGB-D, neglecting the potential for task migration. In this paper, we propose a unified USOD framework for generic USOD tasks. Firstly, we propose a Progressive Curriculum Learning-based Saliency Distilling (PCL-SD) mechanism to extract saliency cues from a pre-trained deep network. This mechanism starts with easy samples and progressively moves towards harder ones, to avoid initial interference caused by hard samples. Afterwards, the obtained saliency cues are utilized to train a saliency detector, and we employ a Self-rectify Pseudo-label Refinement (SPR) mechanism to improve the quality of pseudo-labels. Finally, an adapter-tuning method is devised to transfer the acquired saliency knowledge, leveraging shared knowledge to attain superior transferring performance on the target tasks. Extensive experiments on five representative SOD tasks confirm the effectiveness and feasibility of our proposed method.

However, current methods lack the generation of detailed descriptive captions for the cultural elements depicted in the images, such as the traditional clothing worn by people from Asian cultural groups. In this paper, we propose a new framework, Culturally-aware Image Captioning (CIC), that generates captions and describes cultural elements extracted from cultural visual elements in images representing cultures. Inspired by methods combining visual modality and Large Language Models (LLMs) through appropriate prompts, our framework (1) generates questions based on cultural categories from images, (2) extracts cultural visual elements from Visual Question Answering (VQA) using generated questions, and (3) generates culturally-aware captions using LLMs with the prompts. Our human evaluation conducted on 45 participants from 4 different cultural groups with a high understanding of the corresponding culture shows that our proposed framework generates more culturally descriptive captions when compared to the image captioning baseline based on VLPs.

However, the initial language descriptions are often inaccurate in a highly time-varying video sequence and thus greatly deteriorate their tracking performance due to the low quality of extracted multi-modal features. To address this challenge, we propose a Diffusion Mask-Driven Visual-language Tracker (DMTrack) based on a diffusion model. Confronting the issue of low-quality multi-modal features due to inaccurate language descriptions, we leverage the diffusion model to capture high-quality semantic information from multi-modal features and transform it into target mask features. During the training phase, we further enhance the diffusion model's perception of pixel-level features by calculating the loss between the target mask features and the ground truth masks. Additionally, we perform joint localization of the target using both target mask features and visual features, instead of relying solely on multi-modal features for localization. Through extensive experiments on four tracking benchmarks (i.e., LaSOT, TNL2K, LaSOText, and OTB-Lang), we validate that our proposed Diffusion Mask-Driven Visual-language Tracker can improve the robustness and effectiveness of the model",

    "abstract": "Current text-to-image synthesis (TIS) models have demonstrated the ability to generate high-fidelity images based on textual prompts. However, the efficacy of these models heavily relies on the keywords present in the prompts, and there is a dearth of objective analysis regarding how different keywords impact the ultimate quality of generated results. Therefore, manual evaluation becomes necessary but limited and inefficient to ascertain the role played by keywords. In this paper, we propose automated keywords-ranking for prompts (AK4Prompts), a keyword evaluation model based on mainstream TIS models that explicitly quantifies the multidimensional impact of various keywords on image generation based on prompts. To enable personalized keyword evaluation based on prompt content, we propose decoupling the latent representations of keywords and prompts in TIS models, followed by integrating the semantic features of prompts into keywords. For quantitative and multidimensional evaluation, we align the fused features of keywords using HPSv2, aesthetic score, and CLIP score, each representing distinct factors contributing to keyword impact. Our AK4Prompts can flexibly and automatically select the keywords that best match the original prompt based on individual user preferences. Extensive experimental results show the superiority of AK4Prompts to improve the quality of generated images significantly over strong baselines.

This paper is dedicated to bridging this gap by introducing Detector Collapse (DC), a brand-new backdoor attack paradigm tailored for object detection. DC is designed to instantly incapacitate detectors (i.e., severely impairing detector's performance and culminating in a denial-of-service). To this end, we develop two innovative attack schemes: Sponge for triggering widespread misidentifications and Blinding for rendering objects invisible. Remarkably, we introduce a novel poisoning strategy exploiting natural objects, enabling DC to act as a practical backdoor in real-world environments.

To date, the state-of-the-art (SOTA) results are often yielded by optimization-oriented methods, but their inefficiency hinders their application to realistic datasets. On the other hand, the Distribution-Matching (DM) methods show remarkable efficiency but sub-optimal results compared to optimization-oriented methods. In this paper, we reveal the limitations of current DM-based methods from the inner-class and inter-class views, i.e., Persistent Training and Distribution Shift. To address these problems, we propose a new DM-based method named Dual-view distribution AligNment for dataset CondEnsation (DANCE), which exploits a few pre-trained models to improve DM from both inner-class and inter-class views. Specifically, from the inner-class view, we construct multiple ``mid encoders'' to perform pseudo long-term distribution alignment, making the condensed set a good proxy of the real one during the whole training process; while from the inter-class view, we use the expert models to perform distribution calibration, ensuring the synthetic data remains in the real class region during condensing. Experiments demonstrate the proposed method achieves a SOTA performance while maintaining comparable efficiency with the original DM across various scenarios.

Recently, many efforts have been made to image/video long-tailed learning. However, directly applying them to skeleton data can be sub-optimal due to the lack of consideration of the crucial spatial-temporal motion patterns, especially for some modality-specific methodologies such as data augmentation. To this end, considering the crucial role of the body parts in the spatially concentrated human actions, we attend to the mixing augmentations and propose a novel method, Shap-Mix, which improves long-tailed learning by mining representative motion patterns for tail categories. Specifically, we first develop an effective spatial-temporal mixing strategy for the skeleton to boost representation quality. Then, the employed saliency guidance method is presented, consisting of the saliency estimation based on Shapley value and a tail-aware mixing policy. It preserves the salient motion parts of minority classes in mixed data, explicitly establishing the relationships between crucial body structure cues and high-level semantics. Extensive experiments on three large-scale skeleton datasets show our remarkable performance improvement under both long-tailed and balanced settings.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Object trajectory prediction is a hot research issue with wide applications in video surveillance and autonomous driving. The previous studies consider the interaction sparsity mainly among the pedestrians instead of multi-type of objects, which brings new types of interactions and consequently superfluous ones. This paper proposes a Multi-type Object Trajectory Prediction (MOTP) method with a Sparse Multi-relational Graph Convolutional Network (SMGCN) and a novel multi-round Global Temporal Aggregation (GTA). MOTP introduces a novel adaptive sparsification and multi-scale division method to model interactions among multitype of objects. It further incorporates a Sparse Multi-relational Temporal Graph to capture the temporal division of multi-type trajectories, along with a multi-round Global Temporal Aggregation (GTA) mechanism to mitigate error accumulation, and enhances the trajectory prediction accuracy. The extensive evaluation on the ETH, UCY and SDD datasets shows that our method outperforms the typical state-of-the-art works by significant margins.

    "abstract": "Evaluating the performance of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), integrating both point cloud and language, presents significant challenges. The lack of a comprehensive assessment hampers determining whether these models truly represent advancements, thereby impeding further progress in the field. Current evaluations heavily rely on classification and caption tasks, falling short in providing a thorough assessment of MLLMs. A pressing need exists for a more sophisticated evaluation method capable of thoroughly analyzing the spatial understanding and expressive capabilities of these models. To address these issues, we introduce a scalable 3D benchmark, accompanied by a large-scale instruction-tuning dataset known as 3DBench, providing an extensible platform for a comprehensive evaluation of MLLMs. Specifically, we establish the benchmark that spans a wide range of spatial and semantic scales, from object-level to scene-level, addressing both perception and planning tasks. Furthermore, we present a rigorous pipeline for automatically constructing scalable 3D instruction-tuning datasets, covering 10 diverse multi-modal tasks with more than 0.23 million QA pairs generated in total. Thorough experiments evaluating trending MLLMs, comparisons against existing datasets, and variations of training protocols demonstrate the superiority of 3DBench, offering valuable insights into current limitations and potential research directions.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Adversarial robustness and interpretability are longstanding challenges of computer vision. Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations that are incomprehensible and imperceptible to humans. However, the opaqueness of networks prevents one from theoretically addressing adversarial robustness. As a human-comprehensible approach, the frequency perspective has been adopted in recent works to investigate the properties of neural networks and adversarial examples. In this paper, we investigate the frequency properties of feature extraction and analyze the stability of different frequency features when attacking different frequencies. Therefore, we propose an attack method, F-PGD, based on the projected gradient descent to attack the specified frequency bands. Utilizing this method, we find many intriguing properties of neural networks and adversarial perturbations. We experimentally show that contrary to the low-frequency bias of neural networks, the effective features of the same class are distributed across all frequency bands. Meanwhile, the high-frequency features often dominate when the neural networks make conflicting decisions on different frequency features. Furthermore, the attack experiments show that the low-frequency features are more robust to the attacks on different frequencies, but the interference to the high frequencies makes the network unable to make the right decision. These properties indicate that the decision-making process of neural networks tends to use as few low-frequency features as possible and cannot integrate features of different frequencies",

However, existing CZSL methods are designed to learn compositions from fixed primitive set, which cannot handle the continually expanding primitive set in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a new CZSL setting, named Continual Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CCZSL), which requires the model to recognize unseen compositions composed of learned primitive set while continually increasing the size of learned primitive set. Contextuality and catastrophic forgetting are the main issues to be addressed in this setting. Specifically, we capture similar contextuality in compositions through several learnable Super-Primitives that can modify the invariant primitive embedding to better adapt the contextuality in the corresponding composition. Then we introduce a dual knowledge distillation loss which aims at maintaining old knowledge learned from previous sessions and avoiding overfitting of new session.

Current attacks on segmentation primarily focus on a single task, and these methods typically rely on iterative instance-specific strategies, resulting in limited attack transferability and low efficiency. In this paper, we propose GenSeg, a Generative paradigm that creates unified adversaries for Segmentation tasks. In particular, we propose an intermediate-level objective to enhance attack transferability, including a mutual agreement loss for feature deviation, and a prototype obfuscating loss to disrupt intra-class and inter-class relationships. Moreover, GenSeg crafts an adversary in a single forward pass, significantly boosting the attack efficiency. Besides, we unify multiple segmentation tasks to GenSeg in a novel category-and-mask view, which makes it possible to attack these segmentation tasks within this unified framework, and conduct cross-domain and cross-task attacks as well. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of GenSeg in black-box attacks compared with state-of-the-art attacks. To our best knowledge, GenSeg is the first approach capable of conducting cross-domain and cross-task attacks on segmentation tasks, which are closer to real-world scenarios",

However, existing end-to-end MLLMs only allow users to interact with them through language instructions, leading to the limitation of the interactive accuracy and efficiency. In this study, we present precise referring instructions that utilize diverse reference representations such as points and boxes as referring prompts to refer to the special region. This enables MLLMs to focus on the region of interest and achieve finer-grained interaction. Based on precise referring instruction, we propose ChatSpot, a unified end-to-end MLLM that supports diverse forms of interactivity including mouse clicks, drag-and-drop, and drawing boxes, which provides a more flexible and seamless interactive experience. We also construct a multi-grained vision-language instruction-following dataset based on existing datasets and GPT-4 generating.

    "abstract": "Few-Shot Learning (FSL) aims to train a model that can generalize to recognize new classes, with each new class having only very limited training samples. Since extracting discriminative features for new classes with few samples is challenging, existing FSL methods leverage visual and semantic prior knowledge to guide discriminative feature learning. However, for meta-learning purposes, the semantic knowledge of the query set is unavailable, so their features lack discriminability. To address this problem, we propose a novel Multi-Attention based Visual-Semantic Interaction (MAVSI) approach for FSL. Specifically, we utilize spatial and channel attention mechanisms to effectively select discriminative visual features for the support set based on its ground-truth semantics while using all the support set semantics for each query set sample. Then, a relation module with class prototypes of the support set is employed to supervise and select discriminative visual features for the query set. To further enhance the discriminability of the support set, we introduce a visual-semantic contrastive learning module to promote the similarity between visual features and their corresponding semantic features. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed MAVSI could outperform existing state-of-the-art FSL methods",

    "title": "Focus on the Whole Character: Discriminative Character Modeling for Scene Text Recognition",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recently, scene text recognition (STR) models have shown significant performance improvements. However, existing models still encounter difficulties in recognizing challenging texts that involve factors such as severely distorted and perspective characters. These challenging texts mainly cause two problems: (1) Large Intra-Class Variance. (2) Small Inter-Class Variance. An extremely distorted character may prominently differ visually from other characters within the same category, while the variance between characters from different classes is relatively small. To address the above issues, we propose a novel method that enriches the character features to enhance the discriminability of characters. Firstly, we propose the Character-Aware Constraint Encoder (CACE) with multiple blocks stacked. CACE introduces a decay matrix in each block to explicitly guide the attention region for each token. By continuously employing the decay matrix, CACE enables tokens to perceive morphological information at the character level. Secondly, an Intra-Inter Consistency Loss (I^2CL) is introduced to consider intra-class compactness and inter-class separability at feature space. I^2CL improves the discriminative capability of features by learning a long-term memory unit for each character category. Trained with synthetic data, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on common benchmarks (94.1% accuracy) and Union14M-Benchmark (61.6% accuracy).

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Action Quality Assessment (AQA) is pivotal for quantifying actions across domains like sports and medical care. Existing methods often rely on pre-trained backbones from large-scale action recognition datasets to boost performance on smaller AQA datasets. However, this common strategy yields suboptimal results due to the inherent struggle of these backbones to capture the subtle cues essential for AQA. Moreover, fine-tuning on smaller datasets risks overfitting. To address these issues, we propose Coarse-to-Fine Instruction Alignment (CoFInAl). Inspired by recent advances in large language model tuning, CoFInAl aligns AQA with broader pre-trained tasks by reformulating it as a coarse-to-fine classification task. Initially, it learns grade prototypes for coarse assessment and then utilizes fixed sub-grade prototypes for fine-grained assessment. This hierarchical approach mirrors the judging process, enhancing interpretability within the AQA framework. Experimental results on two long-term AQA datasets demonstrate CoFInAl achieves state-of-the-art performance with significant correlation gains of 5.49% and 3.55% on Rhythmic Gymnastics and Fis-V, respectively.

    "abstract": "Zero-shot sketch-based image retrieval (ZS-SBIR), aiming to recognize and retrieve relevant photos based on freehand sketch queries that belong to unseen categories in the search set, has sparked considerable interest, benefiting from the rapid advancements in multimodal learning and feature representation research. Despite the recent improvements in performance, there are still rooms for refining feature representation and thus enhancing the generalization capabilities of the models. Most of the existing research efforts have primarily focused on learning the feature distribution of modalities within specific datasets, without considering the broader dataset-agnostic `population distribution' of relevant modalities. In this paper, we investigate the modality population distribution and apply such knowledge to guide feature learning. Specifically, we propose a modality capacity constraint loss to control the learning of population distribution for sketches and photos. This loss can be effectively combined with retrieval loss (e.g., triplet loss) or classification loss (e.g., InfoNCE loss) to enhance the performance of ZS-SBIR, through the fine-tuning process of pre-trained models like CLIP and DINO. Extensive experiment results have demonstrated our significant performance improvements, achieving an increase of 7.3%/3.2% and 19.9%/10.3% in terms of mAP@200/P@200 compared to the state-of-the-art models on CLIP and DINO, respectively, on the Sketchy-ext dataset (split 2).

To address the above challenges, a novel Cross-dimensional Transformer (CdTransformer) and a creative Class-consistent Contrastive Learning (CcCL) are proposed. Specifically, CdTransformer consists of two novel modules: 1) Cross-dimensional Attention Module (CAM), which breaks the limitation that Transformer cannot reasonably establish spatial structure correlation when meeting 3D medical data, meanwhile, reduces the computational complexity and memory consumption. 2) Inter-dimensional Feed-forward Network (IdFN), which addresses the challenge of traditional feed-forward networks not being able to learn depth dimension information that is unique to 3D medical data. CcCL innovatively takes full advantage of the inter-class and intra-class features from the slice-distorted samples to boost Transformer in learning feature representation.

In this paper, we propose SceneDiff, a novel retrieval network that leverages a pre-trained diffusion model to establish a shared generative latent space, enabling a joint latent representation learning for both sketch and text features and precise alignment with the corresponding image.

Within this space, we introduce the content-aware feature transformation module to reconcile encoded sketch and image features with the diffusion latent space's dimensional requirements and preserve their visual content information. Then we augment the representation capability of the generated latent fusion features by integrating multiple samplings with partition attention, and utilize contrastive learning to align both direct fusion features and generated latent fusion features with corresponding image representations.

    "title": "Markov Constraint as Large Language Model Surrogate",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "This paper presents NgramMarkov, a variant of the Markov constraints. It is dedicated to text generation in constraint programming (CP). It involves a set of n-grams (i.e., sequence of n words) associated with probabilities given by a large language model (LLM). It limits the product of the probabilities of the n-gram of a sentence. The propagator of this constraint can be seen as an extension of the ElementaryMarkov constraint propagator, incorporating the LLM distribution instead of the maximum likelihood estimation of n-grams. It uses a gliding threshold, i.e., it rejects n-grams whose local probabilities are too low, to guarantee balanced solutions. It can also be combined with a \"look-ahead\" approach to remove n-grams that are very unlikely to lead to acceptable sentences for a fixed-length horizon. This idea is based on the MDDMarkovProcess constraint propagator, but without explicitly using an MDD (Multi-Valued Decision Diagram). The experimental results show that the generated text is valued in a similar way to the LLM perplexity function. Using this new constraint dramatically reduces the number of candidate sentences produced, improves computation times, and allows larger corpora or smaller n-grams to be used. A real-world problem has been solved for the first time using 4-grams instead of 5-grams",

    "title": "A Top-Down Tree Model Counter for Quantified Boolean Formulas",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "This paper addresses the challenge of solution counting for Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBFs), a task distinct from the well-established model counting problem for SAT (\\#SAT). Unlike SAT, where models are straightforward assignments to Boolean variables, QBF solution counting involves tree models that capture dependencies among variables within different quantifier blocks. We present a comprehensive top-down tree model counter capable of handling diverse satisfiable QBF formulas. Emphasizing the critical role of the branching heuristic, which must consider variables in the correct order according to quantification blocks, we further demonstrate the importance of addressing connected components, free variables, and caching. Experimental results indicate that our proposed approach for counting tree models of QBF formulas is highly efficient in practice, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods designed for this specific purpose",

    "title": "Knowledge Compilation for Incremental and Checkable Stochastic Boolean Satisfiability",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Knowledge compilation has proven effective in (weighted) model counting, uniquely supporting incrementality and checkability. For incrementality, compiling an input formula once suffices to answer multiple queries, thus reducing the total solving effort. For checkability, the compiled formula is amenable to producing machine-checkable proofs for verification, thus strengthening the solver's reliability. In this work, we extend knowledge compilation from model counting to stochastic Boolean satisfiability (SSAT) solving by generalizing the dec-DNNF representation to accommodate the SSAT quantifier structure and integrate it into SharpSSAT, a state-of-the-art SSAT solver. We further study proof generation from the compiled representation and extend CPOG, a certified model-counting toolchain, to generate proofs for certifying the results of SharpSSAT. Experimental results show the benefits of the proposed knowledge compilation approach for SSAT in sharing computation efforts for multiple queries and producing checkable dec-DNNF logs with negligible overhead",

    "title": "Efficient Cost-Minimization Schemes for Electrical Energy Demand Satisfaction by Prosumers in Microgrids with Battery Storage Capabilities",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We introduce and study various models for satisfying electrical energy demands of prosumers in a microgrid, while optimizing their costs. Each prosumer has individual demands of electrical energy, which can vary day-by-day, and which they can satisfy by either generating electrical energy through a self-operated mini power plant like a solar panel, through buying from an external energy provider, such as the main grid or by trading with other prosumers. Our models take into account two key aspects motivated by real-life scenarios: first, we consider a daily volatility of prices for buying and selling the energy, and second, the possibility to store the self-generated energy in a battery of finite capacity to be either self-consumed or sold to other prosumers in the future. We provide a thorough complexity analysis, as well as efficient algorithms, so that prosumers can minimize their overall cost over the entire time horizon. As a byproduct, we also solve a new, generalized version of the KNAPSACK problem which may be of independent interest. We complement our theoretical findings by extensive experimental evaluations on realistic data sets",

    "title": "Optimal Extended Formulations from Optimal Dynamic Programming Algorithms",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Vertex Subset Problems (VSPs) are a class of combinatorial optimization problems on graphs where the goal is to find a subset of vertices satisfying a predefined condition. Two prominent approaches for solving VSPs are dynamic programming over tree-like structures, such as tree-decompositions or clique-decompositions, and linear programming. In this work, we establish a sharp connection between both approaches by showing that if a vertex-subset problem Pi admits a solution-preserving dynamic programming algorithm that produces tables of size at most alpha(k,n) when processing a tree decomposition of width at most k of an n-vertex graph G, then the polytope defined as the convex-hull of solutions of Pi in G has extension complexity at most O(alpha(k,n)*n). Additionally, this upper bound is optimal under the exponential time hypothesis (ETH). At the one hand, our results imply that ETH-optimal solution-preserving dynamic programming algorithms for combinatorial problems yield optimal-size parameterized extended formulations for the solution polytopes associated with instances of these problems. At the other hand, unconditional lower bounds obtained in the realm of the theory of extended formulations yield unconditional lower bounds on the table complexity of solution-preserving dynamic programming algorithms",

    "title": "Solving Quantified Boolean Formulas with Few Existential Variables",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The quantified Boolean formula (QBF) problem is an important decision problem generally viewed as the archetype for PSPACE-completeness. Many problems of central interest in AI are in general not included in NP, e.g., planning, model checking, and non-monotonic reasoning, and for such problems QBF has successfully been used as a modelling tool. However, solvers for QBF are not as advanced as state of the art SAT solvers, which has prevented QBF from becoming a universal modelling language for PSPACE-complete problems. A theoretical explanation is that QBF (as well as many other PSPACE-complete problems) lacks natural parameters guaranteeing fixed-parameter tractability (FPT). In this paper we tackle this problem and consider a simple but overlooked parameter: the number of existentially quantified variables. This natural parameter is virtually unexplored in the literature which one might find surprising given the general scarcity of FPT algorithms for QBF. Via this parameterization we then develop a novel FPT algorithm applicable to QBF instances in conjunctive normal form (CNF) of bounded clause length. We complement this by a W[1]-hardness result for QBF in CNF of unbounded clause length as well as sharper lower bounds for the bounded arity case under the (strong) exponential-time hypothesis",

    "title": "A SAT Solver + Computer Algebra Attack on the Minimum Kochen–Specker Problem",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "One of the fundamental results in quantum foundations is the Kochen–Specker (KS) theorem, which states that any theory whose predictions agree with quantum mechanics must be contextual, i.e., a quantum observation cannot be understood as revealing a pre-existing value. The theorem hinges on the existence of a mathematical object called a KS vector system. While many KS vector systems are known, the problem of finding the minimum KS vector system in three dimensions (3D) has remained stubbornly open for over 55 years. To address the minimum KS problem, we present a new verifiable proof-producing method based on a combination of a Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solver and a computer algebra system (CAS) that uses an isomorph-free orderly generation technique that is very effective in pruning away large parts of the search space. Our method shows that a KS system in 3D must contain at least 24 vectors. We show that our sequential and parallel Cube-and-Conquer (CnC) SAT+CAS methods are significantly faster than SAT-only, CAS-only, and a prior CAS-based method of Uijlen and Westerbaan. Further, while our parallel pipeline is somewhat slower than the parallel CnC version of the recently introduced Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMS) method, this is in part due to the overhead of proof generation. Finally, we provide the first computer-verifiable proof certificate of a lower bound to the KS problem with a size of 40.3 TiB in order 23",
