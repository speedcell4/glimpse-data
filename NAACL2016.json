Though notable improvements have been made in these areas, the reordering problem still remains a challenge in statistical machine translations. In this paper, we present a novel neural reordering model that directly models word pairs and alignment. By utilizing LSTM recurrent neural networks, much longer context could be learned for reordering prediction.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Dropped Pronouns (DP) in which pronouns   are frequently dropped in the source language   but should be retained in the target language   are challenge in machine translation. In response to this problem, we propose a semisupervised approach to recall possibly missing   pronouns in the translation. Firstly, we build   training data for DP generation in which the   DPs are automatically labelled according to   the alignment information from a parallel corpus. Secondly, we build a deep learning-based   DP generator for input sentences in decoding   when no corresponding references exist. More   specifically, the generation is two-phase: (1)   DP position detection, which is modeled as a   sequential labelling task with recurrent neural   networks; and (2) DP prediction, which employs a multilayer perceptron with rich features. Finally, we integrate the above outputs   into our translation system to recall missing   pronouns by both extracting rules from the   DP-labelled training data and translating the   DP-generated input sentences. Experimental   results show that our approach achieves a significant improvement of 1.58 BLEU points in   translation performance with 66% F-score for   DP generation accuracy",

Furthermore, for these extrinsic tasks, we find that once the benefit from increasing the embedding dimensionality is mostly exhausted, simple concatenation of word embeddings, learned with different context types, can yield further performance gains.

Our evaluation on Simple and Standard Wikipedia sentence pairs suggests that incremental CCG features are indeed more useful than phrase structure features achieving 0.44 points gain in performance. Incremental CCG parser also gives significant improvements in speed (12 times faster) in comparison to the phrase structure parser.

Further analysis revealed that language pairs requiring a larger amount of re-ordering benefited the most from our approach. When the evaluation was restricted to such pairs, the average improvement increased to up to 0.75 BLEU points with over 97% of the pairs improving.

Each associated article is summarized into a headline and labelled to indicate whether its stance is for, against, or observing the claim, where observing indicates that the article merely repeats the claim. Thus, Emergent provides a real-world data source for a variety of natural language processing tasks in the context of fact-checking. Further to presenting the dataset, we address the task of determining the article headline stance with respect to the claim. For this purpose we use a logistic regression classifier and develop features that examine the headline and its agreement with the claim. The accuracy achieved was 73% which is 26% higher than the one achieved by the Excitement Open Platform (Magnini et al., 2014)",

Little attention has been paid thus far on inducing high-quality word clusters at a large scale. The predictive exchange algorithm is quite scalable, but sometimes does not provide as good perplexity as other slower clustering algorithms. We introduce the bidirectional, interpolated, refining, and alternating (BIRA) predictive exchange algorithm. It improves upon the predictive exchange algorithm's perplexity by up to 18%, giving it perplexities comparable to the slower two-sided exchange algorithm, and better perplexities than the slower Brown clustering algorithm. Our BIRA implementation is fast, clustering a 2.5 billion token English News Crawl corpus in 3 hours. It also reduces machine translation training time while preserving translation quality. Our implementation is portable and freely available",

In this paper we provide the first systematic corpus analysis of the relation and show that relation-specific features can improve considerably the detection of the relation. We show that sentences involved in INSTANTIATION are set apart from other sentences by the use of gradable (subjective) adjectives, the occurrence of rare words and by different patterns in part-of-speech usage. Words across arguments of INSTANTIATION are connected through hypernym and meronym relations significantly more often than in other sentences and that they stand out in context by being significantly less similar to each other than other adjacent sentence pairs. These factors provide substantial predictive power that improves the identification of implicit INSTANTIATION relation by more than 5% F-measure",

Our classifier, computing linguistic features, was able to discriminate normal from cognitively impaired patients to an accuracy of 86.1% using lexical and semantic irregularities found in their writing.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Author(s): Qadir, A; Riloff, E; Walker, MA | Abstract: ©2016 Association for Computational Linguistics. A simile is a figure of speech comparing two fundamentally different things. Sometimes, a simile will explain the basis of a comparison by explicitly mentioning a shared property. For example, \"my room is as cold as Antarctica\" gives \"cold\" as the property shared by the room and Antarctica. But most similes do not give an explicit property (e.g., \"my room feels like Antarctica\") leaving the reader to infer that the room is cold. We tackle the problem of automatically inferring implicit properties evoked by similes. Our approach involves three steps: (1) generating candidate properties from different sources, (2) evaluating properties based on the influence of multiple simile components, and (3) aggregated ranking of the properties. We also present an analysis showing that the difficulty of inferring an implicit property for a simile correlates with its interpretive diversity",

The picked phrase could be at any position of the sentence, which improves the efficiency of human computer interaction. We also propose automatic suggestion models for the two actions to further reduce the cost of human interaction. Experiment results demonstrate that by interactions through either one of the actions, the translation quality could be significantly improved.

In this paper, we demonstrate that accurate multilingual part-of-speech (POS) tagging can be done with just a few (e.g., ten) word translation pairs. We use the translation pairs to establish a coarse linear isometric (orthonormal) mapping between monolingual embeddings. This enables the supervised source model expressed in terms of embeddings to be used directly on the target language. We further reﬁne the model in an unsupervised manner by initializing and regularizing it to be close to the direct transfer model. Averaged across six languages, our model yields a 37.5% absolute improvement over the monolingual prototype-driven method (Haghighi and Klein, 2006) when using a comparable amount of supervision. Moreover, to highlight key linguistic characteristics of the generated tags, we use them to predict typological properties of languages, obtaining a 50% error reduction relative to the prototype model. 1",

However, the performance of these tools is often unsatisfactory, due to language change and genre differences. Spelling normalization heuristics are the dominant solution for dealing with historical texts, but this approach fails to account for changes in usage and vocabulary. In this empirical paper, we assess the capability of domain adaptation techniques to cope with historical texts, focusing on the classic benchmark task of part-of-speech tagging. We evaluate several domain adaptation methods on the task of tagging Early Modern English and Modern British English texts in the Penn Corpora of Historical English. We demonstrate that the Feature Embedding method for unsupervised domain adaptation outperforms word embeddings and Brown clusters, showing the importance of embedding the entire feature space, rather than just individual words. Feature Embeddings also give better performance than spelling normalization, but the combination of the two methods is better still, yielding a 5% raw improvement in tagging accuracy on Early Modern English texts",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Creole languages do not fit into the traditional tree model of evolutionary history because multiple languages are involved in their formation. In this paper, we present several statistical models to explore the nature of creole genesis. After reviewing quantitative studies on creole genesis, we first tackle the question of whether creoles are typologically distinct from non-creoles. By formalizing this question as a binary classification problem, we demonstrate that a linear classifier fails to separate creoles from non-creoles although the two groups have substantially different distributions in the feature space. We then model a creole language as a mixture of source languages plus a special restructurer. We find a pervasive influence of the restructurer in creole genesis and some statistical universals in it, paving the way for more elaborate statistical models",

We evaluate the LCG model on the readability ranking task. The results of the experiments show that the LCG model obtains higher accuracy than state-of-the-art coherence models.

The recently released Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) corpus has made it possible to develop and evaluate learning-centered methods such as deep neural networks for natural language inference (NLI). In this paper, we propose a special long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture for NLI. Our model builds on top of a recently proposed neural attention model for NLI but is based on a significantly different idea. Instead of deriving sentence embeddings for the premise and the hypothesis to be used for classification, our solution uses a match-LSTM to perform word-by-word matching of the hypothesis with the premise. This LSTM is able to place more emphasis on important word-level matching results. In particular, we observe that this LSTM remembers important mismatches that are critical for predicting the contradiction or the neutral relationship label. On the SNLI corpus, our model achieves an accuracy of 86.1%, outperforming the state of the art",

The DLSTM, which is a stack of LSTM units, has different order of feature representations at different depth of LSTM unit. The bottom LSTM unit equipped with input and output gates, extracts the first order feature representation from current word. To extract higher order nonlinear feature representation, the LSTM unit at higher position gets input from two parts. First part is the lower LSTM unit's memory cell from previous word. Second part is the lower LSTM unit's hidden output from current word. In this way, the DLSTM captures the nonlinear nonconsecutive interaction within n-grams.

Then, we determine the best score thresholds for separating argumentative and non-argumentative paragraphs. The results of our experimentation show that our relative word frequency approach provides a reliable way to identify argumentative paragraphs with a F1 score of 0.91, though challenges in accurate scoring invite improvement through context-aware means",

It then builds a tag based product retrieval system upon these allotted tags. The explosive growth of e-commerce products being sold online has made manual annotation infeasible. Without such tags it's impossible for customers to be able to find these products. Hence a scalable approach catering to such large number of product images and allocating meaningful tags is essential and could be used to make an efficient tag based product retrieval system. In this paper we propose one such approach based on feature extraction using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks to learn descriptive semantic features from product images. Then we use inverse distance weighted K-nearest neighbours classifiers along with several other multi-label classification approaches to assign appropriate tags to our images. We demonstrate the functioning of our algorithm for the Amazon product dataset for various categories of products like clothing and apparel, electronics, sports equipment etc",

We leverage the information from the structure to frame a monotone (non-decreasing) sub-modular scoring function for generating comprehensible summaries. Our approach improves the overall quality of comprehensibility of the summary in terms of human evaluation and gives sufficient content coverage with comparable ROUGE score.

In this paper, we attempt to lessen the problem of a lack of training data for low-resource languages by adding data from related high-resource languages in three experiments. First, we interpolate language models trained on the target language and on the related language. In our second experiment, we select the sentences most similar to the target language and add them to our training corpus. Finally, we integrate data from the related language into a translation model for a statistical machine translation application. Although we do not see many significant improvements over baselines trained on a small amount of data in the target language, we discuss some further experiments that could be attempted in order to augment language models and translation models with data from related languages",

Those role-tags are then used to identify the desired operands and filter out irrelevant quantities (so that the answer can be obtained precisely).

    "volume": "demo",
    "abstract": "Foreign students at German universities often have difficulties following lectures as they are often held in German. Since human interpreters are too expensive for universities we are addressing this problem via speech translation technology deployed in KIT's lecture halls. Our simultaneous lecture translation system automatically translates lectures from German to English in real-time. Other supported language directions are English to Spanish, English to French, English to German and German to French. Automatic simultaneous translation is more than just the concatenation of automatic speech recognition and machine translation technology, as the input is an unsegmented, practically infinite stream of spontaneous speech. The lack of segmentation and the spontaneous nature of the speech makes it especially difficult to recognize and translate it with sufficient quality. In addition to quality, speed and latency are of the utmost importance in order for the system to enable students to follow lectures. In this paper we present our system that performs the task of simultaneous speech translation of university lectures by performing speech translation on a stream of audio in real-time and with low latency. The system features several techniques beyond the basic speech translation task, that make it fit for real-world use. Examples of these features are a continuous stream speech recognition without any prior segmentation of the input audio, punctuation prediction, run-on decoding and run-on translation with continuously updating displays in order to keep the latency as low as possible",

    "volume": "demo",
    "abstract": "Despite widespread adoption, machine learning models remain mostly black boxes. Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust, which is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction, or when choosing whether to deploy a new model. Such understanding also provides insights into the model, which can be used to transform an untrustworthy model or prediction into a trustworthy one. In this work, we propose LIME, a novel explanation technique that explains the predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner, by learning an interpretable model locally varound the prediction. We also propose a method to explain models by presenting representative individual predictions and their explanations in a non-redundant way, framing the task as a submodular optimization problem. We demonstrate the flexibility of these methods by explaining different models for text (e.g. random forests) and image classification (e.g. neural networks). We show the utility of explanations via novel experiments, both simulated and with human subjects, on various scenarios that require trust: deciding if one should trust a prediction, choosing between models, improving an untrustworthy classifier, and identifying why a classifier should not be trusted",

    "volume": "tutorial",
    "abstract": "We live in an increasingly multilingual multimodal world where it is common to find multiple views of the same entity across modalities and languages. For example, news articles which get published in multiple languages are essentially different views of the same entity. Similarly, video, audio and multilingual subtitles are multiple views of the same movie clip. Given the proliferation of such multilingual multimodal content it is no longer sufficient to process a single modality or language at a time. Specifically, there is an increasing demand for allowing transfer, conversion and access across such multiple views of the data. For example, users want to translate/convert news articles to their native language, automatically caption their travel photos and even ask natural language questions over videos and images. This has led to a lot of excitement around this interdisciplinary research area which requires ideas from Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Speech and Computer Vision among other fields. In this tutorial we focus on neural network based models for addressing various problems in this space. We will first introduce the participants to some of the basic concepts and building blocks that such approaches rely on. We will then describe some of these approaches in detail. There are two important parts to the tutorial. In the first part, we will talk about approaches which aim to learn a common representation for entities across languages and modalities thereby enabling cross lingual and cross modal access and transfer. In the second part we will talk about multilingual multimodal generation. For example, we will discuss neural network based approaches which aim at (i) generating translations in multiple languages, (ii) generating images given a natural language description and (iii) generating captions in multiple languages",

    "title": "Recent Progress in Deep Learning for NLP",
    "volume": "tutorial",
    "abstract": "Neural network­based methods have been viewed as one of the major driving force in the recent development of natural language processing (NLP). We all have witnessed with great excitement how this subfield advances: new ideas emerge at an unprecedented speed and old ideas resurge in unexpected ways. In a nutshell, there are two major trends: ● Ideas and techniques from other fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence (A.I.) have increasing impact on neural network­based NLP methods. ● With end­to­end models taking on more complex tasks, the design of architecture and mechanisms often needs more domain knowledge from linguists and other domain experts. Both trends are important to researchers in the computational linguistics community. Fundamental ideas like external memory or reinforcement learning, although introduced to NLP only recently, have quickly lead to significant improvement on tasks like natural language generation and question answering. On the other hand, with complicated neural systems with many cooperating components, it calls for linguistic knowledge in designing the right mechanism, architecture, and sometimes training setting. As a simple example, the introducing of automatic alignment in neural machine translation, has quickly led to the state­of­the­art performance in machine translation and triggered a large body of sequence­to­sequence models. It is therefore important to get the researchers in computational linguistics community acquainted with the recent progress in deep learning for NLP. We will focus on the work and ideas strongly related to the core of natural language and yet not so familiar to the majority of the community, which can be roughly categorized into: 1) the differentiable data­structures, and 2) the learning paradigms for NLP. Differentiable data­structures, starting with the memory equipped with continuous operations in Neural Turing Machine, have been the foundation of deep models with sophisticated operations. Some members of it, such as Memory Network, have become famous on tasks like question answering and machine translation, while other development in this direction, including those with clear and important application in NLP, are relatively new to this community. Deep learning, with its promise on end­to­end learning, not only enables the training of complex NLP models from scratch, but also extends the training setting to include remote and indirect supervision. We will introduce not only the end­to­end learning in its general notion, but also newly emerged",

    "title": "Statistical Machine Translation between Related Languages",
    "volume": "tutorial",
    "abstract": "Language­independent Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) has proven to be very challenging. The diversity of languages makes high accuracy difficult and requires substantial parallel corpus as well as linguistic resources (parsers, morph analyzers, etc.). An interesting observation is that a large chunk of machine translation (MT) requirements involve related languages. They are either : (i) between related languages, or (ii) between a lingua franca (like English) and a set of related languages. For instance, India, the European Union and South­East Asia have such translation requirements due to government, business and socio­cultural communication needs. Related languages share a lot of linguistic features and the divergences among them are at a lower level of the NLP pipeline. The objective of the tutorial is to discuss how the relatedness among languages can be leveraged to bridge this language divergence thereby achieving some/all of these goals: (i) improving translation quality, (ii) achieving better generalization, (iii) sharing linguistic resources, and (iv) reducing resource requirements. We will look at the existing research in SMT from the perspective of related languages, with the goal to build a toolbox of methods that are useful for translation between related languages. This tutorial would be relevant to Machine Translation researchers and developers, especially those interested in translation between low­resource languages which have resource­rich related languages. It will also be relevant for researchers interested in multilingual computation. We start with a motivation for looking at the SMT problem from the perspective of related languages. We introduce notions of language relatedness useful for MT. We explore how lexical, morphological and syntactic similarity among related languages can help MT. Lexical similarity will receive special attention since related languages share a significant vocabulary in terms of cognates, loanwords, etc. Then, we look beyond bilingual MT and present how pivot­based and multi­source methods incorporate knowledge from multiple languages, and handle language pairs lacking parallel corpora. We present some studies concerning the implications of languages relatedness to pivot­based SMT, and ways of handling language divergence in the pivot­based SMT scenario. Recent advances in deep learning have made it possible to train multi­language neural MT systems, which we think would be relevant to training between related languages",
