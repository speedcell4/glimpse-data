    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Adversarial attacks in Natural Language Processing apply perturbations in the character or token levels. Token-level attacks, gaining prominence for their use of gradient-based methods, are susceptible to altering sentence semantics, leading to invalid adversarial examples. While character-level attacks easily maintain semantics, they have received less attention as they cannot easily adopt popular gradient-based methods, and are thought to be easy to defend. Challenging these beliefs, we introduce Charmer, an efficient query-based adversarial attack capable of achieving high attack success rate (ASR) while generating highly similar adversarial examples. Our method successfully targets both small (BERT) and large (Llama 2) models. Specifically, on BERT with SST-2, Charmer improves the ASR in $4.84$% points and the USE similarity in $8$% points with respect to the previous art. Our implementation is available in https://github.com/LIONS-EPFL/Charmer",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a payoff perturbation technique for the Mirror Descent (MD) algorithm in games where the gradient of the payoff functions is monotone in the strategy profile space, potentially containing additive noise. The optimistic family of learning algorithms, exemplified by optimistic MD, successfully achieves last-iterate convergence in scenarios devoid of noise, leading the dynamics to a Nash equilibrium. A recent re-emerging trend underscores the promise of the perturbation approach, where payoff functions are perturbed based on the distance from an anchoring, or slingshot, strategy. In response, we propose Adaptively Perturbed MD (APMD), which adjusts the magnitude of the perturbation by repeatedly updating the slingshot strategy at a predefined interval. This innovation empowers us to find a Nash equilibrium of the underlying game with guaranteed rates. Empirical demonstrations affirm that our algorithm exhibits significantly accelerated convergence",

However, today's LLM inference systems are designed for standalone LLMs. They treat each external interaction as the end of LLM generation and form a new request when the interaction finishes, causing unnecessary recomputation of already computed contexts, which accounts for 37-40% of total model forwarding time. This paper presents InferCept, the first LLM inference framework targeting augmented LLMs and supporting the efficient interception of LLM generation. InferCept minimizes the GPU resource waste caused by LLM interceptions and dedicates saved memory for serving more requests.InferCept improves the overall serving throughput by 1.6x-2x and completes 2x more requests per second compared to the state-of-the-art LLM inference systems",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Subset or core-set selection offers a data-efficient way for training deep learning models. One-shot subset selection poses additional challenges as subset selection is only performed once and full set data become unavailable after the selection. However, most existing methods tend to choose either diverse or difficult data samples, which fail to faithfully represent the joint data distribution that is comprised of both feature and label information. The selection is also performed independently from the subset size, which plays an essential role in choosing what types of samples. To address this critical gap, we propose to conduct Feature similarity and Label variability Balanced One-shot Subset Selection (BOSS), aiming to construct an optimal size-aware subset for data-efficient deep learning. We show that a novel balanced core-set loss bound theoretically justifies the need to simultaneously consider both diversity and difficulty to form an optimal subset. It also reveals how the subset size influences the bound. We further connect the inaccessible bound to a practical surrogate target which is tailored to subset sizes and varying levels of overall difficulty. We design a novel Beta-scoring importance function to delicately control the optimal balance of diversity and difficulty. Comprehensive experiments conducted on both synthetic and real data justify the important theoretical properties and demonstrate the superior performance of BOSS as compared with the competitive baselines",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "As machine learning becomes more prominent there is a growing demand to perform several inference tasks in parallel. Multi-task learning (MTL) addresses this challenge by learning a single model that solves several tasks simultaneously and efficiently. Often optimizing MTL models entails first computing the gradient of the loss for each task, and then aggregating all the gradients to obtain a combined update direction. However, common methods following this approach do not consider an important aspect, the sensitivity in the dimensions of the gradients. Some dimensions may be more lenient for changes while others may be more restrictive. Here, we introduce a novel gradient aggregation procedure using Bayesian inference. We place a probability distribution over the task-specific parameters, which in turn induce a distribution over the gradients of the tasks. This valuable information allows us to quantify the uncertainty associated with each of the gradients' dimensions which is factored in when aggregating them. We empirically demonstrate the benefits of our approach in a variety of datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance",

However, achieving faithful attributions for the entirety of a black-box transformer model and maintaining computational efficiency is an unsolved challenge. By extending the Layer-wise Relevance Propagation attribution method to handle attention layers, we address these challenges effectively.

Through extensive evaluations against existing methods on LLaMa 2, Mixtral 8x7b, Flan-T5 and vision transformer architectures, we demonstrate that our proposed approach surpasses alternative methods in terms of faithfulness and enables the understanding of latent representations, opening up the door for concept-based explanations.

We introduce a framework that allows for objects in arbitrary Hilbert spaces, general types of (random) linear measurements as training data and general types of nonlinear model classes. We establish a series of learning guarantees for this framework, which provide explicit relations between the amount of training data and the model class to ensure near-best generalization bounds. In doing so, we introduce the key notion of the variation of a model class with respect to a distribution of sampling operators. We show that this framework can accommodate many different types of well-known problems of interest, such as matrix sketching by random sampling, compressed sensing with isotropic vectors, active learning in regression and compressed sensing with generative models. In all cases, known results become straightforward corollaries of our general theory. Hence, this work provides a powerful framework for studying and analyzing many different types of learning problems",

    "abstract": "Transformers are the backbone of powerful foundation models for many Vision and Natural Language Processing tasks. But their compute and memory/storage footprint is large, and so, serving such models is expensive often requiring high-end hardware. To mitigate this difficulty, Post-Training Quantization seeks to modify a pre-trained model and quantize it to eight bits or lower, significantly boosting compute/memory/latency efficiency. Such models have been successfully quantized to four bits with some performance loss. In this work, we outline a simple scheme to quantize Transformer-based models to just two bits (plus some overhead) with only a small drop in accuracy. Key to our formulation is a concept borrowed from Harmonic analysis called Fusion Frames. Our main finding is that the quantization must take place not in the original weight space, but instead in the Fusion Frame representations. If quantization is interpreted as the addition of noise, our casting of the problem allows invoking an extensive body of known consistent recovery and noise robustness guarantees. Further, if desired, de-noising filters are known in closed form. We show empirically, via a variety of experiments, that (almost) two-bit quantization for Transformer models promises sizable efficiency gains.

    "abstract": "Training reinforcement learning (RL) agents directly from high-dimensional image observations continues to be a challenging problem. Recent line of work on behavioral distances proposes to learn representations that encode behavioral similarities quantified by the bisimulation metric. By learning an isometric mapping to a lower dimensional space that preserves this metric, such methods attempt to learn representations that group together functionally similar states. However, such an isometric mapping may not exist, making the learning objective ill-defined. We propose an alternative objective that allows distortions in long-range distances, while preserving local metric structure – inducing representations that highlight natural clusters in the state space. This leads to new representations, which we term Behavioral Eigenmaps (BeigeMaps), corresponding to the eigenfunctions of similarity kernels induced by behavioral distances. We empirically demonstrate that when added as a drop-in modification, BeigeMaps improve the policy performance of prior behavioral distance based RL algorithms",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The question-answering (QA) capabilities of foundation models are highly sensitive to prompt variations, rendering their performance susceptible to superficial, non-meaning-altering changes. This vulnerability often stems from the model's preference or bias towards specific input characteristics, such as option position or superficial image features in multi-modal settings. We propose to rectify this bias directly in the model's internal representation. Our approach, SteerFair, finds the bias direction in the model's representation space and steers activation values away from it during inference. Specifically, we exploit the observation that bias often adheres to simple association rules, such as the spurious association between the first option and correctness likelihood. Next, we construct demonstrations of these rules from unlabeled samples and use them to identify the bias directions. We empirically show that SteerFair significantly reduces instruction-tuned model performance variance across prompt modifications on three benchmark tasks. Remarkably, our approach surpasses a supervised baseline with 100 labels by an average of 10.86% accuracy points and 12.95 score points and matches the performance with 500 labels",

Our model demonstrates high accuracy in both seizure detection and classification tasks. Notably, REST achieves a remarkable 9-fold acceleration in inference speed compared to state-of-the-art models, while simultaneously demanding substantially less memory than the smallest model employed for this task.

However, for complex reasoning and planning tasks, these methods primarily rely on continuous representations.

In this work, we introduce discrete abstract representations for transformer-based learning (DART), a sample-efficient method utilizing discrete representations for modeling both the world and learning behavior. We incorporate a transformer-decoder for auto-regressive world modeling and a transformer-encoder for learning behavior by attending to task-relevant cues in the discrete representation of the world model. For handling partial observability, we aggregate information from past time steps as memory tokens.

(ICML 2021, PLMR 139, pp. 12447–12457) introduced probabilistic generating circuits (PGCs) as a probabilistic model to unify probabilistic circuits (PCs) and determinantal point processes (DPPs). At a first glance, PGCs store a distribution in a very different way, they compute the probability generating polynomial instead of the probability mass function and it seems that this is the main reason why PGCs are more powerful than PCs or DPPs. However, PGCs also allow for negative weights, whereas classical PCs assume that all weights are nonnegative. One main insight of this work is that the negative weights are the cause for the power of PGCs and not the different representation. PGCs are PCs in disguise: we show how to transform any PGC on binary variables into a PC with negative weights with only polynomial blowup. PGCs were defined by Zhang et al. only for binary random variables. As our second main result, we show that there is a good reason for this: we prove that PGCs for categorical variables with larger image size do not support tractable marginalization unless NP=P. On the other hand, we show that we can model categorical variables with larger image size as PC with negative weights computing set-multilinear polynomials. These allow for tractable marginalization. In this sense, PCs with negative weights strictly subsume PGCs",

Additionally, even for smooth losses, the resulting regret guarantees improve upon previous results in terms their dependence of dimension. Our results provide the best known rates for DP-OCO in all practical regimes of the privacy parameter, barring when it is exceptionally small. The principal innovation in our algorithm design is the use of sampling from strongly log-concave densities which satisfy the Log-Sobolev Inequality. The resulting concentration of measure allows us to obtain a better trade-off for the dimension factors than prior work, leading to improved results. Following previous works on DP-OCO, the proposed algorithm explicitly limits the number of switches via rejection sampling.

    "abstract": "While neural networks allow highly accurate predictions in many tasks, their lack of robustness towards even slight input perturbations often hampers their deployment. Adversarial attacks such as the seminal projected gradient descent (PGD) offer an effective means to evaluate a model's robustness and dedicated solutions have been proposed for attacks on semantic segmentation or optical flow estimation. While they attempt to increase the attack's efficiency, a further objective is to balance its effect, so that it acts on the entire image domain instead of isolated point-wise predictions. This often comes at the cost of optimization stability and thus efficiency. Here, we propose CosPGD, an attack that encourages more balanced errors over the entire image domain while increasing the attack's overall efficiency. To this end, CosPGD leverages a simple alignment score computed from any pixel-wise prediction and its target to scale the loss in a smooth and fully differentiable way. It leads to efficient evaluations of a model's robustness for semantic segmentation as well as regression models (such as optical flow, disparity estimation, or image restoration), and it allows it to outperform the previous SotA attack on semantic segmentation.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "A promising approach to preserving model performance in linearized transformers is to employ position-based re-weighting functions. However, state-of-the-art re-weighting functions rely heavily on target sequence lengths, making it difficult or impossible to apply them to autoregressive and simultaneous tasks, where the target and sometimes even the input sequence length are unknown. To address this issue, we propose Learned Proportions (LeaP) and LeaPformers. Our contribution is built on two major components. First, we generalize the dependence on explicit positional representations and sequence lengths into dependence on sequence proportions for re-weighting. Second, we replace static positional representations with dynamic proportions derived via a compact module, enabling more flexible attention concentration patterns. We evaluate LeaPformer against eight representative efficient transformers on the Long-Range Arena benchmark, where we show that LeaPformer achieves the best quality-throughput trade-off, as well as apply LeaPformer to Wikitext-103b autoregressive language modeling and simultaneous speech-to-text translation for two language pairs, achieving competitive results in both tasks",

    "abstract": "We study the feasibility of identifying epistemic uncertainty (reflecting a lack of knowledge), as opposed to aleatoric uncertainty (reflecting entropy in the underlying distribution), in the outputs of large language models (LLMs) over free-form text. In the absence of ground-truth probabilities, we explore a setting where, in order to (approximately) disentangle a given LLM's uncertainty, a significantly larger model stands in as a proxy for the ground truth. We show that small linear probes trained on the embeddings of frozen, pretrained models accurately predict when larger models will be more confident at the token level and that probes trained on one text domain generalize to others. Going further, we propose a fully unsupervised method that achieves non-trivial accuracy on the same task. Taken together, we interpret these results as evidence that LLMs naturally contain internal representations of different types of uncertainty that could potentially be leveraged to devise more informative indicators of model confidence in diverse practical settings.

    "abstract": "Cardinality sketches are popular data structures that enhance the efficiency of working with large data sets. The sketches are randomized representations of sets that are only of logarithmic size but can support set merges and approximate cardinality (i.e., distinct count) queries. When queries are not adaptive, that is, they do not depend on preceding query responses, the design provides strong guarantees of correctly answering a number of queries exponential in the sketch size $k$. In this work, we investigate the performance of cardinality sketches in adaptive settings and unveil inherent vulnerabilities. We design an attack against the \"standard\" estimators that constructs an adversarial input by post-processing responses to a set of simple non-adaptive queries of size linear in the sketch size $k$. Empirically, our attack used only $4k$ queries with the widely used HyperLogLog (HLL++) Flajolet et al., 2007; Heule et al., 2013) sketch. The simple attack technique suggests it can be effective with post-processed natural workloads. Finally and importantly, we demonstrate that the vulnerability is inherent as any estimator applied to known sketch structures can be attacked using a number of queries that is quadratic in $k$, matching a generic upper bound",

However, most such problems are still solved heuristically by hand rather than optimally by state-of-the-art solvers because the expertise required to formulate and solve these problems limits the widespread adoption of optimization tools and techniques.

OptiMUS can develop mathematical models, write and debug solver code, evaluate the generated solutions, and improve its model and code based on these evaluations. OptiMUS utilizes a modular structure to process problems, allowing it to handle problems with long descriptions and complex data without long prompts. Experiments demonstrate that OptiMUS outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on easy datasets by more than $20$% and on hard datasets (including a new dataset, NLP4LP, released with this paper that features long and complex problems) by more than $30$%.

Motivated by this design choice, we undertake a formal study that (i) formulates the notion of flat minima, and (ii) studies the complexity of finding them. Specifically, we adopt the trace of the Hessian of the cost function as a measure of flatness, and use it to formally define the notion of approximate flat minima. Under this notion, we then analyze algorithms that find approximate flat minima efficiently. For general cost functions, we discuss a gradient-based algorithm that finds an approximate flat local minimum efficiently. The main component of the algorithm is to use gradients computed from randomly perturbed iterates to estimate a direction that leads to flatter minima. For the setting where the cost function is an empirical risk over training data, we present a faster algorithm that is inspired by a recently proposed practical algorithm called sharpness-aware minimization, supporting its success in practice",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "It is known that when the statistical models are singular, i.e., the Fisher information matrix at the true parameter is degenerate, the fixed step-size gradient descent algorithm takes polynomial number of steps in terms of the sample size $n$ to converge to a final statistical radius around the true parameter, which can be unsatisfactory for the practical application. To further improve that computational complexity, we consider utilizing the local curvature information for parameter estimation. Even though there is a rich literature in using the local curvature information for optimization, the statistical rate of these methods in statistical models, to the best of our knowledge, has not been studied rigorously. The major challenge of this problem is due to the non-convex nature of sample loss function. To shed light on these problems, we specifically study the normalized gradient descent (NormGD) algorithm, a variant of gradient descent algorithm whose step size is scaled by the maximum eigenvalue of the Hessian matrix of the empirical loss function, and deal with the aforementioned issue with a population-to-sample analysis. When the population loss function is homogeneous, the NormGD iterates reach a final statistical radius around the true parameter after a logarithmic number of iterations in terms of $n$. Therefore, for fixed dimension $d$, the NormGD algorithm achieves the optimal computational complexity $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ to reach the final statistical radius, which is cheaper than the complexity $\\mathcal{O}(n^{\\tau})$ of the fixed step-size gradient descent algorithm for some $\\tau > 1$",

Specifically, iDEM alternates between (I) sampling regions of high model density from a diffusion-based sampler and (II) using these samples in our stochastic matching objective to further improve the sampler. iDEM is scalable to high dimensions as the inner matching objective, is simulation-free, and requires no MCMC samples. Moreover, by leveraging the fast mode mixing behavior of diffusion, iDEM smooths out the energy landscape enabling efficient exploration and learning of an amortized sampler. We evaluate iDEM on a suite of tasks ranging from standard synthetic energy functions to invariant $n$-body particle systems.

While the mechanisms underlying ICL are well-studied in the context of synthetic problems like in-context linear regression, there is still some divergence between these model problems and the \"real\" ICL exhibited by LMs trained on large text corpora. In this paper, we study ICL through the lens of a new family of model problems we term in context language learning (ICLL). In ICLL, LMs are presented with a set of strings from a formal language, and must generate additional strings from the same language. We focus on in- context learning of regular languages generated by random finite automata. We evaluate a diverse set of neural sequence models on regular ICLL tasks. We first show that Transformers significantly outperform neural sequence models with recurrent or convolutional representations on ICLL tasks. Next, we provide evidence that they do so by computing in-context n-gram statistics using specialized attention heads. Finally, we show that hard-wiring these heads into neural models improves performance not just on synthetic ICLL, but natural language modeling, reducing the perplexity of 340M-parameter Transformers by up to 1.14 points (6.7%) on the SlimPajama dataset.

Conventional sequential importance resampling (SIR) particle filters suffer from fundamental limitations, in scenarios involving degenerate likelihoods or high-dimensional states, due to the weight degeneracy issue. In this paper, we explore an alternative method, which is based on estimating the Brenier optimal transport (OT) map from the current prior distribution of the state to the posterior distribution at the next time step. Unlike SIR particle filters, the OT formulation does not require the analytical form of the likelihood. Moreover, it allows us to harness the approximation power of neural networks to model complex and multi-modal distributions and employ stochastic optimization algorithms to enhance scalability. Extensive numerical experiments are presented that compare the OT method to the SIR particle filter and the ensemble Kalman filter, evaluating the performance in terms of sample efficiency, high-dimensional scalability, and the ability to capture complex and multi-modal distributions",

    "title": "Remembering to Be Fair: Non-Markovian Fairness in Sequential Decision Making",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Fair decision making has largely been studied with respect to a single decision. Here we investigate the notion of fairness in the context of sequential decision making where multiple stakeholders can be affected by the outcomes of decisions. We observe that fairness often depends on the history of the sequential decision-making process, and in this sense that it is inherently non-Markovian. We further observe that fairness often needs to be assessed at time points within the process, not just at the end of the process. To advance our understanding of this class of fairness problems, we explore the notion of non-Markovian fairness in the context of sequential decision making. We identify properties of non-Markovian fairness, including notions of long-term, anytime, periodic, and bounded fairness. We explore the interplay between non-Markovian fairness and memory and how memory can support construction of fair policies. Finally, we introduce the FairQCM algorithm, which can automatically augment its training data to improve sample efficiency in the synthesis of fair policies via reinforcement learning",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Generative models inspired by dynamical transport of measure – such as flows and diffusions – construct a continuous-time map between two probability densities. Conventionally, one of these is the target density, only accessible through samples, while the other is taken as a simple base density that is data-agnostic. In this work, using the framework of stochastic interpolants, we formalize how to couple the base and the target densities, whereby samples from the base are computed conditionally given samples from the target in a way that is different from (but does not preclude) incorporating information about class labels or continuous embeddings. This enables us to construct dynamical transport maps that serve as conditional generative models. We show that these transport maps can be learned by solving a simple square loss regression problem analogous to the standard independent setting. We demonstrate the usefulness of constructing dependent couplings in practice through experiments in super-resolution and in-painting.

    "abstract": "The ability to properly benchmark model performance in the face of spurious correlations is important to both build better predictors and increase confidence that models are operating as intended. We demonstrate that characterizing (as opposed to simply quantifying) model mistakes across subgroups is pivotal to properly reflect model biases, which are ignored by standard metrics such as worst-group accuracy or accuracy gap. Inspired by the hypothesis testing framework, we introduce SkewSize, a principled and flexible metric that captures bias from mistakes in a model's predictions. It can be used in multi-class settings or generalised to the open vocabulary setting of generative models. SkewSize is an aggregation of the effect size of the interaction between two categorical variables: the spurious variable representing the bias attribute the model's prediction. We demonstrate the utility of SkewSize in multiple settings including: standard vision models trained on synthetic data, vision models trained on ImageNet, and large scale vision-and-language models from the BLIP-2 family. In each case, the proposed SkewSize is able to highlight biases not captured by other metrics, while also providing insights on the impact of recently proposed techniques, such as instruction tuning",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel online evaluation protocol for Test Time Adaptation (TTA) methods, which penalizes slower methods by providing them with fewer samples for adaptation. TTA methods leverage unlabeled data at test time to adapt to distribution shifts. Though many effective methods have been proposed, their impressive performance usually comes at the cost of significantly increased computation budgets. Current evaluation protocols overlook the effect of this extra computation cost, affecting their real-world applicability. To address this issue, we propose a more realistic evaluation protocol for TTA methods, where data is received in an online fashion from a constant-speed data stream, thereby accounting for the method's adaptation speed. We apply our proposed protocol to benchmark several TTA methods on multiple datasets and scenarios. Extensive experiments shows that, when accounting for inference speed, simple and fast approaches can outperform more sophisticated but slower methods. For example, SHOT from 2020, outperforms the state-of-the-art method SAR from 2023 under our online setting. Our results reveal the importance of developing practical TTA methods that are both accurate and efficient",

We formalize how these disparities evolve over time by modeling weight dynamics (evolution of expected gradient and weight norms) of networks with normalization layers, predicting the evolution of layer-wise ELR ratios. We prove that when training with any constant learning rate, ELR ratios converge to 1, despite initial gradient explosion. We identify a \"critical learning rate\" beyond which ELR disparities widen, which only depends on current ELRs. To validate our findings, we devise a hyper-parameter-free warm-up method that successfully minimizes ELR spread quickly in theory and practice. Our experiments link ELR spread with trainability, a relationship that is most evident in very deep networks with significant gradient magnitude excursions",

In this work, we introduce round-trip correctness (RTC) as an alternative evaluation method. RTC allows Code LLM evaluation on a broader spectrum of real-world software domains without the need for costly human curation. RTC rests on the idea that we can ask a model to make a prediction (e.g., describe some code using natural language), feed that prediction back (e.g., synthesize code from the predicted description), and check if this round-trip leads to code that is semantically equivalent to the original input. We show how to employ RTC to evaluate code synthesis and editing. We find that RTC strongly correlates with model performance on existing narrow-domain code synthesis benchmarks while allowing us to expand to a much broader set of domains and tasks which was not previously possible without costly human annotations",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) can store a vast amount of world knowledge, often extractable via question-answering (e.g., \"What is Abraham Lincoln's birthday?\"). However, do they answer such questions based on exposure to similar questions during training (i.e., cheating), or by genuinely learning to extract knowledge from sources like Wikipedia? In this paper, we investigate this issue using a controlled biography dataset. We find a strong correlation between the model's ability to extract knowledge and various diversity measures of the training data. Essentially, for knowledge to be reliably extracted, it must be sufficiently augmented (e.g., through paraphrasing, sentence shuffling) during pretraining. Without such augmentation, knowledge may be memorized but not extractable, leading to 0% accuracy, regardless of subsequent instruction fine-tuning. To understand why this occurs, we employ (nearly) linear probing to demonstrate a strong connection between the observed correlation and how the model internally encodes knowledge — whether it is linearly encoded in the hidden embeddings of entity names or distributed across other token embeddings in the training text. This paper provides several key recommendations for LLM pretraining in the industry: (1) rewrite the pretraining data — using small, auxiliary models — to provide knowledge augmentation, and (2) incorporate more instruction-finetuning data into the pretraining stage before it becomes too late",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The possibility of adversarial (a.k.a., Byzantine) clients makes federated learning (FL) prone to arbitrary manipulation. The natural approach to robustify FL against adversarial clients is to replace the simple averaging operation at the server in the standard $\\mathsf{FedAvg}$ algorithm by a robust averaging rule. While a significant amount of work has been devoted to studying the convergence of federated robust averaging (which we denote by $\\mathsf{FedRo}$), prior work has largely ignored the impact of client subsampling and local steps, two fundamental FL characteristics. While client subsampling increases the effective fraction of Byzantine clients, local steps increase the drift between the local updates computed by honest (i.e., non-Byzantine) clients. Consequently, a careless deployment of $\\mathsf{FedRo}$ could yield poor performance. We validate this observation by presenting an in-depth analysis of $\\mathsf{FedRo}$ tightly analyzing the impact of client subsampling and local steps. Specifically, we present a sufficient condition on client subsampling for nearly-optimal convergence of $\\mathsf{FedRo}$ (for smooth non-convex loss). Also, we show that the rate of improvement in learning accuracy diminishes with respect to the number of clients subsampled, as soon as the sample size exceeds a threshold value. Interestingly, we also observe that under a careful choice of step-sizes, the learning error due to Byzantine clients decreases with the number of local steps.

Yet, without additional precautions, curious users can still leverage models obtained from their peers to violate privacy. In this paper, we propose Decor, a variant of decentralized SGD with differential privacy (DP) guarantees. Essentially, in Decor, users securely exchange randomness seeds in one communication round to generate pairwise-canceling correlated Gaussian noises, which are injected to protect local models at every communication round. We theoretically and empirically show that, for arbitrary connected graphs, Decor matches the central DP optimal privacy-utility trade-off. We do so under SecLDP, our new relaxation of local DP, which protects all user communications against an external eavesdropper and curious users, assuming that every pair of connected users shares a secret, i.e., an information hidden to all others. The main theoretical challenge is to control the accumulation of non-canceling correlated noise due to network sparsity. We also propose a companion SecLDP privacy accountant for public use",

Then, using powerful tools for probabilistic modeling, we estimate the discrepancy density, and we measure its statistical diversity using our proposed metric for statistical dissimilarity. In turn, this allows us to derive a data-driven score that expresses the uncertainty of the regression outcome.

    "abstract": "Developments in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), and particularly large language models (LLMs), have created a 'perfect storm' for observing 'sparks' of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) that are spurious. Like simpler models, LLMs distill meaningful representations in their latent embeddings that have been shown to correlate with external variables. Nonetheless, the correlation of such representations has often been linked to human-like intelligence in the latter but not the former. We probe models of varying complexity including random projections, matrix decompositions, deep autoencoders and transformers: all of them successfully distill information that can be used to predict latent or external variables and yet none of them have previously been linked to AGI. We argue and empirically demonstrate that the finding of meaningful patterns in latent spaces of models cannot be seen as evidence in favor of AGI. Additionally, we review literature from the social sciences that shows that humans are prone to seek such patterns and anthropomorphize. We conclude that both the methodological setup and common public image of AI are ideal for the misinterpretation that correlations between model representations and some variables of interest are 'caused' by the model's understanding of underlying 'ground truth' relationships. We, therefore, call for the academic community to exercise extra caution, and to be keenly aware of principles of academic integrity, in interpreting and communicating about AI research outcomes",

In this paper we show that it is possible to use improper GP priors with infinite variance to define processes that are stationary but not mean reverting. To this aim, we use of non-positive kernels that can only be defined in this limit regime. The resulting posterior distributions can be computed analytically and it involves a simple correction of the usual formulas. The main contribution of the paper is the introduction of a large family of smooth non-reverting covariance functions that closely resemble the kernels commonly used in the GP literature (e.g. squared exponential and Matérn class). By analyzing both synthetic and real data, we demonstrate that these non-positive kernels solve some known pathologies of mean reverting GP regression while retaining most of the favorable properties of ordinary smooth stationary kernels",

Unfortunately, the scalable application of hypergraph models has been hampered by the non-linearity of the hypergraph Laplacian. In this paper, we present highly scalable algorithms for hypergraph primitives, such as hypergraph PageRank vectors and hypergraph Laplacian systems, over general families of hypergraphs. In addition to giving strong theoretical guarantees, we empirically showcase the speed of our algorithms on benchmark instances of semi-supervised learning on categorical data. We exploit their generality to improve semi-supervised manifold clustering via hypergraph models. By providing significant speed-ups on fundamental hypergraph tasks, our algorithms enable the deployment of hypergraph models on a massive scale",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "To make accurate predictions, understand mechanisms, and design interventions in systems of many variables, we wish to learn causal graphs from large scale data. Unfortunately the space of all possible causal graphs is enormous so scalably and accurately searching for the best fit to the data is a challenge. In principle we could substantially decrease the search space, or learn the graph entirely, by testing the conditional independence of variables. However, deciding if two variables are adjacent in a causal graph may require an exponential number of tests. Here we build a scalable and flexible method to evaluate if two variables are adjacent in a causal graph, the Differentiable Adjacency Test (DAT). DAT replaces an exponential number of tests with a provably equivalent relaxed problem. It then solves this problem by training two neural networks. We build a graph learning method based on DAT, DAT-Graph, that can also learn from data with interventions. DAT-Graph can learn graphs of 1000 variables with state of the art accuracy. Using the graph learned by DAT-Graph, we also build models that make much more accurate predictions of the effects of interventions on large scale RNA sequencing data",

Prior to this study, existing bounds on the generalization error in the over-parametrized regime were uninformative, limiting our understanding of over-parameterized network performance. Our novel approach involves deriving upper bounds within the mean-field regime for evaluating the generalization error of these graph neural networks. We establish upper bounds with a convergence rate of $O(1/n)$, where $n$ is the number of graph samples. These upper bounds offer a theoretical assurance of the networks' performance on unseen data in the challenging over-parameterized regime and overall contribute to our understanding of their performance",

We propose exploration objectives—policy optimization objectives that enable downstream maximization of any reward function—as a conceptual framework to systematize the study of exploration. We introduce a new objective, L1-Coverage, which generalizes previous exploration schemes and supports three fundamental desiderata: 1. Intrinsic complexity control. L1-Coverage is associated with a structural parameter, L1-Coverability, which reflects the intrinsic statistical difficulty of the underlying MDP, subsuming Block and Low-Rank MDPs. 2. Efficient planning. For a known MDP, L1-Coverage efficiently reduces to standard policy optimization, allowing flexible integration with off-the-shelf methods such as policy gradient and Q-learning approaches. 3. Efficient exploration. L1-Coverage enables the first computationally efficient model-based and model-free algorithms for online (reward-free or reward-driven) reinforcement learning in MDPs with low coverability. Empirically, we find that L1-Coverage effectively drives off-the-shelf policy optimization algorithms to explore the state space",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In recent years, the state-of-the-art in deep learning has been dominated by very large models that have been pre-trained on vast amounts of data. The paradigm is very simple: investing more computational resources (optimally) leads to better performance, and even predictably so; neural scaling laws have been derived that accurately forecast the performance of a network for a desired level of compute. This leads to the notion of a 'compute-optimal' model, i.e. a model that allocates a given level of compute during training optimally to maximize performance. In this work, we extend the concept of optimality by allowing for an 'adaptive' model, i.e. a model that can change its shape during training. By doing so, we can design adaptive models that optimally traverse between the underlying scaling laws and outpace their ‘static' counterparts, leading to a significant reduction in the required compute to reach a given target performance. We show that our approach generalizes across modalities and different shape parameters",

    "abstract": "Certification for machine learning is proving that no adversarial sample can evade a model within a range under certain conditions, a necessity for safety-critical domains. Common certification methods for segmentation use a flat set of fine-grained classes, leading to high abstain rates due to model uncertainty across many classes. We propose a novel, more practical setting, which certifies pixels within a multi-level hierarchy, and adaptively relaxes the certification to a coarser level for unstable components classic methods would abstain from, effectively lowering the abstain rate whilst providing more certified semantically meaningful information. We mathematically formulate the problem setup, introduce an adaptive hierarchical certification algorithm and prove the correctness of its guarantees. Since certified accuracy does not take the loss of information into account for coarser classes, we introduce the Certified Information Gain ($\\mathrm{CIG}$) metric, which is proportional to the class granularity level. Our extensive experiments on the datasets Cityscapes, PASCAL-Context, ACDC and COCO-Stuff demonstrate that our adaptive algorithm achieves a higher $\\mathrm{CIG}$ and lower abstain rate compared to the current state-of-the-art certification method.

However, the SMO iteration is still costly due to the observation noise—one observation at a point typically requires averaging over hundreds to thousands of repeated quantum measurement shots for achieving a reasonable noise level. In this paper, we propose an adaptive cost control method, named subspace in confident region (SubsCoRe), for SMO. SubsCoRe uses the Gaussian process (GP) surrogate, and requires it to have low uncertainty over the subspace being updated, so that optimization in each iteration is performed with guaranteed accuracy. Adaptive cost control is performed by setting the required accuracy according to the progress of the optimization, and identifying the minimum number of measurement shots, as well as their distribution, satisfying the SubsCoRe requirement",

However, these methods achieve scalability at the cost of an increase in the number of necessary iterations, resulting in slower convergence as the problem size grows. Furthermore, they require iteration-dependent parameter schedules that prohibit effective utilization of warm-start initializations important in practical applications with incrementally-arriving data or mixed-integer programming. We present Unified Spectral Bundling with Sketching (USBS), a provably correct, fast and scalable algorithm for solving massive SDPs that can leverage a warm-start initialization to further accelerate convergence. Our proposed algorithm is a spectral bundle method for solving general SDPs containing both equality and inequality constraints. Moveover, when augmented with an optional matrix sketching technique, our algorithm achieves the dramatically improved scalability of previous work while sustaining convergence speed. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across multiple applications, with and without warm-starting. For example, USBS provides a 500x speed-up over the state-of-the-art scalable SDP solver on an instance with over 2 billion decision variables.

However, in reality, many practical applications still depend on well-established but non-automatic-differentiable legacy codes, which prevents practitioners from applying the state-of-the-art research to their own problems. To resolve this problem, we propose a non-intrusive methodology with a novel gradient estimation technique to combine machine learning and legacy numerical codes without any modification.

    "abstract": "Recent work has shown that attention-based language models excel at \"recall\", the ability to ground generations in tokens previously seen in context. However, the efficiency of attention-based models is bottle-necked during inference by the KV-cache's aggressive memory consumption. In this work, we explore whether we can improve language model efficiency (e.g. by reducing memory consumption) without compromising on recall. By applying experiments and theory to a broad set of architectures, we identify a key tradeoff between a model's recurrent state size and recall ability. We show that efficient alternatives to attention (e.g. H3, Mamba, RWKV) maintain a fixed-size recurrent state, but struggle at recall. We propose BASED a simple architecture combining linear and sliding window attention. By varying BASED window size and linear attention feature dimension, we can dial the state size and traverse the Pareto frontier of the recall-memory tradeoff curve, recovering the full quality of attention on one end and the small state size of attention-alternatives on the other. We train language models up to $1.3$b parameters and show that BASED matches the strongest sub-quadratic models (e.g. Mamba) in perplexity and outperforms them on real-world recall-intensive tasks by 10.36 accuracy points. We further develop IO-aware algorithms that enable BASED to provide 24× higher throughput on language generation than FlashAttention-2, when generating 1024 tokens using 1.3b parameter models. Overall, BASED expands the Pareto frontier of the throughput-recall tradeoff space beyond prior architectures",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We consider the problem of localizing change points in high-dimensional linear regression. We propose an Approximate Message Passing (AMP) algorithm for estimating both the signals and the change point locations. Assuming Gaussian covariates, we give an exact asymptotic characterization of its estimation performance in the limit where the number of samples grows proportionally to the signal dimension. Our algorithm can be tailored to exploit any prior information on the signal, noise, and change points. It also enables uncertainty quantification in the form of an efficiently computable approximate posterior distribution, whose asymptotic form we characterize exactly. We validate our theory via numerical experiments, and demonstrate the favorable performance of our estimators on both synthetic data and images",

    "abstract": "Non-linear mixed-effects models are a powerful tool for studying heterogeneous populations in various fields, including biology, medicine, economics, and engineering. Here, the aim is to find a distribution over the parameters that describe the whole population using a model that can generate simulations for an individual of that population. However, fitting these distributions to data is computationally challenging if the description of individuals is complex and the population is large. To address this issue, we propose a novel machine learning-based approach: We exploit neural density estimation based on conditional normalizing flows to approximate individual-specific posterior distributions in an amortized fashion, thereby allowing for efficient inference of population parameters. Applying this approach to problems from cell biology and pharmacology, we demonstrate its unseen flexibility and scalability to large data sets compared to established methods",

    "abstract": "The effectiveness of neural processes (NPs) in modelling posterior prediction maps—the mapping from data to posterior predictive distributions—has significantly improved since their inception. This improvement can be attributed to two principal factors: (1) advancements in the architecture of permutation invariant set functions, which are intrinsic to all NPs; and (2) leveraging symmetries present in the true posterior predictive map, which are problem dependent. Transformers are a notable development in permutation invariant set functions, and their utility within NPs has been demonstrated through the family of models we refer to as TNPs. Despite significant interest in TNPs, little attention has been given to incorporating symmetries. Notably, the posterior prediction maps for data that are stationary—a common assumption in spatio-temporal modelling—exhibit translation equivariance. In this paper, we introduce of a new family of translation equivariant TNPs that incorporate translation equivariance. Through an extensive range of experiments on synthetic and real-world spatio-temporal data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of TE-TNPs relative to their non-translation-equivariant counterparts and other NP baselines",

This approach aims to reduce redundant memory IO costs, a significant factor in latency for high batch sizes and long context lengths. Bifurcated attention achieves this by dividing the attention mechanism during incremental decoding into two distinct GEMM operations, focusing on the KV cache from prefill and the decoding process. This method ensures precise computation and maintains the usual computational load (FLOPs) of standard attention mechanisms, but with reduced memory IO. Bifurcated attention is also compatible with multi-query attention mechanism known for reduced memory IO for KV cache, further enabling higher batch size and context length. The resulting efficiency leads to lower latency, improving suitability for real-time applications, e.g., enabling massively-parallel answer generation without substantially increasing latency, enhancing performance when integrated with post-processing techniques such as reranking",

Our main result is a precise characterization of the tradeoff between the accuracy of a learning algorithm and its CMI, answering an open question posed by Livni (2023). We show that, in the $L^2$ Lipschitz–bounded setting and under strong convexity, every learner with an excess error $\\epsilon$ has CMI bounded below by $\\Omega(1/\\epsilon^2)$ and $\\Omega(1/\\epsilon)$, respectively. We further demonstrate the essential role of memorization in learning problems in SCO by designing an adversary capable of accurately identifying a significant fraction of the training samples in specific SCO problems.

Notably, for linear regression, an approximate compression of size linear in the dimension is constructed. Moreover, for $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_\\infty$ losses, we can even exhibit an efficient exact sample compression scheme of size linear in the dimension. We further show that for every other $\\ell_p$ loss, $p\\in (1,\\infty)$, there does not exist an exact agnostic compression scheme of bounded size. This refines and generalizes a negative result of David, Moran, and Yehudayoff (2016) for the $\\ell_2$ loss.

For the $\\ell_2$ loss, does every function class admit an approximate compression scheme of polynomial size in the fat-shattering dimension?

    "abstract": "Constant (naive) imputation is still widely used in practice as this is a first easy-to-use technique to deal with missing data. Yet, this simple method could be expected to induce a large bias for prediction purposes, as the imputed input may strongly differ from the true underlying data. However, recent works suggest that this bias is low in the context of high-dimensional linear predictors when data is supposed to be missing completely at random (MCAR). This paper completes the picture for linear predictors by confirming the intuition that the bias is negligible and that surprisingly naive imputation also remains relevant in very low dimension. To this aim, we consider a unique underlying random features model, which offers a rigorous framework for studying predictive performances, whilst the dimension of the observed features varies. Building on these theoretical results, we establish finite-sample bounds on stochastic gradient (SGD) predictors applied to zero-imputed data, a strategy particularly well suited for large-scale learning. If the MCAR assumption appears to be strong, we show that similar favorable behaviors occur for more complex missing data scenarios",

    "title": "Bipartite Matching in Massive Graphs: A Tight Analysis of EDCS",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Maximum matching is one of the most fundamental combinatorial optimization problems with applications in various contexts such as balanced clustering, data mining, resource allocation, and online advertisement. In many of these applications, the input graph is massive. The sheer size of these inputs makes it impossible to store the whole graph in the memory of a single machine and process it there. Graph sparsification has been an extremely powerful tool to alleviate this problem. In this paper, we study a highly successful and versatile sparsifier for the matching problem: the edge-degree constrained subgraph (EDCS) introduced first by Bernstein & Stein 2015 The EDCS has a parameter $\\beta \\geq 2$ which controls the density of the sparsifier. It has been shown through various proofs in the literature that by picking a subgraph with $O(n\\beta)$ edges, the EDCS includes a matching of size at least $2/3-O(1/\\beta)$ times the maximum matching size. As such, by increasing $\\beta$ the approximation ratio of EDCS gets closer and closer to $2/3$. In this paper, we propose a new approach for analyzing the approximation ratio of EDCS. Our analysis is tight for any value of $\\beta$. Namely, we pinpoint the precise approximation ratio of EDCS for any sparsity parameter $\\beta$. Our analysis reveals that one does not necessarily need to increase $\\beta$ to improve approximation, as suggested by previous analysis. In particular, the best choice turns out to be $\\beta = 6$, which achieves an approximation ratio of $.677$! This is arguably surprising as it is even better than $2/3 \\sim .666$, the bound that was widely believed to be the limit for EDCS",

In particular, we show that, in the long run, (a) the problem's critical region is visited exponentially more often than any non-critical region; (b) the iterates of SGD are exponentially concentrated around the problem's minimum energy state (which does not always coincide with the global minimum of the objective); (c) all other connected components of critical points are visited with frequency that is exponentially proportional to their energy level; and, finally, (d) any component of local maximizers or saddle points is \"dominated\" by a component of local minimizers which is visited exponentially more often",

These techniques enable a single network to fit over a hundred unique scenes. We further demonstrate that HyperFields learns a more general map between text and NeRFs, and consequently is capable of predicting novel in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenes — either zero-shot or with a few finetuning steps. Finetuning HyperFields benefits from accelerated convergence thanks to the learned general map, and is capable of synthesizing novel scenes 5 to 10 times faster than existing neural optimization-based methods.

Training of DWNs is enabled by a novel Extended Finite Difference technique for approximate differentiation of binary values. We propose Learnable Mapping, Learnable Reduction, and Spectral Regularization to further improve the accuracy and efficiency of these models. We evaluate DWNs in three edge computing contexts: (1) an FPGA-based hardware accelerator, where they demonstrate superior latency, throughput, energy efficiency, and model area compared to state-of-the-art solutions, (2) a low-power microcontroller, where they achieve preferable accuracy to XGBoost while subject to stringent memory constraints, and (3) ultra-low-cost chips, where they consistently outperform small models in both accuracy and projected hardware area. DWNs also compare favorably against leading approaches for tabular datasets, with higher average rank. Overall, our work positions DWNs as a pioneering solution for edge-compatible high-throughput neural networks",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Can a mere next-token predictor faithfully model human thinking? Our work is aimed at crystallizing this intuitive concern, which is currently fragmented in the literature. First, we emphasize isolating the two phases of next-token prediction that are often conflated: autoregression during inference vs. teacher-forcing during training. We argue that the previously-identified problem of \"exponential error accumulation\" is a symptom of autoregressive inference. But more concerningly, we identify that teacher-forcing can let the model fit the training data by cheating, causing total in-distribution failure. We design a minimal planning task where empirically both the Transformer and the Mamba architecture fail in this manner - remarkably, despite the task being easy to learn. Overall, our work consolidates these and other essential arguments surrounding next-token prediction. We hope this effort can ground future discussions and inspire explorations beyond the next-token prediction paradigm",

This motivates further understanding of how neural networks can replicate reasoning steps with relational data. In this work, we study the ability of transformer networks to simulate algorithms on graphs from a theoretical perspective. The architecture we use is a looped transformer with extra attention heads that interact with the graph. We prove by construction that this architecture can simulate individual algorithms such as Dijkstra's shortest path, Breadth- and Depth-First Search, and Kosaraju's strongly connected components, as well as multiple algorithms simultaneously. The number of parameters in the networks does not increase with the input graph size, which implies that the networks can simulate the above algorithms for any graph. Despite this property, we show a limit to simulation in our solution due to finite precision. Finally, we show a Turing Completeness result with constant width when the extra attention heads are utilized",

    "abstract": "In adversarial defense, adversarial purification can be viewed as a special generation task with the purpose to remove adversarial attacks and diffusion models excel in adversarial purification for their strong generative power. With different predetermined generation requirements, various types of guidance have been proposed, but few of them focuses on adversarial purification. In this work, we propose to guide diffusion models for adversarial purification using contrastive guidance. We theoretically derive the proper noise level added in the forward process diffusion models for adversarial purification from a feature learning perspective. For the reverse process, it is implied that the role of contrastive loss guidance is to facilitate the evolution towards the signal direction. From the theoretical findings and implications, we design the forward process with the proper amount of Gaussian noise added and the reverse process with the gradient of contrastive loss as the guidance of diffusion models for adversarial purification. Empirically, extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark and ImageNet datasets with ResNet and WideResNet classifiers show that our method outperforms most of current adversarial training and adversarial purification methods by a large improvement",

Existing methods for unsupervised RL mainly conduct empowerment-driven skill discovery or entropy-based exploration. However, empowerment often leads to static skills, and pure exploration only maximizes the state coverage rather than learning useful behaviors. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised RL framework via an ensemble of skills, where each skill performs partition exploration based on the state prototypes. Thus, each skill can explore the clustered area locally, and the ensemble skills maximize the overall state coverage. We adopt state-distribution constraints for the skill occupancy and the desired cluster for learning distinguishable skills. Theoretical analysis is provided for the state entropy and the resulting skill distributions. Based on extensive experiments on several challenging tasks, we find our method learns well-explored ensemble skills and achieves superior performance in various downstream tasks compared to previous methods",

From this, we derive the Prompt Matching method, allowing us to train hijacks matching the behaviour of an arbitrary user-defined text prompt (e.g. 'the Eiffel Tower is now located in Rome') using a generic, off-the-shelf dataset unrelated to our choice of prompt. We use Behaviour matching to craft hijacks for four types of attack: forcing VLMs to generate outputs of the adversary's choice, leak information from their context window, override their safety training, and believe false statements. We study these attacks against LLaVA, a state-of-the-art VLM based on CLIP and LLaMA-2, and find that all attack types achieve a success rate of over 80%.

We take a different perspective on disentanglement by analyzing topological properties of data manifolds. In particular, we optimize the topological similarity for data manifolds traversals. To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first one to propose a differentiable topological loss for disentanglement learning. Our experiments have shown that the proposed TopDis loss improves disentanglement scores such as MIG, FactorVAE score, SAP score, and DCI disentanglement score with respect to state-of-the-art results while preserving the reconstruction quality. Our method works in an unsupervised manner, permitting us to apply it to problems without labeled factors of variation. The TopDis loss works even when factors of variation are correlated.

The attackability condition depends on the intrinsic properties of the corresponding CMAB instance such as the reward distributions of super arms and outcome distributions of base arms. Additionally, we devise an attack algorithm for attackable CMAB instances. Contrary to prior understanding of multi-armed bandits, our work reveals a surprising fact that the attackability of a specific CMAB instance also depends on whether the bandit instance is known or unknown to the adversary. This finding indicates that adversarial attacks on CMAB are difficult in practice and a general attack strategy for any CMAB instance does not exist since the environment is mostly unknown to the adversary.

Our theoretical findings further enable the design of novel principled solutions applicable to state-of-the-art LLMs. First, we show that, through our geometric understanding, we can bypass LLMs' RLHF protection by controlling the embedding's intrinsic dimension through informed prompt manipulation. Second, we derive interpretable geometrical features that can be extracted from any (pre-trained) LLM, providing a rich abstract representation of their inputs. We observe that these features are sufficient to help solve toxicity detection, and even allow the identification of various types of toxicity.

    "abstract": "Input space reconstruction is an attractive representation learning paradigm. Despite interpretability benefit of reconstruction and generation, we identify a misalignment between learning to reconstruct, and learning for perception. We show that the former allocates a model's capacity towards a subspace of the data explaining the observed variance–a subspace with uninformative features for the latter. For example, the supervised TinyImagenet task with images projected onto the top subspace explaining 90% of the pixel variance can be solved with 45% test accuracy. Using the bottom subspace instead, accounting for only 20% of the pixel variance, reaches 55% test accuracy. Learning by reconstruction is also wasteful as the features for perception are learned last, pushing the need for long training schedules. We finally prove that learning by denoising can alleviate that misalignment for some noise strategies, e.g., masking. While tuning the noise strategy without knowledge of the perception task seems challenging, we provide a solution to detect if a noise strategy is never beneficial regardless of the perception task, e.g., additive Gaussian noise",

In the past few years, autobidding products that provide real-time bidding as a service to advertisers have seen a prominent rise in adoption. A popular autobidding stategy is value maximization subject to return-on-spend (ROS) constraints. For historical or business reasons, the systems that govern these two services, namely budget pacing and ROS pacing, are not necessarily always a single unified and coordinated entity that optimizes a global objective subject to both constraints. The purpose of this work is to theoretically and empirically compare algorithms with different degrees of coordination between these two pacing systems. In particular, we compare (a) a fully-decoupled sequential algorithm; (b) a minimally-coupled min-pacing algorithm; (c) a fully-coupled dual-based algorithm. Our main contribution is to theoretically analyze the min-pacing algorithm and show that it attains similar guarantees to the fully-coupled canonical dual-based algorithm. On the other hand, we show that the sequential algorithm, even though appealing by virtue of being fully decoupled, could badly violate the constraints. We validate our theoretical findings empirically by showing that the min-pacing algorithm performs almost as well as the canonical dual-based algorithm on a semi-synthetic dataset that was generated from a large online advertising platform's auction data",

For any $\\alpha>2$, we show that $D^\\alpha$ seeding guarantees in expectation an approximation factor of \\begin{equation*} O_\\alpha \\left(\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{\\textrm{max}}}{\\sigma_{\\textrm{min}}}\\right)^{2-4/\\alpha}\\cdot (g_\\alpha \\cdot \\min \\lbrace\\ell,\\log k\\rbrace)^{2/\\alpha}\\right) \\end{equation*} with respect to the standard $k$-means cost of any underlying clustering; where $g_\\alpha$ is a parameter capturing the concentration of the points in each cluster, $\\sigma_{\\textrm{max}}$ and $\\sigma_{\\textrm{min}}$ are the maximum and minimum standard deviation of the clusters around their center, and $\\ell$ is the number of distinct mixing weights in the underlying clustering (after rounding them to the nearest power of $2$). For instance, if the underlying clustering is defined by a mixture of $k$ Gaussian distributions with equal cluster variance (up to a constant-factor), then our result implies that: (1) if there are a constant number of mixing weights, any constant $\\alpha>2$ yields a constant-factor approximation; (2) if the mixing weights are arbitrary, any constant $\\alpha>2$ yields an $O\\left(\\log^{2/\\alpha}k\\right)$-approximation, and $\\alpha=\\Theta(\\log\\log k)$ yields an $O(\\log\\log k)^3$-approximation. We complement these results by some lower bounds showing that the dependency on $g_\\alpha$ and $\\sigma_{\\textrm{max}}/\\sigma_{\\textrm{min}}$ is tight. Finally, we provide an experimental validation of the effects of the aforementioned parameters when using $D^\\alpha$ seeding",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "By jointly learning multiple tasks, multi-task learning (MTL) can leverage the shared knowledge across tasks, resulting in improved data efficiency and generalization performance. However, a major challenge in MTL lies in the presence of conflicting gradients, which can hinder the fair optimization of some tasks and subsequently impede MTL's ability to achieve better overall performance. Inspired by fair resource allocation in communication networks, we formulate the optimization of MTL as a utility maximization problem, where the loss decreases across tasks are maximized under different fairness measurements. To address the problem, we propose FairGrad, a novel optimization objective. FairGrad not only enables flexible emphasis on certain tasks but also achieves a theoretical convergence guarantee. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance among gradient manipulation methods on a suite of multi-task benchmarks in supervised learning and reinforcement learning. Furthermore, we incorporate the idea of $\\alpha$-fairness into the loss functions of various MTL methods. Extensive empirical studies demonstrate that their performance can be significantly enhanced. Code is available at https://github.com/OptMN-Lab/fairgrad",

This issue can be mitigated by having the LM verbally convey the probability that its claims are correct, but existing models cannot produce long-form text with calibrated confidence statements. Through the lens of decision-making, we define linguistic calibration for long-form generations: an LM is linguistically calibrated if its generations enable its users to make calibrated probabilistic predictions. This definition enables a training framework where a supervised finetuning step bootstraps an LM to emit long-form generations with confidence statements such as \"I estimate a 30% chance of...\" or \"I am certain that...\", followed by a reinforcement learning step which rewards generations that enable a user to provide calibrated answers to related questions. We linguistically calibrate Llama 2 7B and find in automated and human evaluations of long-form generations that it is significantly more calibrated than strong finetuned factuality baselines with comparable accuracy. These findings generalize under significant domain shifts to scientific and biomedical questions and to an entirely held-out person biography generation task.

This lack of formal guarantees resulted in several research efforts that aim at verifying Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), with a particular focus on safety-critical applications. However, formal verification techniques still face major scalability and precision challenges. The over-approximation introduced during the formal verification process to tackle the scalability challenge often results in inconclusive analysis. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework to generate Verification-Friendly Neural Networks (VNNs). We present a post-training optimization framework to achieve a balance between preserving prediction performance and verification-friendliness. Our proposed framework results in VNNs that are comparable to the original DNNs in terms of prediction performance, while amenable to formal verification techniques.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Local steps are crucial for Federated Learning (FL) algorithms and have witnessed great empirical success in reducing communication costs and improving the generalization performance of deep neural networks. However, there are limited studies on the effect of local steps on heterogeneous FL. A few works investigate this problem from the optimization perspective. Woodworth et al. (2020a) showed that the iteration complexity of Local SGD, the most popular FL algorithm, is dominated by the baseline mini-batch SGD, which does not show the benefits of local steps. In addition, Levy (2023) proposed a new local update method that provably benefits over mini-batch SGD. However, in the same setting, there is still no work analyzing the effects of local steps to generalization in a heterogeneous FL setting. Motivated by our experimental findings where Local SGD learns more distinguishing features than parallel SGD, this paper studies the generalization benefits of local steps from a feature learning perspective. We propose a novel federated data model that exhibits a new form of data heterogeneity, under which we show that a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained by GD with global updates will miss some pattern-related features, while the network trained by GD with local updates can learn all features in polynomial time. Consequently, local steps help CNN generalize better in our data model. In a different parameter setting, we also prove that Local GD with one-shot model averaging can learn all features and generalize well in all clients. Our experimental results also confirm the benefits of local steps in improving test accuracy on real-world data",

    "abstract": "The self-attention mechanism prevails in modern machine learning. It has an interesting functionality of adaptively selecting tokens from an input sequence by modulating the degree of attention localization, which many researchers speculate is the basis of the powerful model performance but complicates the underlying mechanism of the learning dynamics. In recent years, mainly two arguments have connected attention localization to the model performances. One is the rank collapse, where the embedded tokens by a self-attention block become very similar across different tokens, leading to a less expressive network. The other is the entropy collapse, where the attention probability approaches non-uniform and entails low entropy, making the learning dynamics more likely to be trapped in plateaus. These two failure modes may apparently contradict each other because the rank and entropy collapses are relevant to uniform and non-uniform attention, respectively. To this end, we characterize the notion of attention localization by the eigenspectrum of query-key parameter matrices and reveal that a small eigenspectrum variance leads attention to be localized. Interestingly, the small eigenspectrum variance prevents both rank and entropy collapse, leading to better model expressivity and trainability",

For example, given an incomplete picture of a dog, we can guess that there is a tail, but we cannot determine its exact location. In this work, we propose to incorporate location uncertainty to MIM by using stochastic positional embeddings (StoP). Specifically, we condition the model on stochastic masked token positions drawn from a gaussian distribution. We show that using StoP reduces overfitting to location features and guides the model toward learning features that are more robust to location uncertainties. Quantitatively, using StoP improves downstream MIM performance on a variety of downstream tasks.

    "abstract": "Neural networks extract features from data using stochastic gradient descent (SGD). In particular, higher-order input cumulants (HOCs) are crucial for their performance. However, extracting information from the $p$th cumulant of $d$-dimensional inputs is computationally hard: the number of samples required to recover a single direction from an order-$p$ tensor (tensor PCA) using SGD grows as $d^{p−1}$, which is prohibitive for high-dimensional inputs. This result raises the question of how neural networks extract relevant directions from the HOCs of their inputs efficiently. Here, we show that correlations between latent variables along the directions encoded in different input cumulants speed up learning from higher-order correlations. We show this effect analytically by deriving nearly sharp thresholds for the number of samples required by a single neuron to recover these directions using online SGD from a random start in high dimensions.

Taking CIFAR10 as an example, SOTA clean accuracy is about $100$%, but SOTA robustness to $\\ell_{\\infty}$-norm bounded perturbations barely exceeds $70$%. To understand this gap, we analyze how model size, dataset size, and synthetic data quality affect robustness by developing the first scaling laws for adversarial training. Our scaling laws reveal inefficiencies in prior art and provide actionable feedback to advance the field. For instance, we discovered that SOTA methods diverge notably from compute-optimal setups, using excess compute for their level of robustness. Leveraging a compute-efficient setup, we surpass the prior SOTA with $20$% ($70$%) fewer training (inference) FLOPs. We trained various compute-efficient models, with our best achieving $74$% AutoAttack accuracy ($+3$% gain). However, our scaling laws also predict robustness slowly grows then plateaus at $90$%: dwarfing our new SOTA by scaling is impractical, and perfect robustness is impossible. To better understand this predicted limit, we carry out a small-scale human evaluation on the AutoAttack data that fools our top-performing model. Concerningly, we estimate that human performance also plateaus near $90$%, which we show to be attributable to $\\ell_{\\infty}$-constrained attacks' generation of invalid images not consistent with their original labels.

In this paper, we present Neural Diffusion Models (NDMs), a generalization of conventional diffusion models that enables defining and learning time-dependent non-linear transformations of data. We show how to optimise NDMs using a variational bound in a simulation-free setting. Moreover, we derive a time-continuous formulation of NDMs, which allows fast and reliable inference using off-the-shelf numerical ODE and SDE solvers. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of NDMs through experiments on many image generation benchmarks, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, downsampled versions of ImageNet and CelebA-HQ. NDMs outperform conventional diffusion models in terms of likelihood, achieving state-of-the-art results on ImageNet and CelebA-HQ, and produces high-quality samples",

    "title": "Generalization in Kernel Regression Under Realistic Assumptions",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "It is by now well-established that modern over-parameterized models seem to elude the bias-variance tradeoff and generalize well despite overfitting noise. Many recent works attempt to analyze this phenomenon in the relatively tractable setting of kernel regression. However, as we argue in detail, most past works on this topic either make unrealistic assumptions, or focus on a narrow problem setup. This work aims to provide a unified theory to upper bound the excess risk of kernel regression for nearly all common and realistic settings. When applied to common kernels, our results imply benign overfitting in high input dimensions, nearly tempered overfitting in fixed dimensions, and explicit convergence rates for regularized regression. As a by-product, we obtain time-dependent bounds for neural networks trained in the kernel regime. Our results rely on new relative perturbation bounds for the eigenvalues of kernel matrices, which may be of independent interest. These reveal a self-regularization phenomenon, whereby a heavy tail in the eigendecomposition of the kernel implicitly leads to good generalization",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The local and global interpretability of various ML models has been studied extensively in recent years. However, despite significant progress in the field, many known results remain informal or lack sufficient mathematical rigor. We propose a framework for bridging this gap, by using computational complexity theory to assess local and global perspectives of interpreting ML models. We begin by proposing proofs for two novel insights that are essential for our analysis: (1) a duality between local and global forms of explanations; and (2) the inherent uniqueness of certain global explanation forms. We then use these insights to evaluate the complexity of computing explanations, across three model types representing the extremes of the interpretability spectrum: (1) linear models; (2) decision trees; and (3) neural networks. Our findings offer insights into both the local and global interpretability of these models. For instance, under standard complexity assumptions such as P != NP, we prove that selecting global sufficient subsets in linear models is computationally harder than selecting local subsets. Interestingly, with neural networks and decision trees, the opposite is true: it is harder to carry out this task locally than globally. We believe that our findings demonstrate how examining explainability through a computational complexity lens can help us develop a more rigorous grasp of the inherent interpretability of ML models",

To derive a more accurate predictor for the target domain, it is often beneficial to leverage publicly available labeled data from an alternative domain, somewhat close to the target domain. This is the modern problem of supervised domain adaptation from a public source to a private target domain. We present two $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-differentially private adaptation algorithms for supervised adaptation, for which we make use of a general optimization problem, recently shown to benefit from favorable theoretical learning guarantees. Our first algorithm is designed for regression with linear predictors and shown to solve a convex optimization problem. Our second algorithm is a more general solution for loss functions that may be non-convex but Lipschitz and smooth. While our main objective is a theoretical analysis, we also report the results of several experiments. We first show that the non-private versions of our algorithms match state-of-the-art performance in supervised adaptation and that for larger values of the target sample size or $\\epsilon$, the performance of our private algorithms remains close to that of their non-private counterparts",

    "abstract": "Identifying layers within text-to-image models which control visual attributes can facilitate efficient model editing through closed-form updates. Recent work, leveraging causal tracing show that early Stable-Diffusion variants confine knowledge primarily to the first layer of the CLIP text-encoder, while it diffuses throughout the UNet. Extending this framework, we observe that for recent models (e.g., SD-XL, DeepFloyd), causal tracing fails in pinpointing localized knowledge, highlighting challenges in model editing. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of mechanistic localization in text-to-image models, where knowledge about various visual attributes (e.g., \"style\", \"objects\", \"facts\") can be mechanistically localized to a small fraction of layers in the UNet, thus facilitating efficient model editing. We localize knowledge using our method LocoGen which measures the direct effect of intermediate layers to output generation by performing interventions in the cross-attention layers of the UNet. We then employ LocoEdit, a fast closed-form editing method across popular open-source text-to-image models (including the latest SD-XL) and explore the possibilities of neuron-level model editing. Using mechanistic localization, our work offers a better view of successes and failures in localization-based text-to-image model editing",

    "abstract": "Predictions over graphs play a crucial role in various domains, including social networks and medicine. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as the dominant approach for learning on graph data. Although a graph-structure is provided as input to the GNN, in some cases the best solution can be obtained by ignoring it. While GNNs have the ability to ignore the graph-structure in such cases, it is not clear that they will. In this work, we show that GNNs actually tend to overfit the given graph-structure in the sense that they use it even when a better solution can be obtained by ignoring it. We analyze the implicit bias of gradient-descent learning of GNNs and prove that when the ground truth function does not use the graphs, GNNs are not guaranteed to learn a solution that ignores the graph, even with infinite data. We examine this phenomenon with respect to different graph distributions and find that regular graphs are more robust to this overfitting. We also prove that within the family of regular graphs, GNNs are guaranteed to extrapolate when learning with gradient descent. Finally, based on our empirical and theoretical findings, we demonstrate on real-data how regular graphs can be leveraged to reduce graph overfitting and enhance performance",

We therefore propose diffusion tempering, a novel regularization technique for probabilistic numerical methods which improves convergence of gradient-based parameter optimization in ODEs. By iteratively reducing a noise parameter of the probabilistic integrator, the proposed method converges more reliably to the true parameters.

We bridge this gap and design BrainMixer, an unsupervised learning framework that effectively utilizes both functional connectivity and associated time series of voxels to learn voxel-level representation in an unsupervised manner. BrainMixer employs two simple yet effective MLP-based encoders to simultaneously learn the dynamics of voxel-level signals and their functional correlations. To encode voxel activity, BrainMixer fuses information across both time and voxel dimensions via a dynamic attention mechanism. To learn the structure of the functional connectivity, BrainMixer presents a temporal graph patching and encodes each patch by combining its nodes' features via a new adaptive temporal pooling. Our experiments show that BrainMixer attains outstanding performance and outperforms 14 baselines in different downstream tasks and setups",

Since classifiers seldom behave like Bayes classifiers and are influenced by the choice of learning algorithms along with their inherent biases, in this work we initiate the study of how the choice of the learning algorithm plays a role in the success of a collective in practical settings. Specifically, we focus on distributionally robust optimization (DRO), popular for improving a worst group error, and on the ubiquitous stochastic gradient descent (SGD), due to its inductive bias for \"simpler\" functions. Our empirical results, supported by a theoretical foundation, show that the effective size and success of the collective are highly dependent on properties of the learning algorithm.

For accurate uncertainty estimates, neural networks must extract differences in the feature space that quantify uncertainty. This could be achieved by current single-pass approaches that maintain feature distances between data points as they traverse the network. While initial results are promising, maintaining feature distances within the network representations frequently inhibits information compression and opposes the learning objective. We study this effect theoretically and empirically to arrive at a simple conclusion: preserving feature distances in the output is beneficial when the preserved features contribute to learning the label distribution and act in opposition otherwise. We then propose Transitional Uncertainty with Layered Intermediate Predictions (TULIP) as a simple approach to address the shortcomings of current single-pass estimators. Specifically, we implement feature preservation by extracting features from intermediate representations before information is collapsed by subsequent layers. We refer to the underlying preservation mechanism as transitional feature preservation. We show that TULIP matches or outperforms current single-pass methods on standard benchmarks and in practical settings where these methods are less reliable (imbalances, complex architectures, medical modalities)",

    "abstract": "One of the fundamental representation learning tasks is unsupervised sequential disentanglement, where latent codes of inputs are decomposed to a single static factor and a sequence of dynamic factors. To extract this latent information, existing methods condition the static and dynamic codes on the entire input sequence. Unfortunately, these models often suffer from information leakage, i.e., the dynamic vectors encode both static and dynamic information, or vice versa, leading to a non-disentangled representation. Attempts to alleviate this problem via reducing the dynamic dimension and auxiliary loss terms gain only partial success. Instead, we propose a novel and simple architecture that mitigates information leakage by offering a simple and effective subtraction inductive bias while conditioning on a single sample. Remarkably, the resulting variational framework is simpler in terms of required loss terms, hyper-parameters, and data augmentation. We evaluate our method on multiple data-modality benchmarks including general time series, video, and audio, and we show beyond state-of-the-art results on generation and prediction tasks in comparison to several strong baselines",

Because CoLoRA approximates solution fields locally in time, the rank of the weights can be kept small, which means that only few training trajectories are required offline so that CoLoRA is well suited for data-scarce regimes.

    "abstract": "In this work, we analyze both theoretically and empirically the effect of tied input-output embeddings—a popular technique that reduces the model size while often improving training. Interestingly, we found that this technique is connected to Harris (1954)'s distributional hypothesis—often portrayed by the famous Firth (1957)'s quote \"a word is characterized by the company it keeps\". Specifically, our findings indicate that words (or, more broadly, symbols) with similar semantics tend to be encoded in similar input embeddings, while words that appear in similar contexts are encoded in similar output embeddings (thus explaining the semantic space arising in input and output embedding of foundational language models). As a consequence of these findings, the tying of the input and output embeddings is encouraged only when the distributional hypothesis holds for the underlying data. These results also provide insight into the embeddings of foundation language models (which are known to be semantically organized). Further, we complement the theoretical findings with several experiments supporting the claims",

    "title": "Controlling Behavioral Diversity in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The study of behavioral diversity in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is a nascent yet promising field. In this context, the present work deals with the question of how to control the diversity of a multi-agent system. With no existing approaches to control diversity to a set value, current solutions focus on blindly promoting it via intrinsic rewards or additional loss functions, effectively changing the learning objective and lacking a principled measure for it. To address this, we introduce Diversity Control (DiCo), a method able to control diversity to an exact value of a given metric by representing policies as the sum of a parameter-shared component and dynamically scaled per-agent components. By applying constraints directly to the policy architecture, DiCo leaves the learning objective unchanged, enabling its applicability to any actor-critic MARL algorithm. We theoretically prove that DiCo achieves the desired diversity, and we provide several experiments, both in cooperative and competitive tasks, that show how DiCo can be employed as a novel paradigm to increase performance and sample efficiency in MARL.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In unsupervised environment design, reinforcement learning agents are trained on environment configurations (levels) generated by an adversary that maximises some objective. Regret is a commonly used objective that theoretically results in a minimax regret (MMR) policy with desirable robustness guarantees; in particular, the agent's maximum regret is bounded. However, once the agent reaches this regret bound on all levels, the adversary will only sample levels where regret cannot be further reduced. Although there may be possible performance improvements to be made outside of these regret-maximising levels, learning stagnates. In this work, we introduce Bayesian level-perfect MMR (BLP), a refinement of the minimax regret objective that overcomes this limitation. We formally show that solving for this objective results in a subset of MMR policies, and that BLP policies act consistently with a Perfect Bayesian policy over all levels. We further introduce an algorithm, ReMiDi, that results in a BLP policy at convergence. We empirically demonstrate that training on levels from a minimax regret adversary causes learning to prematurely stagnate, but that ReMiDi continues learning",

    "abstract": "To ensure that text generated by large language models (LLMs) is in an expected format, constrained decoding methods propose to enforce strict formal language constraints during generation. However, as we show in this work, not only do such methods often incur performance overhead during generation, but many of them also significantly impair task accuracy, if they do not correctly align the underlying LLM sub-word vocabularies with external constraints. To address this, we present a novel decoding algorithm, DOMINO, that can enforce constraints in a fully subword-aligned fashion, while leveraging pre-computation and speculative decoding to achieve virtually no overhead and in some cases even almost 2$\\times$ speedup over unconstrained decoding – thereby outperforming existing approaches by a wide margin.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Many recent prompting strategies for large language models (LLMs) query the model multiple times sequentially – first to produce intermediate results and then the final answer. However, using these methods, both decoder and model are unaware of potential follow-up prompts, leading to disconnected and undesirably wordy intermediate responses. In this work, we address this issue by proposing prompt sketching, a new prompting paradigm in which an LLM does not only respond by completing a prompt, but by predicting values for multiple variables in a template. This way, sketching grants users more control over the generation process, e.g., by providing a reasoning framework via intermediate instructions, leading to better overall results. The key idea enabling sketching with existing, autoregressive models is to adapt the decoding procedure to also score follow-up instructions during text generation, thus optimizing overall template likelihood in inference. Our experiments show that in a zero-shot setting, prompt sketching outperforms existing, sequential prompting schemes such as direct asking or chain-of-thought on 7 out of 8 LLM benchmarking tasks, including state tracking, arithmetic reasoning, and general question answering. To facilitate future use, we release a number of generic, yet effective sketches applicable to many tasks, and an open source library called dclib, powering our sketch-aware decoders as part of https://github.com/eth-sri/lmql",

In particular, it leads to an FPRAS for estimating TV distances between distributions that are defined over a common Bayes net of small treewidth.

    "abstract": "Reasoning from sequences of raw sensory data is a ubiquitous problem across fields ranging from medical devices to robotics. These problems often involve using long sequences of raw sensor data (e.g. magnetometers, piezoresistors) to predict sequences of desirable physical quantities (e.g. force, inertial measurements). While classical approaches are powerful for locally-linear prediction problems, they often fall short when using real-world sensors. These sensors are typically non-linear, are affected by extraneous variables (e.g. vibration), and exhibit data-dependent drift. For many problems, the prediction task is exacerbated by small labeled datasets since obtaining ground-truth labels requires expensive equipment. In this work, we present Hierarchical State-Space models (HiSS), a conceptually simple, new technique for continuous sequential prediction. HiSS stacks structured state-space models on top of each other to create a temporal hierarchy. Across six real-world sensor datasets, from tactile-based state prediction to accelerometer-based inertial measurement, HiSS outperforms state-of-the-art sequence models such as causal Transformers, LSTMs, S4, and Mamba by at least 23% on MSE. Our experiments further indicate that HiSS demonstrates efficient scaling to smaller datasets and is compatible with existing data-filtering techniques.

    "abstract": "Despite not being designed for this purpose, the use of variational autoencoders (VAEs) has proven remarkably effective for disentangled representation learning (DRL). Recent research attributes this success to certain characteristics of the loss function that prevent latent space rotation, or hypothesize about the orthogonality properties of the decoder by drawing parallels with principal component analysis (PCA). This hypothesis, however, has only been tested experimentally for linear VAEs, and the theoretical justification still remains an open problem. Moreover, since real-world VAEs are often inherently non-linear due to the use of neural architectures, understanding DRL capabilities of real-world VAEs remains a critical task. Our work takes a step towards understanding disentanglement in real-world VAEs to theoretically establish how the orthogonality properties of the decoder promotes disentanglement in practical applications.

With rapidly growing interest in using large language models (LLMs) to act as agents on behalf of human users, such LLM agents would also need to be able to negotiate. In this paper, we study how well LLMs can negotiate with each other. We develop NegotiationArena: a flexible framework for evaluating and probing the negotiation abilities of LLM agents. We implemented three types of scenarios in NegotiationArena to assess LLM's behaviors in allocating shared resources (ultimatum games), aggregate resources (trading games) and buy/sell goods (price negotiations). Each scenario allows for multiple turns of flexible dialogues between LLM agents to allow for more complex negotiations. Interestingly, LLM agents can significantly boost their negotiation outcomes by employing certain behavioral tactics. For example, by pretending to be desolate and desperate, LLMs can improve their payoffs by 20% when negotiating against the standard GPT-4. We also quantify irrational negotiation behaviors exhibited by the LLM agents, many of which also appear in humans. Together, NegotiationArena offers a new environment to investigate LLM interactions, enabling new insights into LLM's theory of mind, irrationality, and reasoning abilities",

    "abstract": "We introduce SPARse fine-grained Contrastive alignment (SPARC), a simple method for pretraining more fine-grained multimodal representations from image-text pairs. Given that multiple image patches often correspond to single words, we propose to learn a grouping of image patches for every token in the caption. To achieve this, we use a sparse similarity metric between image patches and language tokens and compute for each token a language-grouped vision embedding as the weighted average of patches. The token and language-grouped vision embeddings are then contrasted through a fine-grained sequence-wise loss that only depends on individual samples and does not require other batch samples as negatives, i.e., more detailed information is encoded in a computationally inexpensive way. SPARC combines this fine-grained loss with a contrastive loss between global image and text embeddings to learn representations that simultaneously encode global and local information. We thoroughly evaluate SPARC and show improved performance over competing approaches both on image-level tasks relying on coarse-grained information, e.g. classification, as well as region-level tasks relying on fine-grained information, e.g., retrieval, object detection, segmentation while also improving model faithfulness and captioning in foundational vision-language models",

Unfortunately, the progress in this field is currently slowed down by divergent and incompatible goals.

This position paper argues that the area of RED XAI is currently under-explored, i.e., more methods for explainability are desperately needed to question models (e.g., extract knowledge from well-performing models as well as spotting and fixing bugs in faulty models), and the area of RED XAI hides great opportunities and potential for important research necessary to ensure the safety of AI systems.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) has become ubiquitous to adapt foundation models to downstream task requirements while retaining their generalization ability. However, the amount of additionally introduced parameters and compute for successful adaptation and hyperparameter searches can explode quickly, especially when deployed at scale to serve numerous individual requests. To ensure effective, parameter-efficient, and hyperparameter-robust adaptation, we propose the ETHER transformation family, which performs Efficient fineTuning via HypErplane Reflections. By design, ETHER transformations require a minimal number of parameters, are less likely to deteriorate model performance, and exhibit robustness to hyperparameter and learning rate choices. In particular, we introduce ETHER and its relaxation ETHER+, which match or outperform existing PEFT methods with significantly fewer parameters ($\\sim$$10$-$100$ times lower than LoRA or OFT) across multiple image synthesis and natural language tasks without exhaustive hyperparameter tuning. Finally, we investigate the recent emphasis on Hyperspherical Energy retention for adaptation and raise questions on its practical utility. The code is available at https://github.com/mwbini/ether",

For Shapley values, the marginal contributions are averaged over all orderings, while in causal inference methods, the typical approach is to select orderings producing a graph with a minimal number of edges. We reconcile both approaches by reinterpreting them from a maximum entropy perspective. Namely, Shapley values assume no prior knowledge about the orderings and treat them as equally likely, while causal inference approaches apply Occam's razor and consider only orderings producing the simplest explanatory graphs. We find that the blind application of Occam's razor to Shapley values does not produce fully satisfactory explanations. Hence, we propose two variations of Shapley values based on entropy maximization to appropriately incorporate prior information about the model.

We extensively benchmark two such online solvers implemented in the Tactician platform for the Coq proof assistant: First, Tactician's online $k$-nearest neighbor solver, which can learn from recent proofs, shows a $1.72\\times$ improvement in theorems proved over an offline equivalent. Second, we introduce a graph neural network, Graph2Tac, with a novel approach to build hierarchical representations for new definitions. Graph2Tac's online definition task realizes a $1.5\\times$ improvement in theorems solved over an offline baseline. The $k$-NN and Graph2Tac solvers rely on orthogonal online data, making them highly complementary. Their combination improves $1.27\\times$ over their individual performances.

Our theoretical results connect the biharmonic distance to well-known measures of connectivity of a graph like its total resistance and sparsity. Based on these results, we introduce two clustering algorithms using the biharmonic distance.

    "title": "Comparing Graph Transformers via Positional Encodings",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The distinguishing power of graph transformers is tied to the choice of positional encoding: features used to augment the base transformer with information about the graph. There are two primary types of positional encoding: absolute positional encodings (APEs) and relative positional encodings (RPEs). APEs assign features to each node and are given as input to the transformer. RPEs instead assign a feature to each pair of nodes, e.g., shortest-path distance, and are used to augment the attention block. A priori, it is unclear which method is better for maximizing the power of the resulting graph transformer. In this paper, we aim to understand the relationship between these different types of positional encodings. Interestingly, we show that graph transformers using APEs and RPEs are equivalent in their ability to distinguish non-isomorphic graphs. In particular, we demonstrate how to interchange APEs and RPEs while maintaining their distinguishing power in terms of graph transformers. However, in the case of graphs with node features, we show that RPEs may have an advantage over APEs. Based on our theoretical results, we provide a study of different APEs and RPEs—including the shortest-path and resistance distance and the recently introduced stable and expressive positional encoding (SPE)—and compare their distinguishing power in terms of transformers. We believe our work will help navigate the vast number of positional encoding choices and provide guidance on the future design of positional encodings for graph transformers",

    "abstract": "The performance of learning models often deteriorates when deployed in out-of-sample environments. To ensure reliable deployment, we propose a stability evaluation criterion based on distributional perturbations. Conceptually, our stability evaluation criterion is defined as the minimal perturbation required on our observed dataset to induce a prescribed deterioration in risk evaluation. In this paper, we utilize the optimal transport (OT) discrepancy with moment constraints on the (sample, density) space to quantify this perturbation. Therefore, our stability evaluation criterion can address both data corruptions and sub-population shifts—the two most common types of distribution shifts in real-world scenarios. To further realize practical benefits, we present a series of tractable convex formulations and computational methods tailored to different classes of loss functions. The key technical tool to achieve this is the strong duality theorem provided in this paper. Empirically, we validate the practical utility of our stability evaluation criterion across a host of real-world applications. These empirical studies showcase the criterion's ability not only to compare the stability of different learning models and features but also to provide valuable guidelines and strategies to further improve models",

    "abstract": "Noisy gradient descent and its variants are the predominant algorithms for differentially private machine learning. It is a fundamental question to quantify their privacy leakage, yet tight characterizations remain open even in the foundational setting of convex losses. This paper improves over previous analyses by establishing (and refining) the \"privacy amplification by iteration\" phenomenon in the unifying framework of $f$-differential privacy—which tightly captures all aspects of the privacy loss and immediately implies tighter privacy accounting in other notions of differential privacy, e.g., $(\\varepsilon,\\delta)$-DP and Rényi DP. Our key technical insight is the construction of shifted interpolated processes that unravel the popular shifted-divergences argument, enabling generalizations beyond divergence-based relaxations of DP. Notably, this leads to the first exact privacy analysis in the foundational setting of strongly convex optimization. Our techniques extend to many settings: convex/strongly convex, constrained/unconstrained, full/cyclic/stochastic batches, and all combinations thereof. As an immediate corollary, we recover the $f$-DP characterization of the exponential mechanism for strongly convex optimization in Gopi et al. (2022), and moreover extend this result to more general settings",

    "abstract": "Deep learning models are known to overfit and memorize spurious features in the training dataset. While numerous empirical studies have aimed at understanding this phenomenon, a rigorous theoretical framework to quantify it is still missing. In this paper, we consider spurious features that are uncorrelated with the learning task, and we provide a precise characterization of how they are memorized via two separate terms: (i) the stability of the model with respect to individual training samples, and (ii) the feature alignment between the spurious pattern and the full sample. While the first term is well established in learning theory and it is connected to the generalization error in classical work, the second one is, to the best of our knowledge, novel. Our key technical result gives a precise characterization of the feature alignment for the two prototypical settings of random features (RF) and neural tangent kernel (NTK) regression. We prove that the memorization of spurious features weakens as the generalization capability increases and, through the analysis of the feature alignment, we unveil the role of the model and of its activation function.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Understanding the reasons behind the exceptional success of transformers requires a better analysis of why attention layers are suitable for NLP tasks. In particular, such tasks require predictive models to capture contextual meaning which often depends on one or few words, even if the sentence is long. Our work studies this key property, dubbed word sensitivity (WS), in the prototypical setting of random features. We show that attention layers enjoy high WS, namely, there exists a vector in the space of embeddings that largely perturbs the random attention features map. The argument critically exploits the role of the softmax in the attention layer, highlighting its benefit compared to other activations (e.g., ReLU). In contrast, the WS of standard random features is of order $1/\\sqrt{n}$, $n$ being the number of words in the textual sample, and thus it decays with the length of the context. We then translate these results on the word sensitivity into generalization bounds: due to their low WS, random features provably cannot learn to distinguish between two sentences that differ only in a single word; in contrast, due to their high WS, random attention features have higher generalization capabilities. We validate our theoretical results with experimental evidence over the BERT-Base word embeddings of the imdb review dataset",

This phenomenon is known as a neural scaling law. Of fundamental importance is the compute-optimal scaling law, which reports the performance as a function of units of compute when choosing model sizes optimally. We analyze a random feature model trained with gradient descent as a solvable model of network training and generalization. This reproduces many observations about neural scaling laws. First, our model makes a prediction about why the scaling of performance with training time and with model size have different power law exponents. Consequently, the theory predicts an asymmetric compute-optimal scaling rule where the number of training steps are increased faster than model parameters, consistent with recent empirical observations. Second, it has been observed that early in training, networks converge to their infinite-width dynamics at a rate $1/\\text{width}$ but at late time exhibit a rate $\\text{width}^{-c}$, where $c$ depends on the structure of the architecture and task. We show that our model exhibits this behavior. Lastly, our theory shows how the gap between training and test loss can gradually build up over time due to repeated reuse of data",

FSFC tackles a newly defined optimization problem that integrates logistic loss and functional features to identify the most crucial variables for classification. To address the minimization procedure, we employ functional principal components and develop a new adaptive version of the Dual Augmented Lagrangian algorithm. The computational efficiency of FSFC enables handling high-dimensional scenarios where the number of features may considerably exceed the number of statistical units. Simulation experiments demonstrate that FSFC outperforms other machine learning and deep learning methods in computational time and classification accuracy. Furthermore, the FSFC feature selection capability can be leveraged to significantly reduce the problem's dimensionality and enhance the performances of other classification algorithms. The efficacy of FSFC is also demonstrated through a real data application, analyzing relationships between four chronic diseases and other health and demographic factors.

    "title": "On dimensionality of feature vectors in MPNNs",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We revisit the result of Morris et al. (AAAI'19) that message-passing graphs neural networks (MPNNs) are equal in their distinguishing power to the Weisfeiler–Leman (WL) isomorphism test. Morris et al. show their result with ReLU activation function and $O(n)$-dimensional feature vectors, where $n$ is the size of the graph. Recently, by introducing randomness into the architecture, Aamand et al. (NeurIPS'22) improved this bound to $O(\\log n)$-dimensional feature vectors, although at the expense of guaranteeing perfect simulation only with high probability. In all these constructions, to guarantee equivalence to the WL test, the dimension of feature vectors in the MPNN has to increase with the size of the graphs. However, architectures used in practice have feature vectors of constant dimension. Thus, there is a gap between the guarantees provided by these results and the actual characteristics of architectures used in practice. In this paper we close this gap by showing that, for any non-polynomial analytic (like the sigmoid) activation function, to guarantee that MPNNs are equivalent to the WL test, feature vectors of dimension $d=1$ is all we need, independently of the size of the graphs. Our main technical insight is that for simulating multi-sets in the WL-test, it is enough to use linear independence of feature vectors over rationals instead of reals. Countability of the set of rationals together with nice properties of analytic functions allow us to carry out the simulation invariant over the iterations of the WL test without increasing the dimension of the feature vectors",

    "title": "Integrating Multimodal Data for Joint Generative Modeling of Complex Dynamics",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Many, if not most, systems of interest in science are naturally described as nonlinear dynamical systems. Empirically, we commonly access these systems through time series measurements. Often such time series may consist of discrete random variables rather than continuous measurements, or may be composed of measurements from multiple data modalities observed simultaneously. For instance, in neuroscience we may have behavioral labels in addition to spike counts and continuous physiological recordings. While by now there is a burgeoning literature on deep learning for dynamical systems reconstruction (DSR), multimodal data integration has hardly been considered in this context. Here we provide such an efficient and flexible algorithmic framework that rests on a multimodal variational autoencoder for generating a sparse teacher signal that guides training of a reconstruction model, exploiting recent advances in DSR training techniques. It enables to combine various sources of information for optimal reconstruction, even allows for reconstruction from symbolic data (class labels) alone, and connects different types of observations within a common latent dynamics space. In contrast to previous multimodal data integration techniques for scientific applications, our framework is fully generative, producing, after training, trajectories with the same geometrical and temporal structure as those of the ground truth system",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We study the problem of maintaining a decision tree in the fully-dynamic setting, where the dataset is updated by an adversarial sequence of insertions and deletions. We present the first algorithm with strong guarantees on both the quality of the tree and the worst-case update time (the maximum time spent between two consecutive dataset updates). For instance, we can maintain a tree where each node has Gini gain within $\\beta$ of the optimum, while guaranteeing an update time $O(d \\beta^{-3} \\log^4 n )$, where $d$ is the number of features and $n$ the maximum size of the dataset. This is optimal up to polylogarithmic factors, as any dynamic algorithm must have update time in $\\Omega(d)$. Similar guarantees hold for the variance and information gain, for classification and regression, and even for boosted trees. This shows that many popular decision trees such as ID3 or C4.5 can be efficiently be made dynamic, answering an open question of Bressan, Damay and Sozio (AAAI 2023). We also show that, under the 3SUM conjecture or the Orthogonal Vectors Hypothesis, the update time must be polynomial in $1/\\beta$",

This matches the dimension-dependence of the (non-private) ordinary least squares estimator as well as that of recent private algorithms that rely on sophisticated adaptive gradient-clipping schemes (Varshney et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2023).

While the promise of this approach is clear, the original framework was based on the assumption that the honest strategy is able to simulate deterministic AI systems for an exponential number of steps, limiting its applicability.

While existing work successfully develops various effective or theory-justified NAL algorithms, the understanding of the two commonly used query criteria of NAL: uncertainty-based and diversity-based, remains in its infancy. In this work, we try to move one step forward by offering a unified explanation for the success of both query criteria-based NAL from a feature learning view. Specifically, we consider a feature-noise data model comprising easy-to-learn or hard-to-learn features disrupted by noise, and conduct analysis over 2-layer NN-based NALs in the pool-based scenario. We provably show that both uncertainty-based and diversity-based NAL are inherently amenable to one and the same principle, i.e., striving to prioritize samples that contain yet-to-be-learned features. We further prove that this shared principle is the key to their success-achieve small test error within a small labeled set. Contrastingly, the strategy-free passive learning exhibits a large test error due to the inadequate learning of yet-to-be-learned features, necessitating resort to a significantly larger label complexity for a sufficient test error reduction. Experimental results validate our findings",

Karalias & Loukas (2020) adapted the probabilistic method by Erdős & Spencer (1974), to incorporate CO into differentiable optimization. Their work ignited the research on unsupervised learning for CO, composed of two main components: probabilistic objectives and derandomization. However, each component confronts unique challenges. First, deriving objectives under complex conditions and constraints is nontrivial. Second, the derandomization process is underexplored, and the existing derandomization methods are either random sampling or naive rounding. In this work, we aim to tackle complex conditions in unsupervised CO. First, we concretize the targets for probabilistic objective construction and derandomization with theoretical justification. Then, for various complex conditions commonly involved in different CO problems, we derive nontrivial objectives and derandomization to meet the targets. Finally, we apply the derivations to various CO problems. Via extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world graphs, we validate the correctness of our derivations and show our empirical superiority w.r.t. both optimization quality and speed",

We propose differentially private bias-term fine-tuning (DP-BiTFiT), which matches the state-of-the-art accuracy for DP algorithms and the efficiency of the standard BiTFiT. DP-BiTFiT is model agnostic (not modifying the network architecture), parameter efficient (only training about 0.1% of the parameters), and computation efficient (almost removing the overhead caused by DP, in both the time and space complexity). On a wide range of tasks, DP-BiTFiT is 2 - 30X faster and uses 2 - 8X less memory than DP full fine-tuning, even faster than the standard full fine-tuning. This amazing efficiency enables us to conduct DP fine-tuning on language and vision tasks with long-sequence texts and high-resolution images, which were computationally difficult using existing methods",

Leveraging this network structure has been shown to yield significant performance improvements. Existing BOFN algorithms for general-purpose networks evaluate the full network at each iteration. However, many real-world applications allow for evaluating nodes individually. To exploit this, we propose a novel knowledge gradient acquisition function that chooses which node and corresponding inputs to evaluate in a cost-aware manner, thereby reducing query costs by evaluating only on a part of the network at each step. We provide an efficient approach to optimizing our acquisition function and show that it outperforms existing BOFN methods and other benchmarks across several synthetic and real-world problems.

However, for models with structured inputs, such as graph neural networks, existing Shapley-based explainability approaches either focus solely on node-wise importance or neglect the graph structure when perturbing the input instance. This paper introduces the Myerson-Taylor interaction index that internalizes the graph structure into attributing the node values and the interaction values among nodes. Unlike the Shapley-based methods, the Myerson-Taylor index decomposes coalitions into components satisfying a pre-chosen connectivity criterion. We prove that the Myerson-Taylor index is the unique one that satisfies a system of five natural axioms accounting for graph structure and high-order interaction among nodes. Leveraging these properties, we propose Myerson-Taylor Structure-Aware Graph Explainer (MAGE), a novel explainer that uses the second-order Myerson-Taylor index to identify the most important motifs influencing the model prediction, both positively and negatively.

We study an analogy to this problem: can weak model supervision elicit the full capabilities of a much stronger model? We test this using a range of pretrained language models in the GPT-4 family on natural language processing (NLP), chess, and reward modeling tasks. We find that when we naively finetune strong pretrained models on labels generated by a weak model, they consistently perform better than their weak supervisors, a phenomenon we call weak-to-strong generalization. However, we are still far from recovering the full capabilities of strong models with naive finetuning alone, suggesting that techniques like RLHF may scale poorly to superhuman models without further work. We find that simple methods can often significantly improve weak-to-strong generalization: for example, when finetuning GPT-4 with a GPT-2-level supervisor and an auxiliary confidence loss, we can recover close to GPT-3.5-level performance on NLP tasks. Our results suggest that it is feasible to make empirical progress today on a fundamental challenge of aligning superhuman models",

    "title": "CodeIt: Self-Improving Language Models with Prioritized Hindsight Replay",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Large language models are increasingly solving tasks that are commonly believed to require human-level reasoning ability. However, these models still perform very poorly on benchmarks of general intelligence such as the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). In this paper, we approach the ARC as a programming-by-examples problem, and introduce a novel and scalable method for language model self-improvement called Code Iteration (CodeIt). Our method iterates between 1) program sampling and hindsight relabeling, and 2) learning from prioritized experience replay. By relabeling the goal of an episode (i.e., the program output given input) to the output actually produced by the sampled program, our method effectively deals with the extreme sparsity of rewards in program synthesis. Applying CodeIt to the ARC dataset, we demonstrate that prioritized hindsight replay, along with pre-training and data-augmentation, leads to successful inter-task generalization. CodeIt is the first neuro-symbolic approach that scales to the full ARC evaluation dataset. Our method solves 15% of ARC evaluation tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance and outperforming existing neural and symbolic baselines.

    "abstract": "A main theoretical puzzle is why over-parameterized Neural Networks (NNs) generalize well when trained to zero loss (i.e., so they interpolate the data). Usually, the NN is trained with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or one of its variants. However, recent empirical work examined the generalization of a random NN that interpolates the data: the NN was sampled from a seemingly uniform prior over the parameters, conditioned on that the NN perfectly classifying the training set. Interestingly, such a NN sample typically generalized as well as SGD-trained NNs. We prove that such a random NN interpolator typically generalizes well if there exists an underlying narrow \"teacher NN\" that agrees with the labels. Specifically, we show that such a ‘flat' prior over the NN parametrization induces a rich prior over the NN functions, due to the redundancy in the NN structure. In particular, this creates a bias towards simpler functions, which require less relevant parameters to represent — enabling learning with a sample complexity approximately proportional to the complexity of the teacher (roughly, the number of non-redundant parameters), rather than the student's",

Randomized experiments have been extensively used to estimate treatment effects in various scientific fields. However, to gain deeper insights, it is essential to estimate distributional treatment effects rather than relying solely on average effects. Our approach incorporates pre-treatment covariates into a distributional regression framework, utilizing machine learning techniques to improve the precision of distributional treatment effect estimators. The proposed approach can be readily implemented with off-the-shelf machine learning methods and remains valid as long as the nuisance components are reasonably well estimated. Also, we establish the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimator and present a uniformly valid inference method. Through simulation results and real data analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating machine learning techniques in reducing the variance of distributional treatment effect estimators in finite samples",

    "abstract": "Vision-language models (VLMs) have tremendous potential for grounding language, and thus enabling language-conditioned agents (LCAs) to perform diverse tasks specified with text. This has motivated the study of LCAs based on reinforcement learning (RL) with rewards given by rendering images of an environment and evaluating those images with VLMs. If single-task RL is employed, such approaches are limited by the cost and time required to train a policy for each new task. Multi-task RL (MTRL) is a natural alternative, but requires a carefully designed corpus of training tasks and does not always generalize reliably to new tasks. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel decomposition of the problem of building an LCA: first find an environment configuration that has a high VLM score for text describing a task; then use a (pretrained) goal-conditioned policy to reach that configuration. We also explore several enhancements to the speed and quality of VLM-based LCAs, notably, the use of distilled models, and the evaluation of configurations from multiple viewpoints to resolve the ambiguities inherent in a single 2D view. We demonstrate our approach on the Humanoid environment, showing that it results in LCAs that outperform MTRL baselines in zero-shot generalization, without requiring any textual task descriptions or other forms of environment-specific annotation during training",

    "abstract": "In recent years, deep learning-based sequence modelings, such as language models, have received much attention and success, which pushes researchers to explore the possibility of transforming non-sequential problems into a sequential form. Following this thought, deep neural networks can be represented as composite functions of a sequence of mappings, linear or nonlinear, where each composition can be viewed as a word. However, the weights of linear mappings are undetermined and hence require an infinite number of words. In this article, we investigate the finite case and constructively prove the existence of a finite vocabulary $V$=$\\phi_i: \\mathbb{R}^d \\to \\mathbb{R}^d | i=1,...,n$ with $n=O(d^2)$ for the universal approximation. That is, for any continuous mapping $f: \\mathbb{R}^d \\to \\mathbb{R}^d$, compact domain $\\Omega$ and $\\varepsilon>0$, there is a sequence of mappings $\\phi_{i_1}, ..., \\phi_{i_m} \\in V, m \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+$, such that the composition $\\phi_{i_m} \\circ ... \\circ \\phi_{i_1} $ approximates $f$ on $\\Omega$ with an error less than $\\varepsilon$.

    "title": "Medusa: Simple LLM Inference Acceleration Framework with Multiple Decoding Heads",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) employ auto-regressive decoding that requires sequential computation, with each step reliant on the previous one's output. This creates a bottleneck as each step necessitates moving the full model parameters from High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM) to the accelerator's cache. While methods such as speculative decoding have been suggested to address this issue, their implementation is impeded by the challenges associated with acquiring and maintaining a separate draft model. In this paper, we present Medusa, an efficient method that augments LLM inference by adding extra decoding heads to predict multiple subsequent tokens in parallel. Using a tree-based attention mechanism, Medusa constructs multiple candidate continuations and verifies them simultaneously in each decoding step. By leveraging parallel processing, Medusa reduces the number of decoding steps required. We present two levels of fine-tuning procedures for Medusa to meet the needs of different use cases: Medusa-1: Medusa is directly fine-tuned on top of a frozen backbone LLM, enabling lossless inference acceleration. Medusa-2: Medusa is fine-tuned together with the backbone LLM, enabling better prediction accuracy of Medusa heads and higher speedup but needing a special training recipe that preserves the model's capabilities. Moreover, we propose several extensions that improve or expand the utility of Medusa, including a self-distillation to handle situations where no training data is available and a typical acceptance scheme to boost the acceptance rate while maintaining generation quality. We evaluate Medusa on models of various sizes and training procedures. Our experiments demonstrate that Medusa-1 can achieve over 2.2$\\times$ speedup without compromising generation quality, while Medusa-2 further improves the speedup to 2.3-2.8$\\times$",

    "abstract": "Large-scale pretrained models have proven immensely valuable in handling data-intensive modalities like text and image. However, fine-tuning these models for certain specialized modalities, such as protein sequence and cosmic ray, poses challenges due to the significant modality discrepancy and scarcity of labeled data. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end method, PaRe, to enhance cross-modal fine-tuning, aiming to transfer a large-scale pretrained model to various target modalities. PaRe employs a gating mechanism to select key patches from both source and target data. Through a modality-agnostic Patch Replacement scheme, these patches are preserved and combined to construct data-rich intermediate modalities ranging from easy to hard. By gradually intermediate modality generation, we can not only effectively bridge the modality gap to enhance stability and transferability of cross-modal fine-tuning, but also address the challenge of limited data in the target modality by leveraging enriched intermediate modality data. Compared with hand-designed, general-purpose, task-specific, and state-of-the-art cross-modal fine-tuning approaches, PaRe demonstrates superior performance across three challenging benchmarks, encompassing more than ten modalities",

But such approaches to BBVI often converge slowly due to the high variance of their gradient estimates and their sensitivity to hyperparameters. In this work, we propose batch and match (BaM), an alternative approach to BBVI based on a score-based divergence. Notably, this score-based divergence can be optimized by a closed-form proximal update for Gaussian variational families with full covariance matrices. We analyze the convergence of BaM when the target distribution is Gaussian, and we prove that in the limit of infinite batch size the variational parameter updates converge exponentially quickly to the target mean and covariance. We also evaluate the performance of BaM on Gaussian and non-Gaussian target distributions that arise from posterior inference in hierarchical and deep generative models. In these experiments, we find that BaM typically converges in fewer (and sometimes significantly fewer) gradient evaluations than leading implementations of BBVI based on ELBO maximization",

LoCoCo employs only a fixed-size Key-Value (KV) cache, and can enhance efficiency in both inference and fine-tuning stages. Diverging from prior methods that selectively drop KV pairs based on heuristics, LoCoCo leverages a data-driven adaptive fusion technique, blending previous KV pairs with incoming tokens to minimize the loss of contextual information and ensure accurate attention modeling. This token integration is achieved through injecting one-dimensional convolutional kernels that dynamically calculate mixing weights for each KV cache slot. Designed for broad compatibility with existing LLM frameworks, LoCoCo allows for straightforward \"drop-in\" integration without needing architectural modifications, while incurring minimal tuning overhead. Experiments demonstrate that LoCoCo maintains consistently outstanding performance across various context lengths and can achieve a high context compression rate during both inference and fine-tuning phases. During inference, we successfully compressed up to $3482$ tokens into a $128$-size KV cache, while retaining comparable performance to the full sequence - an accuracy improvement of up to $0.2791$ compared to baselines at the same cache size. During post-training tuning, we also effectively extended the context length from 4K to 32K using a KV cache of fixed size 512, achieving performance similar to fine-tuning with entire sequences",

    "abstract": "Visual reprogramming (VR) is a prompting technique that aims to re-purpose a pre-trained model (e.g., a classifier on ImageNet) to target tasks (e.g., medical data prediction) by learning a small-scale pattern added into input images instead of tuning considerable parameters within the model. The location of the pattern within input samples is usually determined by a pre-defined mask shared across all samples. In this paper, we show that the shared mask potentially limits VR's generalization and increases its approximation error due to the lack of sample-level adaptation. Motivated by this finding, we design a new framework for VR called sample-specific multi-channel masks (SMM). Specifically, SMM employs a lightweight ConvNet and patch-wise interpolation to generate sample-specific three-channel masks instead of a shared and pre-defined mask. Since we generate different masks for individual samples, SMM is theoretically shown to reduce approximation error for the target tasks compared with existing state-of-the-art VR methods. We also empirically demonstrate its performance gain on both ResNet and ViT. The success of SMM further highlights the broader applicability of VR in leveraging the latent knowledge of pre-trained models for various target tasks.

Thus, human alignment has been extensively studied recently and several methods such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), Direct Policy Optimisation (DPO) and Sequence Likelihood Calibration (SLiC) have emerged. In this paper, our contribution is two-fold. First, we show the equivalence between two recent alignment methods, namely Identity Policy Optimisation (IPO) and Nash Mirror Descent (Nash-MD). Second, we introduce a generalisation of IPO, named IPO-MD, that leverages the regularised sampling approach proposed by Nash-MD. This equivalence may seem surprising at first sight, since IPO is an offline method whereas Nash-MD is an online method using a preference model. However, this equivalence can be proven when we consider the online version of IPO, that is when both generations are sampled by the online policy and annotated by a trained preference model. Optimising the IPO loss with such a stream of data becomes then equivalent to finding the Nash equilibrium of the preference model through self-play. Building on this equivalence, we introduce the IPO-MD algorithm that generates data with a mixture policy (between the online and reference policy) similarly as the general Nash-MD algorithm. We compare online-IPO and IPO-MD to different online versions of existing losses on preference data such as DPO and SLiC on a summarisation task",

We also provide mathematical guarantees on the expressivity of our models by establishing that our network family qualifies as Universal Conditional Distribution Approximators. Lastly, empirical evaluations across multiple tasks show that our proposed architectures achieve better downstream task performance and uncertainty quantification than their counterparts while being significantly more efficient.

We present Discrete Flow Models (DFMs), a new flow-based model of discrete data that provides the missing link in enabling flow-based generative models to be applied to multimodal continuous and discrete data problems. Our key insight is that the discrete equivalent of continuous space flow matching can be realized using Continuous Time Markov Chains. DFMs benefit from a simple derivation that includes discrete diffusion models as a specific instance while allowing improved performance over existing diffusion-based approaches. We utilize our DFMs method to build a multimodal flow-based modeling framework. We apply this capability to the task of protein co-design, wherein we learn a model for jointly generating protein structure and sequence. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art co-design performance while allowing the same multimodal model to be used for flexible generation of the sequence or structure",

To compensate for the non-availability of expert actions, we rely on an inverse dynamics model that infers plausible actions distribution given the expert's state-state transitions; we regularize the imitator's policy by aligning it to the inferred action distribution. MAAD leads to significantly improved sample efficiency and stability. We demonstrate its effectiveness in a number of MuJoCo environments, both int the OpenAI Gym and the DeepMind Control Suite. We show that it requires considerable fewer interactions to achieve expert performance, outperforming current state-of-the-art on-policy methods.

Here, we present the Graph Positional and Structural Encoder (GPSE), the first-ever graph encoder designed to capture rich PSE representations for augmenting any GNN. GPSE learns an efficient common latent representation for multiple PSEs, and is highly transferable: The encoder trained on a particular graph dataset can be used effectively on datasets drawn from markedly different distributions and modalities. We show that across a wide range of benchmarks, GPSE-enhanced models can significantly outperform those that employ explicitly computed PSEs, and at least match their performance in others. Our results pave the way for the development of foundational pre-trained graph encoders for extracting positional and structural information, and highlight their potential as a more powerful and efficient alternative to explicitly computed PSEs and existing self-supervised pre-training approaches.

    "abstract": "While large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in generating fluent and realistic text, controlling the generated text so that it exhibits properties such as safety, factuality, and non-toxicity remains challenging. Existing decoding-based controllable text generation methods are static in terms of the dimension of control; if the target subject is changed, they require new training. Moreover, it can quickly become prohibitive to concurrently control multiple subjects. To address these challenges, we first show that existing methods can be framed as a reinforcement learning problem, where an action-value function estimates the likelihood of a desired attribute appearing in the generated text. Then, we introduce a novel approach named SF-Gen, which leverages the concept of successor features to decouple the dynamics of LLMs from task-specific rewards. By employing successor features, our method proves to be memory-efficient and computationally efficient for both training and decoding, especially when dealing with multiple target subjects. To the best of our knowledge, our research represents the first application of successor features in text generation. In addition to its computational efficiency, the resultant language produced by our method is comparable to the SOTA (and outperforms baselines) in both control measures as well as language quality, which we demonstrate through a series of experiments in various controllable text generation tasks",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Imitation learning mimics high-quality policies from expert data for sequential decision-making tasks. However, its efficacy is hindered in scenarios where optimal demonstrations are unavailable, and only imperfect demonstrations are present. To address this issue, introducing additional limited human preferences is a suitable approach as it can be obtained in a human-friendly manner, offering a promising way to learn the policy that exceeds the performance of imperfect demonstrations. In this paper, we propose a novel imitation learning (IL) algorithm, Preference Aided Imitation Learning from imperfect demonstrations (PAIL). Specifically, PAIL learns a preference reward by querying experts for limited preferences from imperfect demonstrations. This serves two purposes during training: 1) Reweighting imperfect demonstrations with the preference reward for higher quality. 2) Selecting explored trajectories with high cumulative preference rewards to augment imperfect demonstrations. The dataset with continuously improving quality empowers the performance of PAIL to transcend the initial demonstrations. Comprehensive empirical results across a synthetic task and two locomotion benchmarks show that PAIL surpasses baselines by 73.2% and breaks through the performance bottleneck of imperfect demonstrations",

To address this issue, we propose a Predictive Dynamic Fusion (PDF) framework for multimodal learning. We proceed to reveal the multimodal fusion from a generalization perspective and theoretically derive the predictable Collaborative Belief (Co-Belief) with Mono- and Holo-Confidence, which provably reduces the upper bound of generalization error.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is essential when deploying machine learning models in open-world scenarios. Zero-shot OOD detection, requiring no training on in-distribution (ID) data, has been possible with the advent of vision-language models like CLIP. Existing methods build a text-based classifier with only closed-set labels. However, this largely restricts the inherent capability of CLIP to recognize samples from large and open label space. In this paper, we propose to tackle this constraint by leveraging the expert knowledge and reasoning capability of large language models (LLM) to Envision potential Outlier Exposure, termed EOE, without access to any actual OOD data. Owing to better adaptation to open-world scenarios, EOE can be generalized to different tasks, including far, near, and fine-grained OOD detection. Technically, we design (1) LLM prompts based on visual similarity to generate potential outlier class labels specialized for OOD detection, as well as (2) a new score function based on potential outlier penalty to distinguish hard OOD samples effectively. Empirically, EOE achieves state-of-the-art performance across different OOD tasks and can be effectively scaled to the ImageNet-1K dataset.

We show that uniform selection needs only logarithmically many agents in terms of the number of alternatives to achieve almost optimal distortion.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Existing AI alignment approaches assume that preferences are static, which is unrealistic: our preferences change, and may even be influenced by our interactions with AI systems themselves. To clarify the consequences of incorrectly assuming static preferences, we introduce Dynamic Reward Markov Decision Processes (DR-MDPs), which explicitly model preference changes and the AI's influence on them. We show that despite its convenience, the static-preference assumption may undermine the soundness of existing alignment techniques, leading them to implicitly reward AI systems for influencing user preferences in ways users may not truly want. We then explore potential solutions. First, we offer a unifying perspective on how an agent's optimization horizon may partially help reduce undesirable AI influence. Then, we formalize different notions of AI alignment that account for preference change from the outset. Comparing the strengths and limitations of 8 such notions of alignment, we find that they all either err towards causing undesirable AI influence, or are overly risk-averse, suggesting that a straightforward solution to the problems of changing preferences may not exist. As there is no avoiding grappling with changing preferences in real-world settings, this makes it all the more important to handle these issues with care, balancing risks and capabilities. We hope our work can provide conceptual clarity and constitute a first step towards AI alignment practices which explicitly account for (and contend with) the changing and influenceable nature of human preferences",

Prior work studied RL-ABF only in tabular settings, where the number of states is assumed to be small.

Existing primal-dual algorithms designed for constrained online learning problems under adversarial inputs rely on two fundamental assumptions. First, the decision maker must know beforehand the value of parameters related to the degree of strict feasibility of the problem (i.e. Slater parameters). Second, a strictly feasible solution to the offline optimization problem must exist at each round. Both requirements are unrealistic for practical applications such as bidding in online ad auctions. In this paper, we show how such assumptions can be circumvented by endowing standard primal-dual templates with weakly adaptive regret minimizers. This results in a \"dual-balancing\" framework which ensures that dual variables stay sufficiently small, even in the absence of knowledge about Slater's parameter. We prove the first best-of-both-worlds no-regret guarantees which hold in absence of the two aforementioned assumptions, under stochastic and adversarial inputs. Finally, we show how to instantiate the framework to optimally bid in various mechanisms of practical relevance, such as first- and second-price auctions",

The per-expert context distribution enables automatic curricula learning, allowing each expert to focus on its best-performing sub-region of the context space.

The paper focuses on the setting in which candidates are divided into multiple groups and the observed utilities of candidates in some groups are biased–systematically lower than their true utilities. The first result is that, in these biased settings, prior algorithms can lead to selections with sub-optimal true utility and significant discrepancies in the fraction of candidates from each group that get their preferred choices. Subsequently, an algorithm is presented along with proof that it produces selections that achieve near-optimal group fairness with respect to preferences while also nearly maximizing the true utility under distributional assumptions.

Our framework incorporates visual planning to capture intricate environmental details, while language planning enhances the logical coherence of the overall system. We evaluate the effectiveness of our framework across vision-language tasks, vision-only tasks, and language-only tasks. The results demonstrate the superior performance of our approach, indicating that the integration of visual and language planning yields better contextually aware task execution",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In the field of safe reinforcement learning (RL), finding a balance between satisfying safety constraints and optimizing reward performance presents a significant challenge. A key obstacle in this endeavor is the estimation of safety constraints, which is typically more difficult than estimating a reward metric due to the sparse nature of the constraint signals. To address this issue, we introduce a novel framework named Feasibility Consistent Safe Reinforcement Learning (FCSRL). This framework combines representation learning with feasibility-oriented objectives to identify and extract safety-related information from the raw state for safe RL. Leveraging self-supervised learning techniques and a more learnable safety metric, our approach enhances the policy learning and constraint estimation. Empirical evaluations across a range of vector-state and image-based tasks demonstrate that our method is capable of learning a better safety-aware embedding and achieving superior performance than previous representation learning baselines",

    "abstract": "Offline reinforcement learning algorithms have proven effective on datasets highly connected to the target downstream task. Yet, by leveraging a novel testbed (MOOD) in which trajectories come from heterogeneous sources, we show that existing methods struggle with diverse data: their performance considerably deteriorates as data collected for related but different tasks is simply added to the offline buffer. In light of this finding, we conduct a large empirical study where we formulate and test several hypotheses to explain this failure. Surprisingly, we find that targeted scale, more than algorithmic considerations, is the key factor influencing performance. We show that simple methods like AWAC and IQL with increased policy size overcome the paradoxical failure modes from the inclusion of additional data in MOOD, and notably outperform prior state-of-the-art algorithms on the canonical D4RL benchmark",

Furthermore, we extend this idea to non-contrastive learning methods which do not inherently rely on negatives. For these methods, a pseudo-negative is defined as the output from the previous model for a differently augmented version of the anchor sample and is asymmetrically applied to the regularization term.

We propose the first framework for auditing private prediction where we instantiate adversaries with varying poisoning and query capabilities. This enables us to study the privacy leakage of four private prediction algorithms: PATE (Papernot et al., 2016), CaPC (Choquette-Choo et al., 2020), PromptPATE (Duan et al., 2023), and Private-kNN (Zhu et al., 2020). To conduct our audit, we introduce novel techniques to empirically evaluate privacy leakage in terms of Renyi DP. Our experiments show that (i) the privacy analysis of private prediction can be improved, (ii) algorithms which are easier to poison lead to much higher privacy leakage, and (iii) the privacy leakage is significantly lower for adversaries without query control than those with full control",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has been credited as the key advance that has allowed Large Language Models (LLMs) to effectively follow instructions and produce useful assistance. Classically, this involves generating completions from the LLM in response to a query before using a separate reward model to assign a score to the full completion. As an auto-regressive process, the LLM has to take many \"actions\" (selecting individual tokens) and only receives a single, sparse reward at the end of an episode, a setup that is known to be difficult to optimise in traditional reinforcement learning. In this work we leverage the fact that the reward model contains more information than just its scalar output, in particular, it calculates an attention map over tokens as part of the transformer architecture. We use these attention weights to redistribute the reward along the whole completion, effectively densifying the signal and highlighting the most important tokens, all without incurring extra computational cost or requiring any additional modelling. We demonstrate that, theoretically, this approach is equivalent to potential-based reward shaping, ensuring that the optimal policy remains unchanged. Empirically, we show that it stabilises training, accelerates the rate of learning, and, in practical cases, may lead to better local optima",

However, existing methods often ignore the features of classified pixels during feature propagation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a prototype-based feature augmentation method that leverages feature prototypes to augment scribble supervision.

Rectifying such biases may involve context-dependent interventions such as training separate models on subgroups, removing features with bias in the collection process, or even conducting real-world experiments to ascertain sources of bias. Despite the need for such data bias investigations, few automated methods exist to assist practitioners in these efforts. In this paper, we present one such method that given a dataset $X$ consisting of protected and unprotected features, outcomes $y$, and a regressor $h$ that predicts $y$ given $X$, outputs a tuple $(f_j, g)$, with the following property: $g$ corresponds to a subset of the training dataset $(X, y)$, such that the $j^{th}$ feature $f_j$ has much larger (or smaller) influence in the subgroup $g$, than on the dataset overall, which we call feature importance disparity (FID). We show across $4$ datasets and $4$ common feature importance methods of broad interest to the machine learning community that we can efficiently find subgroups with large FID values even over exponentially large subgroup classes and in practice these groups correspond to subgroups with potentially serious bias issues as measured by standard fairness metrics",

    "abstract": "A common network inference problem, arising from real-world data constraints, is how to infer a dynamic network from its time-aggregated adjacency matrix and time-varying marginals (i.e., row and column sums). Prior approaches to this problem have repurposed the classic iterative proportional fitting (IPF) procedure, also known as Sinkhorn's algorithm, with promising empirical results. However, the statistical foundation for using IPF has not been well understood: under what settings does IPF provide principled estimation of a dynamic network from its marginals, and how well does it estimate the network? In this work, we establish such a setting, by identifying a generative network model whose maximum likelihood estimates are recovered by IPF. Our model both reveals implicit assumptions on the use of IPF in such settings and enables new analyses, such as structure-dependent error bounds on IPF's parameter estimates. When IPF fails to converge on sparse network data, we introduce a principled algorithm that guarantees IPF converges under minimal changes to the network structure. Finally, we conduct experiments with synthetic and real-world data, which demonstrate the practical value of our theoretical and algorithmic contributions",

The experimental results show that LaMAGIC achieves a success rate of up to 96% under a strict tolerance of 0.01. We also examine the scalability and adaptability of LaMAGIC, specifically testing its performance on more complex circuits.

Our novel design enables robust appearance control over generated human images, including body, facial attributes, and even background.

This hierarchy encapsulates a wide range of prevalent methods. We derive theoretical bounds on the number of triangles and other short-length cycles producible by each level of the hierarchy, finding that more complex dependency structure allows an improved trade-off between representation power and overlap. We provide instances demonstrating the asymptotic optimality of our bounds. Furthermore, we introduce new generative models for each of the three hierarchical levels, leveraging dense subgraph discovery. Our evaluation, conducted on real-world datasets, focuses on assessing the output quality and overlap of our proposed models in comparison to other popular models.

    "title": "Performance Bounds for Active Binary Testing with Information Maximization",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In many applications like experimental design, group testing, and medical diagnosis, the state of a random variable $Y$ is revealed by successively observing the outcomes of binary tests about $Y$. New tests are selected adaptively based on the history of outcomes observed so far. If the number of states of $Y$ is finite, the process ends when $Y$ can be predicted with a desired level of confidence or all available tests have been used. Finding the strategy that minimizes the expected number of tests needed to predict $Y$ is virtually impossible in most real applications. Therefore, the commonly used strategy is the greedy heuristic of Information Maximization (InfoMax) that selects tests sequentially in order of information gain. Despite its widespread use, existing guarantees on its performance are often vacuous when compared to its empirical efficiency. In this paper, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, we establish tight non-vacuous bounds on InfoMax's performance. Our analysis is based on the assumption that at any iteration of the greedy strategy, there is always a binary test available whose conditional probability of being 'true', given the history, is within $\\delta$ units of one-half. This assumption is motivated by practical applications where the available set of tests often satisfies this property for modest values of $\\delta$, say, ${0.1 \\leq \\delta \\leq 0.4}$. Specifically, we analyze two distinct scenarios: (i) all tests are functions of $Y$, and (ii) test outcomes are corrupted by a binary symmetric channel. For both cases, our bounds guarantee the near-optimal performance of InfoMax for modest $\\delta$ values. It requires only a small multiplicative factor of the entropy of $Y$, in terms of the average number of tests needed to make accurate predictions",

Offline value function learning, in particular, struggles with sparse-reward, long-horizon tasks due to the difficulty of solving credit assignment and extrapolation errors that accumulates as the horizon of the task grows. On the other hand, models that can perform well in long-horizon tasks are designed specifically for goal-conditioned tasks, which commonly perform worse than value function learning methods on short-horizon, dense-reward scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose a hierarchical planner designed for offline RL called PlanDQ. PlanDQ incorporates a diffusion-based planner at the high level, named D-Conductor, which guides the low-level policy through sub-goals. At the low level, we used a Q-learning based approach called the Q-Performer to accomplish these sub-goals.

    "title": "How Interpretable Are Interpretable Graph Neural Networks?",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Interpretable graph neural networks (XGNNs ) are widely adopted in various scientific applications involving graph-structured data. Existing XGNNs predominantly adopt the attention-based mechanism to learn edge or node importance for extracting and making predictions with the interpretable subgraph. However, the representational properties and limitations of these methods remain inadequately explored. In this work, we present a theoretical framework that formulates interpretable subgraph learning with the multilinear extension of the subgraph distribution, coined as subgraph multilinear extension (SubMT). Extracting the desired interpretable subgraph requires an accurate approximation of SubMT, yet we find that the existing XGNNs can have a huge gap in fitting SubMT. Consequently, the SubMT approximation failure will lead to the degenerated interpretability of the extracted subgraphs. To mitigate the issue, we design a new XGNN architecture called Graph Multilinear neT (GMT), which is provably more powerful in approximating SubMT. We empirically validate our theoretical findings on a number of graph classification benchmarks. The results demonstrate that GMT outperforms the state-of-the-art up to 10% in terms of both interpretability and generalizability across 12 regular and geometric graph benchmarks",

    "title": "Doubly Robust Causal Effect Estimation under Networked Interference via Targeted Learning",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Causal effect estimation under networked interference is an important but challenging problem. Available parametric methods are limited in their model space, while previous semiparametric methods, e.g., leveraging neural networks to fit only one single nuisance function, may still encounter misspecification problems under networked interference without appropriate assumptions on the data generation process. To mitigate bias stemming from misspecification, we propose a novel doubly robust causal effect estimator under networked interference, by adapting the targeted learning technique to the training of neural networks. Specifically, we generalize the targeted learning technique into the networked interference setting and establish the condition under which an estimator achieves double robustness. Based on the condition, we devise an end-to-end causal effect estimator by transforming the identified theoretical condition into a targeted loss. Moreover, we provide a theoretical analysis of our designed estimator, revealing a faster convergence rate compared to a single nuisance model. Extensive experimental results on two real-world networks with semisynthetic data demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed estimators",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We investigate the problem of explainability for machine learning models, focusing on Feature Attribution Methods (FAMs) that evaluate feature importance through perturbation tests. Despite their utility, FAMs struggle to distinguish the contributions of different features, when their prediction changes are similar after perturbation. To enhance FAMs' discriminative power, we introduce Feature Attribution with Necessity and Sufficiency (FANS), which find a neighborhood of the input such that perturbing samples within this neighborhood have a high Probability of being Necessity and Sufficiency (PNS) cause for the change in predictions, and use this PNS as the importance of the feature. Specifically, FANS compute this PNS via a heuristic strategy for estimating the neighborhood and a perturbation test involving two stages (factual and interventional) for counterfactual reasoning. To generate counterfactual samples, we use a resampling-based approach on the observed samples to approximate the required conditional distribution. We demonstrate that FANS outperforms existing attribution methods on six benchmarks. Please refer to the source code via https://github.com/DMIRLAB-Group/FANS",

It is challenging to create the best instruction, especially for black-box LLMs on which backpropagation is forbidden. Instead of directly optimizing the discrete instruction, we optimize a low-dimensional soft prompt applied to an open-source LLM to generate the instruction for the black-box LLM. In each optimization step of the proposed method InstructZero, a soft prompt is converted into an instruction by the open-source LLM, which is then submitted to the black-box LLM for zero-shot evaluation, whose result is sent to Bayesian optimization to produce new soft prompts improving the zero-shot performance. We evaluate InstructZero on different combinations of open-source LLMs and APIs including Vicuna and ChatGPT.

    "abstract": "The growing richness of large-scale datasets has been crucial in driving the rapid advancement and wide adoption of machine learning technologies. The massive collection and usage of data, however, pose an increasing risk for people's private and sensitive information due to either inadvertent mishandling or malicious exploitation. Besides legislative solutions, many technical approaches have been proposed towards data privacy protection. However, they bear various limitations such as leading to degraded data availability and utility, or relying on heuristics and lacking solid theoretical bases. To overcome these limitations, we propose a formal information-theoretic definition for this utility-preserving privacy protection problem, and design a data-driven learnable data transformation framework that is capable of selectively suppressing sensitive attributes from target datasets while preserving the other useful attributes, regardless of whether or not they are known in advance or explicitly annotated for preservation. We provide rigorous theoretical analyses on the operational bounds for our framework, and carry out comprehensive experimental evaluations using datasets of a variety of modalities, including facial images, voice audio clips, and human activity motion sensor signals. Results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our method under various configurations on a multitude of tasks. Our source code is available at this URL",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In reinforcement learning, it is crucial to have an accurate environment dynamics model to evaluate different policies' value in downstream tasks like offline policy optimization and policy evaluation. However, the learned model is known to be inaccurate in predictions when evaluating target policies different from data-collection policies. In this work, we found that utilizing policy representation for model learning, called policy-conditioned model (PCM) learning, is useful to mitigate the problem, especially when the offline dataset is collected from diversified behavior policies. The reason beyond that is in this case, PCM becomes a meta-dynamics model that is trained to be aware of and focus on the evaluation policies that on-the-fly adjust the model to be suitable to the evaluation policies' state-action distribution, thus improving the prediction accuracy. Based on that intuition, we propose an easy-to-implement yet effective algorithm of PCM for accurate model learning. We also give a theoretical analysis and experimental evidence to demonstrate the feasibility of reducing value gaps by adapting the dynamics model under different policies. Experiment results show that PCM outperforms the existing SOTA off-policy evaluation methods in the DOPE benchmark by a large margin, and derives significantly better policies in offline policy selection and model predictive control compared with the standard model learning method",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained significant attention recently, showing remarkable potential in artificial general intelligence. However, assessing the utility of MLLMs presents considerable challenges, primarily due to the absence multimodal benchmarks that align with human preferences. Drawing inspiration from the concept of LLM-as-a-Judge within LLMs, this paper introduces a novel benchmark, termed MLLM-as-a-Judge, to assess the ability of MLLMs in assisting judges across diverse modalities, encompassing three distinct tasks: Scoring Evaluation, Pair Comparison, and Batch Ranking. Our study reveals that, while MLLMs demonstrate remarkable human-like discernment in Pair Comparisons, there is a significant divergence from human preferences in Scoring Evaluation and Batch Ranking tasks. Furthermore, a closer examination reveals persistent challenges in the evaluative capacities of LLMs, including diverse biases, hallucinatory responses, and inconsistencies in judgment, even in advanced models such as GPT-4V. These findings emphasize the pressing need for enhancements and further research efforts to be undertaken before regarding MLLMs as fully reliable evaluators. In light of this, we advocate for additional efforts dedicated to supporting the continuous development within the domain of MLLM functioning as judges.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have accomplished remarkable reasoning performance in various domains. However, in the domain of reasoning tasks, we discover a frailty: LLMs are surprisingly brittle to the ordering of the premises, despite the fact that such ordering does not alter the underlying task. In particular, we observe that LLMs achieve the best performance when the premise order aligns with the context required in intermediate reasoning steps. For example, in deductive reasoning tasks, presenting the premises in the same order as the ground truth proof in the prompt (as opposed to random ordering) drastically increases the model's accuracy. We first examine the effect of premise ordering on deductive reasoning on a variety of LLMs, and our evaluation shows that even if the model performance is decent on the optimal order, permuting the premise order can cause a performance drop of over 30%. In addition, we release the benchmark R-GSM, based on GSM8K, to examine the ordering effect for mathematical problem-solving, and we again observe a significant drop in accuracy, relative to the original GSM8K benchmark",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Harnessing the power of human-annotated data through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is pivotal for advancing Large Language Models (LLMs). In this paper, we delve into the prospect of growing a strong LLM out of a weak one without the need for acquiring additional human-annotated data. We propose a new fine-tuning method called Self-Play fIne-tuNing (SPIN), which starts from a supervised fine-tuned model. At the heart of SPIN lies a self-play mechanism, where the LLM refines its capability by playing against instances of itself. More specifically, the LLM generates its own training data from its previous iterations, refining its policy by discerning these self-generated responses from those obtained from human-annotated data. Our method progressively elevates the LLM from a nascent model to a formidable one, unlocking the full potential of human-annotated demonstration data for SFT. Theoretically, we prove that the global optimum to the training objective function of our method is achieved only when the LLM policy aligns with the target data distribution. Empirically, we evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets including the HuggingFace Open LLM Leaderboard, MT-Bench, and datasets from Big-Bench. Our results show that SPIN can significantly improve the LLM's performance across a variety of benchmarks and even outperform models trained through direct preference optimization (DPO) supplemented with extra GPT-4 preference data. This sheds light on the promise of self-play, enabling the achievement of human-level performance in LLMs without the need for expert opponents",
