    "title": "Can a Crow Hatch a Falcon? Lineage Matters in Predicting Large Language Model Performance",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Accurately forecasting the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) before extensive fine-tuning or merging can substantially reduce both computational expense and development time. Although prior approaches like scaling laws account for global factors such as parameter size or training tokens, they often overlook explicit lineage relationships—i.e., which models are derived or merged from which parents. In this work, we propose a novel Lineage-Regularized Matrix Factorization (LRMF) framework that encodes ancestral ties among LLMs via a graph Laplacian regularizer. By leveraging multi-hop parent--child connections, LRMF consistently outperforms conventional matrix factorization and collaborative filtering methods in both instance-level and benchmark-level performance prediction. Our large-scale study includes 2,934 publicly available Hugging Face models and 21,000+ instances across 6 major benchmarks, showing that the introduction of lineage constraints yields up to 0.15–0.30 higher correlation coefficients with actual performance compared to baseline methods. Moreover, LRMF effectively addresses the cold-start problem, providing accurate estimates for newly derived or merged models even with minimal data. This lineage-guided strategy thus offers a resource-efficient way to inform hyperparameter tuning, data selection, and model combination in modern LLM development",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) demonstrates remarkable capabilities for enhancing the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge. Standard RAG introduces additional computations due to the extra retrieved context. To improve efficiency, recent studies propose compressing chunk tokens into compact forms, such as key-value (KV) caches. However, maintaining these compressed KV caches in an updated state presents a significant challenge, undermining the primary goal of RAG: acquiring up-to-date knowledge. In this work, we propose **E$^{2}$-RAG**, the first **E**ditable **E**fficient-**RAG** method designed to efficiently edit compressed KV caches for knowledge updates. E$^2$-RAG features an encoder-decoder architecture similar to efficient RAG methods, along with an additional editor. The encoder-decoder compresses chunk tokens into KV caches and generates responses. The editor takes old KV caches and new knowledge tokens as inputs, enabling efficient updates to the KV caches. To formalize knowledge updating, we define three operations: INSERT, DELETE, and UPDATE. We create three sets of datasets for each operation. Through extensive experiments, E$^2$-RAG achieves nearly **40x faster** editing compared to recomputing KV caches while maintaining **3x faster** generation efficiency than standard RAG, with a performance downgrade of 1%-5%. We also conduct various ablation studies, including multi-turn editing, multi-chunk capability, and knowledge conflicts, to explore the capabilities of E$^2$-RAG",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Spoken language understanding (SLU) is indispensable for half of all living languages that lack a formal writing system, since these languages cannot pair automatic speech recognition (ASR) with language models to benefit from language technology. Even if low-resource languages possess a writing system, ASR for these languages remains unreliable due to limited bimodal speech and text training data. However, the evaluation of multilingual SLU remains limited to shallow tasks such as intent classification or language identification. To address this, we present Fleurs-SLU, a multilingual SLU benchmark that encompasses (i) 692 hours of speech for topical utterance classification in 102 languages and (ii) multiple-choice question answering through listening comprehension spanning 944 hours of speech across 92 languages. We extensively evaluate both end-to-end speech classification models and cascaded systems that combine speech-to-text transcription with subsequent classification by large language models on Fleurs-SLU. Our results show that cascaded systems exhibit greater robustness in multilingual SLU tasks, though speech encoders can achieve competitive performance in topical speech classification when appropriately pre-trained. We further find a strong correlation between robust multilingual ASR, effective speech-to-text translation, and strong multilingual SLU, highlighting the mutual benefits between acoustic and semantic speech representations",

Our results show that NoWag-VQ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art one-shot vector quantization methods, while NoWag-P performs competitively against leading pruning techniques.

    "abstract": "Textual data annotation, the process of labeling or tagging text with relevant information, is typically costly, time-consuming, and labor-intensive. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential as direct alternatives to human annotators for general domains natural language processing (NLP) tasks, their effectiveness on annotation tasks in domains requiring expert knowledge remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate: whether top-performing LLMs, which might be perceived as having expert-level proficiency in academic and professional benchmarks, can serve as direct alternatives to human expert annotators? To this end, we evaluate both individual LLMs and multi-agent approaches across three highly specialized domains: finance, biomedicine, and law. Specifically, we propose a multi-agent discussion framework to simulate a group of human annotators, where LLMs are tasked to engage in discussions by considering others' annotations and justifications before finalizing their labels. Additionally, we incorporate reasoning models (*e.g.*, o3-mini) to enable a more comprehensive comparison. Our empirical results reveal that: *(1)* Individual LLMs equipped with inference-time techniques (*e.g.*, chain-of-thought (CoT), self-consistency) show only marginal or even negative performance gains, contrary to prior literature suggesting their broad effectiveness. *(2)* Overall, reasoning models do not demonstrate statistically significant improvements over non-reasoning models in most settings. This suggests that extended long CoT provides relatively limited benefits for data annotation in specialized domains. *(3)* Certain model behaviors emerge in the multi-agent discussion environment. For instance, Claude 3.7 Sonnet with thinking rarely changes its initial annotations, even when other agents provide correct annotations or valid reasoning",

To validate our approach, we successfully reproduce the challenging MMLU-Pro benchmark across 86 models spanning 400M to 405B parameters, achieving remarkable Pearson correlations of 0.91-0.99 while generating entirely novel questions for under $15 per model. This demonstrates that dynamically generated evaluations can match the discriminative power of expert-curated benchmarks while eliminating contamination risks. YourBench enables researchers to create domain-specific benchmarks in minutes rather than months. We demonstrate applications in agriculture, personalized education, and RAG training that were previously infeasible. By releasing the YourBench library, Tempora-0325 dataset, 150K+ generated QA pairs, and all evaluation traces, we provide the community with a practical solution to the challenge of keeping pace with rapidly evolving model capabilities",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Legal practitioners, particularly those early in their careers, face complex, high-stakes tasks that require adaptive, context-sensitive reasoning. While AI holds promise in supporting legal work, current datasets and models are narrowly focused on isolated subtasks and fail to capture the end-to-end decision-making required in real-world practice. To address this gap, we introduce _LawFlow_, a dataset of complete end-to-end legal workflows collected from trained law students, grounded in real-world business entity formation scenarios. Unlike prior datasets focused on input-output pairs or linear chains of thought, _LawFlow_ captures dynamic, modular, and iterative reasoning processes that reflect the ambiguity, revision, and client-adaptive strategies of legal practice. Using _LawFlow_, we compare human and LLM-generated workflows, revealing systematic differences in structure, reasoning flexibility, and plan execution. Human workflows tend to be modular and adaptive, while LLM workflows are more sequential, exhaustive, and less sensitive to downstream implications. Our findings also suggest that legal professionals prefer AI to carry out supportive roles, such as brainstorming, identifying blind spots, and surfacing alternatives, rather than executing complex workflows end-to-end. Our results highlight both the current limitations of LLMs in supporting complex legal workflows and opportunities for developing more collaborative, reasoning-aware legal AI systems.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often lack traceable and explainable mechanisms for visual-textual alignment, making it challenging to understand how textual instructions shape multimodal representations. To address this shortcoming, we propose an information-theoretic framework that clarifies how MLLMs handle and transform both text and visual inputs. In particular, we measure the visual information gain that arises from textual instructions and multimodal encodings, thereby illuminating how different modalities interact and contribute to the model's overall processing. Our framework decomposes the multimodal encoding process into layer-wise mutual information measures for better explainability, quantifying the visual contribution as the difference between unconditional and text-conditional mutual information. Specifically, inspired by the Information Bottleneck framework, we introduce a Concept Bottleneck that maps high-dimensional multimodal representations into an interpretable space, enabling tractable variational upper bounds on the mutual information between visual inputs and the model's internal states. Furthermore, we quantify the contextual contribution introduced by textual cues via an InfoNCE mechanism that contrasts multimodal representations computed with and without text guidance. This dual perspective, facilitated by tractable variational upper bounds, provides insight into how visual information is encoded and filtered by textual instructions, while also highlighting the contextual information induced and enhanced by MLLMs. Empirical findings demonstrate underexplored dynamics of visual-textual interaction within MLLMs, underscoring how textual instructions distinctly shape visual representations and demonstrating how visual prompts, when effectively paired with instructions, enhance multimodal understanding",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recent advancements in instructional fine-tuning have injected noise into embeddings, with NEFTune (Jain et al., 2024) setting benchmarks using uniform noise. Despite NEFTune's empirical findings that uniform noise outperforms Gaussian noise, the reasons for this remain unclear. This paper aims to clarify this by offering a thorough analysis, both theoretical and empirical, indicating comparable performance among these noise types. Additionally, we introduce a new fine-tuning method for language models, utilizing symmetric noise in embeddings. This method aims to enhance the model's function by more stringently regulating its local curvature, demonstrating superior performance over the current method, NEFTune. When fine-tuning the LLaMA-2-7B model using Alpaca, standard techniques yield a 29.79% score on AlpacaEval. However, our approach, SymNoise, increases this score significantly to 69.04%, using symmetric noisy embeddings. This is a 6.7% improvement over the state-of-the-art method, NEFTune (64.69%). Furthermore, when tested on various models and stronger baseline instruction datasets, such as Evol-Instruct, ShareGPT, OpenPlatypus, SymNoise consistently outperforms NEFTune. The current literature, including NEFTune, has underscored the importance of more in-depth research into the application of noise-based strategies in the fine-tuning of language models. Our approach, SymNoise, is another significant step towards this direction, showing notable improvement over the existing state-of-the-art method",

    "abstract": "To mitigate reward hacking from response verbosity, modern preference optimization methods are increasingly adopting length normalization (e.g., SimPO, ORPO, LN-DPO). While effective against this bias, we demonstrate that length normalization itself introduces a failure mode: the **URSLA shortcut**. Here models learn to satisfy the alignment objective by prematurely truncating low-quality responses rather than learning from their semantic content. To address this, we introduce **REFA**, a new alignment framework that proposes probabilistic control on a structural token that controls termination. Our core innovation is a new class of regularizers that operate directly on the probability of the End-of-Sequence (EOS) token, a previously unexploited control lever. This token-level intervention provides a principled solution to the URSLA shortcut, ensuring genuine quality improvements. Furthermore, it unlocks a versatile mechanism for managing the alignment-efficiency tradeoff, enabling practitioners to fine-tune models that adhere to specific token budgets. Empirically, REFA achieves a **60.29\\%** win rate and a **52.17\\%** length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval2 with Llama-3-8B-Instruct, demonstrating the power of our token-level control paradigm",

    "abstract": "Hyperparameters greatly impact models' capabilities; however, modern models are too large for extensive search. Instead, researchers design recipes that train well across scales based on their understanding of the hyperparameters. Despite this importance, few tools exist for understanding the hyperparameter loss surface. We discover novel structure in it and propose a new theory yielding such tools. The loss surface is complex, but as you approach the optimum simple structure emerges. It becomes characterized by a few basic features, like its effective dimension and the best possible loss. To uncover this *asymptotic regime*, we develop a novel technique based on random search. Within this regime, the best scores from random search take on a new distribution we discover. Its parameters are exactly the features defining the loss surface in the asymptotic regime. From these features, we derive a new asymptotic law for random search that can explain and extrapolate its convergence. These new tools enable new analyses, such as confidence intervals for the best possible performance or determining the effective number of hyperparameters.

    "abstract": "Membership inference attacks serves as useful tool for fair use of language models, such as detecting potential copyright infringement and auditing data leakage. However, many current state-of-the-art attacks require access to models' hidden states or probability distribution, which prevents investigation into more widely-used, API-access only models like GPT-4. In this work, we introduce N-Gram Coverage Attack, a membership inference attack that relies **solely** on text outputs from the target model, enabling attacks on completely black-box models. We leverage the observation that models are more likely to memorize and subsequently generate text patterns that were commonly observed in their training data. Specifically, to make a prediction on a candidate member, N-Gram Coverage Attack first obtains multiple model generations conditioned on a prefix of the candidate. It then uses n-gram overlap metrics to compute and aggregate the similarities of these outputs with the ground truth suffix; high similarities indicate likely membership. We first demonstrate on a diverse set of existing benchmarks that N-Gram Coverage Attack outperforms other black-box methods while also impressively achieving comparable or even better performance to state-of-the-art white-box attacks --- despite having access to only text outputs. Interestingly, we find that the success rate of our method scales with the attack compute budget --- as we increase the number of sequences generated from the target model conditioned on the prefix, attack performance tends to improve. Having verified the accuracy of our method, we use it to investigate previously unstudied closed OpenAI models on multiple domains. We find that more recent models, such as GPT-4o, exhibit increased robustness to membership inference, suggesting an evolving trend toward improved privacy protections",

As focus is shifting towards solving more complex reasoning and agentic tasks, language models must take multiple steps of text generation, reasoning and environment interaction before generating a solution. We propose a synthetic data generation and RL methodology targeting multi-step optimization scenarios. This approach, called Step-Wise Reinforcement Learning (SWiRL), iteratively generates multi-step reasoning and tool use data, and then learns from that data. It employs a simple step-wise decomposition that breaks each multi-step trajectory into multiple sub-trajectories corresponding to each action by the original model. It then applies synthetic data filtering and RL optimization on these sub-trajectories. We evaluated SWiRL on a number of multi-step tool use, question answering, and mathematical reasoning tasks.

In this paper, we challenge that interpretation. We construct synthetic datasets with matched structure but varied readability, and find that readability alone does not predict coherence or learning efficiency in SLMs. Models trained on complex, adult-level text perform comparably to those trained on simplified language, and even exhibit faster development of coherence during training. Instead, we show that statistical simplicity, as measured by n-gram diversity, is a stronger predictor of learnability.

In such settings, the retrieval component of a RAG pipeline must recognize a variety of relevance signals, and the generation component must connect and synthesize information across multiple sources. We present a scalable framework for constructing evaluation benchmarks that challenge RAG systems to integrate information across distinct sources and generate long-form responses. Using our framework, we build two new benchmarks on Multi-Source Retrieval and Synthesis: MSRS-Story and MSRS-Meet, representing narrative synthesis and summarization tasks, respectively, that require retrieval from large collections. Our extensive experiments with various RAG pipelines—including sparse and dense retrievers combined with frontier LLMs—reveal that generation quality is highly dependent on retrieval effectiveness, which varies greatly by task.

When users request that LLMs \"cite reputable sources,\" \"express appropriate uncertainty,\" or \"include multiple perspectives,\" they discover that current interfaces provide no structured way to articulate these preferences. The result is prompt sharing folklore: community-specific copied prompts passed through trust relationships rather than based on measured efficacy. We propose the Epistemic Alignment Framework, a set of ten challenges in knowledge transmission derived from the philosophical literature of epistemology, concerning issues such as uncertainty expression, evidence quality assessment, and calibration of testimonial reliance. The framework serves as a structured intermediary between user needs and system capabilities, creating a common vocabulary to bridge the gap between what users want and what systems deliver. Through a thematic analysis of custom prompts and personalization strategies shared on online communities where these issues are actively discussed, we find users develop elaborate workarounds to address each of the challenges. We then apply our framework to two prominent model providers, OpenAI and Anthropic, through structured content analysis of their documented policies and product features. Our analysis shows that while these providers have partially addressed the challenges we identified, they fail to establish adequate mechanisms for specifying epistemic preferences, lack transparency about how preferences are implemented, and offer no verification tools to confirm whether preferences were followed.

We introduce PrefPalette, a framework that decomposes preferences into attribute dimensions and tailors its preference prediction to distinct social community values in a human-interpretable way. PrefPalette operationalizes a cognitive science principle known as multi-attribute decision making in two ways: (1) a scalable counterfactual attribute synthesis step that involves generating synthetic training data to isolate for individual attribute effects (e.g., formality, humor, cultural values), and (2) attention-based preference modeling that learns how different social communities dynamically weight these attributes. This approach moves beyond aggregate preference modeling to capture the diverse evaluation frameworks that drive human judgment. When evaluated on 45 social communities from the online platform Reddit, PrefPalette outperforms GPT-4o by 46.6% in average prediction accuracy. Beyond raw predictive improvements, PrefPalette also shed light on intuitive, community-specific profiles: scholarly communities prioritize verbosity and stimulation, conflict-oriented communities value sarcasm and directness, and support-based communities emphasize empathy.

To address these challenges, we present X-Teaming, a scalable framework that systematically explores how seemingly harmless interactions escalate into harmful outcomes and generates corresponding attack scenarios. X-Teaming employs collaborative agents for planning, attack optimization, and verification, achieving state-of-the-art multi-turn jailbreak effectiveness and diversity with success rates up to 98.1% across representative leading open-weight and closed-source models. In particular, X-Teaming achieves a 96.2% attack success rate against the latest Claude 3.7 Sonnet model, which has been considered nearly immune to single-turn attacks. Building on X-Teaming, we introduce X-Guard-Train, an open-source multi-turn safety training dataset that's $~20\\times$ larger than the previous best resource, comprising 30K interactive jailbreaks, designed to enable robust multi-turn safety alignment for LMs. Our work offers essential tools and insights for mitigating sophisticated conversational attacks, advancing the multi-turn safety of LMs",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as personalized assistants for users across a wide range of tasks – from offering writing support to delivering tailored recommendations or consultations. Over time, the interaction history between a user and an LLM can provide extensive information about an individual's traits and preferences. However, open questions remain on how well LLMs today can effectively leverage such history to (1) internalize the user's inherent traits and preferences, (2) track how the user profiling and preferences evolve over time, and (3) generate personalized responses accordingly in new scenarios. In this work, we introduce the PERSONAMEM benchmark. PERSONAMEM features curated user profiles with over 180 simulated user-LLM interaction histories, each containing up to 60 sessions of multi-turn conversations across 15 real-world tasks that require personalization. Given an in-situ user query at a specific time point, we evaluate LLM chatbots' ability to identify the most suitable response according to the current state of the user's profile. We observe that current LLMs still struggle to recognize the dynamic evolution in users' profiles over time through direct prompting approaches. As a consequence, LLMs often fail to deliver responses that align with users' current situations and preferences, with frontier models such as GPT-4.5, or Gemini-2.0 achieving only around 50% overall accuracy, suggesting room for improvement. We hope that PERSONAMEM, along with the user profile and conversation simulation pipeline, can facilitate future research in the development of truly user-aware chatbots",

In this work, we introduce SUV (Selective Unlearning for Verbatim data), a selective unlearning framework designed to prevent LLM from memorizing copyrighted content while preserving its overall utility. In detail, the proposed method constructs a dataset that captures instances of copyrighted infringement cases by the targeted LLM. With the dataset, we unlearn the content from the LLM by means of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which replaces the verbatim copyrighted content with plausible and coherent alternatives. Since DPO may hinder the LLM's performance in other unrelated tasks, we integrate gradient projection and Fisher information regularization to mitigate the degradation. We validate our approach using a large-scale dataset of 500 famous books (predominantly copyrighted works) and demonstrate that SUV significantly reduces verbatim memorization with negligible impact on the performance on unrelated tasks. Extensive experiments on both our dataset and public benchmarks confirm the scalability and efficacy of our approach, offering a promising solution for mitigating copyright risks in real-world LLM applications",

    "abstract": "WebShell attacks, where malicious scripts are injected into web servers, pose a significant cybersecurity threat. Traditional machine learning and deep learning methods are often hampered by challenges such as the need for extensive training data, catastrophic forgetting, and poor generalization. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a powerful alternative for code-related tasks, but their potential in WebShell detection remains underexplored. In this paper, we make two major contributions: (1) a comprehensive evaluation of seven LLMs, including GPT-4, LLaMA 3.1 70B, and Qwen 2.5 variants, benchmarked against traditional sequence- and graph-based methods using a dataset of 26.59K PHP scripts, and (2) the Behavioral Function-Aware Detection (BFAD) framework, designed to address the specific challenges of applying LLMs to this domain. Our framework integrates three components: a Critical Function Filter that isolates malicious PHP function calls, a Context-Aware Code Extraction strategy that captures the most behaviorally indicative code segments, and Weighted Behavioral Function Profiling (WBFP) that enhances in-context learning by prioritizing the most relevant demonstrations based on discriminative function-level profiles. Our results show that, stemming from their distinct analytical strategies, larger LLMs achieve near-perfect precision but lower recall, while smaller models exhibit the opposite trade-off. However, all baseline models lag behind previous State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) methods. With the application of BFAD, the performance of all LLMs improves significantly, yielding an average F1 score increase of 13.82%. Notably, larger models like GPT-4, LLaMA-3.1-70B, and Qwen-2.5-Coder-14B now outperform SOTA benchmarks, while smaller models such as Qwen-2.5-Coder-3B achieve performance competitive with traditional methods. This work is the first to explore the feasibility and limitations of LLMs for WebShell detection and provides solutions to address the challenges in this task",

    "abstract": "Modern large language models often encode sensitive, harmful, or copyrighted knowledge, raising the need for post-hoc unlearning—the ability to remove specific domains of knowledge from a model without full retraining. A major bottleneck in current unlearning pipelines is constructing effective forget sets—datasets that approximate the target domain and guide the model to forget it. In this work, we introduce a scalable, automated approach to generate high-quality forget sets using language models themselves. Our method synthesizes textbook-style data through a structured prompting pipeline, requiring only a domain name as input. Through experiments on unlearning biosecurity, cybersecurity, and Harry Potter novels, we show that our synthetic datasets consistently outperform the baseline synthetic alternatives and are comparable to the expert-curated ones. Additionally, ablation studies reveal that the multi-step generation pipeline significantly boosts data diversity, which in turn improves unlearning utility. Overall, our findings suggest that synthetic datasets offer a promising path toward practical, scalable unlearning for a wide range of emerging domains without the need for manual intervention.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "A key challenge in AI alignment is guiding large language models (LLMs) to follow desired behaviors at test time. Activation steering, which modifies internal model activations during inference, offers a promising solution. However, prior work in dense activation spaces struggles with $\\textit{superposition}$, where multiple features become entangled, limiting interpretability and precise control. In contrast, sparse representations offer an untapped opportunity for more interpretable behavior modulation. In this work, we introduce $\\textit{Sparse Activation Steering}$ (SAS), a novel method for steering LLM behavior in $\\textit{sparse spaces}$. By isolating behavior-specific features (i.e., latent dimensions) through a contrastive prompt-pairing approach, we define a set of features that can selectively reinforce or suppress behaviors. Experiments on Gemma 2 LLMs show that SAS vectors enable steering on par with its dense counterpart while offering interpretability advantages such as easier compositionality of features in these spaces. Furthermore, our scaling studies on sparse latents reveal a trend toward greater sparsity in SAS vectors, approaching ideal $\\textit{monosemanticity}$",

    "abstract": "The recently proposed Forgetting Transformer (FoX) incorporates a forget gate into softmax attention and has shown consistently better or on-par performance compared to the standard RoPE-based Transformer. Notably, many attention heads in FoX tend to forget quickly, causing their output at each timestep to rely primarily on local context. Based on this observation, we propose Adaptive Computation Pruning (ACP) for FoX, a method that dynamically prunes computations involving input-output dependencies that are strongly decayed by the forget gate. In particular, our method performs *provably safe* pruning via a dynamically set pruning threshold that guarantees the pruned attention weights are negligible. We apply ACP to language model pretraining with FoX and show it consistently reduces the number of FLOPs and memory accesses in softmax attention by around 70\\% across different model sizes and context lengths, resulting in a roughly 50\\% to 70\\% reduction in attention runtime (or a 2--3$\\times$ speedup) and a roughly 10\\% to 40\\% increase in end-to-end training throughput. Furthermore, longer context lengths yield greater computational savings. All these speed improvements are achieved without any performance degradation.

Alignment and evaluation are critical components in the development of reliable LLMs, and the choice of feedback protocol plays a central role in both but remains understudied. In this work, we show that the choice of feedback protocol for evaluation (absolute scores versus relative preferences) can significantly affect evaluation reliability and induce systematic biases. In the context of LLM-as-a-judge evaluation, we show that pairwise protocols are more vulnerable to **distracted evaluation**. Generator models can exploit spurious attributes (or distractor features) favored by the LLM judge, resulting in inflated scores for lower-quality outputs. We find that absolute scoring is more robust to such manipulation, producing judgments that better reflect response quality and are less influenced by distractor features. Our results demonstrate that generator models can flip preferences by embedding distractor features, skewing LLM-as-a-judge comparisons and leading to inaccurate conclusions about model quality in benchmark evaluations. **Pairwise preferences flip in about 35\\% of the cases, compared to only 9\\% for absolute scores**.

We propose a debate-driven evaluation paradigm that transforms any existing QA dataset into structured adversarial debates—where one model is given the official answer to defend, and another constructs and defends an alternative answer—adjudicated by a judge model blind to the correct solution. By forcing multi-round argumentation, this approach substantially increases difficulty while penalizing shallow memorization, yet reuses QA items to reduce curation overhead. We make two main contributions: (1) an evaluation pipeline to systematically convert QA tasks into debate-based assessments, and (2) a public benchmark that demonstrates our paradigm's effectiveness on a subset of MMLU-Pro questions, complete with standardized protocols and reference models. Empirical results validate the robustness of the method and its effectiveness against data contamination—a Llama 3.1 model fine-tuned on test questions showed dramatic accuracy improvements (50% → 82%) but performed worse in debates. Results also show that even weaker judges can reliably differentiate stronger debaters, highlighting how debate-based evaluation can scale to future, more capable systems while maintaining a fraction of the cost of creating new benchmarks.

However, prior work has shown that these long-context models are not effective at their claimed context windows. To this end, retrieval-augmented systems provide an efficient and effective alternative. However, their performance can be highly sensitive to the choice of retrieval context length. In this work, we present a hybrid method that combines retrieval-augmented systems with long-context windows supported by recent language models. Our method first estimates the optimal retrieval length as a function of the retriever, summarizer, and dataset. On a randomly sampled subset of the dataset, we use a panel of LMs to generate a pool of silver references. We use these silver references to estimate the optimal context length for a given RAG system configuration. Our results on the multi-document summarization task showcase the effectiveness of our method across model classes and sizes.

However, its effectiveness is constrained by the token-intensive nature of multimodal inputs and the complexity of cross-modal few-shot reasoning, which together hinder LVLMs from extracting useful patterns from demonstrations. To address these challenges, we propose \\textbf{M²IV}, a novel representation engineering approach that replaces explicit token-level demonstrations with a set of learnable Multimodal In-context Vectors directly injected into the residual streams of LVLMs. By analyzing the distinct roles of multi-head attention (MHA) and multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) in the ICL process, we design a training strategy that enables M²IV to perform fine-grained semantic distillation and robust cross-modal representation learning. M²IV not only improves performance across diverse tasks and LVLMs but also significantly reduces token overhead, enabling graceful scaling to many-shot scenarios. To further enhance usability, we introduce \\textbf{VLibrary}, a repository that stores trained M²IVs for flexible retrieval and injection.

In particular, how LLMs balance self-interest and collective well-being is a critical challenge for ensuring alignment, robustness, and safe deployment. In this paper, we examine the challenge of costly sanctioning in multi-agent LLM systems, where an agent must decide whether to invest its own resources to incentivize cooperation or penalize defection. To study this, we adapt a public goods game with institutional choice from behavioral economics, allowing us to observe how different LLMs navigate social dilemmas over repeated interactions. Our analysis reveals four distinct behavioral patterns among models: some consistently establish and sustain high levels of cooperation, others fluctuate between engagement and disengagement, some gradually decline in cooperative behavior over time, and others rigidly follow fixed strategies regardless of outcomes. Surprisingly, we find that reasoning LLMs, such as the o1 series, struggle significantly with cooperation, whereas some traditional LLMs consistently achieve high levels of cooperation. These findings suggest that the current approach to improving LLMs, which focuses on enhancing their reasoning capabilities, does not necessarily lead to cooperation, providing valuable insights for deploying LLM agents in environments that require sustained collaboration",

Yet, it remains unclear whether LMs possess this capability or exhibit systematic biases leading to erroneous conclusions. In this work, we examine LMs' ability to explore and infer causal relationships, using the well-established Blicket Test paradigm from developmental psychology. We find that LMs reliably infer the common, intuitive disjunctive causal relationships but systematically struggle with the unusual, yet equally (or sometimes even more) evidenced conjunctive ones. This \"disjunctive bias\" persists across model families, sizes, and prompting strategies, and performance further declines as task complexity increases. Interestingly, an analogous bias appears in human adults, suggesting that LMs may have inherited deep-seated reasoning heuristics from their training data. To this end, we quantify similarities between LMs and humans, finding that LMs exhibit adult-like inference profiles (but not child-like). Finally, we propose a test-time sampling method which explicitly samples and eliminates hypotheses about causal relationships from the LM. This scalable approach significantly reduces the disjunctive bias and moves LMs closer to the goal of scientific, causally rigorous reasoning",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Stories are a fundamental aspect of human experience. Engaging deeply with stories and spotting plot holes—inconsistencies in a storyline that break the internal logic or rules of a story's world—requires nuanced reasoning skills, including tracking entities and events and their interplay, abstract thinking, pragmatic narrative understanding, commonsense and social reasoning, and theory of mind. As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly generate, interpret, and modify text, rigorously assessing their narrative consistency and deeper language understanding becomes critical. However, existing benchmarks focus mainly on surface-level comprehension. In this work, we propose plot hole detection in stories as a proxy to evaluate language understanding and reasoning in LLMs. We introduce FlawedFictionsMaker, a novel algorithm to controllably and carefully synthesize plot holes in human-written stories. Using this algorithm, we construct a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' plot hole detection abilities in stories —FlawedFictions—robust to contamination, with human filtering ensuring high quality. We find that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle in accurately solving FlawedFictions regardless of the reasoning effort allowed, with performance significantly degrading as story length increases. Finally, we show that LLM-based story summarization and story generation are prone to introducing plot holes, with 50%+ and 100%+ increases in plot hole detection rates with respect to human-written originals",

    "title": "Hell or High Water: Evaluating Agentic Recovery from External Failures",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "As language model agents are applied to real world problems of increasing complexity, they will be expected to formulate plans across large search spaces. If those plans fail for reasons beyond their control, how well do language agents search for alternative ways to achieve their goals? We devise a specialized agentic planning benchmark to study this question. Each planning problem is solved via combinations of function calls. The agent searches for relevant functions from a set of over four thousand possibilities, and observes environmental feedback in the form of function outputs or error messages. Our benchmark confronts the agent with external failures in its workflow, such as functions that suddenly become unavailable. At the same time, even with the introduction of these failures, we guarantee that the task remains solvable. Ideally, an agent's performance on the planning task should not be affected by the presence of external failures. Overall, we find that language agents struggle to formulate and execute backup plans in response to environment feedback. While state-of-the-art models are often able to identify the correct function to use in the right context, they struggle to adapt to feedback from the environment and often fail to pursue alternate courses of action, even when the search space is artificially restricted. We provide a systematic analysis of the failures of both open-source and commercial models, examining the effects of search space size, as well as the benefits of scaling model size in our setting. Our analysis identifies key challenges for current generative models as well as promising directions for future work",

One common strategy uses *verifiers* to evaluate candidate outputs. In this work, we propose a novel scaling dimension for test-time compute: *scaling the number of verifier models*. We introduce Multi-Agent Verification (MAV) as a test-time compute paradigm that combines multiple verifiers to improve performance. To investigate scaling up the verification compute, we propose to combine multiple Aspect Verifiers (AVs) --- off-the-shelf LLMs prompted to verify different aspects of outputs. AVs are a convenient building block for MAV since they can be easily combined without any additional training. We introduce BoN-MAV as a simple multi-agent verification algorithm that combines best-of-*n* sampling with aspect verifiers, and we show that performance improves as we spend more verification compute at test-time by increasing the number and type of verifiers. Moreover, we demonstrate both weak-to-strong generalization, where combining weak verifiers improves even stronger LLMs, and self-improvement, where the same base model is used to both generate and verify outputs. Our results establish scaling the number and type of verifier models as a promising new dimension for improving language model performance at test time",

However, in practice, these systems often need to handle ambiguous user queries and potentially conflicting information from multiple sources while also suppressing inaccurate information from noisy or irrelevant documents. Prior work has generally studied and addressed these challenges in isolation, considering only one aspect at a time, such as handling ambiguity or robustness to noise and misinformation. We instead consider multiple factors simultaneously, proposing (i) RAMDocs (Retrieval with Ambiguity and Misinformation in Documents), a new dataset that simulates complex and realistic scenarios for conflicting evidence for a user query, including ambiguity, misinformation, and noise; and (ii) MADAM-RAG, a multi-agent approach in which LLM agents debate over the merits of an answer over multiple rounds, allowing an aggregator to collate responses corresponding to disambiguated entities while discarding misinformation and noise, thereby handling diverse sources of conflict jointly. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MADAM-RAG using both closed and open-source models on AmbigDocs – which requires presenting all valid answers for ambiguous queries – improving over strong RAG baselines by up to 11.40%, and on FaithEval – which requires suppressing misinformation – where we improve by up to 15.80% (absolute) with Llama3.3-70B-Instruct. Furthermore, we find that our proposed RAMDocs dataset poses a challenge for existing RAG baselines (the most performant Llama3.3-70B-Instruct only yields up to a 32.60 exact match score), as it requires handling conflicting information due to ambiguity, noise, and misinformation simultaneously. While MADAM-RAG begins to address these conflicting factors, our analysis indicates that a substantial gap remains, especially when increasing the level of imbalance in supporting evidence and misinformation",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Scaling laws predict that the performance of large language models improves with increasing model size and data size. In practice, pre-training has been relying on massive web crawls, using almost all data sources publicly available on the internet so far. However, this pool of natural data does not grow at the same rate as the compute supply. Furthermore, the availability of high-quality texts is even more limited: data filtering pipelines often remove up to 99% of the initial web scrapes to achieve state-of-the-art. To address the \"data wall\" of pre-training scaling, our work explores ways to transform and recycle data discarded in existing filtering processes. We propose REWIRE, REcycling the Web with guIded REwrite, a method to enrich low-quality documents so that they could become useful for training. This in turn allows us to increase the representation of synthetic data in the final pre-training set. Experiments at 1B, 3B and 7B scales of the DCLM benchmark show that mixing high-quality raw texts and our rewritten texts lead to 1.0, 1.3 and 2.5 percentage points improvement respectively across 22 diverse tasks, compared to training on only filtered web data. Training on the raw-synthetic data mix is also more effective than having access to 2x web data. Through further analysis, we demonstrate that about 82% of the mixed in texts come from transforming lower-quality documents that would otherwise be discarded. REWIRE also outperforms related approaches of generating synthetic data, including Wikipedia-style paraphrasing, question-answer synthesizing and knowledge extraction. These results suggest that recycling web texts holds the potential for being a simple and effective approach for scaling pre-training data.

    "abstract": "Impression formation plays a crucial role in shaping social life, influencing behaviors, attitudes, and interactions across different contexts. Affect Control Theory (ACT) offers a well-established, empirically grounded model of how people form impressions and evaluate social interactions. We investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit patterns of impression formation that align with ACT's predictions. As a case study, we focus on gendered social interactions—how an LLM perceives gender in a prototypic social interaction. We compare several preference-tuned derivatives of LLaMA-3 model family (including LLaMA-Instruct, Tulu-3, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill) with GPT-4 as a baseline, examining the extent to which alignment or preference tuning influences the models' tendencies in forming gender impressions. We find that LLMs form impressions quite differently than ACT. Notably, LLMs are insensitive to situational context: the impression of an interaction is overwhelmingly driven by the identity of the actor, regardless of the actor's actions or the recipient of those actions. This stands in contrast to ACT's interaction-based reasoning, which accounts for the interplay of identities, behaviors, and recipients. We further find that preference tuning often amplifies or skews certain impressions in unpredicted ways. Our corpus offers a benchmark for assessing LLMs' social intelligence; we encourage further research using ACT-like frameworks to explore how tuning influences impression formation across diverse social dimensions",

We introduce Breakpoint, a benchmarking methodology that automatically generates code-repair tasks by adversarially corrupting functions within real-world software repositories. Breakpoint systematically controls task difficulty along two different dimensions: local reasoning (characterized by code complexity metrics such as cyclomatic complexity) and system-level reasoning (characterized by call-graph centrality and the number of simultaneously corrupted interdependent functions). In experiments across more than 900 generated tasks we demonstrate that Breakpoint's methodology can scale to arbitrary difficulty, with state-of-the-art models' success rates ranging from 55\\% on the easiest tasks down to 0\\% on the hardest. We analyze how static parameters control task difficulty, characterize how improvements in models and inference-time budgets affect local versus system-level reasoning, and evaluate the strategies models use to gather information and iterate on solutions, demonstrating Breakpoint's effectiveness as a comprehensive evaluation suite for understanding agent behavior and capabilities",

However, little is known about how these restrictions (and the resultant filtering of pretraining datasets) affect the capabilities of models trained using these corpora. In this work, we conceptualize this effect as the $\\textit{data compliance gap} (DCG)$, which quantifies the performance difference between models trained on datasets that comply with web crawling opt-outs, and those that do not. We measure the data compliance gap in two settings: pretraining models from scratch and continual pretraining from existing compliant models (simulating a setting where copyrighted data could be integrated later in pertaining). Our experiments with 1.5B models show that, as of January 2025, compliance with web data opt-outs does not degrade general knowledge acquisition (close to 0\\% DCG). However, in specialized domains such as biomedical research, excluding major publishers leads to performance declines. These findings suggest that while general-purpose LLMs can be trained to perform equally well using fully open data, performance in specialized domains may benefit from access to high-quality copyrighted sources later in training.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in recurrent architectures, such as Mamba and RWKV, have showcased strong language capabilities. Unlike transformer-based models, these architectures encode all contextual information into a fixed-size state, leading to great inference efficiency. However, this approach can cause information interference, where different token data conflicts, resulting in performance degradation and incoherent outputs beyond a certain context length. To prevent this, most RNNs incorporate mechanisms designed to \"forget\" earlier tokens. In this paper, we reveal that Mamba-based models struggle to effectively forget earlier tokens even with built-in forgetting mechanisms. We demonstrate that this issue stems from training on contexts that are too short for the state size, enabling the model to perform well without needing to learn how to forget. Then, we show that the minimum training length required for the model to learn forgetting scales linearly with the state size, and the maximum context length for accurate retrieval of a 5-digit passkey scales exponentially with the state size, indicating that the model retains some information beyond the point where forgetting begins. These findings highlight a critical limitation in current RNN architectures and provide valuable insights for improving long-context modeling. Our work suggests that future RNN designs must account for the interplay between state size, training length, and forgetting mechanisms to achieve robust performance in long-context tasks",

    "abstract": "Language model (LM) benchmarking faces several challenges: comprehensive evaluations are costly, benchmarks often fail to measure the intended capabilities, and evaluation quality can degrade due to labeling errors and benchmark saturation. Although various strategies have been proposed to mitigate these issues, they tend to address individual aspects in isolation, neglecting broader questions about overall evaluation quality. Here, we introduce Fluid Benchmarking, a new evaluation approach that advances LM benchmarking across multiple dimensions. Inspired by psychometrics, Fluid Benchmarking is based on the insight that the relative value of benchmark items depends on an LM's capability level, suggesting that evaluation should adapt to each LM. Methodologically, Fluid Benchmarking estimates an item response model based on existing LM evaluation results and uses the inferred quantities to select evaluation items dynamically, similar to computerized adaptive testing in education. In our experiments, we compare Fluid Benchmarking against the common practice of random item sampling as well as more sophisticated baselines, including alternative methods grounded in item response theory. We examine four dimensions&mdash;efficiency, validity, variance, and saturation&mdash;and find that Fluid Benchmarking achieves superior performance in all of them (e.g., higher validity and less variance on MMLU with fifty times fewer items). Our analysis shows that the two components of Fluid Benchmarking have distinct effects: item response theory, used to map performance into a latent ability space, increases validity, while dynamic item selection reduces variance. Overall, our results suggest that LM benchmarking can be substantially improved by moving beyond static evaluation",

    "title": "Data-Centric Human Preference with Rationales for Direct Preference Alignment",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Aligning language models with human preferences through reinforcement learning from human feedback is crucial for their safe and effective deployment. The human preference is typically represented through comparison where one response is chosen over another for a given prompt. However, standard preference datasets often lack explicit information on why a particular choice was made, presenting an ambiguity that can hinder efficient learning and robust alignment, especially given the high cost of acquiring extensive human annotations. While many studies focus on algorithmic improvements, this work adopts a data-centric perspective, exploring how to enhance learning from existing preference data. We propose augmenting standard preference pairs with rationales that explain the reasoning behind the human preference. Specifically, we introduce a simple and principled framework that leverages machine-generated rationales to enrich preference data for preference optimization algorithms. Our comprehensive analysis demonstrates that incorporating rationales improves learning efficiency. Extensive experiments reveal some advantages: rationale-augmented learning accelerates convergence and can achieve higher final model performance. Furthermore, this approach is versatile and compatible with various direct preference optimization algorithms. Our findings showcase the potential of thoughtful data design in preference learning, demonstrating that enriching existing datasets with explanatory rationales can help unlock improvements in model alignment and annotation efficiency",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Existing LLM agent systems typically select actions from a fixed and predefined set at every step. While effective in closed, narrowly scoped environments, this approach presents two major challenges for real-world, open-ended scenarios: (1) it significantly restricts the planning and acting capabilities of LLM agents, and (2) it requires substantial human effort to enumerate and implement all possible actions, which is impractical in complex environments with a vast number of potential actions. To address these limitations, we propose an LLM agent framework that enables the dynamic creation and composition of actions in an online manner. In this framework, the agent interacts with its environment by generating and executing programs written in a general-purpose programming language. Furthermore, generated actions are accumulated over time for future reuse. Our extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that this framework significantly improves flexibility and outperforms prior methods that rely on a fixed action set. Notably, it enables LLM agents to adapt and recover in scenarios where predefined actions are insufficient or fail due to unforeseen edge cases",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Language model developers typically filter out high-risk content—such as toxic or copyrighted text—from their pre-training data to prevent models from generating similar outputs. However, removing such data altogether limits models' ability to recognize and appropriately respond to harmful or sensitive content. In this paper, we introduce Selective Loss to Understand but Not Generate (SLUNG), a pre-training paradigm through which models learn to understand high-risk data without learning to generate it. Instead of uniformly applying the next-token prediction loss, SLUNG selectively avoids incentivizing the generation of high-risk tokens while ensuring they remain within the model's context window. As the model learns to predict low-risk tokens that follow high-risk ones, it is forced to understand the high-risk content. Through our experiments, we show that SLUNG consistently improves models' understanding of high-risk data (e.g., ability to recognize toxic content) without increasing its generation (e.g., toxicity of model responses). Overall, our SLUNG paradigm enables models to benefit from high-risk text that would otherwise be filtered out",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "LLM-based agents have made significant advancements in interactive environments, such as mobile operations and web browsing, and other domains beyond computer using. Current multi-agent systems universally excel in performance, compared to single agents, but struggle with generalization across environments due to predefined roles and inadequate strategies for generalizing language agents. The challenge of achieving both strong performance and good generalization has hindered the progress of multi-agent systems for interactive environments. To address these issues, we propose **CollabUIAgents**, a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework with a novel multi-agent credit re-assignment (CR) strategy, assigning process rewards with LLMs rather than environment-specific rewards and learning with synthesized preference data, in order to foster generalizable, collaborative behaviors among the role-free agents' policies. Empirical results show that our framework improves both performance and cross-environment generalizability of multi-agent systems. Moreover, our 7B-parameter system achieves results on par with or exceed strong closed-source models, and the LLM that guides the CR. We also provide insights in using granular CR rewards effectively for environment generalization, and accommodating trained LLMs in multi-agent systems.

    "abstract": "In this study, we investigate whether attention-based information flow inside large language models (LLMs) is aggregated through noticeable patterns for long context processing. Our observations reveal that LLMs aggregate information through Pyramidal Information Funneling where attention is scattering widely in lower layers, progressively consolidating within specific contexts, and ultimately focusing on critical tokens (a.k.a massive activation or attention sink) in higher layers. Motivated by these insights, we developed PyramidKV, a novel and effective KV cache compression method. This approach dynamically adjusts the KV cache size across different layers, allocating more cache in lower layers and less in higher ones, diverging from traditional methods that maintain a uniform KV cache size. Our experimental evaluations, utilizing the LongBench benchmark, show that PyramidKV matches the performance of models with a full KV cache while retaining only 12% of the KV cache, thus significantly reducing memory usage. In scenarios emphasizing memory efficiency, where only 0.7% of the KV cache is maintained, PyramidKV surpasses other KV cache compression techniques, achieving up to a 20.5 absolute accuracy improvement on TREC dataset. In the Needle-in-a-Haystack experiment, PyramidKV outperforms competing methods in maintaining long-context comprehension in LLMs; notably, retaining just 128 KV cache entries enables the LLAMA-3-70B model to achieve 100% Acc. performance, matching that of a full KV cache",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Most natural language reasoning tasks in the research community assume consistent input knowledge. Nevertheless, real-world scenarios often involve inconsistent information, which might lead to divergent conclusions and are typically associated with varying levels of uncertainty. This raises a key research question: can large language models (LLMs) effectively handle uncertainty in their reasoning process to maximize knowledge consistency? In this paper, we propose a framework for evaluating reasoning over inconsistent knowledge. Our approach models uncertainty via weights of logical rules, leveraging Markov logic networks (MLN), which integrate probabilistic reasoning with first-order logic. This enables us to quantify inconsistencies in knowledge bases, and hence rigorously evaluate LLM reasoning. We introduce two tasks using this framework: 1) QA, which involves answering questions by integrating inconsistent knowledge; and 2) knowledge rectification, where we aim to rectify language models' acquired knowledge to improve consistency. We curate a dataset of 3,000 MLN-formatted knowledge bases to implement these tasks. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on these tasks and highlight their limitations in uncertainty-aware reasoning over inconsistent logical knowledge",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning has become a crucial step in post-training language models for advanced mathematical reasoning and coding. Following the success of frontier reasoning models, recent work has demonstrated that RL fine-tuning consistently improves performance, even in smaller-scale models; however, the underlying mechanisms driving these improvements are not well-understood. Understanding the effects of RL fine-tuning requires disentangling its interaction with pretraining data composition, hyperparameters, and model scale, but such problems are exacerbated by the lack of transparency regarding the training data used in many existing models. In this work, we present a systematic end-to-end study of RL fine-tuning for mathematical reasoning by training models entirely from scratch on different mixtures of fully open datasets. We investigate the effects of various RL fine-tuning algorithms (PPO, GRPO, and Expert Iteration) across models of different scales. Our study reveals that RL algorithms consistently converge towards a dominant output distribution, amplifying patterns in the pretraining data. We also find that models of different scales trained on the same data mixture will converge to distinct output distributions, suggesting that there are scale-dependent biases in model generalization. Moreover, we find that RL post-training on simpler questions can lead to performance gains on harder ones, indicating that certain reasoning capabilities generalize across tasks.

For instance, on a prompt like \"Help me draft an academic talk on coffee intake vs research productivity\", a model response may be evaluated for criteria like accuracy and coherence. However, high-quality responses should do more than just satisfy basic task requirements. An effective response to this query should include quintessential features of an academic talk, such as a compelling opening, clear research questions, and a takeaway. To help identify these implicit criteria, we introduce EvalAgent, a novel framework designed to automatically uncover nuanced and task-specific criteria. EvalAgent first mines expert-authored online guidance. It then uses this evidence to propose diverse, long-tail evaluation criteria that are grounded in reliable external sources. Our experiments demonstrate that the grounded criteria produced by EvalAgent are often implicit (not directly stated in the user's prompt), yet specific (high degree of lexical precision). Further, EvalAgent criteria are often not satisfied by initial responses but they are actionable, such that responses can be refined to satisfy them. Finally, we show that combining LLM-generated and EvalAgent criteria uncovers more human-valued criteria than using LLMs alone",

By considering entire repositories rather than isolated functions, CRUST-Bench captures the challenges of translating complex projects with dependencies across multiple files.

In our paper, we scale up circuit extraction to a real-world language modeling task: context-augmented language modeling for question-answering (QA) tasks and understand the potential benefits of circuits towards downstream applications such as data attribution. We extract circuits as a function of internal model components (e.g., attention heads, attention layers, MLPs) using causal mediation analysis techniques. Leveraging the extracted circuits, we first understand the interplay between the language model's usage of parametric memory and retrieved context towards a better mechanistic understanding of context-augmented language models. We then identify a small set of attention heads in our circuit which performs reliable data attribution by default, thereby obtaining attribution for free in just the model's forward pass! Using this insight, we then introduce AttnAttrib, a fast data attribution algorithm. Through a range of empirical experiments across different extractive QA benchmarks, we show that performing data attribution with AttnAttrib obtains state-of-the-art attribution results across different language models. Finally, we show the possibility to steer the language model towards answering from the context, instead of the parametric memory by (i) using the attribution from our extracted attention head as an additional signal during the forward pass and (ii) scaling the output of a small set of attention heads. Beyond mechanistic understanding, our paper provides tangible applications of mechanistic circuits in the form of reliable data attribution and model steering",

We propose an active exploration algorithm to efficiently select the data and provide theoretical proof that it has a polynomial worst-case regret bound. We extend the setting and methodology for practical use in preference alignment of large language models. We provide two extensions, an online and an offline approach.

One of the approaches for improving math reasoning is self-correction, which designs self-improving loops to let the model correct its own mistakes. However, existing self-correction approaches treat corrections as standalone post-generation refinements, relying on extra prompt and system designs to elicit self-corrections, instead of performing real-time, spontaneous self-corrections in a single pass. To address this, we propose **SPOC**, a *spontaneous self-correction* approach that enables LLMs to generate interleaved solutions and verifications in a *single inference pass*, with generation dynamically terminated based on verification outcomes, thereby effectively scaling inference time compute. SPOC considers a multi-agent perspective by assigning dual roles -- solution proposer and verifier -- to the same model. We adopt a simple yet effective approach to generate synthetic data for fine-tuning, enabling the model to develop capabilities for self-verification and multi-agent collaboration. We further improve its solution proposal and verification accuracy through online reinforcement learning.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The syntactic structures of sentences can be readily read-out from the activations of large language models (LLMs). However, the ``structural probes'' that have been developed to reveal this phenomenon are typically evaluated on an indiscriminate set of sentences. Consequently, it remains unclear whether structural and/or statistical factors systematically affect these syntactic representations. To address this issue, we conduct an in-depth analysis of structural probes on three controlled benchmarks. Our results are fourfold. First, structural probes are biased by a superficial property: the closer two words are in a sentence, the more likely structural probes will consider them as syntactically linked. Second, structural probes are challenged by linguistic properties: they poorly represent deep syntactic structures, and get interfered by interacting nouns or ungrammatical verb forms.

    "abstract": "Humans build viewpoint-independent cognitive maps through navigation, enabling intuitive reasoning about object permanence and spatial relations. We argue that multimodal large language models (MLLMs), despite extensive video training, lack this fundamental spatial reasoning capability, a critical limitation for embodied applications. To demonstrate these limitations and drive research, we introduce REM: Reasoning over Embodied Multi-Frame Trajectories, a benchmark using controllable 3D environments for long-horizon embodied spatial reasoning. REM systematically evaluates key aspects like object permanence/distinction, spatial relationships, and numerical tracking across dynamic embodied viewpoints. Our evaluation shows that the best-performing current models exhibit promising overall performance, but become increasingly unreliable at even moderate complexity levels easily handled by humans. These findings highlight challenges MLLMs face in developing robust spatial representations from sequential visual input. Consequently, REM provides targeted metrics and diagnostics to foster improved spatial understanding in future models",

    "title": "GenerationPrograms: Fine-grained Attribution with Executable Programs",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recent large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive performance in text generation but often fail to accurately attribute their outputs, undermining trust and verifiability. Moreover, existing attribution methods do not explain how and why models leverage the provided source documents to generate their final responses, limiting interpretability. Furthermore, current attributions fail to provide a reason as to how and why the model uses the context to arrive at the final output. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a modular generation framework, GenerationPrograms, inspired by recent advancements in executable ``code agent'' architectures. Unlike conventional generation methods that simultaneously generate outputs and attributions or rely on post-hoc attribution, GenerationPrograms decomposes the process into two distinct stages: first, creating an executable program plan composed of modular text operations (such as paraphrasing, compression, and fusion) explicitly tailored to the query, and second, executing these operations following the program's specified instructions to produce the final response. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that GenerationPrograms significantly improves attribution quality at both document-level and sentence-level granularity across two long-form question-answering tasks. We further demonstrate that GenerationPrograms can effectively function as a post-hoc attribution method, outperforming traditional techniques in recovering accurate attributions. In addition, the interpretable programs generated by GenerationPrograms enable localized refinement through modular-level improvements that further enhance overall attribution quality",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "​​Post-training quantization reduces a model's memory footprint by mapping full precision weights into low bit weights without costly retraining, but can degrade its downstream performance especially in low 2- to 3-bit settings. Existing methods mitigate these drops by keeping some important weights in higher precision; we develop a new mixed-precision approach, Task-Circuit Quantization (TCQ), that directly conditions the quantization process on specific circuits -- which we define as sets of weights associated with downstream task performance. TCQ draws parallels to automated circuit discovery, introducing a novel method to identify a small number of key weights that are particularly important to task performance; these weights are kept as 16-bit weights, while others are quantized, maintaining performance while only adding a marginal memory cost. Specifically, TCQ contrasts unquantized model weights with a uniformly-quantized model to estimate the expected change in weights due to quantization and uses gradient information to predict the resulting impact on task performance, allowing us to preserve task-specific weights. We compare TCQ-based quantization to existing mixed-precision quantization methods and GPTQ when conditioning both on general-purpose and task-specific data. Across QA, math reasoning, text-to-SQL tasks and for both Llama-3 and Qwen2.5 models, we find that TCQ outperforms baselines like SPQR and Slim-LLM using the same calibration data and a lower weight budget, achieving major improvements in the 2- and 3-bit regime. With only 3.1 bits we are able to recover 97% of the model's unquantized 16-bit MMLU performance, obtaining a 5.25% absolute improvement over SPQR. Furthermore, we observe consistently large gains over existing methods in the 2-bit regime, with an average gain of 14.74% over the strongest baseline, Slim-LLM.

    "abstract": "Machine unlearning is concerned with the task of removing knowledge learned from particular data points from a trained model. In the context of large language models (LLMs), unlearning has recently received increased attention, particularly for removing knowledge about named entities from models for privacy purposes. While various approaches have been proposed to address the unlearning problem, most existing approaches treat all data points to be unlearned equally, i.e., unlearning that Montreal is a city in Canada is treated exactly the same as unlearning the phone number of the first author of this paper. In this work, we show that this all data is equal assumption does not hold for LLM unlearning. We study how the success of unlearning depends on the frequency of the knowledge we want to unlearn in the pre-training data of a model and find that frequency strongly affects unlearning, i.e., more frequent knowledge is harder to unlearn. Additionally, we uncover a misalignment between probability- and generation-based evaluations of unlearning and show that this problem worsens as models become larger. Overall, our experiments highlight the need for better evaluation practices and novel methods for LLM unlearning that take the training data of models into account",

In this work, we introduce a new pre-training dataset curation pipeline based on FineWeb that can be automatically adapted to support any language.

We additionally introduce a straightforward and principled approach to rebalance datasets that takes into consideration both duplication count and quality, providing an additional performance uplift.

We demonstrate that sophisticated mathematical reasoning can emerge with only a few examples.

Furthermore, LIMO exhibits strong out-of-distribution generalization, achieving a 45.8% absolute improvement across diverse benchmarks, outperforming models trained on 100× more data. Synthesizing these findings, we propose the Less-Is-More Reasoning Hypothesis (LIMO Hypothesis): In foundation models where domain knowledge has been comprehensively encoded during pre-training, sophisticated reasoning can emerge through minimal but strategically designed demonstrations of cognitive processes. This hypothesis suggests that the threshold for eliciting complex reasoning is not dictated by task complexity but rather by two key factors: (1) the completeness of the model's pre-trained knowledge base and (2) the effectiveness of post-training examples in serving as \"cognitive templates\" that guide reasoning",

This dataset consists of paired concept-caption-image triplets, where concepts visually resemble each other but are culturally different. Then, we fine-tune CLIP on CulTwin to develop CultureCLIP, which aligns cultural concepts with contextually enhanced captions and synthetic images through tailored contrastive learning.

However, their close integration with personal devices raises significant security concerns, with many threats, including backdoor attacks, remaining largely unexplored. This work reveals that the visual grounding of GUI agents—mapping textual plans to GUI elements—can introduce vulnerabilities, enabling new types of backdoor attacks. With backdoor attack targeting visual grounding, the agent's behavior can be compromised even when given correct task-solving plans. To validate this vulnerability, we propose \\textit{VisualTrap}, a method that can hijack the grounding by misleading the agent to locate textual plans to trigger locations instead of the intended targets. VisualTrap uses the common method of injecting poisoned data for attacks, and does so during the pre-training of visual grounding \\textcolor{black}{to ensure practical feasibility of attacking.} Empirical results show that VisualTrap can effectively hijack visual grounding with as little as 5\\% poisoned data and highly stealthy visual triggers (invisible to the human eye); and the attack can be generalized to downstream tasks, even after clean fine-tuning. Moreover, the injected trigger can remain effective across different GUI environments, \\textit{e.g.,} being trained on mobile/web and generalizing to desktop environments.

    "abstract": "The ability to acquire latent semantics is one of the key properties that determines the performance of language models. One convenient approach to invoke this ability is to prepend metadata (e.g. URLs, domains, and styles) at the beginning of texts in the pre-training data, making it easier for the model to access latent semantics before observing the entire text. Previous studies have reported that this technique actually improves the performance of trained models in downstream tasks; however, this improvement has been observed only in specific downstream tasks, without consistent enhancement in average next-token prediction loss. To understand this phenomenon, we closely investigate how prepending metadata during pre-training affects model performance by examining its behavior using artificial data. Interestingly, we found that this approach produces both positive and negative effects on the downstream tasks. We demonstrate that the effectiveness of the approach depends on whether latent semantics can be inferred from the downstream task's prompt. Specifically, through investigations using data generated by probabilistic context-free grammars, we show that training with metadata helps improve model's performance when the given context is long enough to infer the latent semantics. In contrast, the technique negatively impacts performance when the context lacks the necessary information to make an accurate posterior inference",

This paper investigates a novel attack scenario where the attackers aim to mislead the retrieval system into retrieving the attacker-specified contents. Those contents, injected into the retrieval corpus by attackers, can include harmful text like hate speech or spam. Unlike prior methods that rely on model weights and generate conspicuous, unnatural outputs, we propose a covert backdoor attack triggered by grammar errors. Our approach ensures that the attacked models can function normally for standard queries while covertly triggering the retrieval of the attacker's contents in response to minor linguistic mistakes. Specifically, dense retrievers are trained with contrastive loss and hard negative sampling. Surprisingly, our findings demonstrate that contrastive loss is notably sensitive to grammatical errors, and hard negative sampling can exacerbate susceptibility to backdoor attacks. Our proposed method achieves a high attack success rate with a minimal corpus poisoning rate of only 0.048\\%, while preserving normal retrieval performance. This indicates that the method has negligible impact on user experience for error-free queries. Furthermore, evaluations across three real-world defense strategies reveal that the malicious passages embedded within the corpus remain highly resistant to detection and filtering, underscoring the robustness and subtlety of the proposed attack",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited outstanding performance in engaging with humans and addressing complex questions by leveraging their vast implicit knowledge and robust reasoning capabilities. However, such models are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, leading to the generation of harmful responses. Despite recent research on single-turn jailbreak strategies to facilitate the development of defence mechanisms, the challenge of revealing vulnerabilities under multi-turn setting remains relatively under-explored. In this work, we propose Jigsaw Puzzles (JSP), a straightforward yet effective multi-turn jailbreak strategy against the advanced LLMs. JSP splits questions into harmless fractions as the input of each turn, and requests LLMs to reconstruct and respond to questions under multi-turn interaction. Our results demonstrate the proposed JSP jailbreak bypasses original safeguards against explicitly harmful content, achieving an average attack success rate of 93.76% on 189 harmful queries across 5 advanced LLMs (Gemini-1.5-Pro, Llama-3.1-70B, GPT-4, GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini), and exhibits consistent performance on jailbreaking benchmarks. Moreover, JSP exhibits strong resistance to input-side and output-side defence tactics. Warning: this paper contains offensive examples",

    "title": "Probing then Editing Response Personality of Large Language Models",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising capabilities to generate responses that simulate consistent personality traits. Despite the major attempts to analyze personality expression through output-based evaluations, little is known about how such traits are internally encoded within LLM parameters. In this paper, we introduce a layer-wise probing framework to systematically investigate the layer-wise capability of LLMs in simulating personality for responding. We conduct probing experiments on 11 open-source LLMs over the PersonalityEdit benchmark and find that LLMs predominantly simulate personality for responding in their middle and upper layers, with instruction-tuned models demonstrating a slightly clearer separation of personality traits. Furthermore, by interpreting the trained probing hyperplane as a layer-wise boundary for each personality category, we propose a layer-wise perturbation method to edit the personality expressed by LLMs during inference. Our results show that even when the prompt explicitly specifies a particular personality, our method can still successfully alter the response personality of LLMs. Interestingly, the difficulty of converting between certain personality traits varies substantially, which aligns with the representational distances in our probing experiments. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive MMLU benchmark evaluation and time overhead analysis, demonstrating that our proposed personality editing method incurs only minimal degradation in general capabilities while maintaining low training costs and acceptable inference latency.

We formulate LLM control-plane integrity as a distinct problem in AI safety, where the adversary's goal is to control the order or selection of LLMs employed to process users' queries. We then demonstrate that it is possible to generate query-independent ``gadget'' strings that, when added to any query, cause routers to send this query to a strong LLM. In contrast to conventional adversarial inputs, gadgets change the control flow but preserve or even improve the quality of outputs generated in response to adversarially modified queries.

We introduce Collab-RAG, a collaborative training framework that leverages mutual enhancement between a white-box small language model (SLM) and a black-box large language model (LLM) for RAG. Specifically, the SLM decomposes complex queries into simpler sub-questions, thus enhancing the accuracy of the retrieval and facilitating more effective reasoning by the black-box LLM. Concurrently, the black-box LLM provides feedback signals to improve the SLM's decomposition capability. We observe that Collab-RAG relies solely on supervision from an affordable black-box LLM without additional distillation from frontier LLMs, yet demonstrates strong generalization across multiple black-box LLMs. Experimental evaluations across five multi-hop QA datasets demonstrate that Collab-RAG substantially outperforms existing black-box-only and SLM fine-tuning baselines by 1.8%-14.2% on average. In particular, our fine-tuned 3B SLM surpasses a frozen 32B LLM in question decomposition, highlighting the efficiency of Collab-RAG in improving reasoning and retrieval for complex questions.

    "abstract": "The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture has emerged as a powerful paradigm for scaling large language models (LLMs) while maintaining inference efficiency. However, their substantial memory requirements make them prohibitively expensive to fine-tune or deploy in resource-constrained environments. To address this challenge, we propose \\textit{SlimMoE}, a multi-stage compression framework that transforms large MoE models into significantly smaller and more efficient variants without the cost of training from scratch. Our method systematically reduces parameter counts by slimming experts and transferring knowledge through intermediate stages, effectively mitigating the performance degradation typical of one-shot pruning. Using SlimMoE, we compress Phi-3.5-MoE (41.9B total / 6.6B activated parameters) into two smaller models: Phi-mini-MoE (7.6B total / 2.4B activated) and Phi-tiny-MoE (3.8B total / 1.1B activated), using only 400B tokens -- less than 10\\% of the original training data. These models can be fine-tuned on a single GPU (A100 for Phi-mini-MoE, A6000 for Phi-tiny-MoE), making them well suited for academic and resource-limited settings. Our experiments show that the compressed models outperform others of similar size and remain competitive with larger models. For example, Phi-mini-MoE matches or exceeds the performance of Phi-3-mini while using only two-thirds of the activated parameters and achieves comparable MMLU scores to LLaMA 3.1 8B with significantly lower latency. These results highlight that structured pruning combined with multi-stage distillation is an effective strategy for building high-quality, compact MoE models, enabling broader adoption of MoE architectures across diverse computational environments.

Our error analysis reveals two main drivers: textual perception failures from tokenization in domain notation and visual perception failures that induce hallucinations.

While plenty of works have studied post-training algorithms and evaluated post-training models by their outputs, it remains understudied how post-training reshapes LLMs internally. In this paper, we compare base and post-trained LLMs mechanistically from four perspectives to better understand post-training effects. Our findings across model families and datasets reveal that: (1) Post-training does not change the factual knowledge storage locations, and it adapts knowledge representations from the base model while developing new knowledge representations; (2) Both truthfulness and refusal can be represented by vectors in the hidden representation space. The truthfulness direction is highly similar between the base and post-trained model, and it is effectively transferable for interventions; (3) The refusal direction is different between the base and post-trained models, and it shows limited forward transferability; (4) Differences in confidence between the base and post-trained models cannot be attributed to entropy neurons. Our study provides insights into the fundamental mechanisms preserved and altered during post-training, facilitates downstream tasks like model steering, and could potentially benefit future research in interpretability and LLM post-training.

While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive linguistic capabilities, it remains unclear whether they exhibit human-like pattern recognition during in-context learning at inferencing level. We adapted three classic artificial language learning experiments spanning morphology (regular/irregular plural marking), morphosyntax (context-dependent determiners), and syntax (finite state grammar) to systematically evaluate implicit learning at inferencing level in two state-of-the-art Openai models: gpt-4o (optimized for general language tasks) and o3-mini (specifically fine-tuned for explicit reasoning). This comparison allowed us to examine whether models trained to articulate reasoning processes differ in their ability to extract implicit patterns. Our findings reveal a complex picture: o3-mini demonstrated human-like probabilistic learning in morphological regularization, while gpt-4o showed stronger performance in finite state grammar acquisition. Neither model successfully replicated human patterns in the morphosyntax task. Post-experiment probes revealed correlations between models' performance and their ability to articulate underlying patterns, suggesting alignment between implicit recognition and explicit awareness. These results indicate that different LLMs implement distinct in-context processing mechanisms, with architecture and training objectives influencing pattern extraction across linguistic domains.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved their reasoning abilities, particularly through techniques involving search and backtracking. Backtracking naturally scales test-time compute by enabling sequential, linearized exploration via long chain-of-thought (CoT) generation. However, this is not the only strategy for scaling test time-compute: parallel sampling with best-of-n selection provides an alternative that generates diverse solutions simultaneously. Despite the growing adoption of sequential search, its advantages over parallel sampling—especially under a fixed compute budget—remain poorly understood. In this paper, we systematically compare these two approaches on two challenging reasoning tasks: CountDown and Sudoku. Surprisingly, we find that sequential search underperforms parallel sampling on CountDown but outperforms it on Sudoku, suggesting that backtracking is not universally beneficial. We identify two factors that can cause backtracking to degrade performance: (1) training on fixed search traces can lock models intro suboptimal strategies, and (2) explicit CoT supervision can discourage ‘implicit‘ (non verbalized) reasoning. Extending our analysis to reinforcement learning (RL), we show that models with backtracking capabilities benefit significantly from RL fine-tuning, while models without backtracking see limited, mixed gains. Together, these findings challenge the assumption that backtracking universally enhances LLM reasoning, instead revealing a complex interaction between task structure, training data, model scale, and learning paradigm",

    "abstract": "Steering vectors (SVs) have emerged as a promising approach for interpreting and controlling LLMs, but current methods typically require large contrastive datasets that are often impractical to construct and may capture spurious correlations. We propose directly optimizing SVs through gradient descent on a single training example, and systematically investigate how these SVs generalize. We consider several SV optimization techniques and find that the resulting SVs effectively mediate safety-relevant behaviors in multiple models. Indeed, in experiments on an alignment-faking model, we are able to optimize one-shot SVs that induce harmful behavior on benign examples and whose negations suppress harmful behavior on malign examples. And in experiments on refusal suppression, we demonstrate that one-shot optimized SVs can transfer across inputs, yielding a Harmbench attack success rate of 96.9%. Furthermore, we extend work on \"emergent misalignment\" and show that SVs optimized to induce a model to write vulnerable code cause the model to respond harmfully on unrelated open-ended prompts. Finally, we use one-shot SV optimization to investigate how an instruction-tuned LLM recovers from outputting false information, and find that this ability is independent of the model's explicit verbalization that the information was false. Overall, our findings suggest that optimizing SVs on a single example can mediate a wide array of misaligned behaviors in LLMs. Code can be found at https://github.com/jacobdunefsky/one-shot-steering-repro and https://github.com/jacobdunefsky/one-shot-steering-misalignment",

Recent advances, such as direct preference optimization (DPO), have simplified the preference learning step. However, collecting preference data remains a challenging and costly process, often requiring expert annotation. This cost can be mitigated by carefully selecting the data points presented for annotation. In this work, we propose an active learning approach to efficiently select prompt and preference pairs using a risk assessment strategy based on the Sharpe Ratio. To address the challenge of unknown preferences prior to annotation, our method evaluates the gradients of all potential preference annotations to assess their impact on model updates. These gradient-based evaluations enable risk assessment of data points regardless of the annotation outcome. By leveraging the DPO loss derivations, we derive a \\emph{closed-form expression} for computing these Sharpe ratios on a per-tuple basis, ensuring our approach remains both \\emph{tractable} and \\emph{computationally efficient}. We also introduce two variants of our method, each making different assumptions about prior information.

    "abstract": "Large language models face significant computational and memory challenges when processing long contexts. During inference, efficient management of the key-value (KV) cache, which stores intermediate activations for autoregressive generation, is critical to reducing memory overhead and improving computational efficiency. Traditional token-level efficient KV caching methods overlook semantic information, treating tokens independently without considering their semantic relationships. Meanwhile, existing semantic-preserving KV cache management approaches often suffer from substantial memory usage and high time-to-first-token. To address these limitations, we propose SentenceKV, a novel sentence-level semantic KV caching approach designed to enhance inference efficiency while preserving semantic coherence. During prefilling, SentenceKV groups tokens based on sentence-level semantic similarity, compressing sentence representations into concise semantic vectors stored directly on the GPU, while individual KV pairs are offloaded to CPU. During decoding, SentenceKV generates tokens by selectively retrieving semantically relevant sentence-level KV entries, leveraging the semantic similarity between the prefilling-stage semantic vectors and decoding-stage queries. This ensures efficient and contextually accurate predictions, minimizing the loading of redundant or irrelevant data into GPU memory and significantly reducing memory overhead while maintaining stable inference latency, even for extremely long contexts.

    "title": "Defending LLM Watermarking Against Spoofing Attacks with Contrastive Representation Learning",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Watermarking has emerged as a promising technique for detecting texts generated by LLMs. Current research has primarily focused on three design criteria -- high quality of the watermarked text, high detectability, and robustness against removal attack. However, the security against spoofing attacks remains relatively understudied. For example, a piggyback attack can maliciously alter the meaning of watermarked text by transforming it into hate speech, while preserving the original watermark, thereby damaging the reputation of the LLM provider. We identify two core challenges that make defending against spoofing difficult: (1) the need for watermarks to be both sensitive to semantic-distorting changes and insensitive to semantic-preserving edits, and (2) the contradiction between the need to detect global semantic shifts and the local, auto-regressive nature of most watermarking schemes. To address these challenges, we propose a semantic-aware watermarking algorithm that post-hoc embeds watermarks into a given target text while preserving its original meaning. Our method introduces a semantic mapping model, which guides the generation of a green-red token list, contrastively trained to be sensitive to semantic-distorting changes and insensitive to semantic-preserving changes. Experiments on two standard benchmarks demonstrate strong robustness against removal attacks and security against spoofing attacks, including sentiment reversal and toxic content insertion, while maintaining high watermark detectability. Our approach offers a significant step toward more secure and semantically aware watermarking for LLMs",

    "title": "Do Language Models Agree with Human Perceptions of Suspense in Stories?",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Suspense is an affective response to narrative text that is believed to involve complex cognitive processes in humans. Several psychological models have been developed to describe this phenomenon and the circumstances under which text might trigger it. We replicate four seminal psychological studies of human perceptions of suspense, substituting human responses with those of different open-weight and closed-source LMs. We conclude that while LMs can distinguish whether a text is intended to induce suspense in people, LMs cannot accurately estimate the relative amount of suspense within a text sequence as compared to human judgments, nor can LMs properly capture the human perception for the rise and fall of suspense across multiple text segments. We probe the abilities of LM suspense understanding by adversarially permuting the story text to identify what cause human and LM perceptions of suspense to diverge. We conclude that, while LMs can superficially identify and track certain facets of suspense, they do not process suspense in the same way as human readers",

To facilitate this, we developed strategies for designing questions with engineered knowledge gaps that only a student can bridge, and we introduce Socrates, a system for deploying this method with minimal overhead. We evaluated our approach in an undergraduate course and found that this active-learning method led to statistically significant improvements in student performance compared to historical cohorts.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Building precise call graphs for Javascript programs is a fundamental build- ing block for many important software engineering and security applications such as bug detection, program repair, and refactoring. However, resolving dynamic calls using static analysis is challenging because it requires enumerating all possible values of both the object and the field. As a result, static call graph construction algorithms for Javascript ignore such dynamic calls, resulting in missed edges and a high false negative rate. We present a new approach, CALLME, that combines Language Models (LMs) with a custom static analyzer to address this challenge. Our key insight is in using LMs to incorporate additional modalities such as variable names, natural language documentation, and calling contexts, which are often sufficient to resolve dynamic property calls, but are difficult to incorporate in traditional static analysis. We implement our approach in CALLME and evaluate it on a dataset of call edges that are dependent on dynamic property accesses. CALLME achieves 80% accuracy and .79 F1, outperforming the state-of-the- art static analyzer by 30% and .60, respectively. To study the effectiveness of CALLME on downstream analysis tasks, we evaluate it on our manually curated dataset with 25 known Javascript vulnerabilities. CALLME can detect 24 vulnerabilities with only 3 false positives, whereas static analysis tools based on current call graph construction algorithms miss all of them",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Large language models have achieved remarkable success in various tasks but suffer from high computational costs during inference, limiting their deployment in resource-constrained applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel Collaborative Inference with Token-lEvel Routing (CITER) framework that enables efficient collaboration between small and large language models (SLMs & LLMs) through a token-level routing strategy. Specifically, CITER routes non-critical tokens to an SLM for efficiency and routes critical tokens to an LLM for generalization quality. We formulate router training as a policy optimization, where the router receives rewards based on both the quality of predictions and the inference costs of generation. This allows the router to learn to predict token-level routing scores and make routing decisions based on both the current token and the future impact of its decisions. To further accelerate the reward evaluation process, we introduce a shortcut which significantly reduces the costs of the reward estimation and improving the practicality of our approach. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that CITER reduces the inference costs while preserving high-quality generation, offering a promising solution for real-time and resource-constrained applications",

    "title": "LM Agents May Fail to Act on Their Own Risk Knowledge",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Language model (LM) agents have demonstrated significant potential for automating real-world tasks, yet they pose a diverse array of potential, severe risks in safety-critical scenarios. In this work, we identify a significant gap between LM agents' risk awareness and safety execution abilities: while they often answer \"Yes'' to queries like $\\texttt{\"Is executing `sudo rm -rf /*' dangerous?\"}$, they will likely fail to identify such risks in instantiated trajectories or even directly perform these risky actions when acting as agents. To systematically investigate this, we develop a comprehensive evaluation framework to examine agents' safety across three progressive dimensions: 1) their knowledge about potential risks, 2) their ability to identify corresponding risks in execution trajectories, and 3) their actual behaviors to avoid executing these risky actions. Our evaluation reveals two critical performance gaps that resemble the generator-validator gaps observed in LMs: while agents demonstrate near-perfect risk knowledge (>98\\% pass rates), they fail to apply this knowledge when identifying risks in actual scenarios, with performance dropping by >23\\%, and often still execute risky actions (<26\\% pass rates). This trend persists even in specialized reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1, reinforcing the challenge of translating an LM's risk knowledge into safe decision-making. We take advantage of these observed gaps to develop a risk verifier that independently critiques the proposed actions by agents, with an abstractor that converts specific execution trajectories into abstract descriptions where LMs can more effectively identify the risks. Our overall system achieves a significant reduction of risky action execution by 55.3\\% over vanilla-prompted agents",

To explore this, we conducted both qualitative and quantitative human evaluations of proofs generated by LLMs, and developed a schema for automatically assessing their reasoning capabilities. Our study reveals that current LLMs fall significantly short of solving challenging Olympiad-level problems and frequently fail to distinguish correct mathematical reasoning from clearly flawed solutions. We also found that occasional correct final answers provided by LLMs often result from pattern recognition or heuristic shortcuts rather than genuine mathematical reasoning. These findings underscore the substantial gap between LLM performance and human expertise in advanced mathematical reasoning and highlight the importance of developing benchmarks that prioritize the rigor and coherence of mathematical arguments rather than merely the correctness of final answers",

To maximize hardware-effiency, we first propose Group Tied Attention (GTA), a simple attention variant that combines and reuses key and value states to reduce memory transfers during incremental decoding while preserving model quality. We then introduce Group Latent Attention (GLA), a parallel-friendly latent attention combined with low-level optimization designed for fast decoding while showing high model quality. We empirically demonstrate the efficacy of these inference-aware variants in language modeling experiments, showing that GTA matches grouped query attention (GQA) quality with roughly 2x smaller KV cache, and GLA matches multi-head latent attention (MLA) but is easier to shard.

    "abstract": "Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are widely used in mechanistic interpretability research for large language models; however, the state-of-the-art method of using $k$-sparse autoencoders lacks a theoretical grounding for selecting the hyperparameter $k$ that represents the number of nonzero activations, often denoted by $\\ell_0$. In this paper, we reveal a theoretical link that the $\\ell_2$-norm of the sparse feature vector can be approximated with the $\\ell_2$-norm of the dense vector with a closed-form error, which allows sparse autoencoders to be trained without the need to manually determine $\\ell_0$. Specifically, we validate two applications of our theoretical findings. First, we introduce a new methodology that can assess the feature activations of pre-trained SAEs by computing the theoretically expected value from the input embedding, which has been overlooked by existing SAE evaluation methods and loss functions. Second, we introduce a novel activation function, top-AFA, which builds upon our formulation of approximate feature activation (AFA). This function enables top-$k$ style activation without requiring a constant hyperparameter $k$ to be tuned, dynamically determining the number of activated features for each input. By training SAEs on three intermediate layers to reconstruct GPT2 hidden embeddings for over 80 million tokens from the OpenWebText dataset, we demonstrate the empirical merits of this approach and compare it with current state-of-the-art $k$-sparse autoencoders.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recent developments in Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) allow large language models (LLMs) to function as implicit ranking models by maximizing the margin between preferred and non-preferred responses. In practice, user feedback on such lists typically involves identifying a few relevant items in context rather than providing detailed pairwise comparisons for every possible item pair. Besides, many complex information retrieval tasks, such as conversational agents and summarization systems, critically depend on ranking the highest-quality outputs at the top, further emphasizing the need to support natural and flexible forms of user feedback. To address the challenge of limited and sparse pairwise feedback in the in-context setting, we propose an In-context Ranking Preference Optimization (IRPO) framework that directly optimizes LLMs based on ranking lists constructed during inference. To further capture the natural and flexible forms of feedback, IRPO extends the DPO objective by incorporating both the relevance of items and their positions in the list. Modeling these aspects jointly is non-trivial, as ranking metrics are inherently discrete and non-differentiable, making direct optimization challenging. To overcome this, IRPO introduces a differentiable objective based on positional aggregation of pairwise item preferences, enabling effective gradient-based optimization of discrete ranking metrics. We further provide theoretical insights showing that IRPO (i) automatically emphasizes items with greater disagreement between the model and the reference ranking, and (ii) shows its gradient's linkage to an importance sampling estimator, resulting in an unbiased gradient estimator with reduced variance. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that IRPO outperforms standard DPO approaches in ranking performance, highlighting its effectiveness and efficiency in aligning LLMs with direct in-context ranking preferences",

Most ToM experiments place participants in a spectatorial role, wherein they predict and interpret other agents' behavior. However, human ToM also contributes to dynamically planning action and strategically intervening on others' mental states. We present MindGames: a novel `planning theory of mind' (PToM) task which requires agents to infer an interlocutor's beliefs and desires to persuade them to alter their behavior. Unlike previous evaluations, we explicitly evaluate use cases of ToM. We find that humans significantly outperform o1-preview (an LLM) at our PToM task (11% higher; $p=0.006$). We hypothesize this is because humans have an implicit causal model of other agents (e.g., they know, as our task requires, to ask about people's preferences). In contrast, o1-preview outperforms humans in a baseline condition which requires a similar amount of planning but minimal mental state inferences (e.g., o1-preview is better than humans at planning when already given someone's preferences).

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Speculative Decoding (SD) is a widely used approach to accelerate the inference of large language models (LLMs) without reducing generation quality. It operates by first using a compact model to draft multiple tokens efficiently, followed by parallel verification using the target LLM. This approach leads to faster inference compared to auto-regressive decoding. While there are multiple approaches to create a draft model, one promising approach is to use early-exit methods. These methods draft candidate tokens by using a subset of layers of the primary model and applying the remaining layers for verification, allowing a single model to handle both drafting and verification. While this technique reduces memory usage and computational cost, its performance relies on the choice of the exit layer for drafting and the number of tokens drafted (speculation length) in each SD round. Prior works use hyperparameter exploration to statically select these values. However, our evaluations show that these hyperparameter values are task-specific, and even within a task they are dependent on the current sequence context. We introduce DEL (Dynamic Exit Layer), a plug-and-play method that adaptively selects the exit layer and speculation length during inference. DEL dynamically tracks the token acceptance rate if the tokens are drafted at each layer of an LLM and uses that knowledge to heuristically select the optimal exit layer and speculation length. Our experiments across a broad range of models and downstream tasks show that DEL achieves overall speedups of $2.16\\times$$\\sim$$2.62\\times$ over vanilla auto-regressive decoding and improves upon state-of-the-art SD methods, which peak at $2.43\\times$, by up to $0.19\\times$.

    "title": "CRABS: A syntactic-semantic pincer strategy for bounding LLM interpretation of Python notebooks",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recognizing the information flows and operations comprising data science and machine learning Python notebooks is critical for evaluating, reusing, and adapting notebooks for new tasks. Investigating a notebook via re-execution often is impractical due to the challenges of resolving data and software dependencies. While Large Language Models (LLMs) pre-trained on large codebases have demonstrated effectiveness in understanding code without running it, we observe that they fail to understand some realistic notebooks due to hallucinations and long-context challenges. To address these issues, we propose a notebook understanding task yielding an information flow graph and corresponding cell execution dependency graph for a notebook, and demonstrate the effectiveness of a pincer strategy that uses limited syntactic analysis to assist full comprehension of the notebook using an LLM. Our Capture and Resolve Assisted Bounding Strategy (CRABS) employs shallow syntactic parsing and analysis of the abstract syntax tree (AST) to capture the correct interpretation of a notebook between lower and upper estimates of the inter-cell I/O set$\\textemdash$the flows of information into or out of cells via variables$\\textemdash$then uses an LLM to resolve remaining ambiguities via cell-by-cell zero-shot learning, thereby identifying the true data inputs and outputs of each cell. We evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using an annotated dataset of 50 representative, highly up-voted Kaggle notebooks that together represent 3454 actual cell inputs and outputs. The LLM correctly resolves 1397 of 1425 (98%) ambiguities left by analyzing the syntactic structure of these notebooks. Across 50 notebooks, CRABS achieves average $F_1$ scores of 98% identifying cell-to-cell information flows and 99% identifying transitive cell execution dependencies. Moreover, 37 out of the 50 (74%) individual information flow graphs and 41 out of 50 (82%) cell execution dependency graphs match the ground truth exactly",

OLMo 2 includes a family of dense autoregressive language models at 7B, 13B, and 32B scales with fully released artifacts—model weights, full training data, training code and recipes, training logs, and thousands of intermediate checkpoints. In this work, we describe our modified model architecture and training recipe, focusing on techniques for achieving better training stability and improved per-token efficiency. Our updated pretraining data mixture introduces a new, specialized data mix called Dolmino Mix 1124, which significantly improves model capabilities across many downstream task benchmarks when introduced via late-stage curriculum training (i.e., specialized data during the annealing phase of pretraining). Finally, we incorporate best practices from Tülu 3 to develop OLMo 2-Instruct, focusing on permissive data and extending our final-stage reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). Our OLMo 2 base models sit at the Pareto frontier of performance-to-training compute, often matching or outperforming open-weight-only models like Llama 3.1, Qwen 2.5, and Gemma 2 while using fewer FLOPs and with fully transparent training data, code, and recipe.

    "abstract": "As visual assistant systems powered by visual language models (VLMs) become more prevalent, concerns over user privacy have grown, particularly for blind and low vision users who may unknowingly capture personal private information in their images. Existing privacy protection methods rely on coarse-grained segmentation, which uniformly masks entire private objects, often at the cost of usability. In this work, we propose FiG-Priv, a fine-grained privacy protection framework that selectively masks only high-risk private information while preserving low-risk information. Our approach integrates fine-grained segmentation with a data-driven risk scoring mechanism. By leveraging a more nuanced understanding of privacy risk, our method enables more effective protection without unnecessarily restricting users' access to critical information. We evaluate our framework using the BIV-Priv-Seg dataset and show that FiG-Priv preserves +26% of image content, enhancing the ability of VLMs to provide useful responses by 11% and identify the image content by 45%, while ensuring privacy protection",

    "abstract": "Discovering efficient algorithms for solving complex problems has been an outstanding challenge in mathematics and computer science, requiring substantial human expertise over the years. Recent advancements in evolutionary search with large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in accelerating the discovery of algorithms across various domains, particularly in mathematics and optimization. However, existing approaches treat the LLM as a static generator, missing the opportunity to update the model with the signal obtained from evolutionary exploration. In this work, we propose to augment LLM-based evolutionary search by continuously refining the search operator $-$ the LLM $-$ through reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning. Our method leverages evolutionary search as an exploration strategy to discover improved algorithms, while RL optimizes the LLM policy based on these discoveries. Our experiments on combinatorial optimization tasks demonstrate that integrating RL with evolutionary search accelerates the discovery of superior algorithms, showcasing the potential of RL-enhanced evolutionary strategies for algorithm design",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "State-space models (SSMs) have recently attention as an efficient alternative to computationally expensive attention-based models for sequence modeling. They rely on linear recurrences to integrate information over time, enabling fast inference, parallelizable training, and control over recurrence stability. However, traditional SSMs often suffer from limited effective memory, requiring larger state sizes for improved recall. Moreover, existing SSMs struggle to capture multi-scale dependencies, which are essential for modeling complex structures in time series, images, and natural language. This paper introduces a multi-scale SSM framework that addresses these limitations by representing sequence dynamics across multiple resolution and processing each resolution with specialized state-space dynamics. By capturing both fine-grained, high-frequency patterns and coarse, global trends, MS-SSM enhances memory efficiency and long-range modeling. We further introduce an input-dependent scale-mixer, enabling dynamic information fusion across resolutions. The proposed approach significantly improves sequence modeling, particularly in long-range and hierarchical tasks, while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on benchmarks, including Long Range Arena, hierarchical reasoning, time series classification, and image recognition, demonstrate that MS-SSM consistently outperforms prior SSM-based models, highlighting the benefits of multi-resolution processing in state-space architectures",

    "abstract": "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a way to complement the in-context knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external documents. However, real-world applications demand not only accuracy but also interpretability. Dense retrieval methods provide high accuracy but lack interpretability, while sparse retrieval is transparent but often misses query intent due to keyword matching. Thus, balancing accuracy and interpretability remains a challenge. To address these issues, we introduce IterKey, an LLM-driven iterative keyword generation framework that enhances RAG via sparse retrieval. IterKey consists of three LLM-driven stages: generating keywords for retrieval, generating answers based on retrieved documents, and validating the answers. If validation fails, the process iteratively repeats with refined keywords. Across four QA tasks, experimental results show that IterKey achieves 5% to 20% accuracy improvements over BM25-based RAG and simple baselines. Its performance is comparable to dense retrieval based RAG and prior iterative query refinement methods using dense models. In summary, IterKey is a novel BM25-based iterative RAG framework that leverages LLMs to balance accuracy and interpretability",

    "abstract": "Recent work suggests that preference-tuning techniques—such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) methods like PPO and GRPO, as well as alternatives like DPO—reduce diversity, creating a dilemma given that these models are widely deployed in applications requiring varied outputs. We argue that diversity without consideration of quality has limited practical value. To address this issue, we introduce a framework for measuring effective semantic diversity—diversity among outputs that meet quality thresholds—which better reflects the practical utility of large language models (LLMs). Using open-ended tasks that require no human intervention, we find counterintuitive results: when using diversity metrics that do not explicitly consider quality, preference-tuned models—particularly those trained via RL—often produce outputs with lower diversity; however, these same preference-tuned models generate greater effective semantic diversity than supervised fine-tuned (SFT) or base models. Our analysis further shows another trend: while larger models may exhibit greater effective semantic diversity than smaller models, the smaller models are consistently more parameter-efficient at producing unique content within a fixed sampling budget. These findings have practical implications for applications that require diverse yet high-quality outputs, from creative assistance to synthetic data generation",

Although LLMs have the ability to generate text covering diverse topics, there is an overall sense of repetitiveness across texts that we aim to formalize. Such familiarity between documents is induced through the persistence of underlying discourse structures. However, existing similarity metrics dependent on lexical overlap and syntactic patterns are overly sensitive to volatility in content overlap, thus making them unsuitable for detecting $\\textit{structural}$ similarities. We introduce an abstraction based on linguistics theories in Questions Under Discussion (QUD) and question semantics to help quantify differences in discourse progression. We then use this framework to build $\\textbf{QUDsim}$, a similarity metric that can detect discursive parallels between documents. Using QUDsim, we find that LLMs often reuse discourse structures (more so than humans) to create seemingly new documents by simply swapping content. Furthermore, LLMs are not only repetitive and structurally uniform, but are also divergent from human authors in the types of structures they use",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) can be improved by aligning with human preferences through fine-tuning -- the so-called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, the cost of fine-tuning an LLM is prohibitive for many users. Due to their ability to bypass LLM fine-tuning, prediction-time tokenwise reward-guided text generation (RGTG) methods have recently been proposed. They use a reward model trained on full sequences to score partial sequences during decoding in a bid to steer the generation towards sequences with high rewards. However, these methods have so far been only heuristically motivated and poorly analyzed. In this work, we show that reward models trained on full sequences are not compatible with scoring partial sequences. To alleviate this, we propose to train a Bradley-Terry reward model on partial sequences explicitly, and autoregressively sample from the implied tokenwise policy during decoding. We study the properties of this reward model and the resulting policy: we show that this policy is proportional to the ratio of two distinct RLHF policies. Our simple approach outperforms previous RGTG methods and performs similarly to strong offline baselines without large-scale LLM fine-tuning",

Conventional instructional prompting frequently produces flawed outputs in these scenarios. While research has established that advanced techniques such as Chain-of-Thoughts and Least-to-Most methodologies can dramatically enhance LLM performance, emerging investigation indicates that a more streamlined divide-and-conquer (DaC) approach—which systematically partitions input sequences into discrete components—can yield remarkable improvements for particular problem classes like misinformation assessment. Our investigation rigorously examines the efficacy of DaC prompting strategies and precisely delineates the task characteristics that benefit most from this methodology. Through comprehensive theoretical analysis, we establish formal guarantees for performance enhancement in specifically identified task categories. We validate our theoretical framework through focused empirical studies on large integer multiplication and factual verification tasks, where experimental outcomes robustly confirm our analytical predictions, demonstrating DaC's practical superiority in these challenging domains",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) are deployed globally, it is crucial that their responses are calibrated across languages to accurately convey uncertainty and limitations. Prior work shows that LLMs are linguistically overconfident in English, leading users to overrely on confident generations. However, the usage and interpretation of epistemic markers (e.g., 'I think it's') differs sharply across languages. Here, we study the risks of multilingual linguistic (mis)calibration, overconfidence, and overreliance across five languages to evaluate LLM safety in a global context. Our work finds that overreliance risks are high across languages. We first analyze the distribution of LLM-generated epistemic markers and observe that LLMs are overconfident across languages, frequently generating strengtheners even as part of incorrect responses. Model generations are, however, sensitive to documented cross-linguistic variation in usage: for example, models generate the most markers of uncertainty in Japanese and the most markers of certainty in German and Mandarin. Next, we measure human reliance rates across languages, finding that reliance behaviors differ cross-linguistically: for example, participants are significantly more likely to discount expressions of uncertainty in Japanese than in English (i.e., ignore their 'hedging' function and rely on generations that contain them). Taken together, these results indicate a high risk of reliance on overconfident model generations across languages. Our findings highlight the challenges of multilingual linguistic calibration and stress the importance of culturally and linguistically contextualized model safety evaluations",

In this work, we revisit REG from a pragmatic perspective, introducing a new dataset (RefOI) of 1.5k images annotated with both written and spoken referring expressions. Through a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art VLMs, we identify three key failures of pragmatic competence: (1) failure to uniquely identify the referent, (2) inclusion of excessive or irrelevant information, and (3) misalignment with human pragmatic preference, such as the underuse of minimal spatial cues. We also show that standard automatic evaluations fail to capture these pragmatic violations, reinforcing superficial cues rather than genuine referential success.

It is of interest to scholars from a wide range of domains including robotics, narratology, linguistics, and cognitive science.

To do this, we extend an existing corpus of parallel human and model responses to short story prompts with an additional 18,000 stories generated by 18 popular language models. We find that all models generate stories that differ significantly from human usage of sensory language. However, the direction of these differences varies considerably between model families; Gemini models use significantly more sensory language than humans along most axes whereas most models from the remaining five families use significantly less. Linear probes run on five models suggest that they are capable of \\textit{identifying} sensory language, meaning an inability to recognize sensory content is unlikely to be the cause of the observed differences.

Existing LLM agents for penetration testing primarily rely on self‐guided reasoning, which can produce inaccurate or hallucinated procedural steps. As a result, the LLM agent may undertake unproductive actions, such as exploiting unused software libraries or generating cyclical responses that repeat prior tactics. In this work, we propose a reasoning pipeline for penetration testing LLM agents that incorporates a deterministic task tree built from the MITRE ATT\\&CK Matrix, a proven penetration testing kill chain, to constrain the LLM's reasoning process to explicitly defined tactics, techniques, and procedures. This anchors reasoning in proven penetration testing methodologies and filters out ineffective actions by guiding the agent towards more productive attack procedures. To evaluate our approach, we built an automated penetration testing LLM agent using three LLMs (Llama-3-8B, Gemini-1.5, and GPT-4) and applied it to navigate 10 HackTheBox cybersecurity exercises with 103 discrete subtasks representing real-world cyberattack scenarios. Our proposed reasoning pipeline guided the LLM agent through 71.8\\%, 72.8\\%, and 78.6\\% of subtasks using Llama-3-8B, Gemini-1.5, and GPT-4, respectively.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In-context learning (ICL) allows a language model to improve its problem-solving capability when provided with suitable information in context. Since the choice of in-context information can be determined based on the problem itself, in-context learning is analogous to human learning from teachers in a classroom. Recent works (Didolkar et al., 2024a; 2024b) show that ICL performance can be improved by leveraging a frontier large language model's (LLM) ability to predict required skills to solve a problem, popularly referred to as an LLM's metacognition, and using the recommended skills to construct necessary in-context examples. While this skill-based strategy boosts ICL performance in larger models, its gains on small language models (SLMs) have been minimal, highlighting a performance gap in ICL capabilities. We investigate this gap and show that skill-based prompting can hurt SLM performance on easy questions by introducing unnecessary information, akin to cognitive overload. To address this, we introduce AdaptMI, an adaptive approach to selecting skill-based in-context Math Instructions for SLMs. Inspired by cognitive load theory from human pedagogy, our method only introduces skill-based examples when the model performs poorly. We further propose AdaptMI+, which adds examples targeted to the specific skills missing from the model's responses. On 5-shot evaluations across popular math benchmarks and five SLMs (1B–7B; Qwen, Llama), AdaptMI+ improves accuracy by up to 6% over naive skill-based strategies",

    "title": "Missing Premise exacerbates Overthinking: Are Reasoning Models losing Critical Thinking Skill?",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We find that the response length of reasoning LLMs, whether trained by reinforcement learning or supervised learning, drastically increases for ill-posed questions with missing premises (MiP), ending up with redundant and ineffective thinking. Such failures are against the ``test-time scaling law'' but have been widely observed on multiple datasets we curated with MiP, indicating the harm of cheap overthinking and a lack of critical thinking. Surprisingly, LLMs not specifically trained for reasoning exhibit much better critical thinking ability, producing much shorter responses that quickly identify ill-posed queries and ask for the MiP. This implies a critical flaw of the current training recipe for reasoning LLMs, which does not encourage efficient thinking adequately, leading to the abuse of thinking patterns. To further investigate the reasons behind such failures, we conduct fine-grained analyses of the reasoning length, overthinking patterns, and location of critical thinking on different types of LLMs. Moreover, our extended ablation study reveals that the overthinking is contagious through the distillation of reasoning models' responses. These results improve the understanding of overthinking and shed novel insights into mitigating the problem. Our code and data can be found in: https://github.com/tianyi-lab/MiP-Overthinking",

These metrics offer a fine-grained, context-sensitive assessment of factual consistency. To facilitate evaluation, we contribute the first large-scale dataset of long-form user reviews, comprising entities with over a thousand reviews each, paired with unbiased expert summaries and manually annotated queries.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Unit tests (UTs) play an instrumental role in assessing code correctness as well as providing feedback to large language models (LLMs), motivating automated test generation. However, we uncover a trade-off between generating unit test inputs that reveal errors when given a faulty code and correctly predicting the unit test output without access to the gold solution. To address this trade-off, we propose UTGen, which teaches LLMs to generate unit test inputs that reveal errors along with their correct expected outputs based on task descriptions. Since model-generated tests can provide noisy signals (e.g., from incorrectly predicted outputs), we propose UTDebug that (i) scales UTGen via test-time compute to improve UT output prediction, and (ii) validates and backtracks edits based on multiple generated UTs to avoid overfitting, and helps LLMs debug effectively. We show that UTGen outperforms other LLM-based baselines by 7.59% based on a metric measuring the presence of both error-revealing UT inputs and correct UT outputs. When used with UTDebug, we find that feedback from UTGen's unit tests improves pass@1 accuracy of Qwen2.5 32B on HumanEvalFix and our own harder debugging split of MBPP+ by over 3.17% and 12.35% (respectively) over other LLM-based UT generation baselines. Moreover, we observe that feedback from Qwen2.5 32B-based UTGen model can enhance debugging with frontier LLMs like GPT-4o by 13.8%.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Large language model (LLM) unlearning has become a critical challenge in ensuring safety and controlled model behavior by removing *undesired* data-model influences from the pretrained model while preserving its general utility. Significant recent efforts have been dedicated to developing LLM unlearning benchmarks such as WMDP (Weapons of Mass Destruction Proxy) and MUSE (Machine Unlearning Six-way Evaluation), facilitating standardized unlearning performance assessment and method comparison. Despite their usefulness, we uncover for the first time a novel *coreset effect* within these benchmarks. Specifically, we find that LLM unlearning achieved with the original (full) forget set can be effectively maintained using a significantly smaller subset (functioning as a \"coreset\"), *e.g.*, as little as 5% of the forget set, even when selected at random. This suggests that LLM unlearning in these benchmarks can be performed surprisingly easily, even in an extremely low-data regime. We demonstrate that this coreset effect remains strong, regardless of the LLM unlearning method used, such as NPO (Negative Preference Optimization) and RMU (Representation Misdirection Unlearning), the popular ones in these benchmarks. The surprisingly strong coreset effect is also robust across various data selection methods, ranging from random selection to more sophisticated heuristic approaches. We explain the coreset effect in LLM unlearning through a keyword-based perspective, showing that keywords extracted from the forget set alone contribute significantly to unlearning effectiveness and indicating that current unlearning is driven by a compact set of high-impact tokens rather than the entire dataset. We further justify the faithfulness of coreset-unlearned models along additional dimensions, such as mode connectivity and robustness to jailbreaking attacks",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance, leading to their widespread adoption as decision-support tools in resource-constrained contexts like hiring and admissions. There is, however, scientific consensus that AI systems can reflect and exacerbate societal biases, raising concerns about identity-based harm when used in critical social contexts. Prior work has laid a solid foundation for assessing bias in LLMs by evaluating demographic disparities in different language reasoning tasks. In this work, we extend single-axis fairness evaluations to examine intersectional bias, recognizing that when multiple axes of discrimination intersect, they create distinct patterns of disadvantage. We create a new benchmark called WinoIdentity by augmenting the WinoBias dataset with 25 demographic markers across 10 attributes, including age, nationality, and race, intersected with binary gender, yielding 245,700 prompts to evaluate 50 distinct bias patterns. Focusing on harms of omission due to underrepresentation, we investigate bias through the lens of uncertainty and propose a group (un)fairness metric called \\emph{Coreference Confidence Disparity} which measures whether models are more or less confident for some intersectional identities than others. We evaluate five recently published LLMs and find confidence disparities as high as 40\\% along various demographic attributes including body type, sexual orientation and socio-economic status, with models being most uncertain about doubly-disadvantaged identities in anti-stereotypical settings, such as when assigning transgender women to historically male-dominated occupations. Surprisingly, coreference confidence decreases even for hegemonic or privileged markers (e.g., 'White' or 'cisgender'), indicating that the recent impressive performance of LLMs is more likely due to memorization than logical reasoning. Notably, these are two independent failures in value alignment and validity that can compound to cause social harm",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "While the inconsistency of LLMs is not a novel topic, prior research has predominantly addressed two types of generative inconsistencies: i) Randomness Inconsistency: running the same LLM multiple trials, yielding varying responses; ii) Paraphrase Inconsistency: paraphrased prompts result in different responses from the same LLM. Randomness Inconsistency arises from the inherent randomness due to stochastic sampling in generative models, while Paraphrase Inconsistency is a consequence of the language modeling objectives, where paraphrased prompts alter the distribution of vocabulary logits. This research discovers Prompt-Reverse Inconsistency (PRIN), a new form of LLM self-inconsistency: given a question and a couple of LLM-generated answer candidates, the LLM often has conflicting responses when prompted \"Which are correct answers?\" and \"Which are incorrect answers?\". PRIN poses a big concern as it undermines the credibility of LLM-as-a-judge, and suggests a challenge for LLMs to adhere to basic logical rules. We conduct a series of experiments to investigate PRIN, examining the extent of PRIN across different LLMs, methods to mitigate it, potential applications, and its relationship with Randomness Inconsistency and Paraphrase Inconsistency. As the first study to explore PRIN, our findings offer valuable insights into the inner workings of LLMs and contribute to advancing trustworthy AI",

    "title": "Positional Biases Shift as Inputs Approach Context Window Limits",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to use information across long inputs effectively. Prior work has identified positional biases, such as the Lost in the Middle (LiM) effect, where models perform better when information appears at the beginning (primacy bias) or end (recency bias) of the input, rather than in the middle. However, long-context studies have not consistently replicated these effects, raising questions about their intensity and the conditions under which they manifest. To address this, we conducted a comprehensive analysis using relative rather than absolute input lengths, defined with respect to each model's context window. Our findings reveal that the LiM effect is strongest when inputs occupy up to 50\\% of a model's context window. Beyond that, the primacy bias weakens, while recency bias remains relatively stable. This effectively eliminates the LiM effect; instead, we observe a distance-based bias, where model performance is better when relevant information is closer to the end of the input. Furthermore, our results suggest that successful retrieval is a prerequisite for reasoning in LLMs, and that the observed positional biases in reasoning are largely inherited from retrieval. These insights have implications for long-context tasks, the design of future LLM benchmarks, and evaluation methodologies for LLMs handling extended inputs",

The task requires two key competencies: (1) algorithm comprehension: synthesizing information from papers and academic literature to understand implementation logic, and (2) coding expertise: identifying dependencies and correctly implementing necessary APIs. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce SciReplicate-Bench, a benchmark of 100 tasks from 36 NLP papers published in 2024, featuring detailed annotations and comprehensive test cases. Building on SciReplicate-Bench, we propose Sci-Reproducer, a dual-agent framework consisting of a Paper Agent that interprets algorithmic concepts from literature and a Code Agent that retrieves dependencies from repositories and implements solutions. To assess algorithm understanding, we introduce reasoning graph accuracy, which quantifies similarity between generated and reference reasoning graphs derived from code comments and structure. For evaluating implementation quality, we employ execution accuracy, CodeBLEU, and repository dependency/API recall metrics. In our experiments, we evaluate various powerful non-reasoning and reasoning LLMs as foundational models. The best-performing LLM using \\ModelName~achieves only 39\\% execution accuracy, highlighting the benchmark's difficulty.

    "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), built on powerful language backbones, have enabled Multimodal In-Context Learning (MICL)—adapting to new tasks from a few multimodal demonstrations consisting of images, questions, and answers. Despite showing noticeable improvement on standard vision-language datasets, current MLLMs struggle to leverage visual information in the demonstrations. Specifically, they tend to neglect visual cues and over-rely on textual patterns, leading to mere text imitation rather than genuine multimodal adaptation. This behavior makes MICL still unimodal and largely restricts its practical utility. More importantly, this limitation is often concealed by the improved performance on tasks that do not require understanding the visual context. As a result, how to effectively enhance MICL ability and reliably evaluate the MICL performance remains underexplored. To address these issues, we first introduce Dynamic Attention Reallocation (DARA), an efficient fine-tuning strategy that encourages models to attend to the visual context by rebalancing attention across visual and textual tokens. In addition, we present TrueMICL, an MICL-dedicated dataset with both support and test sets that explicitly requires the integration of multimodal information—particularly visual content—for correct task completion. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our holistic solution, showcasing substantial improvements in the MICL capabilities.

    "abstract": "Training of large language models (LLMs) is typically distributed across a large number of accelerators to reduce training time. Since internal states and parameter gradients need to be exchanged at each and every single gradient step, all devices need to be co-located using low-latency high-bandwidth communication links to support the required high volume of data exchange. Recently, algorithms like DiLoCo have relaxed the constraint that all devices need co-location: accelerators can be grouped into ``workers'', where synchronizations between workers need only occur infrequently. This in turn means that workers can afford being connected by lower bandwidth communication links without affecting learning quality. However, in these methods, communication across workers still requires the same peak bandwidth as before, as the synchronizations require all parameters to be exchanged across all workers. In this paper, we improve DiLoCo in three ways. First, we synchronize only subsets of parameters in sequence, rather than all at once, which greatly reduces peak bandwidth. Second, we allow workers to continue training while synchronizing, which decreases wall clock time. Third, we quantize the data exchanged by workers, which further reduces bandwith across workers. We show experimentally that by properly combining these modifications we can distribute training of billion-scale parameters and attain models of similar quality as before, but reducing required bandwidth by a factor of up to two orders of magnitude",

Social media platforms amplify the impact of sexism by conveying discriminatory content not only through text but also across multiple modalities, highlighting the critical need for a multimodal approach to the analysis of sexism online. With the rise of social media platforms where users share short videos, sexism is increasingly spreading through video content. Automatically detecting sexism in videos is a challenging task, as it requires analyzing the combination of verbal, audio, and visual elements to identify sexist content. In this study, (1) we introduce MuSeD, a new Multimodal Spanish dataset for Sexism Detection consisting of ≈ 11 hours of videos extracted from TikTok and BitChute; (2) we propose an innovative annotation framework for analyzing the contributions of textual, vocal, and visual modalities to the classification of content as either sexist or non-sexist; and (3) we evaluate a range of large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs on the task of sexism detection. We find that visual information plays a key role in labeling sexist content for both humans and models. Models effectively detect explicit sexism; however, they struggle with implicit cases, such as stereotypes—instances where annotators also show low agreement.

TTT has recently been shown to significantly improve language models, but is computationally expensive. We find that performance of TTMM improves with more experts and approaches the performance of TTT. Moreover, we find that with a 1B parameter base model, _TTMM is more than $100\\times$ faster than TTT_ at test-time by amortizing the cost of TTT at train-time.

    "abstract": "Pre-tokenization, the initial step in many modern tokenization pipelines, segments text into smaller units called pretokens, typically splitting on whitespace and punctuation. While this process encourages having full, individual words as tokens, it introduces a fundamental limitation in most tokenization algorithms such as Byte Pair Encoding (BPE). Specifically, pre-tokenization causes the distribution of tokens in a corpus to heavily skew towards common, full-length words. This skewed distribution limits the benefits of expanding to larger vocabularies, since the additional tokens appear with progressively lower counts. To overcome this barrier, we propose BoundlessBPE, a modified BPE algorithm that relaxes the pretoken boundary constraint. Our approach selectively merges two complete pretokens into a larger unit we term a superword. Superwords are not necessarily semantically cohesive. For example, the pretokens \" of\" and \" the\" might be combined to form the superword \" of the\". This merging strategy results in a substantially more uniform distribution of tokens across a corpus than standard BPE, and compresses text more effectively, with an approximate 20% increase in bytes per token",

For example, **when agents are instantiated with GPT-4o, Web-based attacks successfully cause the multi-agent system execute arbitrary malicious code in 58-90% of trials** (depending on the orchestrator). In some model-orchestrator configurations, the attack success rate is 100%.

    "title": "Privately Learning from Graphs with Applications in Fine-tuning Large Language Models",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Graphs offer unique insights into relationships between entities, complementing data modalities like text and images and enabling AI models to extend their capabilities beyond traditional tasks. However, learning from graphs often involves handling sensitive relations, raising significant privacy concerns. Existing privacy-preserving methods, such as DP-SGD, rely on gradient decoupling assumptions and are incompatible with relational learning due to the inherent dependencies between training samples. To address this challenge, we propose a privacy-preserving pipeline for relational learning that decouples dependencies in sampled relations during training, ensuring differential privacy through a tailored application of DP-SGD. We apply this approach to fine-tune large language models (LLMs), such as BERT and Llama2, on sensitive graph data while addressing the associated computational complexities. Our method is evaluated on four real-world text-attributed graphs, demonstrating significant improvements in relational learning tasks while maintaining robust privacy guarantees. Additionally, we analyze the trade-offs between privacy, utility, and computational efficiency, offering insights into the practical deployment of our approach for privacy-preserving relational learning.

    "abstract": "Idioms, whose figurative meanings usually differ from their literal interpretations, are common in everyday language, especially in Chinese, where they often contain historical references and follow specific structural patterns. Despite recent progress in machine translation with large language models, little is known about Chinese idiom translation. In this work, we introduce IdiomEval, a framework with a comprehensive error taxonomy for Chinese idiom translation. We annotate 900 translation pairs from nine modern systems, including GPT-4o and Google Translate, across four domains: web, news, Wikipedia, and social media. We find these systems fail at idiom translation, producing incorrect, literal, partial, or even missing translations. The best-performing system, GPT-4, makes errors in 28\\% of cases. We also find that existing evaluation metrics measure idiom quality poorly with Pearson correlation below 0.48 with human ratings. We thus develop improved models that achieve F$_1$ scores of 0.68 for detecting idiom translation errors",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Fine-tuning language models is commonly believed to inevitably harm their safety, i.e., refusing to respond to harmful user requests, even when using harmless datasets, thus requiring additional safety measures. We challenge this belief through systematic testing, showing that poor optimization choices, rather than inherent trade-offs, often cause safety problems, measured as harmful responses to adversarial prompts. By properly selecting key training hyper-parameters, e.g., learning rate, batch size, and gradient steps, we reduce unsafe model responses from 16\\% to approximately 5\\%, as measured by keyword matching, while maintaining utility performance. Based on this observation, we propose a simple exponential moving average (EMA) momentum technique in parameter space that preserves safety performance by creating a stable optimization path and retains the original pre-trained model's safety properties. Our experiments on the Llama families across multiple datasets (Dolly, Alpaca, ORCA) demonstrate that safety problems during fine-tuning can largely be avoided without specialized interventions, outperforming existing approaches that require additional safety data while offering practical guidelines for maintaining both model performance and safety during adaptation",

To address this, we introduce CodeXEmbed, a family of large-scale code embedding models ranging from 400M to 7B parameters. Our novel training pipeline unifies multiple programming languages and transforms various code-related tasks into a common retrieval framework, enhancing model generalizability and retrieval performance.

We introduce TREQA (Translation Evaluation via Question-Answering), a framework that extrinsically evaluates translation quality by assessing how accurately candidate translations answer reading comprehension questions that target key information in the original source or reference texts. In challenging domains that require long-range understanding, such as literary texts, we show that TREQA is competitive with and, in some cases, outperforms state-of-the-art neural and LLM-based metrics in ranking alternative paragraph-level translations, despite never being explicitly optimized to correlate with human judgments.

    "abstract": "Merging parameter-efficient task experts has recently gained growing attention as a way to build modular architectures that can be rapidly adapted on the fly for specific downstream tasks, without requiring additional fine-tuning. Typically, LoRA serves as the foundational building block of such parameter-efficient modular architectures, leveraging low-rank weight structures to reduce the number of trainable parameters. In this paper, we study the properties of sparse adapters, which train only a subset of weights in the base neural network, as potential building blocks of modular architectures. First, we propose a simple method for training highly effective sparse adapters, which is conceptually simpler than existing methods in the literature and surprisingly outperforms both LoRA and full fine-tuning in our setting. Next, we investigate the merging properties of these sparse adapters by merging adapters for up to 20 natural language processing tasks, thus scaling beyond what is usually studied in the literature. Our findings demonstrate that sparse adapters yield superior in-distribution performance post-merging compared to LoRA or full model merging.

    "abstract": "Long-context large language models (LLMs) are able to process inputs containing up to several million tokens. In the scope of in-context learning (ICL), this translates into using hundreds/thousands of demonstrations in the input prompt, enabling many-shot ICL. In practice, a fixed set of demonstrations is often selected at random in many-shot settings due to (1) high inference costs, (2) the benefits of caching and reusing computations, and (3) the similar performance offered by this strategy compared to others when scaled. In this work, we propose two straightforward strategies for demonstration selection in many-shot ICL that improve performance with minimal computational overhead. Our first method combines a small number of demonstrations, selected based on their similarity to each test sample, with a disproportionately larger set of random demonstrations that are cached. The second strategy improves the first by replacing random demonstrations with those selected using centroids derived from test sample representations via k-means clustering. Our experiments with Gemini Pro and Flash across several datasets indicate that our strategies consistently outperform random selection and surpass or match the most performant selection approach while supporting caching and reducing inference cost by up to an order of magnitude. We also show that adjusting the proportion of demonstrations selected based on different criteria can balance performance and inference cost in many-shot ICL",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively tuned to mitigate explicit biases, yet they often exhibit subtle implicit biases rooted in their pre-training data. Rather than directly probing LLMs with human-crafted questions that may trigger guardrails, we propose studying how models behave when they proactively ask questions themselves. The 20 Questions game, a multi-turn deduction task, serves as an ideal testbed for this purpose. We systematically evaluate geographic performance disparities in entity deduction using a new dataset, Geo20Q+, consisting of both notable people and culturally significant objects (e.g., foods, landmarks, animals) from diverse regions. We test popular LLMs across two gameplay configurations (canonical 20-question and unlimited turns) and in seven languages (English, Hindi, Mandarin, Japanese, French, Spanish, and Turkish). Our results reveal geographic disparities: LLMs are substantially more successful at deducing entities from the _Global North_ than the _Global South_, and the _Global West_ than the _Global East_. While Wikipedia pageviews and pre-training corpus frequency correlate mildly with performance, they fail to fully explain these disparities. Notably, the language in which the game is played has minimal impact on performance gaps. These findings demonstrate the value of creative, _free-form_ evaluation frameworks for uncovering subtle biases in LLMs that remain hidden in standard prompting setups. By analyzing how models initiate and pursue reasoning goals over multiple turns, we find geographic and cultural disparities embedded in their reasoning processes.

    "abstract": "Recent studies have discovered that large language models (LLM) may be ``fooled'' to output private information, including training data, system prompts, and personally identifiable information, under carefully crafted adversarial prompts. Existing red-teaming approaches for privacy leakage either rely on manual efforts or focus solely on system prompt extraction, making them ineffective for severe risks of training data leakage. We propose LeakAgent, a novel black-box red-teaming framework for LLM privacy leakage. Our framework trains an open-source LLM through reinforcement learning as the attack agent to generate adversarial prompts for both training data extraction and system prompt extraction. To achieve this, we propose a novel reward function to provide effective and fine-grained rewards and design novel mechanisms to balance exploration and exploitation during learning and enhance the diversity of adversarial prompts. Through extensive evaluations, we first show that LeakAgent significantly outperforms existing rule-based approaches in training data extraction and automated methods in system prompt leakage. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of LeakAgent in extracting system prompts from real-world applications in OpenAI's GPT Store. We further demonstrate LeakAgent's effectiveness in evading the existing guardrail defense and its helpfulness in enabling better safety alignment.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has emerged as a crucial method for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human-annotated demonstrations. However, SFT, being an off-policy approach similar to behavior cloning, often struggles with overfitting and poor out-of-domain generalization, especially in limited-data scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose Self-Rewarding PPO, a novel fine-tuning method that leverages on-policy techniques to enhance generalization performance. Our approach combines the strengths of SFT and proximal policy optimization (PPO) to achieve more effective alignment from demonstration data. At its core is a reward function designed as the log policy ratio between the SFT model and the pretrained base model. This function serves as an implicit reward signal, using the pretrained policy as a baseline and the SFT policy as a target. By doing so, it enables on-policy fine-tuning without relying on human preference annotations. The integration of this self-rewarding mechanism with PPO addresses key limitations of SFT, improving generalization, data efficiency, and robustness. Our empirical evaluation across a range of natural language processing tasks demonstrates that Self-Rewarding PPO consistently outperforms traditional SFT methods. The results highlight the effectiveness of our approach in aligning LLMs using demonstration data, particularly in scenarios where high-quality annotated data is scarce",

Although current vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress, they continue to struggle with chart comprehension due to training on datasets that lack diversity and real-world authenticity, or on automatically extracted underlying data tables of charts, which can contain numerous estimation errors. Furthermore, existing models only rely on supervised fine-tuning using these low-quality datasets, severely limiting their effectiveness. To address these issues, we first propose BigCharts, a dataset creation pipeline that generates visually diverse chart images by conditioning the rendering process on real-world charts sourced from multiple online platforms. Unlike purely synthetic datasets, BigCharts incorporates real-world data, ensuring authenticity and visual diversity, while still retaining accurate underlying data due to our proposed replotting process.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are restricted to reason in the \"language space\", where they typically express the reasoning process with a chain-of-thought (CoT) to solve a complex reasoning problem. However, we argue that language space may not always be optimal for reasoning. For example, most word tokens are primarily for textual coherence and not essential for reasoning, while some critical tokens require complex planning and pose huge challenges to LLMs. To explore the potential of LLM reasoning in an unrestricted latent space instead of using natural language, we introduce a new paradigm Coconut (Chain of Continuous Thought). We utilize the last hidden state of the LLM as a representation of the reasoning state (termed \"continuous thought\"). Rather than decoding this into a word token, we feed it back to the LLM as the subsequent input embedding directly in the continuous space. Experiments show that Coconut can effectively augment the LLM on several reasoning tasks. This novel latent reasoning paradigm leads to emergent advanced reasoning patterns: the continuous thought can encode multiple alternative next reasoning steps, allowing the model to perform a breadth-first search (BFS) to solve the problem, rather than prematurely committing to a single deterministic path like CoT. Coconut outperforms CoT in certain logical reasoning tasks that require substantial backtracking during planning, with fewer thinking tokens during inference. These findings demonstrate the promise of latent reasoning and offer valuable insights for future research",

In this work, we show that paired preference data consisting of individually weak data points can enable gains beyond the strength of each individual sample. We formulate the **delta learning hypothesis** to explain this phenomenon, positing that the relative quality _delta_ between points suffices to drive learning via preference tuning—even when supervised finetuning on the weak data hurts. We validate our hypothesis in controlled experiments and at scale, where we post-train 8B models on preference data generated by pairing a small 3B model's responses with outputs from an even smaller 1.5B model to ensure a meaningful delta. Strikingly, on a standard 11-benchmark evaluation suite (MATH, MMLU, etc.), our simple recipe matches the performance of Tülu 3, a state-of-the-art open model that was tuned from the same base as our model while relying on vastly stronger supervisors (e.g., GPT-4o).

Instead of simply imitating correct responses, CFT trains models to critique noisy responses, inspired by human learning processes that emphasize critical thinking, deeper analysis, and nuanced understanding--traits often overlooked by standard SFT. To validate the effectiveness of CFT, we construct multiple critique datasets (e.g., WebInstruct, MetaMath, NuminaMath), where GPT-4o serves as the teacher to generate critiques in the form of ([query; noisy response], critique). Experiments on these datasets demonstrate that CFT consistently outperforms SFT by 4--10% across six mathematical reasoning benchmarks, and is effective across different base models including Qwen2.5, Qwen2.5-Math, and DeepSeek-Math. Notably, our model Qwen2.5-Math-CFT only requires 1 hour of training on 8xH100 over the 50K examples, yet matches or outperforms strong competitors like Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct on most benchmarks, which use over 2M samples. Moreover, it matches the performance of SimpleRL, which is a DeepSeek-r1 replication trained with 140x more compute.

    "title": "Improving Fisher Information Estimation and Efficiency for LoRA-based LLM Unlearning",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "LLMs have demonstrated remarkable performance across various tasks but face challenges related to unintentionally generating outputs containing sensitive information. A straightforward approach to address this issue is to retrain the model after excluding the problematic data. However, this approach incurs prohibitively high computational costs. To overcome this limitation, machine unlearning has emerged as a promising solution that can effectively remove sensitive information without the need to retrain the model from scratch. Recently, FILA has been proposed as a parameter-efficient unlearning method by integrating LoRA adapters. Specifically, it calculates the Fisher information to identify parameters associated with the forget set and assigns them to LoRA adapters for updates. Despite its innovative approach, FILA still requires access to all model parameters and does not adequately account for fundamental assumptions underlying Fisher information, leading to inaccuracies in importance estimation. To address these limitations, we propose VILA, a novel unlearning framework that explicitly considers the assumptions overlooked in FILA, thereby enhancing the accuracy of parameter identification for the forget set. Moreover, VILA significantly reduces computational costs by enabling parameter identification without accessing the entire model. Our method achieves up to 100× higher parameter efficiency and 40× faster training speed compared to FILA, and sets new state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks including TOFU, WMDP, and MUSE.

    "abstract": "Soft attention is a critical mechanism powering LLMs to locate relevant parts within a given context. However, individual attention weights are determined by the similarity of only a single query and key token vector. This \"single token attention\" bottlenecks the amount of information used in distinguishing a relevant part from the rest of the context. To address this issue, we propose a new attention method, Multi-Token Attention (MTA), which allows LLMs to condition their attention weights on multiple query and key vectors simultaneously. This is achieved by applying convolution operations over queries, keys and heads, allowing nearby queries and keys to affect each other's attention weights for more precise attention. As a result, our method can locate relevant context using richer, more nuanced information that can exceed a single vector's capacity. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that MTA achieves enhanced performance on a range of popular benchmarks. Notably, it outperforms Transformer baseline models on standard language modeling tasks, and on tasks that require searching for information within long contexts, where our method's ability to leverage richer information proves particularly beneficial",

    "abstract": "Despite the impressive multilingual capabilities of recent large language models (LLMs), the mechanisms underlying their language-specific processing remain largely unclear. In this paper, we investigate how LLMs handle multilingualism through the lens of sparse autoencoders (SAEs), uncovering distinctive patterns that offer new insights into their internal workings. Specifically, we introduce two novel concepts—task instruction–focused (TF) and heading-focused (HF) SAE features—and use them to reveal intrinsic discrepancies between high- and low-performing languages. Our analysis yields several key findings: (1) SAEs provide concrete evidence that LLMs have a precise understanding of prompt structure; (2) heading keywords (e.g., \"Question,\" \"Choices,\" and \"Answer\") play a distinct role in LLM processing; and (3) low-performing languages exhibit a relative deficiency in TF features compared to high-performing languages. Building on these insights, we propose two practical strategies to improve zero-shot multilingual performance: (1) incorporating English heading keywords and (2) amplifying TF features through steering. Our approach improves zero-shot performance in low-performing languages by up to 3.7% on average on ARC-Challenge and MMLU, while also shedding new light on fundamental differences between high- and low-performing languages in LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/ihcho2/SAE-ML",

CrossWordBench leverages a controllable puzzle generation framework that produces puzzles in two formats ($\\textit{text}$ and $\\textit{image}$), supports adjustable difficulty through prefill ratio control, and offers different evaluation strategies, ranging from direct puzzle solving to interactive modes. Our extensive evaluation of over 20 models reveals that reasoning LLMs substantially outperform non-reasoning models by effectively leveraging crossing-letter constraints. We further demonstrate that LVLMs struggle with the task, showing a strong correlation between their puzzle-solving performance and grid-parsing accuracy. Our findings highlight limitations of the reasoning capabilities of current LLMs and LVLMs, and provide an effective approach for creating multimodal constrained tasks for future evaluations",

However, for tasks that require high precision, e.g., mathematical reasoning, uncontrolled high temperature sampling, e.g., min-$p$ or top-$p$ lowers reasoning quality. We demonstrate that the loss of accuracy is caused by sampling incorrect continuations in sensitive positions when entropy is high. To address this, in this paper, we propose selective sampling, a method that dynamically switches between greedy and high-temperature sampling based on a sampling risk metric. This risk metric estimates the likelihood of output errors when applying high temperature sampling on the current token position. We train a lightweight classifier on a small subset of verifiable problems to predict sampling risk. The classifier can be integrated with the base language model with minimal latency overhead. Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks show that selective sampling improves the quality-diversity trade-off, even under high-temperature settings",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Subword tokenization segments input text according to a pre-defined vocabulary to feed it into a language model; the language model, in turn, generates a sequence made from this same vocabulary. The members of the vocabulary can be built of code points or bytes. Using code points means that all members of the vocabulary are valid UTF-8 characters. However, it also requires thousands of initial members to achieve acceptable coverage of inputs. Beginning with bytes, on the contrary, avoids out-of-vocabulary errors with only 256 initial members of the vocabulary, but the members of the vocabulary and sequences of them are not guaranteed to be valid UTF-8. Sequences that are not valid UTF-8 break code that assumes its input to be valid UTF-8. Applications of language models must account for the breakage thereby introduced. In this paper, we formalize tokenization using monoid theory and prove that tokenizers whose vocabularies contain tokens that are ill-formed UTF-8 can always produce sequences that are ill-formed UTF-8. We demonstrate formally that attempting to incrementally convert tokens back to a string and interpret the results as UTF-8 gives different results than converting the whole sequence of tokens at once. This formal result predicts real-world bugs: we evaluate mitigations for the problem identified and provide case studies of major foundation models, serving engines, and constrained generation systems",

However, existing methods have significant limitations: serialized chain-of-thought approaches generate overly long outputs, leading to increased latency and exhausted context windows, while parallel methods such as self-consistency suffer from insufficient coordination, resulting in redundant computations and limited performance gains. To address these shortcomings, we propose Adaptive Parallel Reasoning (APR), a novel reasoning framework that enables language models to orchestrate both serialized and parallel computations end-to-end. APR generalizes existing reasoning methods by enabling adaptive multi-threaded inference using spawn() and join() operations. A key innovation is our end-to-end reinforcement learning strategy, optimizing both parent and child inference threads to enhance task success rate without requiring predefined reasoning structures. Experiments on the Countdown reasoning task demonstrate significant benefits of APR: (1) higher performance within the same context window (83.4% vs. 60.0% at 4k context); (2) superior scalability with increased computation (80.1% vs. 66.6% at 20k total tokens); (3) improved accuracy at equivalent latency (75.2% vs. 57.3% at approximately 5,000ms).

Despite the success of advanced LLM-based Text-to-SQL approaches on leaderboards, their unsustainable computational costs—often overlooked—stand as the \"elephant in the room\" in current leaderboard-driven research, limiting their economic practicability for real-world deployment and widespread adoption. To tackle this, we exploratively propose EllieSQL, a complexity-aware routing framework that assigns queries to suitable SQL generation pipelines based on estimated complexity. We investigate multiple routers to direct simple queries to efficient approaches while reserving computationally intensive methods for complex cases. Drawing from economics, we introduce the Token Elasticity of Performance (TEP) metric, capturing cost-efficiency by quantifying the responsiveness of performance gains relative to token investment in SQL generation. Experiments show that compared to always using the most advanced methods in our study, EllieSQL with the Qwen2.5-0.5B-DPO router reduces token use by over 40% without compromising performance on Bird development set, achieving more than a 2× boost in TEP over non-routing approaches.

Yet, while many works have provided conditions in which they occur or not, a critical question remains shallowly answered: Why do LLMs learn such patterns and how are they being used? In this work, we argue theoretically and empirically that this mechanism provides a method for LLMs to avoid over-mixing, connecting this to existing lines of work that study mathematically how information propagates in Transformers. We run experiments to validate our theoretical intuitions and show how choices such as context length, depth, and data packing influence the sink behaviour.

Instead of generating claims directly from the raw text of the book, which results in artifact-riddled claims, CLIPPER first compresses the book into chapter outlines and book summaries and then uses these intermediate representations to generate complex claims and corresponding chain-of-thoughts. Compared to naive approaches, CLIPPER produces claims that are more valid, grounded, and complex. Using CLIPPER, we synthesize a dataset of 19K claims paired with source books and chain-of-thought reasoning, and use it to fine-tune three open-weight models. Our best model achieves breakthrough results on narrative claim verification (from 28% to 76% accuracy on our test set) and sets a new state-of-the-art for sub-10B models on the NoCha leaderboard.

By expert demonstrations, each specialized agent learns a distinctive strategy, such as aerial support or defensive maneuvers, and produces coherent, structured multistep action sequences. The SP then orchestrates these proposals into a single, environmentally adaptive plan that ensures local decisions aligning with long-term strategies. We call this HIMA (Hierarchical Imitation Multi-Agent). We also present TEXTSCII-ALL, a comprehensive SC2 testbed that encompasses all race match combinations in SC2.

Performance gains reported in recent studies frequently hinge on unclear comparisons or unreported sources of variance. To address these issues, we propose a standardized evaluation framework with clearly defined best practices and reporting standards.

We formulate the benchmark SPIN-Bench by systematically varying action spaces, state complexity, and the number of interacting agents to simulate a variety of social settings where success depends on not only methodical and step-wise decision making, but also conceptual inference of other (adversarial or cooperative) participants. Our experiments reveal that while contemporary LLMs handle basic fact retrieval and short-range planning reasonably well, they encounter significant performance bottlenecks in tasks requiring deep multi-hop reasoning over large state spaces and socially adept coordination under uncertainty.

The policy uses smaller, cheaper backends to handle simpler subtasks, while allowing more complex subtasks to leverage larger, more capable models. We evaluate the method on two new \"streaming\" visual question-answering tasks in which a system answers a question on a sequence of inputs, receiving ground-truth feedback after each answer. Compared to monolithic multi-modal models, our implementation achieves up to 98\\% resource savings with minimal accuracy loss, demonstrating its potential for scalable and resource-efficient multi-modal inference.

    "abstract": "Sparse Autoencoders have emerged as powerful tools for interpreting the internal representations of Large Language Models, yet they often fail to capture domain-specific features not prevalent in their training corpora. This paper introduces a residual learning approach that addresses this feature blindness without requiring complete retraining. We propose training a secondary SAE specifically to model the reconstruction error of a pretrained SAE on domain-specific texts, effectively capturing features missed by the primary model. By summing the outputs of both models during inference, we demonstrate significant improvements in both LLM cross-entropy and explained variance metrics across multiple specialized domains. Our experiments show that this method efficiently incorporates new domain knowledge into existing SAEs while maintaining their performance on general tasks. This approach enables researchers to selectively enhance SAE interpretability for specific domains of interest, opening new possibilities for targeted mechanistic interpretability of LLMs",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have made remarkable strides in reasoning tasks, yet their performance often falters on novel and complex problems. Domain-specific continue-pretraining (CPT) methods, such as those tailored for mathematical reasoning, have shown promise but lack transferability to broader reasoning tasks. In this work, we pioneer the use of Graph Problem Reasoning (GPR) to enhance LLMs' general reasoning capabilities. GPR tasks—spanning pathfinding, network analysis, numerical computation, and topological reasoning—require sophisticated logical and relational reasoning, making them ideal for teaching diverse reasoning patterns. To achieve this, we introduce GraphPile, the first large-scale corpus specifically designed for CPT using GPR data. Spanning 10.9 billion tokens across 23 graph tasks, the dataset includes Chain-of-Thought, Program-of-Thought, Trace of Execution, and Real-world Graph Data. Using GraphPile, we train GraphMind on popular base models-Llama 3&3.1 and Gemma 2-achieving up to 4.9% higher accuracy in mathematical reasoning and up to 21.2% improvement in non-mathematical reasoning tasks, like logical and commonsense reasoning. By being the first to harness GPR for enhancing reasoning patterns and introducing the first dataset of its kind, our work bridges the gap between domain-specific pretraining and universal reasoning capabilities, advancing the adaptability and robustness of LLMs",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "As language models improve and grow capable of performing more complex tasks across modalities, evaluating them automatically becomes increasingly challenging. Developing strong and robust task-specific automatic metrics gets harder, and human-annotated test sets—which are expensive to create—saturate more quickly. A compelling alternative is to design reliable strategies to automate the creation of test data and evaluation, but previous attempts either rely on pre-existing data, or focus solely on individual tasks. We present Zero-shot Benchmarking (ZSB), a framework for creating high-quality benchmarks for any task by leveraging language models for both synthetic test data creation and evaluation. ZSB is simple and flexible: it requires only the creation of a prompt for data generation and one for evaluation; it is scalable to tasks and languages where collecting real-world data is costly or impractical; it is model-agnostic, allowing the creation of increasingly challenging benchmarks as models improve. To assess the effectiveness of our framework, we create benchmarks for five text-only tasks and a multi-modal one: general capabilities in four languages (English, Chinese, French, and Korean), translation, and general vision-language capabilities in English. We then rank a broad range of open and closed systems on our benchmarks. ZSB rankings consistently correlate strongly with human rankings, outperforming widely-adopted standard benchmarks. Through ablations, we find that strong benchmarks can be created with open models, and that judge model size and dataset variety are crucial drivers of performance.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Pretraining data curation is a cornerstone in Large Language Model (LLM) development, leading to growing research on quality filtering of large web corpora. From statistical quality flags to LLM-based labelling systems, datasets are divided into categories, frequently reducing to a binary: those passing the filters are deemed as valuable examples, others are discarded as useless or detrimental. However, a more detailed understanding of the contribution of different kinds of texts to model performance is still largely lacking. In this article, we present the first study utilising _registers_ or _genres_—a widely used standard in corpus linguistics to model linguistic variation—to curate pretraining datasets and investigate the effect of register on the performance of LLMs. We train small generative models with register classified data and evaluate them using standard benchmarks, and show that the register of pretraining data substantially affects model performance. We uncover surprising relationships between the pretraining material and the resulting models: using the _News_ register results in subpar performance, and on the contrary, including the _Opinion_ class, covering texts such as reviews and opinion blogs, is highly beneficial. While a model trained on the entire unfiltered dataset outperforms those trained on datasets limited to a single register, combining well-performing registers such as _How-to-Instructions_, _Informational Description_, and _Opinion_ leads to major improvements. Furthermore, analysis of individual benchmark results reveals key differences in the strengths and drawbacks of specific register classes as pretraining data: _How-to-Instructions_ excels at physical reasoning and sentence completion while barely crossing random baselines on world-knowledge benchmarks, while _Narrative_ boosts performance on social interaction tasks but struggles with scientific questions. These findings show that register is an important explainer of model variation and can facilitate more deliberate and detailed future data selection practices",

Recently, decoding-time alignment has emerged as an effective plug-and-play technique that avoids fine-tuning model parameters.

To address these challenges, we introduce Cascade Reward Sampling (CARDS) to resolve both efficiency bottlenecks in decoding-time alignment. Specifically, we develop a segment-level rejection sampling algorithm that minimizes redundant computations of both LLMs and reward models (RMs). Central to CARDS is an uncertainty-based segmentation mechanism, which ensures the accuracy of RMs evaluations on incomplete segments. Furthermore, we provide a detailed analysis of reward scores on segments to elucidate the improved alignment performance. Experimental results demonstrate that CARDS significantly improves decoding efficiency, alignment quality, and general utility compared to existing decoding-time alignment methods, achieving approximately a 70\\% reduction in decoding time and over 90\\% win-ties in utility and safety benchmarks",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have been touted as AI models possessing advanced reasoning abilities. In theory, autoregressive LLMs with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) can perform more serial computations to solve complex reasoning tasks. However, recent studies suggest that, despite this capacity, LLMs do not truly learn to reason but instead fit on statistical features. To study the reasoning capabilities in a principled fashion, we adopt a computational theory perspective and propose an experimental protocol centered on 3-SAT -- the prototypical NP-complete problem lying at the core of logical reasoning and constraint satisfaction tasks. Specifically, we examine the phase transitions in random 3-SAT and characterize the reasoning abilities of state-of-the-art LLMs by varying the inherent hardness of the problem instances. By comparing DeepSeek R1 with other LLMs, our findings reveal two key insights (1) LLM accuracy drops significantly on harder instances, suggesting all current models struggle when statistical shortcuts are unavailable (2) Unlike other LLMs, R1 shows signs of having learned the underlying reasoning. Following a principled experimental protocol, our study moves beyond the benchmark-driven evidence often found in LLM reasoning research.

To address this challenge, we introduce Adv-RM, a novel adversarial training framework that automatically identifies adversarial examples — responses that receive high rewards from the target RM but are OOD and of low quality. By leveraging reinforcement learning, Adv-RM trains a policy to generate adversarial examples that reliably expose vulnerabilities in large state-of-the-art reward models such as Nemotron 340B RM. Incorporating these adversarial examples into the reward training process improves the robustness of RMs, mitigating reward hacking and enhancing downstream performance in RLHF.

    "abstract": "Unlearning in Large Language Models (LLMs) aims to enhance safety, mitigate biases, and comply with legal mandates, such as the right to be forgotten. However, existing unlearning methods are brittle: minor query modifications, such as multi-hop reasoning and entity aliasing, can recover supposedly forgotten information. As a result, current evaluation metrics often create an illusion of effectiveness, failing to detect these vulnerabilities due to reliance on static, unstructured benchmarks. We propose a dynamic framework that stress tests unlearning robustness using complex structured queries. Our approach first elicits knowledge from the target model (pre-unlearning) and constructs targeted probes, ranging from simple queries to multi-hop chains, allowing precise control over query difficulty. Our experiments show that the framework: (1) shows comparable coverage to existing benchmarks by automatically generating semantically equivalent Q&A probes, (2) aligns with prior evaluations, and (3) uncovers new unlearning failures missed by other benchmarks, particularly in multi-hop settings. Furthermore, activation analyses show that single-hop queries typically follow dominant computation pathways, which are more likely to be disrupted by unlearning methods. In contrast, multi-hop queries tend to use alternative pathways that often remain intact, explaining the brittleness of unlearning techniques in multi-hop settings. Our framework enables practical and scalable evaluation of unlearning methods without the need for manual construction of forget test sets, enabling easier adoption for real-world applications.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) exhibit cognitive biases -- systematic tendencies of irrational decision-making, similar to those seen in humans. Prior work has found that these biases vary across models and can be amplified by instruction tuning. However, it remains unclear if these differences in biases stem from pretraining, finetuning, or even random noise due to training stochasticity. We propose a two-step causal experimental approach to disentangle these factors. First, we finetune models multiple times using different random seeds to study how training randomness affects over $30$ cognitive biases. Second, we introduce \\emph{cross-tuning} -- swapping instruction datasets between models to isolate bias sources. This swap uses datasets that led to different bias patterns, directly testing whether biases are dataset-dependent. Our findings reveal that while training randomness introduces some variability, biases are mainly shaped by pretraining: models with the same pretrained backbone exhibit more similar bias patterns than those sharing only finetuning data. These insights suggest that understanding biases in finetuned models requires considering their pretraining origins, especially given their high post-finetuning variability. This perspective can guide future efforts to develop principled strategies for evaluating and mitigating bias in LLMs. See our code and models at: https://itay1itzhak.github.io/planted-in-pretraining",

Quality Estimation (QE) for Machine Translation (MT), which assesses the quality of a source-target pair without relying on reference translations, remains a challenging cross-lingual task for LLMs. The challenges stem from the inherent limitations of existing LLM-based QE systems, which are pre-trained for causal language modelling rather than regression-specific tasks, further elevated by the presence of low-resource languages given pre-training data distribution. This paper introduces ALOPE, an adaptive layer-optimization framework designed to enhance LLM-based QE by restructuring Transformer representations through layer-wise adaptation for improved regression-based prediction. Our framework integrates low-rank adapters (LoRA) with regression task heads, leveraging selected pre-trained Transformer layers for improved cross-lingual alignment. In addition to the layer-specific adaptation, ALOPE introduces two strategies—dynamic weighting, which adaptively combines representations from multiple layers, and multi-head regression, which aggregates regression losses from multiple heads for QE. Our framework shows improvements over various existing LLM-based QE approaches. Empirical evidence suggests that intermediate Transformer layers in LLMs provide contextual representations that are more aligned with the cross-lingual nature of the QE task. We make resultant models and framework code publicly available for further research, also allowing existing LLM-based MT frameworks to be scaled with QE capabilities",

The scale of LLMs play a contributing role in their success, and the growth in parameter count follows larger hidden dimensions. In this paper, we hypothesize that while the increase in dimensions has been a key advantage, it may lead to emergent problems as well. These problems emerge as the linear structures in the activation space can be exploited, in the form of activation engineering, to circumvent its safety alignment. Through detailed visualizations of linear subspaces associated with different concepts, such as safety, across various model scales, we show that the curse of high-dimensional representations uniquely impacts LLMs. Further substantiating our claim, we demonstrate that projecting the representations of the model onto a lower dimensional subspace can preserve sufficient information for alignment while avoiding those linear structures. Empirical results confirm that such dimensional reduction significantly reduces susceptibility to jailbreaking through representation engineering. Building on our empirical validations, we provide theoretical insights into these linear jailbreaking methods relative to a model's hidden dimensions. Broadly speaking, our work posits that the high dimensions of a model's internal representations can be both a blessing and a curse in safety alignment",

In this work, we take a novel perspective on domain adaptation–reducing latency and computational costs by adapting the vocabulary to focused domains of interest. We introduce AdaptiVocab, an end-to-end approach for vocabulary adaptation, designed to enhance LLM efficiency in low resource domains. AdaptiVocab can be applied to any tokenizer and architecture, modifying the vocabulary by replacing tokens with domain-specific n-gram-based tokens, thereby reducing the number of tokens required for both input processing and output generation. AdaptiVocab initializes new n-token embeddings using an exponentially weighted combination of existing embeddings and employs a lightweight fine-tuning phase that can be efficiently performed on a single GPU.

Recent advancements in long-context extension have significantly expanded the context window of LLMs but require expensive overhead to train the large-scale models with longer context. In this work, we propose Dimension-Wise Positional Embeddings Manipulation (DPE), a training-free framework to extrapolate the context window of LLMs by diving into RoPE's different hidden dimensions. Instead of manipulating all dimensions equally, DPE detects the effective length for every dimension and finds the key dimensions for context extension. We reuse the original position indices with their embeddings from the pre-trained model and manipulate the key dimensions' position indices to their most effective lengths. In this way, DPE adjusts the pre-trained models with minimal modifications while ensuring that each dimension reaches its optimal state for extrapolation. DPE significantly surpasses well-known baselines such as YaRN and Self-Extend. DPE enables Llama3-8k 8B to support context windows of 128k tokens without continual training and integrates seamlessly with Flash Attention 2.

To address this challenge, we present GlyphDecode, a novel framework designed to restore visually perturbed text to its original form. Our framework consists of two key components: (1) GlyphPerturber, which generates visually perturbed text images for training, and (2) GlyphRestorer, which learns to recover the original text through a multimodal transformer architecture. GlyphRestorer is a light-weight and fast module that can be applied in a plug-and-play manner with off-the-shelf LLMs and multimodal LLMs to enhance harmful content detection. To evaluate restoration efficacy in real-world scenarios, we introduce GlyphSynth publicly available, a specialized dataset containing realistic examples of content moderation evasion from diverse sources including DEA(Drug Enforcement Administration) reports and social media platforms. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms baselines in text restoration, and enabling multimodal language models to better detect harmful content disguised through visual manipulations. Our work bridges an important gap in content moderation systems by addressing not only the detection but also the recovery of manipulated text, contributing to more effective safeguards against increasingly sophisticated evasion tactics",

    "abstract": "Process Reward Models (PRMs) provide step-level supervision to large language models (LLMs), but scaling up training data annotation remains challenging for both humans and LLMs. To address this limitation, we propose an active learning approach, ActPRM, which proactively selects the most uncertain samples for training, substantially reducing labeling costs. During training, we use the PRM to estimate uncertainty after the forward pass, retaining only highly uncertain data. A capable yet costly reasoning model then labels this data. Then we compute the loss w.r.t. the labels and update the PRM's weights. We compare ActPRM vs. vanilla fine-tuning, on a pool-based active learning setting, demonstrating that ActPRM reduce 50\\% annotation, but achieving the comparable or even better performance. Beyond annotation efficiency, we further advance the actively trained PRM by filtering over 1M+ math reasoning trajectories with ActPRM, retaining 60\\% of the data.

While beneficial in one setting, these dataset-specific mechanisms typically degrade performance when models encounter novel tasks or distributions. In this work, we introduce a fine-tuning approach designed to enhance generalization by identifying and pruning neurons associated with dataset-specific mechanisms in transformer-based LLMs. Our method employs Integrated Gradients to quantify each neuron's influence on high-confidence predictions, pinpointing those that disproportionately contribute to dataset-specific performance without supporting robust, transferable reasoning. Selectively pruning these neurons compels the model to depend on generalizable representations. Evaluated across multiple-choice benchmarks, our pruning-based fine-tuning significantly enhances performance, surpassing prior (non-pruning) adaptation methods",

    "abstract": "The rapid deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) highlights the need for efficient low-bit post-training quantization (PTQ) due to their high memory costs. A key challenge in weight quantization is the presence of outliers, which inflate quantization ranges and lead to large errors. While a number of outlier suppression techniques have been proposed, they either: fail to effectively shrink the quantization range, or incur (relatively) high bit overhead. In this paper, we present ICQuant, a novel framework that leverages outlier statistics to design an efficient index coding scheme for outlier-aware weight-only quantization. Compared to existing outlier suppression techniques requiring $\\approx 1$ bit overhead to halve the quantization range, ICQuant requires only $\\approx 0.25$ bits; a significant saving in low bit regimes (e.g., 2-3 bits). ICQuant can be used on top of any existing quantizers to eliminate outliers, improving the quantization quality.

MAC leverages over 25,000 image-text pairs sourced from issues of top-tier scientific journals such as Nature, Science, and Cell, challenging MLLMs to reason across abstract visual and textual scientific content. Experiments on our most recent yearly snapshot, MAC-2025, reveal that while MLLMs demonstrate strong perceptual abilities, their cross-modal scientific reasoning remains limited. To bridge this gap, we propose DAD, a lightweight inference-time approach that enhances MLLMs by extending MLLM visual features with language space reasoning, achieving performance improvements of up to 11%.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Vision-language models encode images and text in a joint space, minimizing the distance between corresponding image and text pairs. How are language and images organized in this joint space, and how do the models encode meaning and modality? To investigate this, we train and release sparse autoencoders (SAEs) on the embedding spaces of four vision-language models (CLIP, SigLIP, SigLIP2, and AIMv2). SAEs approximate model embeddings as sparse linear combinations of learned directions, or ``concepts''. We find that, compared to other methods of linear feature learning, SAEs are better at reconstructing the real embeddings, while also able to retain the most sparsity. Retraining SAEs with different seeds or different data diet leads to two findings: the rare, specific concepts captured by the SAEs are liable to change drastically, but we also show that commonly-activating concepts are remarkably stable across runs. Interestingly, while most concepts activate primarily for one modality, we find they are not merely encoding modality per se. Many are almost orthogonal to the subspace that defines modality, and the concept directions do not function as good modality classifiers, suggesting that they encode cross-modal semantics. To quantify this bridging behavior, we introduce the Bridge Score, a metric that identifies concept pairs which are both co-activated across aligned image-text inputs and geometrically aligned in the shared space. This reveals that even single-modality concepts can collaborate to support cross-modal integration. We release interactive demos of the SAEs for all models, allowing researchers to explore the organization of the concept spaces. Overall, our findings uncover a sparse linear structure within VLM embedding spaces that is shaped by modality, yet stitched together through latent bridges—offering new insight into how multimodal meaning is constructed",

However, such potential also raises concerns about the safety risks of LLM-driven persuasion, particularly their potential for unethical influence through manipulation, deception, exploitation of vulnerabilities, and many other harmful tactics. In this work, we present a systematic investigation of LLM persuasion safety through two critical aspects: (1) whether LLMs appropriately reject unethical persuasion tasks and avoid unethical strategies during execution, including cases where the initial persuasion goal appears ethically neutral, and (2) how influencing factors like personality traits and external pressures affect their behavior. To this end, we introduce PersuSafety, the first comprehensive framework for the assessment of persuasion safety which consists of three stages, i.e., persuasion scene creation, persuasive conversation simulation, and persuasion safety assessment. PersuSafety covers 6 diverse unethical persuasion topics and 15 common unethical strategies. Through extensive experiments across 8 widely used LLMs, we observe significant safety concerns in most LLMs, including failing to identify harmful persuasion tasks and leveraging various unethical persuasion strategies.

We train a set of small-scale \"ladder\" models, collect data points to fit the parameterized functions of the two prediction steps, and make predictions for two target models: a 7B model trained to 4T tokens and a 13B model trained to 5T tokens. Training the ladder models only costs 1\\% of the compute used for the target models. On four multiple-choice tasks formatted as ranked classification, we can predict the accuracy of both target models within 2 points of absolute error.

In this work, we investigate the feasibility of simulating health-related decision-making, using vaccine hesitancy, defined as the delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccines despite the availability of vaccination services (MacDonald, 2015), as a case study. To this end, we introduce the VacSim framework with 100 generative agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). VacSim simulates vaccine policy outcomes with the following steps: 1) instantiate a population of agents with demographics based on census data; 2) connect the agents via a social network and model vaccine attitudes as a function of social dynamics and disease-related information; 3) design and evaluate various public health interventions aimed at mitigating vaccine hesitancy. To align with real-world results, we also introduce simulation warmup and attitude modulation to adjust agents' attitudes. We propose a series of evaluations to assess the reliability of various LLM simulations. Experiments indicate that models like Llama and Qwen can simulate aspects of human behavior but also highlight real-world alignment challenges, such as inconsistent responses with demographic profiles. This early exploration of LLM-driven simulations is not meant to serve as definitive policy guidance; instead, it serves as a call for action to examine social simulation for policy development",

However, the benefit of such long thoughts for system-2 reasoning is relatively less explored in other domains such as perceptual tasks where shallower, system-1 reasoning seems sufficient. In this paper, we introduce $\\textit{LongPerceptualThoughts}$, a new synthetic dataset with 30K long-thought traces for perceptual tasks. The key challenges in synthesizing elaborate reasoning thoughts for perceptual tasks are that off-the-shelf models are not yet equipped with such thinking behavior and that it is not straightforward to build a reliable process verifier for perceptual tasks. Thus, we propose a novel three-stage data synthesis framework that first synthesizes verifiable multiple-choice questions from dense image descriptions, then distills simple CoTs from VLMs for those verifiable problems, and finally expands those simple thoughts to elaborate long thoughts via frontier reasoning models. In controlled experiments with a strong instruction-tuned 7B model, we demonstrate notable improvements over existing visual reasoning data-generation methods. Our model, trained on the generated dataset, achieves an average +3.4 points improvement over 5 vision-centric benchmarks, including +11.8 points on V$^*$ Bench.

Existing approaches often rely on handcrafted reasoning paths with inductive biases that can limit their overall effectiveness. Motivated by the recent success of reasoning-enhanced models such as DeepSeek R1 and OpenAI O1, which effectively leverage reward-driven self-exploration to enhance reasoning capabilities and generalization, we propose a novel set of partial rewards tailored specifically for the Text-to-SQL task. Our reward set includes schema-linking, partial reward from AI feedback, n-gram similarity, and syntax check rewards, explicitly designed to address the reward sparsity issue prevalent in reinforcement learning (RL). Leveraging group relative policy optimization (GRPO), our approach explicitly encourages large language models (LLMs) to develop intrinsic reasoning skills necessary for accurate SQL query generation. With models of different sizes, we demonstrate that RL-only training with our proposed rewards consistently achieves higher accuracy and superior generalization compared to supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Remarkably, our RL-trained14B-parameter model significantly outperforms larger proprietary models, e.g. O3-Mini by 4% and Gemini-1.5-Pro-002 by 3% on the BIRD benchmark.

A key prerequisite for human-aligned evaluation is role identification, the ability to recognize who is speaking based on dialogue context. We argue that any meaningful judgment of role-playing quality (how well a character is played) fundamentally depends on first correctly attributing words and actions to the correct persona (who is speaking). We present PersonaEval, the first benchmark designed to test whether LLM evaluators can reliably identify human roles. PersonaEval uses human-authored dialogues from novels, scripts, and video transcripts, challenging models to determine the correct persona according to the conversation context. Our experiments, including a human study, show that even the best-performing LLMs reach only around 69% accuracy, well below the level needed for reliable evaluation. In contrast, human participants perform near ceiling with 90.8% accuracy, highlighting that current LLM evaluators are still not human enough to effectively judge role-play scenarios. To better understand this gap, we examine training-time adaptation and test-time compute, suggesting that reliable evaluation requires more than task-specific tuning, but depends on strong, human-like reasoning abilities in LLM evaluators.

Prior work has established strong correlations between the number of in-context examples provided and the accuracy of the model's predictions.

In experiments with GPT-2 models of different sizes, our scaling law matches existing scaling laws in accuracy while also offering interpretable terms for task priors, learning efficiency, and per-example probabilities. To illustrate the analytic power that such interpretable scaling laws provide, we report on controlled synthetic dataset experiments designed to inform real-world studies of safety alignment. In our experimental protocol, we use SFT or DPO to suppress an unwanted existing model capability and then use ICL to try to bring that capability back (many-shot jailbreaking). We then study ICL on real-world instruction-tuned LLMs using capabilities benchmarks as well as a new many-shot jailbreaking dataset. In all cases, Bayesian scaling laws accurately predict the conditions under which ICL will cause suppressed behaviors to reemerge, which sheds light on the ineffectiveness of post-training at increasing LLM safety",

However, their effectiveness in fine-grained tasks remains an open question. In everyday scenarios, individuals encountering design materials, such as magazines, typography tutorials, research papers, or branding content, may wish to identify aesthetically pleasing fonts used in the text. Given their multimodal capabilities and free accessibility, many VLMs are often considered potential tools for font recognition. This raises a fundamental question: Do VLMs truly possess the capability to recognize fonts? To investigate this, we introduce the Font Recognition Benchmark (FRB), a compact and well-structured dataset comprising 15 commonly used fonts. FRB includes two versions: (i) an easy version, where 10 sentences are rendered in different fonts, and (ii) a hard version, where each text sample consists of the names of the 15 fonts themselves, introducing a stroop effect that challenges model perception. Through extensive evaluation of various VLMs on font recognition tasks, we arrive at the following key findings: (i) Current VLMs exhibit limited font recognition capabilities, with many state-of-the-art models failing to achieve satisfactory performance and being easily affected by the stroop effect introduced by textual information. (ii) Few-shot learning and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting provide minimal benefits in improving font recognition accuracy across different VLMs. (iii) Attention analysis sheds light on the inherent limitations of VLMs in capturing semantic features",

We introduce **Speculative Thinking**, a training-free framework that enables large reasoning models to guide smaller ones during inference at the reasoning level, distinct from speculative decoding, which operates at the token level. Our approach is based on two observations: (1) reasoning-supportive tokens such as $''wait''$ frequently appear after structural delimiters like $''\\n\\n''$, serving as signals for reflection or continuation; and (2) larger models exhibit stronger control over reflective behavior, reducing unnecessary backtracking while improving reasoning quality. By strategically delegating reflective steps to a more capable model, our method significantly boosts the reasoning accuracy of reasoning models while shortening their output.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated surprisingly robust performance across a wide range of language-related tasks, including programming language understanding and generation. In this paper, we take the first steps towards a formal investigation of using transformers as compilers from an expressive power perspective. To this end, we introduce a representative programming language, **Mini-Husky**, which encapsulates key features of modern C-like languages. We show that if the input code sequence has a bounded depth in both the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and type inference (reasonable assumptions based on the *clean code principle*), then the number of parameters required by transformers depends only on the *logarithm of the input sequence length* to handle compilation tasks, such as AST construction, symbol resolution, and type analysis. A significant technical challenge stems from the fact that transformers operate at a low level, where each layer processes the input sequence as raw vectors without explicitly associating them with predefined structure or meaning. In contrast, high-level compiler tasks necessitate managing intricate relationships and structured program information. Our primary technical contribution is the development of a domain-specific language, **Cybertron**, which generates formal proofs of the transformer's expressive power, scaling to address compiler tasks. We further establish that recurrent neural networks (RNNs) require at least a linear number of parameters relative to the input sequence, leading to an exponential separation between transformers and RNNs. Finally, we empirically validate our theoretical results by comparing transformers and RNNs on compiler tasks within **Mini-Husky**",

This makes choosing the right LM architecture challenging. Recently proposed hybrid architectures seek a best-of-all-worlds approach that reaps the benefits of all architectures. Hybrid design is difficult for two reasons: it requires manual expert-driven search, and new hybrids must be trained from scratch. We propose Manticore, a framework that addresses these challenges by automating the design of hybrid architectures while reusing pretrained models to create pretrained hybrids. Our approach augments ideas from differentiable Neural Architecture Search (NAS) by incorporating simple projectors that translate features between pretrained blocks from different architectures. We then fine-tune hybrids that combine pretrained models from different architecture families---such as the GPT series and Mamba---end-to-end. With Manticore, we enable LM selection without training multiple models, the construction of pretrained hybrids from existing pretrained models, and the ability to program pretrained hybrids to have certain capabilities. Manticore hybrids match existing manually designed hybrids, achieve strong performance on the Long Range Arena benchmark, and improve on pretrained transformers and state space models on various natural language tasks",

    "abstract": "Domain reweighting is an emerging research area aimed at adjusting the relative weights of different data sources to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of LLM pre-training. We show that data mixtures that perform well at smaller scales may not retain their advantage at larger scales, challenging the existing practice of determining competitive mixtures in small-scale experiments and *directly* applying them at much larger scales. To address this, we propose AutoScale, a two-stage, scale-aware data composition framework. First, AutoScale fits a parametric model that predicts the model's loss under different data compositions, then uses it to find an approximate best allocation at smaller, more manageable budgets. Next, leveraging a novel theoretical analysis of how optimal compositions evolve with scale, AutoScale extrapolates that composition to larger budgets without further retraining. Empirically, AutoScale accelerates convergence and improves downstream performance. For instance, when pre-training GPT-2 Large, it achieves a 28\\% faster perplexity reduction than baselines and up to a 38\\% speed-up over unweighted training, while yielding best-average results on various downstream tasks.

To mitigate these costs and address challenges related to scalability and data security, there is a growing shift towards decentralized systems for model deployment, where choosing efficient inference acceleration schemes become crucial to manage computational resources effectively and enhance system responsiveness. In this work, we address the challenge of selecting optimal acceleration methods in decentralized systems by introducing a meta-learning-based framework. This framework automates the selection process by learning from historical performance data of various acceleration techniques across different tasks. Unlike traditional methods that rely on random selection or expert intuition, our approach systematically identifies the best acceleration strategies based on the specific characteristics of each task. We demonstrate that our meta-learning framework not only streamlines the decision-making process but also consistently outperforms conventional methods in terms of efficiency and performance. Our results highlight the potential of inference acceleration in decentralized AI systems, offering a path towards more democratic and economically feasible artificial intelligence solutions.

While prior work has focused on English-centric attacks, we expose a far more severe vulnerability: adversarial multilingual and multi-accent audio jailbreaks, where linguistic and acoustic variations dramatically amplify attack success. In this paper, we introduce Multi-AudioJail, the first systematic framework to exploit these vulnerabilities through (1) a novel dataset of adversarially perturbed multilingual/multi-accent audio jailbreaking prompts, and (2) a hierarchical evaluation pipeline revealing that how acoustic perturbations (e.g., reverberation, echo, and whisper effects) interacts with cross-lingual phonetics to cause jailbreak success rates (JSRs) to surge by up to +57.25 percentage points (e.g., reverberated Kenyan-accented attack on MERaLiON). Crucially, our work further reveals that multimodal LLMs are inherently more vulnerable than unimodal systems: attackers need only exploit the weakest link (e.g., non-English audio inputs) to compromise the entire model, which we empirically show by multilingual audio-only attacks achieving 3.1x higher success rates than text-only attacks. We plan to release our dataset to spur research into cross-modal defenses, urging the community to address this expanding attack surface in multimodality as LALMs evolve",

    "abstract": "Multi-head latent attention (MLA) is designed to optimize KV cache memory through low-rank key-value joint compression. Rather than caching keys and values separately, MLA stores their compressed latent representations, reducing memory overhead while maintaining the performance. While MLA improves memory efficiency without compromising language model accuracy, its major limitation lies in its integration during the pre-training phase, requiring models to be trained from scratch. This raises a key question: can we use MLA's benefits fully or partially in models that have already been pre-trained with different attention mechanisms? In this paper, we propose X-EcoMLA to deploy post training distillation to enable the upcycling of Transformer-based attention into an efficient hybrid MLA variant through lightweight post-training adaptation, bypassing the need for extensive pre-training. We demonstrate that leveraging the dark knowledge of a well-trained model can enhance training accuracy and enable extreme KV cache compression in MLA without compromising model performance. The experimental results show that our proposed method can effectively compress the KV cache while preserving the performance on the benchmarks; specifically, for Llama3.2-1B-Instruct baseline, a 6.4× compression achieves the same average score by using only 3.6B training tokens and 70 GPU hours on AMD MI300, whereas a 10.6× compression have less than 0.1\\% average score drop with 7B training tokens and 140 GPU hours.

To address this, we construct a superior supervised fine-tuning (SFT) dataset that we use to achieve state-of-the-art coding capability results in models of various sizes. Our distilled models use only SFT to achieve 61.8% on LiveCodeBench and 24.6% on CodeContests, surpassing alternatives trained with reinforcement learning. We then perform analysis on the data sources used to construct our dataset, the impact of code execution filtering, and the importance of instruction/solution diversity.

We propose agent skill induction (ASI), which allows agents to adapt themselves by inducing, verifying, and utilizing program-based skills on the fly. We start with an evaluation on the WebArena agent benchmark and show that ASI outperforms the static baseline agent and its text-skill counterpart by 23.5% and 11.3% in success rate, mainly thanks to the programmatic verification guarantee during the induction phase. ASI also improves efficiency by reducing 10.7–15.3% of the steps over baselines, by composing primitive actions (e.g., click) into higher-level skills (e.g., search product). We then highlight the efficacy of ASI in remaining efficient and accurate under scaled-up web activities. Finally, we examine the generalizability of induced skills when transferring between websites, and find that ASI can effectively reuse common skills, while also updating incompatible skills to versatile website changes",

As chatbots evolved from rule-based systems to those powered by large language models (LLMs), evaluating the effectiveness of their personality design has become increasingly complex, particularly due to the open-ended nature of interactions. A recent and widely adopted method for assessing the personality design of LLM-based chatbots is the use of self-report questionnaires. These questionnaires, often borrowed from established human personality inventories, ask the chatbot to rate itself on various personality traits. Can LLM-based chatbots meaningfully \"self-report\" their personality? We created 500 chatbots with distinct personality designs and evaluated the validity of their self-report personality scores by examining human perceptions formed during interactions with these chatbots. Our findings indicate that the chatbot's answers on human personality scales exhibit weak correlations with both human-perceived personality traits and the overall interaction quality. These findings raise concerns about both the criterion validity and the predictive validity of self-report methods in this context. Further analysis revealed the role of task context and interaction in the chatbot's personality design assessment.

    "abstract": "Despite interpretability work analyzing VIT encoders and transformer activations, we don't yet understand why Multimodal Language Models (MLMs) struggle on perception-heavy tasks. We offer an under-studied perspective by examining how popular MLMs (LLaVA-OneVision, Qwen2.5-VL, and Llama-3-LLaVA-NeXT) process their visual key-value tokens. We first study the flow of visual information through the language model, finding that image value tokens encode sufficient information to perform several perception-heavy tasks zero-shot: segmentation, semantic correspondence, temporal correspondence, and referring expression detection. We find that while the language model does augment the visual information received from the projection of input visual encodings---which we reveal correlates with overall MLM perception capability---it contains less visual information on several tasks than the equivalent visual encoder (SigLIP) that has not undergone MLM finetuning. Further, we find that the visual information corresponding to input-agnostic image key tokens in later layers of language models contains artifacts which reduce perception capability of the overall MLM. Next, we discuss controlling visual information in the language model, showing that adding a text prefix to the image input improves perception capabilities of visual representations. Finally, we reveal that if language models were able to better control their visual information, their perception would significantly improve; e.g., in 33.3% of Art Style questions in the BLINK benchmark, perception information present in the language model is not surfaced to the output!

    "abstract": "Speculative decoding reduces the inference latency of a target large language model via utilizing a smaller and faster draft model. Its performance depends on a hyperparameter K -- the candidate length, i.e., the number of candidate tokens for the target model to verify in each round. However, previous methods often use simple heuristics to choose K, which may result in sub-optimal performance. We study the choice of the candidate length K and formulate it as a Markov Decision Process. We theoretically show that the optimal policy of this Markov decision process takes the form of a threshold policy, i.e., the current speculation should stop and be verified when the probability of getting a rejection exceeds a threshold value. Motivated by this theory, we propose SpecDec++, an enhanced version of speculative decoding that adaptively determines the candidate length on the fly. We augment the draft model with a trained acceptance prediction head to predict the conditional acceptance probability of the candidate tokens. SpecDec++ will stop the current speculation when the predicted probability that at least one token gets rejected exceeds a threshold. We implement SpecDec++ and apply it to the llama-2-chat 7B & 70B model pair. Our adaptive method achieves a 2.04x speedup on the Alpaca dataset (7.2% improvement over the baseline speculative decoding).

Models can follow user-provided instructions to generate coherent and grammatically correct outputs but in this work, we study a more fundamental question: how do we evaluate and improve the writing quality of AI-generated text? Writing quality assessment has received less attention from the community, in part because it is fundamentally subjective and requires expertise. We first introduce the Writing Quality Benchmark (WQ) by consolidating five writing-preference datasets into 4,729 writing quality judgments. Our experiments show that competitive baselines, including state-of-the-art LLMs that excel at reasoning tasks, barely outperform random baselines on WQ. We then train specialized Writing Quality Reward Models (WQRM) of various sizes for writing quality assessment that demonstrate strong generalization on four out-of-distribution test sets and 74% accuracy on the WQ benchmark.

Human evaluation with 9 experienced writers confirm that WQRM-based selection produces writing samples preferred by experts 66% overall, and 72.2% when the reward gap is larger than 1 point.

    "abstract": "Foundation models (FMs) deployed in real-world tasks such as computer-use agents must integrate diverse modalities. How good are FMs at performing *joint reasoning*, simultaneously reasoning over multiple modalities, especially when the modalities interact and relate to each other to form *cross-modal context*? To better understand this problem, we study FMs on *cross-modal conflicts*: scenarios where conflicting evidence is presented across modalities. This allows us to examine whether FMs prioritize one modality over another or reason jointly to reconcile the conflict. Our experiments reveal that FMs can recognize conflicts in *unimodal contexts*, composed of a single modality, 90% of the time, but the ratio falls as low as 3% when evidence is split across modalities -- similar observations hold in *cross-lingual contexts*, composed of multiple languages. We trace this failure to *cross-modal attention imbalance*, showing that FMs exhibit extreme asymmetry in attention scores, disproportionately prioritizing certain modalities. We show that cross-modal attention imbalance does not go away by simply scaling up multimodal or multilingual datasets blindly, since they lack training examples that explicitly require cross-modal reasoning. We demonstrate that even a simple and scalable method of explicitly combining multiple modalities within each training instance significantly reduces attention imbalance. Reduced attention imbalance directly translates to improved downstream performance on several vision-language benchmarks. Our findings underscore the importance of systematically addressing cross-modal contexts to build reliable foundation models",

    "title": "(Im)possibility of Automated Hallucination Detection in Large Language Models",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Is automated hallucination detection fundamentally possible? In this paper, we introduce a theoretical framework to rigorously study the (im)possibility of automatically detecting hallucinations produced by large language models (LLMs). Our model builds on the classical Gold-Angluin framework of language identification and its recent adaptation by Kleinberg and Mullainathan to the language generation setting. Concretely, we investigate whether an algorithm—trained on examples from an unknown target language $K$, chosen from a countable collection of languages $\\mathcal{L}$, and given access to an LLM—can reliably determine if the LLM's outputs are correct or constitute hallucinations. First, we establish a strong equivalence between hallucination detection and the classical problem of language identification. Specifically, we prove that any algorithm capable of identifying languages (in the limit) can be efficiently transformed into one that reliably detects hallucinations, and conversely, successful hallucination detection strategy inherently implies language identification. Given the notorious difficulty of language identification, our first result implies that hallucination detection is *impossible* for most collections of languages. Second, we show that once we enrich the detector's training data, i.e., providing it with both positive examples (correct statements) and negative examples (explicitly labeled incorrect statements)— the conclusion dramatically changes. Under this enriched training regime, we show that automated hallucination detection is *possible* for any countable collection $\\mathcal{L}$. Our theoretical results, thus, underscore the fundamental importance of expert-labeled feedback in the practical deployment of hallucination detection methods, reinforcing why feedback-based approaches, such as reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), have proven so crucial in improving the reliability and safety of real-world LLMs",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited extraordinary performance in a variety of tasks, while it remains challenging for them to solve complex multi-step tasks as agents. In practice, agents are sensitive to the outcome of certain key steps, which makes them likely to fail the task because of a subtle mistake in the planning trajectory. Recent approaches resort to calibrating the reasoning process through reinforcement learning. They reward or penalize every reasoning step with process supervision, known as Process Reward Models (PRMs). However, PRMs are difficult and costly to scale up with a large number of next action candidates since they require extensive computations to acquire the training data through per-step trajectory exploration. To mitigate this issue, we focus on the relative reward trend across successive reasoning steps and propose maintaining an increasing reward in the collected trajectories for process supervision, which we term Reward Rising Optimization (RRO). Specifically, we incrementally augment the process supervision until we identify a step exhibiting positive reward differentials, i.e., rising rewards, relative to its preceding iteration. This method dynamically expands the search space for the next action candidates, efficiently capturing high-quality data. We provide mathematical groundings and empirical results on the WebShop and InterCode-SQL benchmarks, showing that our proposed RRO method achieves superior performance while requiring much less exploration cost",

On 41 QA benchmarks, our single-pass scanner consistently outperforms chunk-based embedding methods and competes with large language models at a fraction of the computational cost. By conditioning on the entire preceding context without chunk breaks, the method preserves global coherence, which is especially important for long documents.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in open-domain question answering (QA), but their reliance on knowledge learned during pretraining limits their ability to provide accurate and up-to-date information. Knowledge Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) enhances LLMs by incorporating structured knowledge from knowledge graphs (KGs). A common approach in KG-RAG is to retrieve relevant knowledge paths starting from entities in the input question and expanding along KG edges by LLM reasoning. However, existing KG-RAG methods suffer from the challenge that retrieval is performed step by step greedily using only local graph context, which can lead to retrieval errors that prematurely discard essential paths. To address the issue and perform more accurate retrieval, we propose GGR (GNN-Guided Retrieval for LLM Reasoning), a novel GNN-enhanced KG-RAG framework that integrates graph-based relevance scoring into the retrieval process. Our approach computes global importance scores across a contextualized subgraph, ensuring that key reasoning knowledge paths are preserved, even if their local relevance appears weak. Additionally, we introduce local semantic alignment by incorporating query-relation semantic similarity, refining the relation selection of LLM. Extensive experiments on Question-Answering tasks demonstrate that our method significantly improves retrieval accuracy and answer quality, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining graph-based reasoning and LLM-driven retrieval for structured knowledge integration",

Evaluating web agents trajectories is an important problem, since it helps us determine whether the agent successfully completed the tasks. Rule-based methods are widely used for this purpose, but they are challenging to extend to new tasks and may not always recognize successful trajectories. We may achieve higher accuracy through human evaluation, but the process would be substantially slower and more expensive. Automatic evaluations with LLMs may avoid the challenges of designing new rules and manually annotating trajectories, enabling faster and cost-effective evaluation. However, it is unclear how effective they are at evaluating web agents. To this end, we propose AgentRewardBench, the first benchmark to assess the effectiveness of LLM judges for evaluating web agents. AgentRewardBench contains 1302 trajectories across 5 benchmarks and 4 LLMs. Each trajectory in AgentRewardBench is reviewed by an expert, who answers questions pertaining to the success, side effects, and repetitiveness of the agent. Using our benchmark, we evaluate 12 LLM judges and find that no single LLM excels across all benchmarks. We also find that the rule-based evaluation used by common benchmarks tends to underreport the success rate of web agents, highlighting a key weakness of rule-based evaluation and the need to develop more flexible automatic evaluations.

We introduce a suite of quantitative assessments to compare different weakness profiling methods. We also introduce a weakness profiling method EvalTree. EvalTree constructs a capability tree where each node represents a capability described in natural language and is linked to a subset of benchmark instances that specifically evaluate this capability; it then extracts nodes where the LM performs poorly to generate a weakness profile. On the MATH and WildChat benchmarks, we show that EvalTree outperforms baseline weakness profiling methods by identifying weaknesses more precisely and comprehensively. Weakness profiling further enables weakness-guided data collection, and training data collection guided by EvalTree-identified weaknesses improves LM performance more than other data collection strategies. We also show how EvalTree exposes flaws in Chatbot Arena's human-voter-based evaluation practice. To facilitate future work, we provide an interface that allows practitioners to interactively explore the capability trees built by EvalTree",

It predicts that SLMs require much more compute and data compared to text, leading some to question the feasibility of training high-quality SLMs. However, modern SLMs are often initialised from pre-trained TextLMs using speech-text interleaving to allow knowledge transfer. This raises the question - \"Do interleaved SLMs scale more efficiently than textless-SLMs?\" In this paper we answer a resounding yes! We conduct scaling analysis of interleaved SLMs by training several dozen and analysing the scaling trends. We see that under this setup SLMs scale more efficiently with compute. Additionally, our results indicate that the scaling dynamics significantly differ from textless-SLMs, suggesting one should allocate notably more of the compute budget to increasing model size over training tokens. We also study the role of synthetic data and TextLM model families in unlocking this potential. Results suggest that our scaled up model achieves comparable semantic speech performance to leading models, while using less compute and data.

We may want models to output refusal messages for various categories of user queries, for example, ill-posed questions, instructions for committing illegal acts, or queries which require information past the model's knowledge horizon. Engineering models that refuse to answer such questions is complicated by the fact that an individual may want their model to exhibit varying levels of sensitivity for refusing queries of various categories, and different users may want different refusal rates. The current default approach involves training multiple models with varying proportions of refusal messages from each category to achieve the desired refusal rates, which is computationally expensive and may require training a new model to accommodate each user's desired preference over refusal rates. To address these challenges, we propose refusal tokens, one such token for each refusal category or a single refusal token, which are prepended to the model's responses during training. We then show how to increase or decrease the probability of generating the refusal token for each category during inference to steer the model's refusal behavior. Refusal tokens enable controlling a single model's refusal rates without the need of any further fine-tuning, but only by selectively intervening during generation",

In this work, we introduce a probing framework to systematically analyze how MLLMs process visual and textual inputs across layers. We train linear classifiers to predict fine-grained visual categories (e.g., dog breeds) from token embeddings extracted at each layer, using a standardized anchor question. To uncover the functional roles of different layers, we evaluate these probes under three types of controlled prompt variations: (1) lexical variants that test sensitivity to surface-level changes, (2) semantic negation variants that flip the expected answer by modifying the visual concept in the prompt, and (3) output format variants that preserve reasoning but alter the answer format. Applying our framework to LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-Next-LLaMA-3, and Qwen2-VL, we identify a consistent stage-wise structure in which early layers perform visual grounding, middle layers support lexical integration and semantic reasoning, and final layers prepare task-specific outputs. We further show that while the overall stage-wise structure remains stable across variations in visual tokenization, instruction tuning data, and pretraining corpus, the specific layer allocation to each stage shifts notably with changes in the base LLM architecture. Our findings provide a unified perspective on the layer-wise organization of MLLMs and offer a lightweight, model-agnostic approach for analyzing multimodal representation dynamics",

Conversely, training-free methods struggle with limited context lengths, making it difficult to incorporate all the policies comprehensively. To overcome these limitations, we propose to condition model's judgment on \"precedents\", which are the reasoning processes of prior data points similar to the given input. By leveraging precedents instead of fixed policies, our approach greatly enhances the flexibility and adaptability of the guardrail. In this paper, we introduce a critique-revise mechanism for collecting high-quality precedents and two strategies that utilize precedents for robust prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous methods across both few-shot and full-dataset scenarios and exhibits superior generalization to novel policies",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We explore the application of large language models (LLMs) to empower domain experts in integrating large, heterogeneous, and noisy urban spatial datasets. Traditional rule-based integration methods are unable to cover all edge cases, requiring manual verification and repair. Machine learning approaches require collecting and labeling of large numbers of task-specific samples. In this study, we investigate the potential of LLMs for spatial data integration. Our analysis first considers how LLMs reason about environmental spatial relationships mediated by human experience, such as between roads and sidewalks. We show that while LLMs exhibit spatial reasoning capabilities, they struggle to connect the macro-scale environment with the relevant computational geometry tasks, often producing logically incoherent responses. But when provided relevant features, thereby reducing dependence on spatial reasoning, LLMs are able to generate high-performing results. We then adapt a review-and-refine method, which proves remarkably effective in correcting erroneous initial responses while preserving accurate responses. We discuss practical implications of employing LLMs for spatial data integration in real-world contexts and outline future research directions, including post-training, multi-modal integration methods, and support for diverse data formats. Our findings position LLMs as a promising and flexible alternative to traditional rule-based heuristics, advancing the capabilities of adaptive spatial data integration",

    "title": "What is the Visual Cognition Gap between Humans and Multimodal LLMs?",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown great promise in language-guided perceptual tasks such as recognition, segmentation, and object detection. However, their effectiveness in addressing visual cognition problems that require high-level multi-image reasoning and visual working memory is not well-established. One such challenge is matrix reasoning -- the cognitive ability to discern relationships among patterns in a set of images and extrapolate to predict subsequent patterns. This skill is crucial during the early neurodevelopmental stages of children. Inspired by the matrix reasoning tasks in Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) and Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC), we propose a new dataset MaRs-VQA to evaluate the visual cognition capability of MLLMs and compare their performance with existing human visual cognition studies. Based on the training data of MaRs-VQA, we also finetune a baseline model Qwen2-VCog with multi-stage cognition reasoning annotations. Our comparative experiments with different baselines reveal a gap between MLLMs and human intelligence, highlighting the visual cognitive limitations of current MLLMs. We believe that the public release of MaRs-VQA and the Qwen2-VCog baseline model will drive progress toward the next generation of MLLMs with human-like visual cognition abilities.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Reasoning language models have shown an uncanny ability to improve performance at test-time by ``thinking longer''—that is, by generating longer chain-of-thought sequences and hence using more compute. However, the length of their chain-of-thought reasoning is not controllable, making it impossible to allocate test-time compute to achieve a desired level of performance. We introduce Length Controlled Policy Optimization (LCPO), a simple reinforcement learning method that optimizes for accuracy and adherence to user-specified length constraints. We use LCPO to train L1, a reasoning language model that produces outputs satisfying a length constraint given in its prompt. L1's length control allows for smoothly trading off computational cost and accuracy on a wide range of tasks, and outperforms the state-of-the-art S1 method for length control. Furthermore, we uncover an unexpected short chain-of-thought capability in models trained with LCPO. Specifically, using LCPO we derive Short Reasoning Models (SRMs), that exhibit similar reasoning patterns as full-length reasoning models, but can generate CoT lengths comparable to non-reasoning models. They demonstrate significant performance gains, for instance, our 1.5B L1 model surpasses GPT-4o at equal reasoning lengths. Overall, LCPO enables precise control over reasoning length, allowing for fine-grained allocation of test-time compute and accuracy",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive investigation into the decay mechanisms inherent in linear complexity sequence models. We systematically delineate the design space of decay mechanisms across four pivotal dimensions: parameterization strategy, which refers to the computational methodology for decay; parameter sharing, which involves the utilization of supplementary parameters for decay computation; decay granularity. comparing scalar versus vector-based decay; and compatibility with relative positional encoding methods, such as Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE). Through an extensive series of experiments conducted on diverse language modeling tasks, we uncovered several critical insights. Firstly, the design of the parameterization strategy for decay requires meticulous consideration. Our findings indicate that effective configurations are typically confined to a specific range of parameters. Secondly, parameter sharing cannot be used arbitrarily, as it may cause decay values to be too large or too small, thereby significantly impacting performance. Thirdly, under identical parameterization strategies, scalar decay generally underperforms compared to its vector-based counterpart. However, in certain scenarios with alternative parameterization strategies, scalar decay may unexpectedly surpass vector decay in efficacy. Lastly, our analysis reveals that RoPE, a commonly employed relative positional encoding method, typically fails to provide tangible benefits to the majority of linear attention mechanisms",

    "abstract": "Large language models, while groundbreaking, are computationally expensive and difficult to deploy in resource-constrained settings. To address this challenge, small language models have emerged, but their performance critically depends on the quality and composition of the pretraining datasets—yet many recent models, such as Qwen2.5-1.5B and Llama3.2-1B, remain opaque about their training data, limiting reproducibility and scientific understanding. In this paper, we document and publicly release SmolLM2, a fully transparent state-of-the-art ``small'' (1.7 billion parameter) language model (LM), along with its training datasets and code. To attain strong performance, we overtrain SmolLM2 on 11 trillion tokens of data using a multi-stage training process that mixes web text with specialized math, code, and instruction-following data. We additionally curate and release new specialized datasets (FineMath, Stack-Edu, and SmolTalk) at stages where we found existing datasets to be problematically small or low-quality. To inform our design decisions, we perform both small-scale ablations and a manual refinement process that updates the dataset mixing rates at each stage based on the performance at the previous one. Ultimately, we demonstrate that SmolLM2 outperforms other recent small LMs including Qwen2.5-1.5B, Llama3.2-1B, and Falcon3-1.6B. By releasing our model, datasets, and code, we aim to facilitate future research on LM development as well as applications of small LMs",

We identify code comprehension and repair as a natural testbed and challenge task for long-context models and introduce **LongCodeBench** (**LCB**), a benchmark to test LLM coding abilities in long-context scenarios. Our benchmark tests both the comprehension and repair capabilities of LCLMs in realistic and important settings by drawing from real-world GitHub issues and constructing QA (**LongCodeQA**) and bug fixing (**LongSWE-Bench**) tasks.

However, it has gone unexamined whether these evaluation methods have convergent validity, that is, whether their results align. Therefore, we conduct a systematic meta-evaluation of these methods across three existing datasets for LLM misgendering. We propose a method to transform each dataset to enable parallel probability- and generation-based evaluation. Then, by automatically evaluating a suite of 6 models from 3 families, we find that these methods can disagree with each other at the instance, dataset, and model levels, conflicting on 20.2% of evaluation instances. Finally, with a human evaluation of 2400 LLM generations, we show that misgendering behaviour is complex and goes far beyond pronouns, which automatic evaluations are not currently designed to capture, suggesting essential disagreement with human evaluations. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for future evaluations of LLM misgendering. Our results are also more widely relevant, as they call into question broader methodological conventions in LLM evaluation, which often assume that different evaluation methods agree",

During data generation, each agent is repeatedly sampled to form a multi-agent search tree, where final outputs are graded against ground-truth data. We then apply value iteration to propagate reward signals back to each role-conditioned model, automatically producing multi-agent post-training data without human or teacher-model supervision. Our off-policy approach allows each agent to specialize by learning from correct and incorrect trajectories, ultimately improving the end-to-end reasoning chain. On MATH, GSM8K, and CSQA, MALT surpasses the same baseline LLM with relative improvements of 15.66%, 7.42%, and 9.40%.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values is an increasingly critical step in post-training. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a simple, yet effective alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Synthetic preference data with its low cost and high quality enable effective alignment through single- or multi-model generated preference data. Our study reveals a striking, safety-specific phenomenon associated with DPO alignment: Although multi-model generated data enhances performance on general tasks (ARC, Hellaswag, MMLU, TruthfulQA, Winogrande) by providing diverse responses, it also tends to facilitate reward hacking during training. This can lead to a high attack success rate (ASR) when models encounter jailbreaking prompts. The issue is particularly pronounced when employing stronger models like GPT-4o or larger models in the same family to generate chosen responses paired with target model self-generated rejected responses, resulting in dramatically poorer safety outcomes. Furthermore, with respect to safety, using solely self-generated responses (single-model generation) for both chosen and rejected pairs significantly outperforms configurations that incorporate responses from stronger models, whether used directly as chosen data or as part of a multi-model response pool. We demonstrate that multi-model preference data exhibits high linear separability between chosen and rejected responses, which allows models to exploit superficial cues rather than internalizing robust safety constraints. Our experiments, conducted on models from the Llama, Mistral, and Qwen families, consistently validate these findings.

    "abstract": "To alleviate the computational burden of large language models (LLMs), architectures with activation sparsity, represented by mixture-of-experts (MoE), have attracted increasing attention. However, the non-differentiable and inflexible routing of vanilla MoE hurts model performance. Moreover, while each token activates only a few parameters, these sparsely-activated architectures exhibit low chunk-level sparsity, indicating that the union of multiple consecutive tokens activates a large ratio of parameters. Such a sparsity pattern is unfriendly for acceleration under low-resource conditions (e.g., end-side devices) and incompatible with mainstream acceleration techniques (e.g., speculative decoding). To address these challenges, we introduce a novel MoE architecture, BlockFFN, as well as its efficient training and deployment techniques. Specifically, we use a router integrating ReLU activation and RMSNorm for differentiable and flexible routing. Next, to promote both token-level sparsity (TLS) and chunk-level sparsity (CLS), CLS-aware training objectives are designed, making BlockFFN more acceleration-friendly. Finally, we implement efficient acceleration kernels, combining activation sparsity and speculative decoding for the first time. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of BlockFFN over other MoE baselines, achieving over 80\\% TLS and 70\\% 8-token CLS.

Specifically, generating repetitive tokens or fixed phrases requires fewer layers, whereas producing tokens involving computation or high uncertainty requires more layers. Despite the computational savings, FlexiDepth does not yet achieve wall-clock speedup due to varied skipping patterns and I/O overhead.

This study systematically evaluates 36 CPT configurations involving three multilingual base models, across 30+ languages categorized as altruistic, selfish, and stagnant, spanning various resource levels.

(2) Including programming code data during CPT consistently enhances multilingual classification accuracy and language modeling capabilities, particularly benefiting low-resource languages, but introduces a trade-off by slightly degrading generation quality.

Hyperpower methods offer rigorous convergence guarantees for matrix inverse approximation, but their matrix multiplication operations typically involve intractable memory and computation costs for large-scale models. We propose HyperINF, an efficient and accurate influence function approximation leveraging the hyperpower HyperINF, specifically Schulz's iterative algorithm. To address computation-intensive matrix multiplication, we incorporate generalized Fisher information (GFIM) as a low-rank Hessian matrix approximation, reducing memory and computation overhead to constant costs. Through comprehensive convergence simulations on matrix inversion, we demonstrate HyperINF's superior accuracy and stability compared to baselines. We further validate its efficacy through extensive real-world data attribution tasks, including mislabeled data detection and data selection for LLM and VLM fine-tuning. On LoRA-tuned models, HyperINF achieves superior downstream performance with minimal memory and computational overhead, while other approaches suffer significant degradation.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In-Context Learning (ICL) is an intriguing ability of large language models (LLMs). Despite a substantial amount of work on its behavioral aspects and how it emerges in miniature setups, it remains unclear which mechanism assembles task information from the individual examples in a fewshot prompt. We use causal interventions to identify information flow in Gemma-2 2B for five naturalistic ICL tasks. We find that the model infers task information using a two-step strategy we call contextualize-then-aggregate: In the lower layers, the model builds up representations of individual fewshot examples, which are contextualized by preceding examples through connections between fewshot input and output tokens across the sequence. In the higher layers, these representations are aggregated to identify the task and prepare prediction of the next output. The importance of the contextualization step differs between tasks, and it may become more important in the presence of ambiguous examples. Overall, by providing rigorous causal analysis, our results shed light on the mechanisms through which ICL happens in language models",

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offers a promising alternative by conditioning caption generation on retrieved examples in the target language, reducing the need for extensive multilingual training. However, multilingual RAG captioning models often depend on retrieved captions translated from English, which can introduce mismatches and linguistic biases relative to the source language. We introduce CONCAP, a multilingual image captioning model that integrates retrieved captions with image-specific concepts, enhancing the contextualization of the input image and grounding the captioning process across different languages.

    "abstract": "LLM-based intelligent agents face significant deployment challenges, particularly related to resource management. Allowing unrestricted access to LLM or tool resources can lead to inefficient or even potentially harmful resource allocation and utilization for agents. Furthermore, the absence of proper scheduling and resource management mechanisms in current agent designs hinders concurrent processing and limits overall system efficiency. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the architecture of AIOS (LLM-based AI Agent Operating System) under the context of managing LLM-based agents. It introduces a novel architecture for serving LLM-based agents by isolating resources and LLM-specific services from agent applications into an AIOS kernel. This AIOS kernel provides fundamental services (e.g., scheduling, context management, memory management, storage management, access control) for runtime agents. To enhance usability, AIOS also includes an AIOS SDK, a comprehensive suite of APIs designed for utilizing functionalities provided by the AIOS kernel. Experimental results demonstrate that using AIOS can achieve up to $2.1\\times$ faster execution for serving agents built by various agent frameworks.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable in real-world applications. However, their widespread adoption raises significant safety concerns, particularly in responding to socially harmful questions. Despite substantial efforts to improve model safety through alignment, aligned models can still have their safety protections undermined by subsequent fine-tuning—even when the additional training data appears benign. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from the sensitivity of safety-critical low-rank subspaces in LLM parameters to fine-tuning. Building on this insight, we propose a novel training-free method, termed Low-Rank Extrapolation (LoX), to enhance safety robustness by extrapolating the safety subspace of an aligned LLM. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness of LoX, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against both benign and malicious fine-tuning attacks while preserving the model's adaptability to new tasks. For instance, LoX leads to 11% to 54% absolute reductions in attack success rates (ASR) facing benign or malicious fine-tuning attacks. By investigating the ASR landscape of parameters, we attribute the success of LoX to that the extrapolation moves LLM parameters to a flatter zone, thereby less sensitive to perturbations.

First, we highlight the importance of addressing annotation errors and ambiguity in datasets, demonstrating that approximately 16\\% of ambiguous or incorrectly labeled data substantially influences model rankings. Neglecting this issue may result in misleading conclusions during comparative evaluations, and we suggest using a systematic pipeline utilizing LLM-as-a-judge to help identify these issues at scale. Second, we discover that frontier LLMs with few-shot in-context examples, often overlooked in previous works, achieve top-tier performance. We therefore recommend that future studies include comparisons with these simple yet highly effective baselines. Lastly, despite their effectiveness, frontier LLMs incur substantial costs, motivating the development of small, fine-tuned fact verifiers.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as an influential technique, enabling the alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, how to protect user preference privacy has become a crucial issue, as LLMs tend to remember users' preferences. Most previous work has focused on using differential privacy (DP) to protect the privacy of individual data. However, they have concentrated primarily on item-level privacy protection and have unsatisfactory performance for user-level privacy, which is more common in RLHF. This study proposes a novel framework, AUP-RLHF, which integrates user-level label DP into RLHF. We first show that the classical random response algorithm, which achieves an acceptable performance in item-level privacy, leads to suboptimal utility when in the user-level settings. We then establish a lower bound for the user-level label DP-RLHF and develop the AUP-RLHF algorithm, which guarantees $(\\varepsilon, \\delta)$ user-level privacy and achieves an improved estimation error. Experimental results show that AUP-RLHF outperforms existing baseline methods in sentiment generation and summarization tasks, achieving a better privacy-utility trade-off",

Our experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning, scientific question answering, and language understanding benchmarks show that MeMAD achieves significant accuracy gains (up to 3.3\\% over conventional MAD baselines) without parameter updates.

However, existing techniques overlook the prevalence of noise in synthetic preference annotations in the form of stylistic and length biases. To this end, we introduce a hard-negative response generation framework based on LLM-guided response editing, that produces rejected responses with targeted errors, maintaining stylistic and length similarity to the accepted ones. Using this framework, we develop the VaPR dataset, comprising 30K high-quality samples, to finetune three LVLM families: LLaVA-V1.5, Qwen2VL \\& Qwen2.5VL (2B-13B sizes). Our VaPR models deliver significant performance improvements across ten benchmarks, achieving average gains of 6.5% (LLaVA), 4.0% (Qwen2VL), and 1.5% (Qwen2.5VL), with notable improvements on reasoning tasks. A scaling analysis shows that performance consistently improves with data size, with LLaVA models benefiting even at smaller scales. Moreover, VaPR reduces the tendency to answer \"Yes\" in binary questions - addressing a common failure mode in LVLMs like LLaVA. Lastly, we show that the framework generalizes to open-source LLMs as editors, with models trained on VaPR-OS achieving ~99% of the performance of models trained on VaPR, which is synthesized using GPT-4o.

    "abstract": "The assumption across nearly all language model (LM) tokenization schemes is that tokens should be subwords, i.e., contained within word boundaries. While providing a seemingly reasonable inductive bias, is this common practice limiting the potential of modern LMs? Whitespace is not a reliable delimiter of meaning, as evidenced by multi-word expressions (e.g., \"by the way\"), crosslingual variation in the number of words needed to express a concept (e.g., \"spacesuit helmet\" in German is \"raumanzughelm\"), and languages that do not use whitespace at all (e.g., Chinese). To explore the potential of tokenization beyond subwords, we introduce a \"superword\" tokenizer, SuperBPE, which incorporates a simple pretokenization curriculum into the byte-pair encoding (BPE) algorithm to first learn subwords, then superwords that bridge whitespace. This brings dramatic improvements in encoding efficiency: when fixing the vocabulary size to 200k, SuperBPE encodes a fixed piece of text with up to 33% fewer tokens than BPE on average. In experiments, we pretrain 8B transformer LMs from scratch while fixing the model size, vocabulary size, and train compute, varying *only* the algorithm for learning the vocabulary. Our model trained with SuperBPE achieves an average +4.0% absolute improvement over the BPE baseline across 30 downstream tasks (including +8.2% on MMLU), while simultaneously requiring 27% less compute at inference time. In analysis, we find that SuperBPE results in segmentations of text that are more uniform in per-token difficulty. Qualitatively, this may be because SuperBPE tokens often capture common multi-word expressions that function semantically as a single unit. SuperBPE is a straightforward, local modification to tokenization that improves both encoding efficiency and downstream performance, yielding better language models overall",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved widespread adoption across numerous applications. However, many LLMs are vulnerable to malicious attacks even after safety alignment. These attacks typically bypass LLMs' safety guardrails by wrapping the original malicious instructions inside adversarial jailbreaks prompts. Previous research has proposed methods such as adversarial training and prompt rephrasing to mitigate these safety vulnerabilities, but these methods often reduce the utility of LLMs or lead to significant computational overhead and online latency. In this paper, we propose SecurityLingua, an effective and efficient approach to defend LLMs against jailbreak attacks via security-oriented prompt compression. Specifically, we train a prompt compressor designed to discern the \"true intention\" of the input prompt, with a particular focus on detecting the malicious intentions of adversarial prompts. Then, in addition to the original prompt, the intention is passed via the system prompt to the target LLM to help it identify the true intention of the request. SecurityLingua ensures a consistent user experience by leaving the original input prompt intact while revealing the user's potentially malicious intention and stimulating the built-in safety guardrails of the LLM. Moreover, thanks to prompt compression, SecurityLingua incurs only a negligible overhead and extra token cost compared to all existing defense methods, making it an especially practical solution for LLM defense. Experimental results demonstrate that SecurityLingua can effectively defend against malicious attacks and maintain utility of the LLM with negligible compute and latency overhead.

    "abstract": "Test-time inference has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enabling language models to ``think'' longer and more carefully about complex challenges, much like skilled human experts. While reinforcement learning (RL) can drive self-improvement in language models on verifiable tasks, some models exhibit substantial gains while others quickly plateau. For instance, we find that Qwen-2.5-3B far exceeds Llama-3.2-3B under identical RL training for the game of Countdown. This discrepancy raises a critical question: what intrinsic properties enable effective self-improvement? We introduce a framework to investigate this question by analyzing four key cognitive behaviors --- verification, backtracking, subgoal setting, and backward chaining --- that both expert human problem solvers and successful language models employ. Our study reveals that Qwen naturally exhibits these reasoning behaviors, whereas Llama initially lacks them. In systematic experimentation with controlled behavioral datasets, we find that priming Llama with examples containing these reasoning behaviors enables substantial improvements during RL, matching or exceeding Qwen's performance. Importantly, the presence of reasoning behaviors, rather than correctness of answers, proves to be the critical factor --- models primed with incorrect solutions containing proper reasoning patterns achieve comparable performance to those trained on correct solutions. Finally, leveraging continued pretraining with OpenWebMath data, filtered to amplify reasoning behaviors, enables the Llama model to match Qwen's self-improvement trajectory. Our findings establish a fundamental relationship between initial reasoning behaviors and the capacity for improvement, explaining why some language models effectively utilize additional computation while others plateau",

However, its efficiency remains a challenge due to excessive intermediate reasoning tokens, which introduce both semantic redundancy and unnecessarily detailed reasoning steps. Moreover, the computational expense and latency remain high, as the cost is determined by the number of output tokens, which encompasses these intermediate steps. In this work, we observe that most CoT tokens are unnecessary, and retaining only a small portion of them is sufficient for high-quality responses. Inspired by this, we propose Hawkeye, a novel post-training and inference framework where a large model produce concise CoT instructions to guide a smaller model in response generation. Hawkeye quantifies redundancy in CoT reasoning and distills high-density information via reinforcement learning. By leveraging these concise CoTs, Hawkeye is able to expand responses while reducing token usage and computational cost significantly. Our evaluation results show that Hawkeye can achieve comparable response quality using only 35\\% of the complete CoTs while improving clarity, coherence, and conciseness by approximately 10\\%.

To address this issue, we leverage this metric to construct a repository-level dataset where each retrieved chunk is labeled as positive, neutral, or negative based on its relevance to the target completion. We then propose an adaptive retrieval context filtering framework, CODEFILTER, trained on this dataset to mitigate the harmful effects of negative retrieved contexts in code completion. Extensive evaluation on the RepoEval and CrossCodeLongEval benchmarks demonstrates that CODEFILTER consistently improves completion accuracy compared to approaches without filtering operations across various tasks. Additionally, CODEFILTER significantly reduces the length of the input prompt, enhancing computational efficiency while exhibiting strong generalizability across different models. These results underscore the potential of CODEFILTER to enhance the accuracy, efficiency, and attributability of repository-level code completion",

    "abstract": "Current efforts in building large language models (LLMs) based general-purpose text retrieval models primarily focus on architectural design and training data scaling. However, significant challenges remain in effectively modeling diverse retrieval tasks and domains, including multi-task conflict, data imbalance, and training efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a novel phased training framework for text retrieval, featuring: (1) robust foundation modeling with core relevance data, (2) progressive specialization through modular task adaptation, and (3) knowledge fusion via weight interpolation based model merging. This framework simultaneously optimizes both embedding and reranking models through a unified architecture. We also present an efficient yet scalable data synthesis pipeline to expand training data, based on open-source LLMs. These synthetic data can be efficiently incorporated into the phased training framework, enhancing model performance. We identify five distinct types of retrieval tasks, \\ie basic relevance retrieval, code retrieval, tool retrieval, complex instruction-based retrieval, as well as reasoning-intensive retrieval, conducting extensive experiments. Our method achieves the best performance across MTEB and various retrieval benchmarks of the five task types. Further analysis demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed training framework and data synthesis pipeline",

    "abstract": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language tasks but also pose significant risks of generating harmful content, particularly through jailbreak attacks. Jailbreak attacks refer to intentional manipulations that bypass safety mechanisms in models, leading to the generation of inappropriate or unsafe content. Detecting such attacks is critical to ensuring the responsible deployment of MLLMs. Existing jailbreak detection methods face three primary challenges: (1) Many rely on model hidden states or gradients, limiting their applicability to white-box models, where the internal workings of the model are accessible; (2) They involve high computational overhead from uncertainty-based analysis, which limits real-time detection, and (3) They require fully labeled harmful datasets, which are often scarce in real-world settings. To address these issues, we introduce a test-time adaptive framework called JailDAM. Our method leverages a memory-based approach guided by policy-driven unsafe knowledge representations, eliminating the need for explicit exposure to harmful data. By dynamically updating unsafe knowledge during test-time, our framework improves generalization to unseen jailbreak strategies while maintaining efficiency. Experiments on multiple VLM jailbreak benchmarks demonstrate that JailDAM delivers state-of-the-art performance in harmful content detection, improving both accuracy and speed",

One key desirable capability for speech language models is the ability to capture the intricate interdependency between content and prosody. The existing mainstream paradigm of training speech language models, which converts speech into discrete tokens before feeding them into LLMs, is sub-optimal in learning prosody information --- we find that the resulting LLMs do not exhibit obvious emerging prosody processing capabilities via pre-training alone. To overcome this, we propose ProsodyLM, which introduces a simple tokenization scheme amenable to learning prosody. Each speech utterance is first transcribed into text, followed by a sequence of word-level prosody tokens. Compared with conventional speech tokenization schemes, the proposed tokenization scheme retains more complete prosody information, and is more understandable to text-based LLMs. We find that ProsodyLM can learn surprisingly diverse emerging prosody processing capabilities through pre-training alone, ranging from harnessing the prosody nuances in generated speech, such as contrastive focus, understanding emotion and stress in an utterance, to maintaining prosody consistency in long contexts",

We present BASIS (Bootstrapping Assistant modeling with Situated Interaction Simulation), a novel framework that fundamentally rethinks how visual assistants are developed and evaluated. Rather than relying on expensive human data collection, BASIS leverages simulation to bootstrap capable assistants through three interconnected stages: (1) Situated Interaction Simulation generates high-quality synthetic data through interactions between oracle assistants and simulated users; (2) Autonomous Model Development trains and continuously evaluates assistant models using this synthetic data; and (3) Real-User Validation verifies effectiveness with human users. We implement BASIS in Alexa Arena and demonstrate that our best model—despite being fine-tuned solely on synthetic data and operating under realistic perception conditions—enables real human users to achieve a 72.9% success rate, approaching the 88.6% performance of an oracle assistant with access to privileged information of perfect perception. Through detailed error analysis, we identify object identification as the primary bottleneck for current visual assistants. Our approach successfully bridges the gap between simulation and reality, establishing a scalable pipeline for developing assistants that can effectively guide users through complex tasks.

    "abstract": "Aligning large language models (LLMs) through supervised fine-tuning is essential for tailoring them to specific applications. Recent studies suggest that alignment primarily adjusts a model's presentation style rather than its foundational knowledge, indicating that only certain components of the model are significantly impacted. To uncover how alignment affects model behavior at a granular level, we propose identifying which layers within LLMs are most critical to the alignment process. Our approach, named ILA, involves learning a binary mask for the parameter changes in each layer during alignment, as an indicator of layer significance. Experimental results reveal that, despite substantial differences in alignment datasets, the important layers of a model identified by ILA exhibit nearly 90\\% overlap, highlighting fundamental patterns in LLM alignment. The results also indicate that freezing non-essential layers improves overall model performance, while selectively tuning the most critical layers significantly enhances fine-tuning efficiency with minimal performance loss.

    "title": "EnrichIndex: Using LLMs to Enrich Retrieval Indices Offline",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Existing information retrieval systems excel in cases where the language of target documents closely matches that of the user query. However, real-world retrieval systems are often required to *implicitly reason* whether a document is relevant. For example, when retrieving technical texts or tables, their relevance to the user query may be implied through a particular jargon or structure, rather than explicitly expressed in their content. Large language models (LLMs) hold great potential in identifying such implied relevance by leveraging their reasoning skills. Nevertheless, current LLM-augmented retrieval is hindered by high latency and computation cost, as the LLM typically computes the query-document relevance *online*, for every query anew. To tackle this issue we introduce EnrichIndex, a retrieval approach which instead uses the LLM *offline* to build semantically-enriched retrieval indices, by performing a single pass over all documents in the retrieval corpus once during ingestion time. Furthermore, the semantically-enriched indices can complement existing online retrieval approaches, boosting the performance of LLM re-rankers. We evaluated EnrichIndex on five retrieval tasks, involving passages and tables, and found that it outperforms strong online LLM-based retrieval systems, with an average improvement of 11.7 points in recall @ 10 and 10.6 points in NDCG @ 10 compared to strong baselines. In terms of online calls to the LLM, it processes 293.3 times fewer tokens which greatly reduces the online latency and cost. Overall, EnrichIndex is an effective way to build better retrieval indices offline by leveraging the strong reasoning skills of LLMs",

    "abstract": "Fine-tuning large pre-trained LLMs generally demands extensive GPU memory. Traditional first-order optimizers like SGD encounter substantial difficulties due to increased memory requirements from storing activations and gradients during both the forward and backward phases as the model size expands. Alternatively, zeroth-order (ZO) techniques can compute gradients using just forward operations, eliminating the need to store activations. Furthermore, by leveraging CPU capabilities, it's feasible to enhance both the memory and processing power available to a single GPU. We propose a novel framework, ZO2 (Zeroth-Order Offloading), for efficient zeroth-order fine-tuning of LLMs with only limited GPU memory. Our framework dynamically shifts model parameters between the CPU and GPU as required, optimizing computation flow and maximizing GPU usage by minimizing downtime. This integration of parameter adjustments with ZO's double forward operations reduces unnecessary data movement, enhancing the fine-tuning efficacy. Additionally, our framework supports an innovative low-bit precision approach in AMP (Automatic Mixed Precision) mode to streamline data exchanges between the CPU and GPU. Employing this approach allows us to fine-tune extraordinarily large models, such as the OPT-175B with 175 billion parameters, on a mere 18GB GPU. Moreover, our framework achieves these results with almost no additional time overhead and absolutely no accuracy loss compared to standard zeroth-order methods.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly capable of simulating human behavior, offering cost-effective ways to estimate user responses during the early phases of survey design. While previous studies have examined whether models can reflect individual opinions or attitudes, we argue that a higher-order binding of virtual personas requires successfully approximating not only the opinions of a user as an identified member of a group, but also the nuanced ways in which that user perceives and evaluates those outside the group. In particular, faithfully simulating how humans perceive different social groups is critical for applying LLMs to various political science studies, including timely topics on polarization dynamics, inter-group conflict, and democratic backsliding. To this end, we propose a novel methodology for constructing virtual personas with synthetic user \"backstories\" generated as extended, multi-turn interview transcripts. Our generated backstories are longer, rich in detail, and consistent in authentically describing a singular individual, compared to previous methods. We show that virtual personas conditioned on our backstories closely replicate human response distributions (up to an 87% improvement as measured by Wasserstein Distance) and produce effect sizes that closely match those observed in the original studies. Altogether, our work extends the applicability of LLMs beyond estimating individual self-opinions, enabling their use in a broader range of human studies",

While many studies highlight that large multimodal language models (MLMs) struggle to reason about space, they only focus on static spatial relationships and not dynamic awareness of motion and space---i.e. reasoning about the effect of egocentric and object motions on spatial relationships. Manually annotating such object and camera movements is expensive. Hence, we introduce SAT, a simulated spatial aptitude training dataset comprising both static and dynamic spatial reasoning across 175K question-answer (QA) pairs and 20K scenes. Complementing this, we also construct a small (150 image-QAs) yet challenging dynamic spatial test set using real-world images. Leveraging our SAT datasets and 6 existing static spatial benchmarks, we systematically investigate what improves both static and dynamic spatial awareness. Our results reveal that simulations are surprisingly effective at imparting spatial aptitude to MLMs that translate to real images. We show that perfect annotations in simulation are more effective than existing approaches of pseudo-annotating real images. For instance, SAT training improves a LLaVA-13B model by an average 11% and a LLaVA-Video-7B model by an average 8% on multiple spatial benchmarks, including our real-image dynamic test set and spatial reasoning on long videos---even outperforming some large proprietary models.

This process requires significant researcher effort, reasoning, and ingenuity. Yet current benchmarks for LMs predominantly assess their ability to generate solutions rather than challenge them. We advocate for developing benchmarks that evaluate this inverse capability — creating counterexamples for subtly incorrect solutions. To demonstrate this approach, we start with the domain of algorithmic problem solving, where counterexamples can be evaluated automatically using code execution. Specifically, we introduce REFUTE, a dynamically updating benchmark that includes recent problems and incorrect submissions from programming competitions, where human experts successfully identified counterexamples. Our analysis finds that the best reasoning agents, even OpenAI o3-mini (high) with code execution feedback, can create counterexamples for only $<9$% of incorrect solutions in REFUTE, even though ratings indicate its ability to solve up to $48$% of these problems from scratch.

We propose Plato, a novel approach that co-designs algorithms and systems for semantic-aware parallel decoding. Plato leverages LLMs to organize sub-problems into a dependency graph based on logical and causal relationships, enabling concurrent decoding of non-dependent nodes while preserving answer coherence and quality. To further enhance efficiency, Plato pipelines planning and node decoding stages, implements a global context cache, and carefully structures node inference prompts to maximize key-value cache reuse and minimize overhead. Our evaluations show that Plato improves throughput by up to 68% over autoregressive decoding while achieving a 40% net win rate in answer quality. Compared to SoT, Plato demonstrates a remarkable 90% quality net-win rate.

Although imperfect code may be acceptable during software development with human oversight, domains such as video games and robotics require one-shot correctness for runtime-critical components.

To build such a context-sensitive parser, we propose a framework of a dynamic tree of parsers (ToP) during parsing, where each parser corresponds to a modular context-free grammar enriched with contextual information such as variable scopes and type constraints, with tree branches representing ambiguity in the future code segment. We demonstrate our approach through sLua, a strongly typed variant of Lua, showing that our method can generate semantically correct programs conforming to any prescribed scripting API.

In this work, we propose anew architecture StagFormer (Staggered Transformer), which staggered execution along the time axis and thereby enables parallelizing the decoding process along the depth of the model. We achieve this by breaking the dependency of the token representation at time step $i$ in layer $l$ upon the representations of tokens until time step $i$ from layer $l−1$. Instead, we stagger the execution and only allow a dependency on token representations until time step $i−1$. The later sections of the Transformer still get access to the \"rich\" representations from the prior section but only from those token positions which are one time step behind. StagFormer allows for different sections of the model to be executed in parallel yielding up to 33% speedup in decoding while being quality neutral. We also explore many natural variants of this idea. We present how weight-sharing across the different sections being staggered can be more practical in settings with limited memory. We show how one can approximate a recurrent model during inference using such weight-sharing. We explore the efficacy of using a bounded window attention to pass information from one section to another which helps drive further latency gains for some applications.

Solving these tasks requires real-world AI research skills such as generating new ideas and hypotheses, creating and processing data, implementing ML methods, training models, running experiments, analyzing the results, and iterating through this process to improve on a given task. We evaluate a number of frontier large language models (LLMs) on our benchmarks such as Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Llama-3.1 405B, GPT-4o, o1-preview, and Gemini-1.5 Pro. Our MLGym framework makes it easy to add new tasks, integrate and evaluate models or agents, generate synthetic data at scale, as well as develop new learning algorithms for training agents on AI research tasks. We find that current frontier models can improve on the given baselines, usually by finding better hyperparameters, but do not generate novel hypotheses, algorithms, architectures, or substantial improvements. We open-source our framework and benchmark to facilitate future research in advancing the AI research capabilities of LLM agents",

    "abstract": "Standard techniques for aligning large language models (LLMs) utilize human-produced data, which could limit the capability of any aligned LLM to human level. Label refinement and weak training have emerged as promising strategies to address this *superalignment* problem. In this work, we adopt probabilistic assumptions commonly used to study label refinement and analyze whether refinement can be outperformed by alternative approaches, including computationally intractable oracle methods. We show that both weak training and label refinement suffer from irreducible error, leaving a performance gap between label refinement and the oracle. These results motivate future research into developing alternative methods for weak to strong generalization that synthesize the practicality of label refinement or weak training and the optimality of the oracle procedure",

    "abstract": "Large language models accumulate vast amounts of knowledge during their pre-training, yet the dynamics governing this acquisition remain poorly understood. This work investigates the learning dynamics of language models on a synthetic factual recall task, uncovering three key findings: First, language models learn in three phases, with performance plateauing before they acquire precise factual knowledge. Mechanistically, this plateau coincides with the formation of attention-based circuits that support recall. Second, the training data distribution significantly impacts learning dynamics, with imbalanced distributions shortening the plateau. Finally, hallucinations appear simultaneously to knowledge, and integrating new knowledge into the model through fine-tuning is challenging, as it quickly corrupts its existing parametric associative memories. Our results emphasize the importance of data distribution in knowledge acquisition and suggest novel data scheduling strategies to accelerate neural network training",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Model editing aims to efficiently update a pre-trained model's knowledge without the need for time-consuming full retraining. While existing pioneering editing methods achieve promising results, they primarily focus on editing single-modal language models (LLMs). However, for vision-language models (VLMs), which involve multiple modalities, the role and impact of each modality on editing performance remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, we explore the impact of textual and visual modalities on model editing and find that: (1) textual and visual representations reach peak sensitivity at different layers, reflecting their varying importance; and (2) editing both modalities can efficiently update knowledge, but this comes at the cost of compromising the model's original capabilities. Based on our findings, we propose DualEdit, an editor that modifies both textual and visual modalities at their respective key layers. Additionally, we introduce a gating module within the more sensitive textual modality, allowing DualEdit to efficiently update new knowledge while preserving the model's original information. We evaluate DualEdit across multiple VLM backbones and benchmark datasets, demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art VLM editing baselines as well as adapted LLM editing methods on different evaluation metrics.

Additionally, it focuses on table entities, ensuring that table cells are semantically tightly bound, thereby enhancing contextual clarity.

    "abstract": "Existing benchmarks for evaluating long-context language models (LCLMs) primarily focus on long-context recall, requiring models to produce short responses based on a few critical snippets while processing thousands of irrelevant tokens. We introduce LongProc (Long Procedural Generation), a new benchmark that requires both the integration of highly dispersed information and long-form generation. LongProc consists of six diverse procedural generation tasks, such as extracting structured information from HTML pages into a TSV format and executing complex search procedures to create travel plans. These tasks challenge LCLMs by testing their ability to follow detailed procedural instructions, synthesize and reason over dispersed information, and generate structured, long-form outputs (up to 8K tokens). Furthermore, as these tasks adhere to deterministic procedures and yield structured outputs, they enable reliable rule-based evaluation. We evaluated 23 LCLMs, including instruction-tuned models and recent reasoning models, on LongProc at three difficulty levels, with the maximum number of output tokens set at 500, 2K, and 8K. Notably, while all tested models claim a context window size above 32K tokens, open-weight models typically falter on 2K-token tasks, and closed-source models like GPT-4o show significant degradation on 8K-token tasks. Reasoning models achieve stronger overall performance in long-form generation, benefiting from long CoT training. Further analysis reveals that LCLMs struggle to maintain long-range coherence in long-form generations. These findings highlight critical limitations in current LCLMs and suggest substantial room for improvement",

    "abstract": "Academic writing requires both coherent text generation and precise citation of relevant literature. Although recent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have significantly improved factual accuracy in general-purpose text generation, their ability to support professional academic writing remains limited. In this work, we introduce ScholarCopilot, a unified framework designed to enhance existing large language models for generating professional academic articles with accurate and contextually relevant citations. ScholarCopilot dynamically determines when to retrieve scholarly references by generating a retrieval token [RET], which is then used to query a citation database. The retrieved references are fed into the model to augment the generation process. We jointly optimize both the generation and citation tasks within a single framework to improve efficiency. Our model is built upon Qwen-2.5-7B and trained on 500K papers from arXiv. It achieves a top-1 retrieval accuracy of 40.1% on our evaluation dataset, outperforming baselines such as E5-Mistral-7B-Instruct (15.0%) and BM25 (9.8%). On a dataset of 1,000 academic writing samples, ScholarCopilot scores 16.2/25 in generation quality--measured across relevance, coherence, academic rigor, completeness, and innovation--significantly surpassing all existing models, including much larger ones like the Retrieval-Augmented Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct.

Multiple methods recover such directions and build probes that are described as uncovering a model's \"knowledge\" or \"beliefs\". We investigate this phenomenon, looking closely at the impact of context on the probes. Our experiments establish where in the LLM the probe's predictions are (most) sensitive to the presence of related sentences, and how to best characterize this kind of sensitivity. We do so by measuring different types of consistency errors that occur after probing an LLM whose inputs consist of hypotheses preceded by (negated) supporting and contradicting sentences. We also perform a causal intervention experiment, investigating whether moving the representation of a premise along these truth-value directions influences the position of an entailed or contradicted sentence along that same direction. We find that the probes we test are generally context sensitive, but that contexts which should not affect the truth often still impact the probe outputs. Our experiments show that the type of errors depend on the layer, the model, and the kind of data. Finally, our results suggest that truth-value directions are causal mediators in the inference process that incorporates in-context information",

This work is the first to systematically connect code hallucinations with vulnerability risks, offering a unified conceptual and practical framework to address them. At the heart of our approach is the notion of hallucination anchors, localized subtrees in the abstract syntax tree (AST) that serve as root causes of defective logic. We propose Structural Trimming (ST), a targeted mitigation method that removes these anchors while preserving functional semantics. To anticipate the effect of trimming, we introduce the Compositional Structural Hallucination Score (CSHS), which quantifies the likelihood that pruning will improve robustness. By grounding error reduction in the syntax graph itself, our method reframes hallucination mitigation as a structured intervention process interpretable, generalizable, and actionable",

    "abstract": "Language models are strong few-shot learners and achieve good overall accuracy in text classification tasks, masking the fact that their results suffer from great class accuracy imbalance. We believe that the pursuit of overall accuracy should not come from enriching the strong classes, but from raising up the weak ones. To address the imbalance, we propose a Heaviside step function based ensemble debiasing method, which enables flexible rectifications of in-context learned class probabilities at both class and sample levels. Evaluations with Llama-2-13B on seven text classification benchmarks show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art overall accuracy gains with balanced class accuracies. More importantly, we perform analyses on the resulted probability correction scheme, showing that sample-level corrections are necessary to elevate weak classes. Due to effectively correcting weak classes, our method also brings significant performance gains to a larger model variant, Llama-2-70B, especially on a biomedical domain task, further demonstrating the necessity of ensemble debiasing at both levels.

To address these challenges, we propose Scenario-Profiled Indexing with Knowledge Expansion (SPIKE), a dense retrieval framework that explicitly indexes implicit relevance by decomposing documents into scenario-based retrieval units. SPIKE organizes documents into scenario, which encapsulates the reasoning process necessary to uncover implicit relationships between hypothetical information needs and document content. SPIKE constructs a scenario-augmented dataset using a powerful teacher large language model (LLM), then distills these reasoning capabilities into a smaller, efficient scenario generator. During inference, SPIKE incorporates scenario-level relevance alongside document-level relevance, enabling reasoning-aware retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SPIKE consistently enhances retrieval performance across various query types and dense retrievers. It also enhances the retrieval experience for users through scenario and offers valuable contextual information for LLMs in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)",

    "abstract": "The goal of translation, be it by human or by machine, is, given some text in a source language, to produce text in a target language that simultaneously 1) preserves the meaning of the source text and 2) achieves natural expression in the target language. However, researchers in the machine translation community usually assess translations using a single score intended to capture semantic accuracy and the naturalness of the output simultaneously. In this paper, we build on recent advances in information theory to mathematically prove and empirically demonstrate that such single-score summaries *do not and cannot* give the complete picture of a system's true performance. Concretely, we prove that a tradeoff exists between accuracy and naturalness and demonstrate it by evaluating the submissions to the WMT24 shared task. Our findings help explain well-known empirical phenomena, such as the observation that optimizing translation systems for a specific accuracy metric (like BLEU) initially improves the system's naturalness, while \"overfitting\" the system to the metric can significantly degrade its naturalness. Thus, we advocate for a change in how translations are evaluated: rather than comparing systems using a single number, they should be compared on an *accuracy-naturalness plane*",

    "abstract": "Sliding-window attention offers a hardware-efficient solution to the memory and throughput challenges of Large Language Models (LLMs) in long-context scenarios. Existing methods typically employ a single window length across all attention heads and input sizes. However, this uniform approach fails to capture the heterogeneous attention patterns inherent in LLMs, ignoring their distinct accuracy-latency trade-offs. To address this challenge, we propose *Mixture of Attention Spans* (MoA), which automatically tailors distinct sliding-window length configurations to different heads and layers. MoA constructs and navigates a search space of various window lengths and their scaling rules relative to input sizes. It profiles the model, evaluates potential configurations, and pinpoints the optimal length configurations for each head. MoA adapts to varying input sizes, revealing that some attention heads expand their focus to accommodate longer inputs, while other heads consistently concentrate on fixed-length local contexts. Experiments show that MoA increases the effective context length by 3.9× with the same average sliding-window length, boosting retrieval accuracy by 1.5-7.1× over the uniform-window baseline across Vicuna-{7B,13B}, and Llama3-{8B,70B} models. Moreover, MoA narrows the performance gap with full attention, reducing the maximum relative performance drop from 9%-36% to within 5% across three long-context understanding benchmarks. MoA achieves a 1.2-1.4× GPU memory reduction, boosting decode throughput by 6.6-8.2× and 1.7-1.9× over FlashAttention2 and vLLM, with minimal performance impact.

However, documents often contain noise-like information, such as watermarks, which inevitably leads us to inquire: Do watermarks degrade the performance of VLMs in document understanding? To address this, we propose a novel evaluation framework to investigate the effect of visible watermarks on VLMs performance. We takes into account various factors, including different types of document data, the positions of watermarks within documents and variations in watermark content. Our experimental results reveal that VLMs performance can be significantly compromised by watermarks, with performance drop rates reaching up to 36\\%. We discover that \\emph{scattered} watermarks cause stronger interference than centralized ones, and that \\emph{semantic contents} in watermarks creates greater disruption than simple visual occlusion. Through attention mechanism analysis and embedding similarity examination, we find that the performance drops are mainly attributed to that watermarks 1) force widespread attention redistribution, and 2) alter semantic representation in the embedding space. Our research not only highlights significant challenges in deploying VLMs for document understanding, but also provides insights towards developing robust inference mechanisms on watermarked documents",

    "abstract": "Reasoning abilities, especially those for solving complex math problems, are crucial components of general intelligence. Recent advances by proprietary companies, such as o-series models of OpenAI, have made remarkable progress on reasoning tasks. However, the complete technical details remain unrevealed, and the techniques that are believed certainly to be adopted are only reinforcement learning (RL) and the long chain of thoughts. This paper proposes a new RL framework, termed OREAL, to pursue the performance limit that can be achieved through **O**utcome **RE**w**A**rd-based reinforcement **L**earning for mathematical reasoning tasks, where only binary outcome rewards are easily accessible. We theoretically prove that behavior cloning on positive trajectories from best-of-N (BoN) sampling is sufficient to learn the KL-regularized optimal policy in binary feedback environments. This formulation further implies that the rewards of negative samples should be reshaped to ensure the gradient consistency between positive and negative samples. To alleviate the long-existing difficulties brought by sparse rewards in RL, which are even exacerbated by the partial correctness of the long chain of thought for reasoning tasks, we further apply a token-level reward model to sample important tokens in reasoning trajectories for learning. With OREAL, for the first time, a 7B model can obtain 94.0 pass@1 accuracy on MATH-500 through RL, being on par with 32B models. OREAL-32B also surpasses previous 32B models trained by distillation with 95.0 pass@1 accuracy on MATH-500.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Scaling test-time compute has emerged as a key strategy for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly in tasks like mathematical problem-solving. A traditional approach, Self-Consistency (SC), generates multiple solutions to a problem and selects the most common answer via majority voting. Another common method involves scoring each solution with a reward model (verifier) and choosing the best one. Recent advancements in Generative Reward Models (GenRM) reframe verification as a next-token prediction task, enabling inference-time scaling along a new axis. Specifically, GenRM generates multiple verification chains-of-thought to score each solution. Under a limited inference budget, this introduces a fundamental trade-off: should you spend the budget on scaling solutions via SC or generate fewer solutions and allocate compute to verification via GenRM? To address this, we evaluate GenRM against SC under a fixed inference budget. Interestingly, we find that SC is more compute-efficient than GenRM for most practical inference budgets across diverse models and datasets. For instance, GenRM first matches SC after consuming up to $8\\times$ the inference compute and requires significantly more compute to outperform it. Furthermore, we derive inference scaling laws for the GenRM paradigm, revealing that compute-optimal inference favors scaling solution generation more aggressively than scaling the number of verifications.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Code LLMs have shown promising results with converting tasks in natural language to programs that can be executed by service robots. We are interested in finetuning small, specialized LLMs for this purpose, but collecting datasets of task-program pairs specific to each robot is time-consuming and expensive. While approaches such as SELF-INSTRUCT and EVOL-INSTRUCT are capable of generating novel tasks given a few examples, they are unable to provide the corresponding programs that correctly abide by physical-world and robot-constraints using the provided programming interface. Using a simulator is a natural potential solution to checking for such constraints, but building simulation environments that can handle arbitrary tasks and their necessary objects and locations, is challenging. To address these challenges, we introduce ROBO-INSTRUCT, which synthesizes task-specific simulation environments on the fly during program execution, by opportunistically inferring entity properties and enforcing corresponding constraints based on how the entities are used in the task program. Additionally, ROBO-INSTRUCT integrates an LLM-aided post-processing procedure to refine instructions for better alignment with robot programs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ROBO-INSTRUCT across multiple LLMs, showing that our fine-tuned models outperform all baseline methods and even match or surpass the performance of several larger and proprietary models",

    "title": "CodeARC: Benchmarking Reasoning Capabilities of LLM Agents for Inductive Program Synthesis",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Inductive program synthesis, or programming by example, requires synthesizing functions from input-output examples that generalize to unseen inputs. While large language model agents have shown promise in programming tasks guided by natural language, their ability to perform inductive program synthesis is underexplored. Existing evaluation protocols rely on static sets of examples and held-out tests, offering no feedback when synthesized functions are incorrect and failing to reflect real-world scenarios such as reverse engineering. We propose CodeARC, the *Code Abstraction and Reasoning Challenge*, a new evaluation framework where agents interact with a hidden target function by querying it with new inputs, synthesizing candidate functions, and iteratively refining their solutions using a differential testing oracle. This interactive setting encourages agents to perform function calls and self-correction based on feedback. We construct the first large-scale benchmark for general-purpose inductive program synthesis, featuring 1114 functions. Among 18 models evaluated, o3-mini performs best with a success rate of 52.7%, highlighting the difficulty of this task. Fine-tuning LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct on curated synthesis traces yields up to a 31% relative performance gain. CodeARC provides a more realistic and challenging testbed for evaluating LLM-based program synthesis and inductive reasoning.

    "abstract": "Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from severely sub-optimal expert pathways—our study reveals that naive expert selection learned from pretraining leaves a surprising 10-20% accuracy gap for improvement. Motivated by this observation, we develop a novel class of test-time optimization methods to re-weight or \"re-mixing\" the experts in different layers jointly for each test sample. Since the test sample's ground truth is unknown, we propose to optimize a surrogate objective defined by the sample's \"successful neighbors\" from a reference set of samples. We introduce three surrogates and algorithms based on mode-finding, kernel regression, and the average loss of similar reference samples/tasks. To reduce the cost of optimizing whole pathways, we apply our algorithms merely to the core experts' mixing weights in critical layers, which enjoy similar performance but save significant computation. This leads to \"Critical-Layer, Core-Expert, Collaborative Pathway Optimization (C3PO)\". We apply C3PO to two recent MoE LLMs and examine it on six widely-used benchmarks. It consistently improves the base model by 7-15% in accuracy and outperforms widely used test-time learning baselines, e.g., in-context learning and prompt/prefix tuning, by a large margin. Moreover, C3PO enables MoE LLMs with 1-3B active parameters to outperform LLMs of 7-9B parameters, hence improving MoE's advantages on efficiency. Our thorough ablation study further sheds novel insights on achieving test-time improvement on MoE",

    "abstract": "Linear attention methods offer a compelling alternative to softmax attention due to their efficiency in recurrent decoding. Recent research has focused on enhancing standard linear attention by incorporating gating while retaining its computational benefits. Such Gated Linear Attention (GLA) architectures include highly competitive models such as Mamba and RWKV. In this work, we investigate the in-context learning capabilities of the GLA model and make the following contributions. We show that a multilayer GLA can implement a general class of Weighted Preconditioned Gradient Descent (WPGD) algorithms with data-dependent weights. These weights are induced by the gating mechanism and the input, enabling the model to control the contribution of individual tokens to prediction. To further understand the mechanics of this weighting, we introduce a novel data model with multitask prompts and characterize the optimization landscape of learning a WPGD algorithm. We identify mild conditions under which there exists a unique global minimum, up to scaling invariance, and the associated WPGD algorithm is unique as well. Finally, we translate these findings to explore the optimization landscape of GLA and shed light on how gating facilitates context-aware learning and when it is provably better than vanilla linear attention",

We introduce a benchmark to measure the time to pre-train models on given GPUs and also identify ideal settings for maximizing training speed. We run our benchmark on a range of models and academic GPUs, spending 2,000 GPU-hours on our experiments. Our results reveal a brighter picture for academic pre-training: for example, although Pythia-1B was originally trained on 64 GPUs for 3 days, we find it is also possible to replicate this model (with the same hyper-parameters) in 3x fewer GPU-days: i.e. on 4 GPUs in 18 days. We conclude with a cost-benefit analysis to help clarify the trade-offs between price and pre-training time.

Both characterizations allow us to find local similarities across token embeddings. Additionally, our intrinsic dimension demonstrates that embeddings lie on a lower dimensional manifold, and that tokens with lower intrinsic dimensions often have semantically coherent clusters, while those with higher intrinsic dimensions do not.

Thus, we propose Continuous Optimization with Discrete Efficient Search (CODES), a token-level jailbreak method that combines continuous-space optimization with discrete-space search to efficiently generate self-replicating attack prompts. Through CODES, malicious content propagates across multiple agents, compromising the entire MAS. In the three realistic threat scenarios—ranging from triggering offensive outputs across an entire agent cohort to bypassing multi-level safeguard modules, CODES demonstrate effectiveness.

Our results show that the bias in the thinking steps is not highly correlated with the output bias (less than $0.6$ correlation with a $p$-value smaller than $0.001$ in most cases).

While such agents have considerable potential to assist human users with complex tasks, evaluating their capabilities in real-world settings poses a major challenge. To this end, we introduce BEARCUBS, a \"smallbut mighty\" benchmark of 111 information-seeking questions designed to evaluate a web agent's ability to search, browse, and identify factual information from the web. Unlike prior web agent benchmarks, solving BEARCUBS requires (1) accessing live web content rather than synthetic or simulated pages, which captures the unpredictability of real-world web interactions; and (2) performing a broad range of multimodal interactions (e.g., video understanding, 3D navigation) that cannot be bypassed via text-based workarounds. Each question in BEARCUBS has a corresponding short, unambiguous answer and a human-validated browsing trajectory, allowing for transparent evaluation of agent performance and strategies. A human study confirms that BEARCUBS questions are solvable but non-trivial (84.7% human accuracy), revealing domain knowledge gaps and overlooked details as common failure points. We find that ChatGPT Agent significantly outperforms other computer-using agents with an overall accuracy of 65.8% (compared to e.g., Operator's 23.4%), showcasing substantial progress in tasks involving real computer use, such as playing web games and navigating 3D environments. Nevertheless, closing the gap to human performance requires improvements in areas like fine control, complex data filtering, and execution speed.

    "abstract": "Personalization of Large Language Models (LLMs) often assumes users hold static preferences that reflect globally in all tasks. In reality, humans hold dynamic preferences that change depending on the context. As users interact with an LLM in various contexts, they naturally reveal their contextual preferences, which a model must infer and apply in future contexts to ensure alignment. To assess this, we introduce 🏹 CUPID, a benchmark of 756 human-curated interaction session histories between users and LLM-based chat assistants. In each interaction session, the user provides a request in a specific context and expresses their preference through multi-turn feedback. Given a new user request and prior interaction sessions, our benchmark assesses whether LLMs can infer the preference relevant to this request and generate a response that satisfies this preference. With CUPID, we evaluated 10 open and proprietary LLMs, revealing that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to infer preferences from multi-turn interactions and fail to discern what previous context is relevant to a new request—under 50% precision and 65% recall. Our work highlights the need to advance LLM capabilities for more contextually personalized interactions and proposes CUPID as a resource to drive these improvements",

While previous research has primarily focused on \"when\" LLMs hallucinate, our work explains \"why\" and directly links model behaviour to the pre-training data that forms their prior knowledge. Specifically, we demonstrate that an asymmetry exists in the recognition of logically equivalent facts, which can be attributed to frequency discrepancies of entities appearing as subjects versus objects. Given that most pre-training datasets are inaccessible, we leverage the fully open-source $\\texttt{OLMo}$ series by indexing its $\\texttt{Dolma}$ dataset to estimate entity frequencies. Using relational facts (represented as triples) from $\\texttt{Wikidata5M}$, we construct probing datasets to isolate this effect. Our experiments reveal that facts with a high-frequency subject and a low-frequency object are better recognised than their inverse, despite their logical equivalence. The pattern reverses in low-to-high frequency settings, and no statistically significant asymmetry emerges when both entities are high-frequency.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) allows us to train models, such as language models (LMs), to follow complex human preferences. In RLHF for LMs, we first train an LM using supervised fine-tuning, sample pairs of responses, obtain human feedback, and use the resulting data to train a reward model (RM). RL methods are then used to train the LM to maximize the reward given by the RM. As training progresses, the responses generated by the LM no longer resemble the responses seen by the RM during training, leading to the RM becoming inaccurate. The score given by the RM keeps increasing, but the learned behavior no longer matches the human preferences. This issue is known as overoptimization. We investigate overoptimization from the point of view of distribution shift and show that the shift results in an inconsistent estimate of the RM parameters, leading to an inconsistent estimate of the policy gradient. We propose Off-Policy Corrected Reward Modeling (OCRM), which iteratively off-policy corrects the RM using importance weighting, without requiring new labels or samples. This results in a more accurate RM, which empirically leads to an improved final policy.

Furthermore, we design an iterative enhancement framework for both the generator and the reward model (RM), enabling their mutual improvement through online interaction across multiple rounds of DPO. Finally, with simple verifiable rewards, our model DPO-VP achieves RL-level performance with significantly lower computational overhead.

    "title": "Agents Are All You Need for LLM Unlearning",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Information removal or suppression in large language models (LLMs) is a desired functionality, useful in AI regulation, legal compliance, safety, and privacy. LLM unlearning methods aim to remove information on demand from LLMs. Current LLM unlearning methods struggle to balance the unlearning efficacy and utility due to the competing nature of these objectives. Keeping the unlearning process computationally feasible without assuming access to the model weights is an overlooked area. In this work we show that \\textit{agents might be all we need for effective and practical LLM unlearning}. We present the first agentic LLM unlearning (\\texttt{ALU}) method, a multi-agent, retrain-free, model-agnostic approach to LLM unlearning that achieves effective unlearning while preserving the utility. Our \\texttt{ALU} framework unlearns by involving multiple LLM agents, each designed for a specific step in the unlearning process, without the need to update model weights for any of the agents in the framework. Users can easily request any set of unlearning instances in any sequence, and \\texttt{ALU} seamlessly adapts in real time. This is facilitated without requiring any changes in the underlying LLM model. Through extensive experiments on established benchmarks (TOFU, WMDP, WPU) and jailbreaking techniques (many shot, target masking, other languages), we demonstrate that \\texttt{ALU} consistently stands out as the most robust LLM unlearning framework among current state-of-the-art methods while incurring time cost that remains effectively constant regardless of the number of unlearning targets. We further highlight \\texttt{ALU}'s superior performance compared to existing methods when evaluated at scale. Specifically, \\texttt{ALU} is assessed on up to 1000 unlearning targets, exceeding the evaluation scope of all previously proposed LLM unlearning methods",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We present ONERULER, a multilingual benchmark designed to evaluate long-context language models across 26 languages. ONERULER adapts the English-only RULER benchmark (Hsieh et al., 2024) by including seven synthetic tasks that test both retrieval and aggregation, including new variations of the \"needle-in-a-haystack\" task that allow for the possibility of a nonexistent needle. We create ONERULER through a two-step process, first writing English instructions for each task and then collaborating with native speakers to translate them into 25 additional languages. Experiments with both open-weight and closed LLMs reveal a widening performance gap between low- and high-resource languages as context length increases from 8K to 128K tokens. Surprisingly, English is not the top-performing language on long-context tasks (ranked 6th out of 26), with Polish emerging as the top language. Our experiments also show that many LLMs (particularly OpenAI's o3-mini-high) incorrectly predict the absence of an answer, even in high-resource languages. Finally, in cross-lingual scenarios where instructions and context appear in different languages, performance can fluctuate by up to 20% depending on the instruction language. We hope the release of ONERULER will facilitate future research into improving multilingual and cross-lingual long-context training pipelines",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs), such as OpenAI's o1-series have demonstrated compelling capabilities for complex reasoning tasks via the extended chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning mechanism. However, recent studies reveal substantial redundancy in the CoT reasoning traces, which not only increases inference latency but also negatively impacts model performance by diverting attention to unnecessary reasoning paths. To address this issue, we investigate the internal reasoning structures of LLMs and categorize them into three primary thought types: execution, reflection, and transition thoughts. Moreover, our analysis reveals that excessive reflection and transition thoughts are strongly correlated with failure cases and these thought categories exhibit clear separation in the latent space. Based on these, we introduce SEAL (**S**teerable r**EA**soning ca**L**ibration), a training-free approach that seamlessly calibrates the CoT process, improving accuracy while demonstrating significant efficiency gains. SEAL consists of an offline stage for extracting the reasoning steering vector in the latent space, followed by an on-the-fly calibration of the reasoning trace through representation intervention using the steering vector. Notably, the steering vector exhibits strong transferability across various tasks. Extensive experiments across multiple models (DeepSeek-R1-Distill and QwQ-32B-Preview) and benchmarks (Math500, GSM8K, LiveCodeBench) validate the effectiveness of SEAL, up to a 11\\% improvement in accuracy while reducing reasoning tokens by 11.8\\% to 50.4\\%",

    "abstract": "DeepSeek-R1 has shown that long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning can naturally emerge through a simple reinforcement learning (RL) framework with rule-based rewards, where the training may directly start from the base models—a paradigm referred to as zero RL training. Most recent efforts to reproduce zero RL training have primarily focused on the Qwen2.5 model series, which may not be representative as we find the base models already exhibit strong instruction-following and self-reflection abilities. In this work, we investigate zero RL training across 10 diverse base models, spanning different families and sizes including LLama3-8B, Mistral-7B/24B, DeepSeek-Math-7B, Qwen2.5-math-7B, and all Qwen2.5 models from 0.5B to 32B. Leveraging several key design strategies—such as adjusting format reward and controlling query difficulty—we achieve substantial improvements in both reasoning accuracy and response length across most settings. However, by carefully monitoring the training dynamics, we observe that different base models exhibit distinct patterns during training. For instance, the increased response length does not always correlate with the emergence of certain cognitive behaviors such as verification (i.e., the \"aha moment\"). Notably, we observe the ``aha moment'' for the first time in small models not from the Qwen family. We share the key designs that enable successful zero RL training, along with our findings and practices. To facilitate further research, we open-source the code, models, and analysis tools",

    "abstract": "Language models (LMs) tend to show human-like preferences on a number of syntactic phenomena, but the extent to which these are attributable to direct exposure to the phenomena or more general properties of language is unclear. We explore this with the English dative alternation (DO: \"gave Y the X\" vs. PO: \"gave the X to Y\"), using a controlled rearing paradigm wherein we iteratively train small LMs on systematically manipulated input. We focus on two properties that affect the choice of alternant: length and animacy. Both properties are directly present in datives but also reflect more global tendencies for shorter elements to precede longer ones and animates to precede inanimates. First, by manipulating and ablating datives for these biases in the input, we show that direct evidence of length and animacy matters, but easy-first preferences persist even without such evidence. Then, using LMs trained on systematically perturbed datasets to manipulate global length effects (re-linearizing sentences globally while preserving dependency structure), we find that dative preferences can emerge from indirect evidence. We conclude that LMs' emergent syntactic preferences come from a mix of direct and indirect sources",

We further explore the impact of company characteristics, such as size, retail investment, institutional attention, and readability of financial filings, on the accuracy of knowledge represented in LLMs. Our results reveal that LLMs are less informed about past financial performance, but they display a stronger awareness of larger companies and more recent information.

    "abstract": "Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a popular parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method for Large Language Models (LLMs), yet it still incurs notable overhead and suffers from parameter interference in multi-task scenarios. We propose LoRA with Reduced Interference (LoRI), a simple yet effective approach that freezes the projection matrices $A$ as random projections and sparsifies the matrices $B$ using task-specific masks. This design substantially reduces the number of trainable parameters while maintaining strong task performance. Moreover, LoRI minimizes cross-task interference in adapter merging by leveraging the orthogonality between adapter subspaces, and supports continual learning by using sparsity to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments across natural language understanding, mathematical reasoning, code generation, and safety alignment tasks demonstrate that LoRI outperforms full fine-tuning and existing PEFT methods, while using up to 95\\% fewer trainable parameters than LoRA. In multi-task experiments, LoRI enables effective adapter merging and continual learning with reduced cross-task interference. Code is available at: https://github.com/juzhengz/LoRI",

    "abstract": "Language models often struggle with cross-mode knowledge retrieval – the ability to access knowledge learned in one format (mode) when queried in another. We demonstrate that models trained on multiple data sources (e.g., Wikipedia and TinyStories) exhibit significantly reduced accuracy when retrieving knowledge in a format different from its original training mode. This paper quantitatively investigates this phenomenon through a controlled study of random token sequence memorization across different modes. We first explore dataset rewriting as a solution, revealing that effective cross-mode retrieval requires prohibitively extensive rewriting efforts that follow a sigmoid-like relationship. As an alternative, we propose CASCADE, a novel pretraining algorithm that uses cascading datasets with varying sequence lengths and computing losses on only the second half of each training sequence to capture knowledge at different scales. Our experiments demonstrate that CASCADE outperforms dataset rewriting approaches, even when compressed into a single model with a unified loss function. This work provides both qualitative evidence of cross-mode retrieval limitations and a practical solution to enhance language models' ability to access knowledge independently of its presentational format",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has become essential for improving language model capabilities, but traditional approaches rely on the assumption that human preferences follow a transitive Bradley-Terry model. This assumption fails to capture the non-transitive nature of populational human preferences. Nash learning from human feedback (NLHF), targeting non-transitive preferences, is a problem of computing the Nash equilibrium (NE) of the two-player constant-sum game defined by the human preference. We introduce Extragradient preference optimization (EGPO), a novel algorithm for NLHF achieving last-iterate linear convergence to the NE of KL-regularized games and polynomial convergence to the NE of original games, while being robust to noise. Unlike previous approaches that rely on nested optimization, we derive an equivalent implementation using gradients of an online variant of the identity preference optimization (IPO) loss, enabling more faithful implementation for neural networks. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate EGPO's superior performance over baseline methods when training for the same number of epochs, as measured by pairwise win-rates using the ground truth preference. These results validate both the theoretical strengths and practical advantages of EGPO for language model alignment with non-transitive human preferences",

This limitation persists even though VLMs are equipped with strong vision and language backbones. While supervised data and complex reward functions have been proposed to improve detailed image captioning, we identify a simpler underlying issue: a bias towards the end-of-sequence (EOS) token, which is introduced during cross-entropy training. We propose an unsupervised method to debias the model's tendency to predict the EOS token prematurely. By reducing this bias, we encourage the generation of longer, more detailed captions without the need for intricate reward functions or supervision. Our approach is straightforward, effective, and easily applicable to any pretrained model. We demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments with three VLMs and on three detailed captioning benchmarks.

By adopting our approach to direct preference optimization (DPO) and odds ratio preference optimization (ORPO), we demonstrate that we can promote the output diversity of trained models while minimally decreasing quality.

    "abstract": "Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in various vision-language tasks. However, it is still unclear how accurately LVLMs can perceive visual information in images. In particular, the capability of LVLMs to perceive geometric information, such as shape, angle, and size, remains insufficiently analyzed, although the perception of these properties is crucial for tasks that require a detailed visual understanding. In this work, we introduce VisOnlyQA, a dataset for evaluating the geometric perception of LVLMs, and reveal that LVLMs often cannot accurately perceive basic geometric information in images, while human performance is nearly perfect. VisOnlyQA consists of 12 tasks that directly ask about geometric information in geometric shapes, charts, chemical structures, and 3D shapes. Our experiments highlight the following findings: (i) State-of-the-art LVLMs struggle with basic geometric perception. 23 LVLMs we evaluate, including GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Pro, work poorly on VisOnlyQA. (ii) Additional training data does not resolve this issue. Fine-tuning on the training set of VisOnlyQA is not always effective, even for in-distribution tasks. (iii) LLM may be the bottleneck.

    "abstract": "Rotating the activation and weight matrices to reduce the influence of outliers in large language models (LLMs) has recently attracted significant attention, particularly in the context of model quantization. Prior studies have shown that in low-precision quantization scenarios, such as 4-bit weights and 4-bit activations~(W4A4), randomized Hadamard transforms can achieve significantly higher accuracy than randomized orthogonal transforms. Notably, the reason behind this phenomenon remains unknown. In this paper, we find that these transformations show substantial improvement in eliminating outliers for common tokens and achieve similar quantization error. The primary reason for the accuracy difference lies in the fact that randomized Hadamard transforms can slightly reduce the quantization error for tokens with massive activations while randomized orthogonal transforms increase the quantization error. Due to the extreme rarity of these tokens and their critical impact on model accuracy, we consider this a long-tail optimization problem, and therefore construct a simple yet effective method: a weighted loss function. Additionally, we propose an optimization strategy for the rotation matrix that involves alternating optimization of quantization parameters while employing orthogonal Procrustes transforms to refine the rotation matrix. This makes the distribution of the rotated activation values more conducive to quantization, especially for tokens with massive activations. Our method enhances the Rotated LLMs by achieving dual free, **Outlier-Free** and **Massive Activation-Free**, dubbed as **DFRot**. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of DFRot. By tuning the rotation matrix using just a single sample, DFRot achieves a perplexity improvement of 0.98 and 0.95 on W4A4KV4 and W4A4KV16, respectively, for LLaMA3-70B, a model known for its quantization challenges.

    "title": "The Dual-Route Model of Induction",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Prior work on in-context copying has shown the existence of *induction heads*, which attend to and promote individual tokens during copying. In this work we discover a new type of induction head: *concept-level* induction heads, which copy entire lexical units instead of individual tokens. Concept induction heads learn to attend to the ends of multi-token words throughout training, working in parallel with token-level induction heads to copy meaningful text. We show that these heads are responsible for semantic tasks like word-level translation, whereas token induction heads are vital for tasks that can only be done verbatim (like copying nonsense tokens). These two \"routes\" operate independently: we show that ablation of token induction heads causes models to paraphrase where they would otherwise copy verbatim. By patching concept induction head outputs, we find that they contain language-independent word representations that mediate natural language translation, suggesting that LLMs represent abstract word meanings independent of language or form",

    "title": "Language Models Fail to Introspect About Their Knowledge of Language",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "There has been recent interest in whether large language models (LLMs) can introspect about their own internal states. Such abilities would make LLMs more interpretable, and also validate the use of standard introspective methods in linguistics to evaluate grammatical knowledge in models (e.g., asking \"Is this sentence grammatical?\"). We systematically investigate emergent introspection across 21 open-source LLMs, in two domains where introspection is of theoretical interest: grammatical knowledge and word prediction. Crucially, in both domains, a model's internal linguistic knowledge can be theoretically grounded in direct measurements of string probability. We then evaluate whether models' responses to metalinguistic prompts faithfully reflect their internal knowledge. We propose a new measure of introspection: the degree to which a model's prompted responses predict its own string probabilities, beyond what would be predicted by another model with nearly identical internal knowledge. While both metalinguistic prompting and probability comparisons lead to high task accuracy, we do not find evidence that LLMs have privileged \"self-access\". By using general tasks, controlling for model similarity, and evaluating a wide range of open-source models, we show that LLMs cannot introspect, and add new evidence to the argument that prompted responses should not be conflated with models' linguistic generalizations",

    "title": "SQuat: Subspace-orthogonal KV Cache Quantization",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The key-value (KV) cache accelerates LLMs decoding by storing KV tensors from previously generated tokens. It reduces redundant computation at the cost of increased memory usage. To mitigate this overhead, existing approaches compress KV tensors into lower-bit representations; however, quantization errors can accumulate as more tokens are generated, potentially resulting in undesired outputs. In this paper, we introduce SQuat (Subspace-orthogonal KV cache quantization). It first constructs a subspace spanned by query tensors to capture the most critical task-related information. During key tensor quantization, it enforces that the difference between the (de)quantized and original keys remains orthogonal to this subspace, minimizing the impact of quantization errors on the attention mechanism's outputs. SQuat requires no model fine-tuning, no additional calibration dataset for offline learning, and is grounded in a theoretical framework we develop. Through numerical experiments, we show that our method reduces peak memory by $2.17\\times \\sim 2.82\\times$, improves throughput by $2.45\\times \\sim 3.60 \\times$, and achieves more favorable benchmark scores than existing KV cache quantization algorithms",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Language provides a natural interface to specify and evaluate performance on visual tasks. To realize this possibility, vision language models (VLMs) must successfully integrate visual and linguistic information. Our work compares VLMs to a direct readout of their visual encoders to understand their ability to integrate across these modalities. Across a series of vision-centric benchmarks (e.g., depth estimation, correspondence), we find that VLMs perform substantially worse than their visual encoders, dropping to near-chance performance. We investigate these results through a series of analyses across the entire VLM: namely 1) the degradation of vision representations, 2) brittleness to task prompt, and 3) the language model's role in solving the task. We find that the bottleneck in performing these vision-centric tasks lies in this third category; VLMs are not effectively using visual information easily accessible throughout the \\textit{entire} model, and they inherit their language biases. Our work helps diagnose the failure modes of open-source VLMs, and presents a series of evaluations useful for future investigations into visual understanding within VLMs",

    "title": "Language Model Uncertainty Quantification with Attention Chain",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Accurately quantifying a large language model's (LLM) predictive uncertainty is crucial for judging the reliability of its answers. While most existing research focuses on short, directly answerable questions with closed-form outputs (e.g., multiple-choice), involving intermediate reasoning steps in LLM responses is increasingly important. This added complexity complicates uncertainty quantification (UQ) because the probabilities assigned to answer tokens are conditioned on a vast space of preceding reasoning tokens. Direct marginalization is infeasible, and the dependency inflates probability estimates, causing overconfidence in UQ. To address this, we propose UQAC, an efficient method that narrows the reasoning space to a tractable size for marginalization. UQAC iteratively constructs an \"attention chain\" of tokens deemed \"semantically crucial to the final answer via a backtracking procedure. Starting from the answer tokens, it uses attention weights to identify the most influential predecessors, then iterates this process until reaching the input tokens. The resulting chain is further refined with similarity filtering and probability thresholding, which reduce the reasoning space, facilitating the approximation of the marginal answer token probabilities. We validate UQAC on multiple reasoning benchmarks with advanced open-source LLMs, demonstrating that it consistently delivers reliable UQ estimates with high computational efficiency",

Smaller VLMs typically mirror design choices of larger models, such as extensive image tokenization, leading to inefficient GPU memory usage and constrained practicality for on-device applications. We introduce SmolVLM, a series of compact multimodal models specifically engineered for resource-efficient inference. We systematically explore architectural configurations, tokenization strategies, and data curation optimized for low computational overhead. Through this, we identify key design choices that yield substantial performance gains on both image and video tasks within minimal memory footprints. Our smallest model, SmolVLM-256M, uses less than 1GB GPU memory during inference and outperforms the 300-times larger Idefics-80B model, despite an 18-month development gap. Our largest model, at 2.2B parameters, rivals state-of-the-art VLMs consuming twice the GPU memory. SmolVLM models extend beyond static images, demonstrating robust video comprehension capabilities. Our results emphasize that strategic architectural optimizations, aggressive yet efficient tokenization, and carefully curated training data significantly enhance multimodal performance, facilitating practical, energy-efficient deployments at significantly smaller scales",

We generate preference learning pairs using a controllable hallucination mechanism and optimize data quality by leveraging lightweight, contrastive language-image encoders to evaluate and reverse pairs when necessary. Evaluations across public benchmarks and our newly introduced IC dataset, designed to challenge hallucination control, demonstrate that our model outperforms conventional techniques.

    "abstract": "A recent trend in LLMs is developing recurrent sub-quadratic models that improve long-context processing efficiency. We investigate leading large long-context models, focusing on how their fixed-size recurrent memory affects their performance. Our experiments reveal that, even when these models are trained for extended contexts, their use of long contexts remains underutilized. Specifically, we demonstrate that a chunk-based inference procedure, which identifies and processes only the most relevant portion of the input can mitigate recurrent memory failures and be effective for many long-context tasks: On LongBench, our method improves the overall performance of Falcon3-Mamba-Inst-7B by 14%, Falcon-Mamba-Inst-7B by 28%, RecurrentGemma-IT-9B by 50%, and RWKV6-Finch-7B by 51%. Surprisingly, this simple approach also leads to state-of-the-art results in the challenging LongBench v2 benchmark, showing competitive performance with equivalent size Transformers. Furthermore, our findings raise questions about whether recurrent models genuinely exploit long-range dependencies across multiple chunks, since our single-chunk strategy delivers stronger performance - even in tasks that presumably require cross-segment relations.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Key-Value (KV) cache quantization has become a widely adopted optimization technique for efficient large language models (LLMs) inference by reducing KV cache memory usage and mitigating memory-bound constraints. Recent studies have emphasized the importance of preserving the original precision of KVs for the first few tokens to ensure the protection of attention sinks. While this approach has proven effective in mitigating performance degradation, its underlying principles remain insufficiently understood. Moreover, it fails to address the recent discovery that attention sinks can emerge beyond the initial token positions. In this work, we elucidate the underlying mechanisms of attention sinks during inference by examining their role in the cross-layer evolution of extreme activation outliers. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the interplay between attention sinks and KV cache quantization. Based on our enhanced understanding, we introduce KVSink, a plug-and-play method that effectively predicts sink tokens with negligible overhead, enabling more thorough preservation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KVSink outperforms the existing Preserve-First-N (PFN) strategy, offering more effective preservation of attention sinks during KV cache quantization. Moreover, when applied to the well-established KVQuant method, KVSink further improves perplexity (PPL) and reduces reliance on 16-bit numerical outliers",

    "title": "PredGen: Accelerated Inference of Large Language Models through Input-Time Speculation for Real-Time Speech Interaction",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in real-time voice chat applications, typically in combination with text-to-speech (TTS) systems to generate audio responses. However, their large size often leads to noticeable latency between the end of user input and the start of audio output, resulting in suboptimal user experiences. This latency is particularly evident when LLMs are deployed as single-user voice assistants on consumer-grade hardware with limited computing capacity. We discovered that this latency is primarily dominated by the time it takes for the LLMs to generate the first sentence, which is required as input by the TTS systems that synthesize audio responses on a sentence-by-sentence basis. To address this bottleneck, we propose Predictive Generation (PredGen), a novel framework that mitigates—or even eliminates—this delay through speculative decoding at input time. PredGen generates candidate responses while the user is still speaking, enabling the system to begin TTS processing with minimal delay. Simulated experiments on the Lmsys and MT-Bench datasets show that the proposed method can effectively reduce the latency by around 2× across a wide range of use cases, while incurring only minimal additional computation cost at input time—computation that would otherwise go unused",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) possess impressive linguistic capabilities but often fail to faithfully retain factual knowledge, leading to hallucinations and unreliable outputs. Understanding LLMs' knowledge deficiencies by exhaustively evaluating against full-scale knowledge bases is computationally prohibitive, especially for closed-weight models. We propose stochastic error ascent (SEA), a scalable and efficient framework for discovering knowledge deficiencies (errors) in closed-weight LLMs under a strict query budget. Rather than naively probing all knowledge candidates, SEA formulates error discovery as a stochastic optimization process: it iteratively retrieves new high-error candidates by leveraging the semantic similarity to previously observed failures. To further enhance search efficiency and coverage, SEA employs hierarchical retrieval across document and paragraph levels, and constructs a relation directed acyclic graph to model error propagation and identify systematic failure modes. Empirically, SEA uncovers 40.7× more knowledge errors than Automated Capability Discovery and 26.7% more than AutoBencher, while reducing the cost-per-error by 599× and 9×, respectively. Human evaluation confirms the high quality of generated questions, while ablation and convergence analyses validate the contribution of each component in SEA. Further analysis on the discovered errors reveals correlated failure patterns across LLM families and recurring deficits, highlighting the need for better data coverage and targeted fine-tuning in future LLM development",

    "abstract": "Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) like DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI-o1 have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities, raising important questions about their biases in LLM-as-a-judge settings. We present a comprehensive benchmark comparing judging biases between LLMs and LRMs across both subjective preference-alignment datasets and objective fact-based datasets. Through investigation of bandwagon, authority, position, and distraction biases, we uncover four key findings: (1) despite their advanced reasoning capabilities, LRMs remain susceptible to the above biases; (2) LRMs demonstrate better robustness than LLMs specifically on fact-related datasets; (3) LRMs exhibit notable position bias, preferring options in later positions; and (4) we identify a novel \"superficial reflection bias\" where phrases mimicking reasoning (e.g., \"wait, let me think...\") significantly influence model judgments. To address these biases, we design and evaluate three mitigation strategies: specialized system prompts that reduce judging biases by up to 19\\% in preference alignment datasets and 14\\% in fact-related datasets, in-context learning that provides up to 27\\% improvement on preference tasks but shows inconsistent results on factual tasks, and a self-reflection mechanism that reduces biases by up to 10\\% in preference datasets and 16\\% in fact-related datasets, with self-reflection proving particularly effective for LRMs. Our work provides crucial insights for developing more reliable LLM-as-a-Judge frameworks, especially as LRMs become increasingly deployed as automated judges.
