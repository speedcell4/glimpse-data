    "title": "Inference under Information Constraints: Lower Bounds from Chi-Square Contraction",
    "abstract": "Multiple users getting one sample each from an unknown  distribution seek to enable a central server to conduct statistical inference. However, each player can only provide limited amount of information about its sample to the server.  We propose a unified framework to study such distributed inference problems under local information constraints.  We model the local information constraints by a set of channels $\\mathcal{W}$: each player chooses a channel from $\\mathcal{W}$, and then passes their data through this channel before transmitting the output to the server. The goal in this distributed setting is to understand the blow-up in data requirement imposed by the information constraints, compared to the centralized setting where all data samples are available to the server.  We introduce two notions of \\emph{chi-square fluctuations} which provide bounds for the  average distance and the distance to the  average of a local perturbation. When information constraints are imposed, by the standard data-processing inequality, pairwise distances contract and so do our chi-square fluctuations. We provide a precise characterization of this contraction for discrete $k$-ary distributions and use it to obtain to general lower bounds for distribution learning and testing under information constraints. Our results involve  notions of minmax and maxmin chi-square fluctuations, where  the maximum is over the choice of channels and the minimum is over perturbations. The former emerges when considering public-coin protocols for testing and is bounded in terms of Frobenius norm of a positive semidefinite matrix $H$, a function of the channel family $\\mathcal{W}$. The latter appears for private-coin protocols and is bounded by the nuclear norm of $H$ which is smaller than its Frobenius norm, establishing a separation between the sample complexity of testing using public and private coins",

    "title": "Learning in Non-convex Games with an Optimization Oracle",
    "abstract": "We consider  online learning in an adversarial, non-convex setting under the assumption that the learner has an access to an offline optimization oracle.  In the general setting of prediction with expert advice, Hazan and Koren established that in the optimization-oracle model, online learning requires exponentially more computation than statistical learning.  In this paper we show that by slightly strengthening the oracle model, the online and the statistical learning models become computationally equivalent. Our result holds for any Lipschitz and bounded (but not necessarily convex) function.  As an application we demonstrate how the offline oracle enables efficient computation of an equilibrium in non-convex games, that include GAN (generative adversarial networks) as a special case",

    "title": "Learning to Prune: Speeding up Repeated Computations",
    "abstract": "Algorithms often must solve sequences of closely related problems. If the algorithm runs a standard procedure with worst-case runtime guarantees on each instance, it will fail to take advantage of valuable structure shared across the problem instances. When a commuter drives from work to home, for example, there are typically only a handful of routes that will ever be the shortest path. A naïve algorithm that does not exploit this common structure may spend most of its time checking roads that will never be in the shortest path. More generally, we can often ignore large swaths of the search space that will likely never contain an optimal solution. We present an algorithm that learns to maximally prune the search space on repeated computations, thereby reducing runtime while provably outputting the correct solution each period with high probability. Our algorithm employs a simple explore-exploit technique resembling those used in online algorithms, though our setting is quite different. We prove that, with respect to our model of pruning search spaces, our approach is optimal up to constant factors. Finally, we illustrate the applicability of our model and algorithm to three classic problems: shortest-path routing, string search, and linear programming. We present experiments confirming that our simple algorithm is effective at significantly reducing the runtime of solving repeated computations",

A distribution $p$ over a poset is {\\em monotone} if, for any pair of domain elements $x$ and $y$ such that $x \\preceq y$, $p(x) \\leq p(y)$. To understand the sample complexity of this problem, we introduce a new property called \\emph{bigness} over a finite domain, where the distribution is $T$-big if the minimum probability for any domain element is at least $T$. We establish a lower bound of $\\Omega(n/\\log n)$ for testing bigness of distributions on  domains of size $n$. We then build on  these lower bounds to give $\\Omega(n/\\log{n})$ lower bounds for  testing monotonicity over a matching poset of size $n$ and significantly improved lower bounds over the hypercube poset. We give sublinear sample complexity bounds for testing bigness and for testing monotonicity over the matching poset.

    "title": "Testing Mixtures of Discrete Distributions",
    "abstract": "There has been significant study on the sample complexity of testing properties of distributions over large domains.  For many properties, it is known that the sample complexity can be substantially smaller than the domain size. For example, over a domain of size $n$, distinguishing the uniform distribution from distributions that are far from uniform in $\\ell_1$-distance uses only $O(\\sqrt{n})$ samples.  However, the picture is very different in the presence of arbitrary noise, even when the amount of noise is quite small.  In this case, one must distinguish if samples are coming from a distribution that is $\\epsilon$-close to uniform from the case where the distribution is $(1-\\epsilon)$-far from uniform.  The latter task requires nearly linear in $n$ samples (Valiant, 2008; Valiant and Valiant, 2017a). In this work, we present a noise model that on one hand is more tractable for the testing problem, and on the other hand represents a rich class of noise families.   In our model, the noisy distribution is a mixture of the original distribution and noise, where the latter is known to the tester either explicitly or via sample access; the form of the noise is also known \\emph{a priori}.  Focusing on the identity and closeness testing problems leads to the following mixture testing question:  Given samples of distributions $p, q_1,q_2$, can we test if $p$ is a mixture of $q_1$ and $q_2$?  We consider this general question in various scenarios that differ in terms of how the tester can access the distributions, and show that indeed this problem is more tractable.  Our results  show that the sample complexity of our testers are exactly the same as for the classical non-mixture case",

    "abstract": "We consider the following fundamental problem in the study of neural networks: given input examples $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ and their vector-valued labels, as defined by an underlying generative neural network, recover the weight matrices of this network. We consider two-layer networks, mapping $\\mathbb{R}^d$ to $\\mathbb{R}^m$, with a single hidden layer and $k$ non-linear activation units $f(\\cdot)$, where $f(x) = \\max \\{x , 0\\}$ is the ReLU activation function. Such a network is specified by two weight matrices, $\\mathbf{U}^* \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times k}, \\mathbf{V}^* \\in \\mathbb{R}^{k \\times d}$, such that the label of an example $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is given by $\\mathbf{U}^* f(\\mathbf{V}^* x)$, where $f(\\cdot)$ is applied coordinate-wise. Given $n$ samples $x^1,…,x^n \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ as a matrix $\\mathbf{X} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times n}$ and the label $\\mathbf{U}^* f(\\mathbf{V}^* \\mathbf{X})$ of the network on these samples, our goal is to recover the weight matrices $\\mathbf{U}^*$ and $\\mathbf{V}^*$. More generally, our labels $\\mathbf{U}^* f(\\mathbf{V}^* \\mathbf{X})$  may be corrupted by noise, and instead we observe $\\mathbf{U}^* f(\\mathbf{V}^* \\mathbf{X}) + \\mathbf{E}$ where $\\mathbf{E}$ is some noise matrix. Even in this case, we may still be interested in recovering good approximations to the weight matrices $\\mathbf{U}^*$ and $\\mathbf{V}^*$.  In this work, we develop algorithms and hardness results under varying assumptions on the input and noise. Although the problem is NP-hard even for $k=2$, by assuming Gaussian marginals over the input $\\mathbf{X}$ we are able to develop polynomial time algorithms for the approximate recovery of $\\mathbf{U}^*$ and $\\mathbf{V}^*$. Perhaps surprisingly, in the noiseless case our algorithms recover $\\mathbf{U}^*,\\mathbf{V}^*$ \\textit{exactly}, i.e. with no error, in \\textit{strongly} polynomial time. To the best of the our knowledge, this is the first algorithm to accomplish exact recovery for the ReLU activation function. For the noisy case, we give the first polynomial time algorithm that approximately recovers the weights in the presence of mean-zero noise $\\mathbf{E}$. Our algorithms generalize to a larger class of \\textit{rectified} activation functions, $f(x) = 0$ when $x\\leq 0$, and $f(x) > 0$ otherwise. Although our polynomial time results require $\\mathbf{U}^*$ to have full column rank, we also give a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm (in $k$) when $\\mathbf{U}^*$ does not have this property. Lastly, we give a  fixed-parameter tractable algorithm for more arbitrary noise matrices $\\mathbf{E}$, so long as they are independent of $\\mathbf{X}$",

We consider identity testing for both soft-constraint and hard-constraint systems. In particular, we prove hardness results in two prototypical cases, the \\emph{Ising model} and \\emph{proper colorings}, and explore whether identity testing is easier than structure learning. For the ferromagnetic (attractive) Ising model, Daskalasis et al. (2018) presented a polynomial time algorithm for identity testing. We prove hardness results in the antiferromagnetic (repulsive) setting in the same regime of parameters where structure learning is known to require a super-polynomial number of samples. Specifically, for $n$-vertex graphs of maximum degree $d$, we prove that if $|\\beta| d = \\omega(\\log{n})$ (where $\\beta$ is the inverse temperature parameter), then there is no identity testing algorithm  for the antiferromagnetic Ising model  that runs in polynomial time unless $RP\\!=\\!NP$. We also establish computational lower bounds for a broader set of parameters under the (randomized) exponential time hypothesis. In our proofs, we  use random graphs as gadgets; this is inspired by similar constructions in seminal works on the hardness of approximate counting. In the hard-constraint setting, we present hardness results  for identity testing for proper colorings.   Our results are based on the presumed hardness of \\textsc{#BIS}, the problem of (approximately) counting independent sets in bipartite graphs. In particular, we prove that identity testing for colorings is hard in the same range of parameters  where structure learning is known to be hard, which in turn matches the parameter regime for  NP-hardness of the corresponding decision problem",

The problem is formalized as factorizing a matrix $X (d \\times n)$ (whose columns are the signals) as $X = AY$, where $A$ has a prescribed number $m$ of columns (typically $m \\ll n$), and $Y$ has columns that are $k$-sparse (typically $k \\ll d$).

A remarkable result due to Yatracos shows that this problem is tractable in the following sense: there exists an algorithm that uses  $O(\\epsilon^{-2})$ samples from $p$ and outputs $q_i$ such that with high probability, $TV(q_i,p) \\leq 3\\cdot OPT + \\epsilon$, where $OPT= \\min\\{TV(q_1,p),TV(q_2,p)\\}$. Moreover, this result extends to any finite class of densities $\\mathcal{Q}$: there exists an algorithm that outputs the best density in $\\mathcal{Q}$ up to a multiplicative approximation factor of 3. We complement and extend this result by showing that: (i) the factor 3 can not be improved if one restricts the algorithm to output a density from $\\mathcal{Q}$, and (ii) if one allows the algorithm to output arbitrary densities (e.g. a mixture of densities from $\\mathcal{Q}$),  then the approximation factor can be reduced to 2, which is optimal. In particular this demonstrates an advantage of improper learning over proper in this setup. We develop two approaches to achieve the optimal approximation factor of $2$: an adaptive one and a static one. Both approaches are based on a geometric point of view of the problem and rely on estimating surrogate metrics to the total variation.

We show that the unknown parameter can always be decomposed into two components, one of which can be estimated at the fast rate $n^{-1/2}$, the other one being estimated at the slower rate $n^{-1/4}$.

We first show that the seemingly suboptimal path-length bound of (Wei and Luo, 2018) is in fact not improvable for adaptive adversary. Despite this negative result, we then develop two new algorithms, one that strictly improves over (Wei and Luo, 2018) with a smaller path-length measure, and the other which improves over (Wei and Luo, 2018) for oblivious adversary when the path-length is large. Our algorithms are based on the well-studied optimistic mirror descent framework, but importantly with several novel techniques, including new optimistic predictions, a slight bias towards recently selected arms, and the use of a hybrid regularizer similar to that of (Bubeck et al., 2018). Furthermore, we extend our results to linear bandit by showing a reduction to obtaining dynamic regret for a full-information problem, followed by a further reduction to convex body chasing.

To analyze more complex ranking data, several studies considered the Generalized Mallows model defined by Fligner and Verducci 1986. Despite the significant research interest of ranking distributions, the exact sample complexity of estimating the parameters of a Mallows and a Generalized Mallows Model is not well-understood. The main result of the paper is a tight sample complexity bound for learning Mallows and Generalized Mallows Model. We approach the learning problem by analyzing a more general model which interpolates between the single parameter Mallows Model and the $m$ parameter Mallows model. We call our model Mallows Block Model – referring to the Block Models that are a popular model in theoretical statistics. Our sample complexity analysis gives tight bound for learning the Mallows Block Model for any number of blocks. We provide essentially matching lower bounds for our sample complexity results. As a corollary of our analysis, it turns out that, if the central ranking is known, one single sample from the Mallows Block Model is sufficient to estimate the spread parameters with error that goes to zero as the size of the permutations goes to infinity.

    "abstract": "Gaussian processes (GP) are a stochastic processes, used  as Bayesian approach for the optimization of black-box functions. Despite their effectiveness in simple problems, GP-based algorithms hardly scale to high-dimensional functions, as their per-iteration time and space cost is at least \\emph{quadratic} in the number of dimensions $d$ and iterations $t$. Given a set of $A$ alternatives to choose from, the overall runtime $O(t^3 A)$ is prohibitive.  In this paper, we introduce BKB (\\textit{budgeted kernelized bandit}), a new approximate GP algorithm for optimization under bandit feedback that achieves near-optimal regret (and hence near-optimal convergence rate) with near-constant per-iteration complexity and remarkably no assumption on the input space or covariance of the GP. We combine a kernelized linear bandit algorithm (GP-UCB)  leverage score sampling as a randomized matrix sketching and  prove that selecting inducing points based on their posterior variance gives an accurate low-rank approximation of the GP, preserving variance estimates and confidence intervals. As a consequence, BKB does not suffer from \\emph{variance starvation}, an important problem faced by many previous sparse GP approximations. Moreover, we show that our procedure selects at most $\\widetilde{O}(d_{eff})$ points, where $d_{eff}$ is the \\emph{effective} dimension of the explored space, which is typically much smaller than both $d$ and $t$. This greatly reduces the dimensionality of the problem, thus leading to a $O(T A d_{eff}^2)$ runtime and $O(A d_{eff})$ space complexity",

Concretely, Multiplicative Weights Updates (MWU) with constant step-size is \\emph{Lyapunov chaotic} in the dual (payoff) space. Simply put, let’s assume that an observer asks the agents playing Matching-Pennies whether they prefer Heads or Tails (and by how much in terms of aggregate payoff so far).

This problem has remained a challenge since the early works of Tobin 1958, Amemiya et al. 1973, HAusman et al 1977, Breen et al. 1996, its applications are abundant, and its history dates back even further to the work of Galton 1897, Pearson 1908, Lee 1915, and Fisher 1931. While consistent estimators of the regression coefficients have been identified, the error rates are not well-understood, especially in high-dimensional settings. Under a “thickness assumption” about the covariance matrix of the covariates in the revealed sample, we provide a computationally efficient estimator for the coefficient vector $\\vec{w}$ from $n$ revealed samples that attains $\\ell_2$ error $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{k / n})$, almost recovering the guarantees of least squares in the standard (untruncated) linear regression setting.

We show that the polynomial dependence on $s$ is necessary. Moreover, we show that if the function is a linear $k$-junta with surface area at most $s$,  we give a $(s \\cdot k)^{O(k)}$-query non-adaptive algorithm to learn the function \\emph{up to a rotation of the basis}.  In particular, this implies that we can test the class of intersections of $k$ halfspaces in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ with query complexity independent of $n$",

    "title": "Computational Limitations in Robust Classification and Win-Win Results",
    "abstract": "We continue the study of statistical/computational tradeoffs in learning robust classifiers, following the recent work of Bubeck, Lee, Price and Razenshteyn who showed examples of classification tasks where (a) an efficient robust classifier exists, in the small-perturbation regime; (b) a non-robust classifier can be learned efficiently; but (c) it is computationally hard to learn a robust classifier, assuming the hardness of factoring large numbers. Indeed, the question of whether a robust classifier for their task exists in the large perturbation regime seems related to important open questions in computational number theory. In this work, we extend their work in three directions. First, we demonstrate classification tasks where computationally efficient robust classification is impossible, even when computationally unbounded robust classifiers exist. For this, we rely on the existence of average-case hard functions, requiring no cryptographic assumptions. Second, we show hard-to-robustly-learn classification tasks in the large-perturbation regime. Namely, we show that even though an efficient classifier that is very robust (namely, tolerant to large perturbations) exists, it is computationally hard to learn any non-trivial robust classifier. Our first construction relies on the existence of one-way functions, a minimal assumption in cryptography, and the second on the hardness of the learning parity with noise problem. In the latter setting, not only does a non-robust classifier exist, but also an efficient algorithm that generates fresh new labeled samples given access to polynomially many training examples (termed as generation by Kearns et al. (1994)). Third, we show that any such counterexample implies the existence of cryptographic primitives such as one-way functions or even forms of public-key encryption. This leads us to a win-win scenario: either we can quickly learn an efficient robust classifier, or we can construct new instances of popular and useful cryptographic primitives",

    "title": "Fast determinantal point processes via distortion-free intermediate sampling",
    "abstract": "Given a fixed $n\\times d$ matrix $\\mathbf{X}$, where $n\\gg d$, we study the complexity of sampling from a  distribution over all subsets of rows where the probability of a subset is proportional to the squared volume of the parallelepiped spanned by the rows (a.k.a. a determinantal point process). In this task, it is important to minimize the preprocessing cost of the procedure (performed once) as well as the  sampling cost (performed repeatedly). To that end, we propose a new determinantal point process algorithm which has the following two properties, both of which are novel: (1) a preprocessing step which runs in time $O\\big(\\text{number-of-non-zeros}(\\mathbf{X})\\cdot\\log n\\big)+\\text{poly}(d)$, and (2) a sampling step which runs in $\\text{poly}(d)$ time, independent of the number of rows $n$. We achieve this by introducing a new \\textit{regularized} determinantal point process (R-DPP), which serves as an intermediate distribution in the sampling procedure by reducing the number of rows from $n$ to $\\text{poly}(d)$. Crucially, this intermediate distribution does not distort the probabilities of the target sample. Our key novelty in defining the R-DPP  is the use of a Poisson random variable for controlling the probabilities of different subset sizes, leading to new determinantal formulas such as the normalization constant for this distribution. Our algorithm has applications in many diverse areas where determinantal point processes have been used, such as  machine learning, stochastic optimization, data summarization and low-rank matrix reconstruction",

    "title": "Minimax experimental design: Bridging the gap between statistical and worst-case approaches to least squares regression",
    "abstract": "In experimental design, we are given a large collection of vectors, each with a hidden response value that we assume derives from an underlying linear model, and we wish to pick a small subset of the vectors such that querying the corresponding responses will lead to a good estimator of the model.   A classical approach in statistics is to assume the responses are linear, plus zero-mean i.i.d. Gaussian noise, in which case the goal is to provide an unbiased estimator with smallest mean squared error (A-optimal design).   A related approach, more common in computer science, is to assume the responses are arbitrary but fixed, in which case the goal is to estimate the least squares solution using few responses, as quickly as possible, for worst-case inputs.    Despite many attempts, characterizing the relationship between these two approaches has proven elusive.   We address this by proposing a framework for experimental  design where the responses are produced by an arbitrary unknown distribution.   We show that there is an efficient randomized experimental design procedure that achieves strong variance bounds for an unbiased estimator using few responses  in this general model. Nearly tight bounds for the classical A-optimality criterion, as well as improved bounds for worst-case responses, emerge as special cases of this result.   In the process, we develop a new algorithm for a joint sampling distribution called volume sampling, and we propose a new i.i.d. importance sampling method: inverse score sampling.   A key novelty of our analysis is in developing new expected error bounds for worst-case regression by controlling the tail behavior of i.i.d. sampling via the jointness of volume sampling.   Our result motivates a new minimax-optimality criterion for experimental design with unbiased estimators, which can be viewed as an extension of both A-optimal design and sampling for worst-case regression",

Histograms are one of the most fundamental nonparametric families of distributions and have been extensively studied in computer science and statistics. We give the first identity tester for this problem with {\\em sub-learning} sample complexity in any fixed dimension and a nearly-matching sample complexity lower bound. In more detail, let $q$ be an unknown $d$-dimensional $k$-histogram distribution in fixed dimension $d$,  and $p$ be an explicitly given $d$-dimensional $k$-histogram. We want to correctly distinguish, with probability at least $2/3$, between the case that $p = q$ versus $\\|p-q\\|_1 \\geq \\epsilon$.

In particular, we show that it is not possible to obtain a polylogarithmic (in the sequential complexity of the problem) number of parallel rounds  with a polynomial (in the dimension) number of queries per round. In the majority of these settings and when the dimension of the space is polynomial in the inverse target accuracy, our lower bounds match the oracle complexity of sequential convex optimization, up to at most a logarithmic factor in the dimension, which makes them (nearly) tight. Prior to our work, lower bounds for parallel convex optimization algorithms were only known in a small fraction of the settings considered in this paper, mainly applying to Euclidean ($\\ell_2$) and $\\ell_\\infty$ spaces.

A notable weakness of most stability-based generalization bounds is that they hold only in expectation. Generalization with high probability has been established in a landmark paper of Bousquet and Elisseeff (2001) albeit at the expense of an additional $\\sqrt{n}$ factor in the bound. Specifically, their bound on the estimation error of any $\\gamma$-uniformly stable learning algorithm on $n$ samples and range in $[0,1]$ is $O(\\gamma \\sqrt{n \\log(1/\\delta)} + \\sqrt{\\log(1/\\delta)/n})$ with probability  $\\geq 1-\\delta$. The $\\sqrt{n}$ overhead makes the bound vacuous in the common settings where $\\gamma \\geq 1/\\sqrt{n}$. A stronger bound was recently proved by the authors (Feldman and Vondrak, 2018) that reduces the overhead to at most $O(n^{1/4})$. Still, both of these results give optimal generalization bounds only when $\\gamma = O(1/n)$. We prove a nearly tight bound of $O(\\gamma \\log(n)\\log(n/\\delta) + \\sqrt{\\log(1/\\delta)/n})$ on the estimation error of any $\\gamma$-uniformly stable algorithm.

For agnostic learning of third-order tensors with the square loss, we give the first polynomial time algorithm that obtains a “fast” (i.e., $O(1/n)$-type) rate improving over the rate obtained by reduction to matrix completion. Our prediction error rate to compete with the best $d\\times{}d\\times{}d$ tensor of rank-$r$ is $\\tilde{O}(r^{2}d^{3/2}/n)$.

This unlocks the standard toolbox for localization of empirical processes under the square loss, and allows us to establish restricted eigenvalue-type guarantees for various tensor regression models, with tensor completion as a special case.

Notably, we show that in the global oracle/statistical learning model, only logarithmic dependence on smoothness is required to find a near-stationary point, whereas polynomial dependence on smoothness is necessary in the local stochastic oracle model. In other words, the separation in complexity between the two models can be exponential, and the folklore understanding that smoothness is required to find stationary points is only weakly true for statistical learning. Our upper bounds are based on extensions of a recent “recursive regularization” technique proposed by Allen-Zhu (2018). We show how to extend the technique to achieve near-optimal rates, and in particular show how to leverage the extra information available in the global oracle model.

We analyze a two-stage sample splitting meta-algorithm that takes as input two arbitrary estimation algorithms: one for the target model and one for the nuisance model. We show that if the population risk satisfies a condition called Neyman orthogonality, the impact of the nuisance estimation error on the excess risk bound achieved by the meta-algorithm is of second order. Our theorem is agnostic to the particular algorithms used for the target and nuisance and only makes an assumption on their individual performance. This enables the use of a plethora of existing results from statistical learning and machine learning literature to give new guarantees for learning with a nuisance component. Moreover, by focusing on excess risk rather than parameter estimation, we can give guarantees under weaker assumptions than in previous works and accommodate the case where the target parameter belongs to a complex nonparametric class. We characterize conditions on the metric entropy such that oracle rates—rates of the same order as if we knew the nuisance model—are achieved. We also analyze the rates achieved by specific estimation algorithms such as variance-penalized empirical risk minimization, neural network estimation and sparse high-dimensional linear model estimation.

For this problem, all existing regret minimization algorithms for the fully-adversarial setting are based on a positive semidefinite convex relaxation, and hence require quadratic memory and SVD computation (either thin of full) on each iteration, which amounts to at least quadratic runtime per iteration. This is in stark contrast to a corresponding stochastic i.i.d. variant of the problem, which was studied extensively lately, and admits very efficient gradient ascent algorithms that work directly on the natural non-convex formulation of the problem, and hence require only linear memory and linear runtime per iteration. This raises the question: \\textit{can non-convex online gradient ascent algorithms be shown to minimize regret in online adversarial settings?} In this paper we take a step forward towards answering this question. We introduce an \\textit{adversarially-perturbed spiked-covariance model} in which, each data point is assumed to follow a fixed stochastic distribution with a non-zero spectral gap in the covariance matrix,  but is then perturbed with some adversarial vector. This model is a natural extension of a well studied standard \\textit{stochastic} setting that allows for non-stationary (adversarial) patterns to arise in the data  and hence, might serve as a significantly better approximation for real-world data-streams. We show that in an interesting regime of parameters, when the non-convex online gradient ascent algorithm is initialized with a “warm-start\" vector, it provably minimizes the regret with high probability. We further discuss the possibility of computing such a “warm-start\" vector, and also the use of regularization to obtain fast regret rates.

    "abstract": "We give a polynomial-time algorithm for learning neural networks with one layer of sigmoids feeding into any Lipschitz, monotone activation function (e.g., sigmoid or ReLU).  The algorithm succeeds with respect to {\\em any} distribution on the unit ball in $n$ dimensions (hidden weight vectors in the first layer have unit norm).  This is the first efficient algorithm for learning a general class of neural networks with more than one nonlinear layer that makes no restrictions on the VC-dimension of the network. Algorithms for learning relaxations of our model (e.g., allowing larger weight vectors in the first layer) would lead to breakthroughs on notoriously hard problems in Boolean function learning.  Thus, our results are “best possible” with respect to current techniques. Our algorithm– {\\em Alphatron}– is an iterative update rule that combines isotonic regression with kernel methods.  We use this algorithm to give a simple reduction for translating PAC learning algorithms to the more general, real-valued setting of {\\em probabilistic concepts}, a model that (unlike PAC learning) requires non-i.i.d. noise-tolerance.

    "abstract": "In semi-supervised classification, one is given access both to labeled and unlabeled data. As unlabeled data is typically cheaper to acquire than labeled data, this setup becomes advantageous as soon as one can exploit the unlabeled data in order to produce a better classifier than with labeled data alone. However, the conditions under which such an improvement is possible are not fully understood yet. Our analysis focuses on improvements in the \\emph{minimax} learning rate in terms of the number of labeled examples (with the number of unlabeled examples being allowed to depend on the number of labeled ones). We argue that for such improvements to be realistic and indisputable, certain specific conditions should be satisfied and previous analyses have failed to meet those conditions. We then demonstrate examples where these conditions can be met, in particular showing rate changes from $1/\\sqrt{\\ell}$ to $e^{-c\\ell}$ and from $1/\\sqrt{\\ell}$ to $1/\\ell$.

In this paper, we study sampling and convex optimization problems over manifolds of non-negative curvature proving polynomial running time in the dimension and other relevant parameters. Our algorithms assume a warm start. We first present a random walk based sampling algorithm and then combine it with simulated annealing for solving convex optimization problems.

Then, they repeatedly announce the state of the world they consider most likely to their neighbors, at the same time updating their beliefs based on their neighbors’ announcements. This model is extensively studied in economics since the work of Aumann (1976) and Geanakoplos and Polemarchakis (1982). It is known that the agents eventually agree with high probability on any network. It is often argued that the computations needed by agents in this model are difficult, but prior to our results there was no rigorous work showing this hardness.  We show that it is  $\\mathsf{PSPACE}$-hard for the agents to compute their actions in this model. Furthermore, we show that it is equally difficult even to approximate an agent’s posterior: It is $\\mathsf{PSPACE}$-hard to distinguish between the posterior being almost entirely concentrated on one state of the world or another",

    "abstract": "Robust mean estimation is the problem of estimating the mean $\\mu \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ of a $d$-dimensional distribution $D$ from a list of independent samples, an $\\varepsilon$-fraction of which have been arbitrarily corrupted by a malicious adversary. Recent algorithmic progress has resulted in the first polynomial-time algorithms which achieve \\emph{dimension-independent} rates of error: for instance, if $D$ has covariance $I$, in polynomial-time one may find $\\hat{\\mu}$ with $\\|\\mu - \\hat{\\mu}\\| \\leq O(\\sqrt{\\varepsilon})$. However, error rates achieved by current polynomial-time algorithms, while dimension-independent, are sub-optimal in many natural settings, such as when $D$ is sub-Gaussian, or has bounded $4$-th moments. In this work we give worst-case complexity-theoretic evidence that improving on the error rates of current polynomial-time algorithms for robust mean estimation may be computationally intractable in natural settings. We show that several natural approaches to improving error rates of current polynomial-time robust mean estimation algorithms would imply efficient algorithms for the small-set expansion problem, refuting Raghavendra and Steurer’s small-set expansion hypothesis (so long as $P \\neq NP$). We also give the first direct reduction to the robust mean estimation problem, starting from a plausible but nonstandard variant of the small-set expansion problem",

Such matrices arise in various computational contexts such as learning image manifolds, handwriting recognition, and multi-dimensional unfolding. In this work we study algorithms for low-rank approximation of distance matrices.

    "title": "Making the Last Iterate of SGD Information Theoretically Optimal",
    "abstract": "Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is one of the most widely used algorithms for large scale optimization problems. While classical theoretical analysis of SGD for convex problems studies (suffix) \\emph{averages} of iterates and obtains information theoretically optimal bounds on suboptimality, the \\emph{last point} of SGD is, by far, the most preferred choice in practice. The best known results for last point of SGD (Shamir and Zhang, 2013) however, are suboptimal compared to information theoretic lower bounds by a $\\log T$ factor, where $T$ is the number of iterations. Harvey et. al (2018) shows that in fact, this additional $\\log T$ factor is tight for standard step size sequences of $\\OTheta{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{t}}}$ and $\\OTheta{\\frac{1}{t}}$ for non-strongly convex and strongly convex settings, respectively. Similarly, even for subgradient descent (GD) when applied to non-smooth, convex functions, the best known step-size sequences still lead to $O(\\log T)$-suboptimal convergence rates (on the final iterate). The main contribution of this work is to design new step size sequences that enjoy information theoretically optimal bounds on the suboptimality of \\emph{last point} of SGD as well as GD. We achieve this by designing a modification scheme, that converts one sequence of step sizes to another so that the last point of SGD/GD with modified sequence has the same suboptimality guarantees as the average of SGD/GD with original sequence. We also show that our result holds with high-probability. We validate our results through simulations which demonstrate that the new step size sequence indeed improves the final iterate significantly compared to the standard step size sequences",

    "title": "An Optimal High-Order Tensor Method for Convex Optimization",
    "abstract": "This paper is concerned with finding an  optimal algorithm for minimizing a composite convex objective function. The basic setting is that the objective is the sum of two convex functions: the first function is smooth with up to the d-th order derivative information available, and the second function is possibly non-smooth, but its proximal tensor mappings can be computed approximately in an efficient manner. The problem is to find – in that setting – the best possible (optimal) iteration complexity for convex optimization. Along that line, for the smooth case (without the second non-smooth part in the objective), Nesterov (1983) proposed an optimal algorithm for the first-order methods (d=1) with iteration complexity O( 1 / k^2 ).  A high-order tensor algorithm with iteration complexity of O( 1 / k^{d+1} ) was proposed by Baes (2009) and Nesterov (2018). In this paper, we propose a new high-order tensor algorithm for the general composite case, with the iteration complexity of O( 1 / k^{(3d+1)/2} ), which matches the lower bound for the d-th order methods as established in Nesterov (2018) and Shamir et al. (2018), and hence is optimal. Our approach is based on the  Accelerated Hybrid Proximal Extragradient (A-HPE) framework proposed in Monteiro and Svaiter (2013), where a bisection procedure is installed for each A-HPE iteration. At each bisection step a proximal tensor subproblem is approximately solved, and the total number of bisection steps per A-HPE iteration is bounded by a logarithmic factor in the precision required",

    "title": "Parameter-Free Online Convex Optimization with Sub-Exponential Noise",
    "abstract": "We consider the problem of unconstrained online convex optimization (OCO) with sub-exponential noise, a strictly more general problem than the standard OCO. In this setting, the learner receives a subgradient of the loss functions corrupted by sub-exponential noise and strives to achieve optimal regret guarantee, without knowledge of the competitor norm, i.e., in a parameter-free way. Recently, Cutkosky and Boahen (COLT 2017) proved that, given unbounded subgradients, it is impossible to guarantee a sublinear regret due to an exponential penalty. This paper shows that it is possible to go around the lower bound by allowing the observed subgradients to be unbounded via stochastic noise. However, the presence of unbounded noise in unconstrained OCO is challenging; existing algorithms do not provide near-optimal regret bounds or fail to have a guarantee. So, we design a novel parameter-free OCO algorithm for Banach space, which we call BANCO, via a reduction to betting on noisy coins. We show that BANCO achieves the optimal regret rate in our problem. Finally, we show the application of our results to obtain a parameter-free locally private stochastic subgradient descent algorithm, and the connection to the law of iterated logarithms",

This framework subsumes  well studied problems such as finding the best arm or the best few arms. We consider distributions belonging to the single parameter exponential family and primarily consider partitions  where the vector of means of arms lie either in a given  set or its complement. The sets considered  correspond to distributions where there exists  a mean above a specified threshold, where the set is a half space and where either the set or its complement  is a polytope, or more generally, a convex set.  In these settings, we characterize the lower bounds on mean number of samples for each arm  highlighting  their dependence on the problem geometry. Further, inspired by the lower bounds, we propose algorithms  that can match these bounds asymptotically with decreasing probability of error.  Applications of this framework may be diverse.

This enables a uniform treatment of infinite classes such as half-spaces in $\\R^d$, which are ubiquitous in machine learning.  We study several fundamental questions in this model.
