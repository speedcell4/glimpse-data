    "title": "Invertible Denoising Network: A Light Solution for Real Noise Removal",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Invertible networks have various benefits for image denoising since they are lightweight, information-lossless, and memory-saving during back-propagation. However, applying invertible models to remove noise is challenging because the input is noisy, and the reversed output is clean, following two different distributions. We propose an invertible denoising network, InvDN, to address this challenge. InvDN transforms the noisy input into a low-resolution clean image and a latent representation containing noise. To discard noise and restore the clean image, InvDN replaces the noisy latent representation with another one sampled from a prior distribution during reversion. The denoising performance of InvDN is better than all the existing competitive models, achieving a new state-of-the-art result for the SIDD dataset while enjoying less run time. Moreover, the size of InvDN is far smaller, only having 4.2% of the number of parameters compared to the most recently proposed DANet. Further, via manipulating the noisy latent representation, InvDN is also able to generate noise more similar to the original one. Our code is available at: https://github.com/Yang-Liu1082/InvDN.git",

    "title": "Greedy Hierarchical Variational Autoencoders for Large-Scale Video Prediction",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "A video prediction model that generalizes to diverse scenes would enable intelligent agents such as robots to perform a variety of tasks via planning with the model. However, while existing video prediction models have produced promising results on small datasets, they suffer from severe underfitting when trained on large and diverse datasets. To address this underfitting challenge, we first observe that the ability to train larger video prediction models is often bottlenecked by the memory constraints of GPUs or TPUs. In parallel, deep hierarchical latent variable models can produce higher quality predictions by capturing the multi-level stochasticity of future observations, but end-to-end optimization of such models is notably difficult. Our key insight is that greedy and modular optimization of hierarchical autoencoders can simultaneously address both the memory constraints and the optimization challenges of large-scale video prediction. We introduce Greedy Hierarchical Variational Autoencoders (GHVAEs), a method that learns high-fidelity video predictions by greedily training each level of a hierarchical autoencoder. In comparison to state-of-the-art models, GHVAEs provide 17-55% gains in prediction performance on four video datasets, a 35-40% higher success rate on real robot tasks, and can improve performance monotonically by simply adding more modules",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks for video classification, just like image classification networks, may be subjected to adversarial manipulation. The main difference between image classifiers and video classifiers is that the latter usually use temporal information contained within the video. In this work we present a manipulation scheme for fooling video classifiers by introducing a flickering temporal perturbation that in some cases may be unnoticeable by human observers and is implementable in the real world. After demonstrating the manipulation of action classification of single videos, we generalize the procedure to make universal adversarial perturbation, achieving high fooling ratio. In addition, we generalize the universal perturbation and produce a temporal-invariant perturbation, which can be applied to the video without synchronizing the perturbation to the input. The attack was implemented on several target models and the transferability of the attack was demonstrated. These properties allow us to bridge the gap between simulated environment and real-world application, as will be demonstrated in this paper for the first time for an over-the-air flickering attack",

Previous methods perform the multi-modal fusion between language and vision at the decoding side of the network. And, linguistic feature interacts with visual feature of each scale separately, which ignores the continuous guidance of language to multi-scale visual features. In this work, we propose an encoder fusion network (EFN), which transforms the visual encoder into a multi-modal feature learning network, and uses language to refine the multi-modal features progressively. Moreover, a co-attention mechanism is embedded in the EFN to realize the parallel update of multi-modal features, which can promote the consistent of the cross-modal information representation in the semantic space. Finally, we propose a boundary enhancement module (BEM) to make the network pay more attention to the fine structure.

Active stereo cameras project a pseudo-random dot pattern on object surfaces to extract disparity independently of object texture.

In this work, we propose a method to jointly learn structured illumination and reconstruction, parameterized by a diffractive optical element and a neural network, in an end-to-end fashion. To this end, we introduce a differentiable image formation model for active stereo, relying on both wave and geometric optics, and a trinocular reconstruction network.

Recently emerged correspondence networks propose to perform those steps inside a single network but suffer from low matching resolution due to the memory bottleneck. In this work, we propose a new perspective to estimate correspondences in a detect-to-refine manner, where we first predict patch-level match proposals and then refine them. We present Patch2Pix, a novel refinement network that refines match proposals by regressing pixel-level matches from the local regions defined by those proposals and jointly rejecting outlier matches with confidence scores. Patch2Pix is weakly supervised to learn correspondences that are consistent with the epipolar geometry of an input image pair. We show that our refinement network significantly improves the performance of correspondence networks on image matching, homography estimation, and localization tasks. In addition, we show that our learned refinement generalizes to fully-supervised methods without re-training, which leads us to state-of-the-art localization performance.

The proposed PAT model enjoys several merits. First, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to exploit the transformer encoder-decoder architecture for occluded person Re-ID in a unified deep model. Second, to learn part prototypes well with only identity labels, we design two effective mechanisms including part diversity and part discriminability. Consequently, we can achieve diverse part discovery for occluded person Re-ID in a weakly supervised manner.

    "abstract": "We present a novel counterfactual framework for both Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) and Open-Set Recognition (OSR), whose common challenge is generalizing to the unseen-classes by only training on the seen-classes. Our idea stems from the observation that the generated samples for unseen-classes are often out of the true distribution, which causes severe recognition rate imbalance between the seen-class (high) and unseen-class (low). We show that the key reason is that the generation is not Counterfactual Faithful, and thus we propose a faithful one, whose generation is from the sample-specific counterfactual question: What would the sample look like, if we set its class attribute to a certain class, while keeping its sample attribute unchanged? Thanks to the faithfulness, we can apply the Consistency Rule to perform unseen/seen binary classification, by asking: Would its counterfactual still look like itself? If \"yes\", the sample is from a certain class, and \"no\" otherwise. Through extensive experiments on ZSL and OSR, we demonstrate that our framework effectively mitigates the seen/unseen imbalance and hence significantly improves the overall performance. Note that this framework is orthogonal to existing methods, thus, it can serve as a new baseline to evaluate how ZSL/OSR models generalize.

This paper introduces Patch-NetVLAD, which provides a novel formulation for combining the advantages of both local and global descriptor methods by deriving patch-level features from NetVLAD residuals. Unlike the fixed spatial neighborhood regime of existing local keypoint features, our method enables aggregation and matching of deep-learned local features defined over the feature-space grid. We further introduce a multi-scale fusion of patch features that have complementary scales (i.e. patch sizes) via an integral feature space and show that the fused features are highly invariant to both condition (season, structure, and illumination) and viewpoint (translation and rotation) changes. Patch-NetVLAD achieves state-of-the-art visual place recognition results in computationally limited scenarios, validated on a range of challenging real-world datasets, including winning the Facebook Mapillary Visual Place Recognition Challenge at ECCV2020. It is also adaptable to user requirements, with a speed-optimised version operating over an order of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art.

Recent research has explored generating stereophonic audios guided by visual cues and multi-channel audio collections in a fully-supervised manner.

In this work, we propose PseudoBinaural, an effective pipeline that is free of binaural recordings. The key insight is to carefully build pseudo visual-stereo pairs with mono data for training. Specifically, we leverage spherical harmonic decomposition and head-related impulse response (HRIR) to identify the relationship between the location of a sound source and the received binaural audio. Then in the visual modality, corresponding visual cues of the mono data are manually placed at sound source positions to form the pairs. Compared to fully-supervised paradigms, our binaural-recording-free pipeline shows great stability in the cross-dataset evaluation and comparable performance under subjective preference. Moreover, combined with binaural recorded data, our method is able to further boost the performance of binaural audio generation under supervised settings",

Our approach simultaneously recovers the intrinsic and extrinsic calibration of a camera from line-features only. This enables uncalibrated devices to both localize themselves within an existing map as well as contribute to the map, while preserving the privacy of the image contents.

    "abstract": "In medical image analysis, it is typical to collect multiple annotations, each from a different clinical expert or rater, in the expectation that possible diagnostic errors could be mitigated. Meanwhile, from the computer vision practitioner viewpoint, it has been a common practice to adopt the ground-truth obtained via either the majority-vote or simply one annotation from a preferred rater. This process, however, tends to overlook the rich information of agreement or disagreement ingrained in the raw multi-rater annotations. To address this issue, we propose to explicitly model the multi-rater (dis-)agreement, dubbed MRNet, which has two main contributions. First, an expertise-aware inferring module or EIM is devised to embed the expertise level of individual raters as prior knowledge, to form high-level semantic features. Second, our approach is capable of reconstructing multi-rater gradings from coarse predictions, with the multi-rater (dis-)agreement cues being further exploited to improve the segmentation performance. To our knowledge, our work is the first in producing calibrated predictions under different expertise levels for medical image segmentation. Extensive empirical experiments are conducted across five medical segmentation tasks of diverse imaging modalities. In these experiments, superior performance of our MRNet is observed comparing to the state-of-the-arts, indicating the effectiveness and applicability of our MRNet toward a wide range of medical segmentation tasks",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recent development of Under-Display Camera (UDC) systems provides a true bezel-less and notch-free viewing experience on smartphones (and TV, laptops, tablets), while allowing images to be captured from the selfie camera embedded underneath. In a typical UDC system, the microstructure of the semi-transparent organic light-emitting diode (OLED) pixel array attenuates and diffracts the incident light on the camera, resulting in significant image quality degradation. Oftentimes, noise, flare, haze, and blur can be observed in UDC images. In this work, we aim to analyze and tackle the aforementioned degradation problems. We define a physics-based image formation model to better understand the degradation. In addition, we utilize one of the world's first commodity UDC smartphone prototypes to measure the real-world Point Spread Function (PSF) of the UDC system, and provide a model-based data synthesis pipeline to generate realistically degraded images. We specially design a new domain knowledge-enabled Dynamic Skip Connection Network (DISCNet) to restore the UDC images. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real UDC data. Our physics-based image formation model and proposed DISCNet can provide foundations for further exploration in UDC image restoration, and even for general diffraction artifact removal in a broader sense",

    "abstract": "It is nontrivial to store rapidly growing big data nowadays, which demands high-performance lossless compression techniques. Likelihood-based generative models have witnessed their success on lossless compression, where flow based models are desirable in allowing exact data likelihood optimisation with bijective mappings. However, common continuous flows are in contradiction with the discreteness of coding schemes, which requires either 1) imposing strict constraints on flow models that degrades the performance or 2) coding numerous bijective mapping errors which reduces the efficiency. In this paper, we investigate volume preserving flows for lossless compression and show that a bijective mapping without error is possible. We propose Numerical Invertible Volume Preserving Flow (iVPF) which is derived from the general volume preserving flows. By introducing novel computation algorithms on flow models, an exact bijective mapping is achieved without any numerical error. We also propose a lossless compression algorithm based on iVPF. Experiments on various datasets show that the algorithm based on iVPF achieves state-of-the-art compression ratio over lightweight compression algorithms",

To address this issue, we propose a data-uncertainty guided multi-phase learning method for semi-supervised object detection. We comprehensively consider divergent types of unlabeled images according to their difficulty levels, utilize them in different phases and ensemble models from different phases together to generate ultimate results. Image uncertainty guided easy data selection and region uncertainty guided RoI Re-weighting are involved in multi-phase learning and enable the detector to concentrate on more certain knowledge.

    "abstract": "Single image dehazing is a challenging ill-posed problem due to the severe information degeneration. However, existing deep learning based dehazing methods only adopt clear images as positive samples to guide the training of dehazing network while negative information is unexploited. Moreover, most of them focus on strengthening the dehazing network with an increase of depth and width, leading to a significant requirement of computation and memory. In this paper, we propose a novel contrastive regularization (CR) built upon contrastive learning to exploit both the information of hazy images and clear images as negative and positive samples, respectively. CR ensures that the restored image is pulled to closer to the clear image and pushed to far away from the hazy image in the representation space. Furthermore, considering trade-off between performance and memory storage, we develop a compact dehazing network based on autoencoder-like (AE) framework. It involves an adaptive mixup operation and a dynamic feature enhancement module, which can benefit from preserving information flow adaptively and expanding the receptive field to improve the network's transformation capability, respectively. We term our dehazing network with autoencoder and contrastive regularization as AECR-Net. The extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our AECR-Net surpass the state-of-the-art approaches. The code is released in https://github.com/GlassyWu/AECR-Net",

These methods heavily rely on the region proposal mechanisms and ROI-based instance-level features to design fine-grained feature alignment modules with respect to the foreground objects. However, for one-stage detectors, it is hard or even impossible to obtain explicit instance-level features in the detection pipelines. Motivated by this, we propose an Implicit Instance-Invariant Network (I3Net), which is tailored for adapting one-stage detectors and implicitly learns instance-invariant features via exploiting the natural characteristics of deep features in different layers. Specifically, we facilitate the adaptation from three aspects: (1) Dynamic and Class-Balanced Reweighting (DCBR) strategy, which considers the coexistence of intra-domain and intra-class variations to assign larger weights to those sample-scarce categories and easy-to-adapt samples; (2) Category-aware Object Pattern Matching (COPM) module, which boosts the cross-domain foreground objects matching guided by the categorical information and suppresses the uninformative background features; (3) Regularized Joint Category Alignment (RJCA) module, which jointly enforces the category alignment at different domain-specific layers with a consistency regularization.

Existing methods are mostly two-stage based--one stage for person localization and the other stage for individual body mesh estimation, leading to redundant pipelines with high computation cost and degraded performance for complex scenes (e.g., occluded person instances). In this work, we present a single stage model, Body Meshes as Points (BMP), to simplify the pipeline and lift both efficiency and performance. In particular, BMP adopts a new method that represents multiple person instances as points in the spatial-depth space where each point is associated with one body mesh. Hinging on such representations, BMP can directly predict body meshes for multiple persons in a single stage by concurrently localizing person instance points and estimating the corresponding body meshes. To better reason about depth ordering of all the persons within the same scene, BMP designs a simple yet effective inter-instance ordinal depth loss to obtain depth-coherent body mesh estimation. BMP also introduces a novel keypoint-aware augmentation to enhance model robustness to occluded person instances. Comprehensive experiments on benchmarks Panoptic, MuPoTS-3D and 3DPW clearly demonstrate the state-of-the-art efficiency of BMP for multi-person body mesh estimation, together with outstanding accuracy.

    "abstract": "Acquisition and rendering of photo-realistic human heads is a highly challenging research problem of particular importance for virtual telepresence. Currently, the highest quality is achieved by volumetric approaches trained in a person-specific manner on multi-view data. These models better represent fine structure, such as hair, compared to simpler mesh-based models. Volumetric models typically employ a global code to represent facial expressions, such that they can be driven by a small set of animation parameters. While such architectures achieve impressive rendering quality, they can not easily be extended to the multi-identity setting. In this paper, we devise a novel approach for predicting volumetric avatars of the human head given just a small number of inputs. We enable generalization across identities by a novel parameterization that combines neural radiance fields with local, pixel-aligned features extracted directly from the inputs, thus side-stepping the need for very deep or complex networks. Our approach is trained in an end-to-end manner solely based on a photometric re-rendering loss without requiring explicit 3D supervision. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms the existing state of the art in terms of quality and is able to generate faithful facial expressions in a multi-identity setting",

    "abstract": "Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have gained considerable attention owing to their ability to reproduce images. However, they can recreate training images faithfully despite image degradation in the form of blur, noise, and compression, generating similarly degraded images. To solve this problem, the recently proposed noise robust GAN (NR-GAN) provides a partial solution by demonstrating the ability to learn a clean image generator directly from noisy images using a two-generator model comprising image and noise generators. However, its application is limited to noise, which is relatively easy to decompose owing to its additive and reversible characteristics, and its application to irreversible image degradation, in the form of blur, compression, and combination of all, remains a challenge. To address these problems, we propose blur, noise, and compression robust GAN (BNCR-GAN) that can learn a clean image generator directly from degraded images without knowledge of degradation parameters (e.g., blur kernel types, noise amounts, or quality factor values). Inspired by NR-GAN, BNCR-GAN uses a multiple-generator model composed of image, blur-kernel, noise, and quality-factor generators. However, in contrast to NR-GAN, to address irreversible characteristics, we introduce masking architectures adjusting degradation strength values in a data-driven manner using bypasses before and after degradation. Furthermore, to suppress uncertainty caused by the combination of blur, noise, and compression, we introduce adaptive consistency losses imposing consistency between irreversible degradation processes according to the degradation strengths. We demonstrate the effectiveness of BNCR-GAN through large-scale comparative studies on CIFAR-10 and a generality analysis on FFHQ.

By contrast, we contribute a procedure to generate, for the first time, physical adversarial examples that are invisible to human eyes. Rather than modifying the victim object with visible artifacts, we modify light that illuminates the object. We demonstrate how an attacker can craft a modulated light signal that adversarially illuminates a scene and causes targeted misclassifications on a state-of-the-art ImageNet deep learning model. Concretely, we exploit the radiometric rolling shutter effect in commodity cameras to create precise striping patterns that appear on images. To human eyes, it appears like the object is illuminated, but the camera creates an image with stripes that will cause ML models to output the attacker-desired classification. We conduct a range of simulation and physical experiments with LEDs, demonstrating targeted attack rates up to 84%",

In this work, we propose Introvert, a model which predicts human path based on his/her observed trajectory and the dynamic scene context, captured via a conditional 3D visual attention mechanism working on the input video. Introvert infers both environment constraints and social interactions through observing the dynamic scene instead of communicating with other humans, hence, its computational cost is independent of how crowded the surrounding of a target human is. In addition, to focus on relevant interactions and constraints for each human, Introvert conditions its 3D attention model on the observed trajectory of the target human to extract and focus on relevant spatio-temporal primitives.

To this end, we develop a bio-inspired framework, termed Positioning and Focus Network (PFNet), which mimics the process of predation in nature. Specifically, our PFNet contains two key modules, i.e., the positioning module (PM) and the focus module (FM). The PM is designed to mimic the detection process in predation for positioning the potential target objects from a global perspective and the FM is then used to perform the identification process in predation for progressively refining the coarse prediction via focusing on the ambiguous regions. Notably, in the FM, we develop a novel distraction mining strategy for the distraction region discovery and removal, to benefit the performance of estimation.

    "abstract": "Semantic scene understanding from point clouds is particularly challenging as the points reflect only a sparse set of the underlying 3D geometry. Previous works often convert point cloud into regular grids (e.g. voxels or bird-eye view images), and resort to grid-based convolutions for scene understanding. In this work, we introduce RfD-Net that jointly detects and reconstructs dense object surfaces directly from raw point clouds. Instead of representing scenes with regular grids, our method leverages the sparsity of point cloud data and focuses on predicting shapes that are recognized with high objectness. With this design, we decouple the instance reconstruction into global object localization and local shape prediction. It not only eases the difficulty of learning 2-D manifold surfaces from sparse 3D space, the point clouds in each object proposal convey shape details that support implicit function learning to reconstruct any high-resolution surfaces. Our experiments indicate that instance detection and reconstruction present complementary effects, where the shape prediction head shows consistent effects on improving object detection with modern 3D proposal network backbones. The qualitative and quantitative evaluations further demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms the state-of-the-arts and improves over 11 of mesh IoU in object reconstruction",

    "abstract": "Style transfer aims to render the content of a given image in the graphical/artistic style of another image. The fundamental concept underlying Neural Style Transfer (NST) is to interpret style as a distribution in the feature space of a Convolutional Neural Network, such that a desired style can be achieved by matching its feature distribution. We show that most current implementations of that concept have important theoretical and practical limitations, as they only partially align the feature distributions. We propose a novel approach that matches the distributions more precisely, thus reproducing the desired style more faithfully, while still being computationally efficient. Specifically, we adapt the dual form of Central Moment Discrepancy, as recently proposed for domain adaptation, to minimize the difference between the target style and the feature distribution of the output image. The dual interpretation of this metric explicitly matches all higher-order centralized moments and is therefore a natural extension of existing NST methods that only take into account the first and second moments. Our experiments confirm that the strong theoretical properties also translate to visually better style transfer, and better disentangle style from semantic image content",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) has attracted extensive attention due to its efficiency in searching for cell structures. DARTS mainly focuses on the operation search and derives the cell topology from the operation weights. However, the operation weights can not indicate the importance of cell topology and result in poor topology rating correctness. To tackle this, we propose to Decouple the Operation and Topology Search (DOTS), which decouples the topology representation from operation weights and makes an explicit topology search. DOTS is achieved by introducing a topology search space that contains combinations of candidate edges. The proposed search space directly reflects the search objective and can be easily extended to support a flexible number of edges in the searched cell. Existing gradient-based NAS methods can be incorporated into DOTS for further improvement by the topology search. Considering that some operations (e.g., Skip-Connection) can affect the topology, we propose a group operation search scheme to preserve topology-related operations for a better topology search. The experiments on CIFAR10/100 and ImageNet demonstrate that DOTS is an effective solution for differentiable NAS. The code is released at https://github.com/guyuchao/DOTS",

We introduce a novel high-quality neural simulator referred to as DriveGAN that achieves controllability by disentangling different components without supervision. In addition to steering controls, it also includes controls for sampling features of a scene, such as the weather as well as the location of non-player objects. Since DriveGAN is a fully differentiable simulator, it further allows for re-simulation of a given video sequence, offering an agent to drive through a recorded scene again, possibly taking different actions. We train DriveGAN on multiple datasets, including 160 hours of real-world driving data. We showcase that our approach greatly surpasses the performance of previous data-driven simulators, and allows for new features not explored before",

We systematically study the cause of this imbalanced style transferability (IST) and propose a simple yet effective solution to mitigate this issue. Our studies show that the IST issue is related to the conventional AST style loss, and reveal that the root cause is the equal weightage of training samples irrespective of the properties of their corresponding style images, which biases the model towards certain styles. Through investigation of the theoretical bounds of the AST style loss, we propose a new loss that largely overcomes IST.

Typically, such a task aims at inferring both the action category and localization of the start and end frame for each action instance in a long, untrimmed video.

Instead, anchor-free methods is lighter, getting rid of redundant hyper-parameters, but gains few attention. In this paper, we propose the first purely anchor-free temporal localization method, which is both efficient and effective.

    "abstract": "In many real-world applications, the relative depth of objects in an image is crucial for scene understanding. Recent approaches mainly tackle the problem of depth prediction in monocular images by treating the problem as a regression task. Yet, being interested in an order relation in the first place, ranking methods suggest themselves as a natural alternative to regression, and indeed, ranking approaches leveraging pairwise comparisons as training information (\"object A is closer to the camera than B\") have shown promising performance on this problem. In this paper, we elaborate on the use of so-called listwise ranking as a generalization of the pairwise approach. Our method is based on the Plackett-Luce (PL) model, a probability distribution on rankings, which we combine with a state-of-the-art neural network architecture and a simple sampling strategy to reduce training complexity. Moreover, taking advantage of the representation of PL as a random utility model, the proposed predictor offers a natural way to recover (shift-invariant) metric depth information from ranking-only data provided at training time.

Given an image (e.g. from a rgb-camera) and a general point cloud (e.g. from a 3D Lidar scanner) captured at different locations in the same scene, our method estimates the relative rigid transformation between the coordinate frames of the camera and Lidar. Learning common feature descriptors to establish correspondences for the registration is inherently challenging due to the lack of appearance and geometric correlations across the two modalities. We circumvent the difficulty by converting the registration problem into a classification and inverse camera projection optimization problem. A classification neural network is designed to label whether the projection of each point in the point cloud is within or beyond the camera frustum. These labeled points are subsequently passed into a novel inverse camera projection solver to estimate the relative pose.

To emulate the human ability in controlling caption generation, current CIC studies focus exclusively on control signals concerning objective properties, such as contents of interest or descriptive patterns. However, we argue that almost all existing objective control signals have overlooked two indispensable characteristics of an ideal control signal: 1) Event-compatible: all visual contents referred to in a single sentence should be compatible with the described activity. 2) Sample-suitable: the control signals should be suitable for a specific image sample. To this end, we propose a new control signal for CIC: Verb-specific Semantic Roles (VSR). VSR consists of a verb and some semantic roles, which represents a targeted activity and the roles of entities involved in this activity. Given a designated VSR, we first train a grounded semantic role labeling (GSRL) model to identify and ground all entities for each role. Then, we propose a semantic structure planner (SSP) to learn human-like descriptive semantic structures. Lastly, we use a role-shift captioning model to generate the captions. Extensive experiments and ablations demonstrate that our framework can achieve better controllability than several strong baselines on two challenging CIC benchmarks. Besides, we can generate multi-level diverse captions easily. The code is available at: https://github.com/mad-red/VSR-guided-CIC",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples that mislead the models with imperceptible perturbations. Though adversarial attacks have achieved incredible success rates in the white-box setting, most existing adversaries often exhibit weak transferability in the black-box setting, especially under the scenario of attacking models with defense mechanisms. In this work, we propose a new method called variance tuning to enhance the class of iterative gradient based attack methods and improve their attack transferability. Specifically, at each iteration for the gradient calculation, instead of directly using the current gradient for the momentum accumulation, we further consider the gradient variance of the previous iteration to tune the current gradient so as to stabilize the update direction and escape from poor local optima. Empirical results on the standard ImageNet dataset demonstrate that our method could significantly improve the transferability of gradient-based adversarial attacks. Besides, our method could be used to attack ensemble models or be integrated with various input transformations. Incorporating variance tuning with input transformations on iterative gradient-based attacks in the multi-model setting, the integrated method could achieve an average success rate of 90.1% against nine advanced defense methods, improving the current best attack performance significantly by 85.1%.

    "abstract": "While generative adversarial networks (GANs) can successfully produce high-quality images, they can be challenging to control. Simplifying GAN-based image generation is critical for their adoption in graphic design and artistic work. This goal has led to significant interest in methods that can intuitively control the appearance of images generated by GANs. In this paper, we present HistoGAN, a color histogram-based method for controlling GAN-generated images' colors. We focus on color histograms as they provide an intuitive way to describe image color while remaining decoupled from domain-specific semantics. Specifically, we introduce an effective modification of the recent StyleGAN architecture [31] to control the colors of GAN-generated images specified by a target color histogram feature. We then describe how to expand HistoGAN to recolor real images. For image recoloring, we jointly train an encoder network along with HistoGAN. The recoloring model, ReHistoGAN, is an unsupervised approach trained to encourage the network to keep the original image's content while changing the colors based on the given target histogram. We show that this histogram-based approach offers a better way to control GAN-generated and real images' colors while producing more compelling results compared to existing alternative strategies",

Firstly, we propose a Bilateral Complementary Network (BiCnet) for spatial complementarity modeling. Specifically, BiCnet contains two branches. Detail Branch processes frames at original resolution to preserve the detailed visual clues, and Context Branch with a down-sampling strategy is employed to capture long-range contexts. On each branch, BiCnet appends multiple parallel and diverse attention modules to discover divergent body parts for consecutive frames, so as to obtain an integral characteristic of target identity. Furthermore, a Temporal Kernel Selection (TKS) block is designed to capture short-term as well as long-term temporal relations by an adaptive mode. TKS can be inserted into BiCnet at any depth to construct BiCnet-TKS for spatial-temporal modeling. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks show that BiCnet-TKS outperforms state-of-the-arts with about 50% less computations.

    "abstract": "Semantic correspondence is a fundamental problem in computer vision, which aims at establishing dense correspondences across images depicting different instances under the same category. This task is challenging due to large intra-class variations and a severe lack of ground truth. A popular solution is to learn correspondences from synthetic data. However, because of the limited intra-class appearance and background variations within synthetically generated training data, the model's capability for handling \"real\" image pairs using such strategy is intrinsically constrained. We address this problem with the use of a novel Probabilistic Model Distillation (PMD) approach which transfers knowledge learned by a probabilistic teacher model on synthetic data to a static student model with the use of unlabeled real image pairs. A probabilistic supervision reweighting (PSR) module together with a confidence-aware loss (CAL) is used to mine the useful knowledge and alleviate the impact of errors. Experimental results on a variety of benchmarks show that our PMD achieves state-of-the-art performance. To demonstrate the generalizability of our approach, we extend PMD to incorporate stronger supervision for better accuracy -- the probabilistic teacher is trained with stronger key-point supervision. Again, we observe the superiority of our PMD. The extensive experiments verify that PMD is able to infer more reliable supervision signals from the probabilistic teacher for representation learning and largely alleviate the influence of errors in pseudo labels",

In this paper, we propose a separable self-attention (SSA) module, which models spatial and temporal correlations sequentially, so that spatial contexts can be efficiently used in temporal modeling. By adding SSA module into 2D CNN, we build a SSA network (SSAN) for video representation learning. On the task of video action recognition, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on Something-Something and Kinetics-400 datasets. Our models often outperform counterparts with shallower network and less modality.

To address this limitation, we present SceneGen, a neural autoregressive model of traffic scenes that eschews the need for rules and heuristics. In particular, given the ego-vehicle state and a high definition map of surrounding area, SceneGen inserts actors of various classes into the scene and synthesizes their sizes, orientations, and velocities.

The framework of variational autoencoder (VAE) is commonly used to disentangle independent factors from observations. However, in real scenarios, factors with semantics are not necessarily independent. Instead, there might be an underlying causal structure which renders these factors dependent. We thus propose a new VAE based framework named CausalVAE, which includes a Causal Layer to transform independent exogenous factors into causal endogenous ones that correspond to causally related concepts in data. We further analyze the model identifiabitily, showing that the proposed model learned from observations recovers the true one up to a certain degree. Experiments are conducted on various datasets, including synthetic and real word benchmark CelebA. Results show that the causal representations learned by CausalVAE are semantically interpretable, and their causal relationship as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is identified with good accuracy.

Given a video sequence as an input sample, we improve the temporal feature representations of MoCo from two perspectives. First, we introduce a generator to drop out several frames from this sample temporally. The discriminator is then learned to encode similar feature representations regardless of frame removals. By adaptively dropping out different frames during training iterations of adversarial learning, we augment this input sample to train a temporally robust encoder. Second, we use temporal decay to model key attenuation in the memory queue when computing the contrastive loss. As the momentum encoder updates after keys enqueue, the representation ability of these keys degrades when we use the current input sample for contrastive learning. This degradation is reflected via temporal decay to attend the input sample to recent keys in the queue. As a result, we adapt MoCo to learn video representations without empirically designing pretext tasks. By empowering the temporal robustness of the encoder and modeling the temporal decay of the keys, our VideoMoCo improves MoCo temporally based on contrastive learning.

    "abstract": "Recent neural view synthesis methods have achieved impressive quality and realism, surpassing classical pipelines which rely on multi-view reconstruction. State-of-the-Art methods, such as NeRF, are designed to learn a single scene with a neural network and require dense multi-view inputs. Testing on a new scene requires re-training from scratch, which takes 2-3 days. In this work, we introduce Stereo Radiance Fields (SRF), a neural view synthesis approach that is trained end-to-end, generalizes to new scenes, and requires only sparse views at test time. The core idea is a neural architecture inspired by classical multi-view stereo methods, which estimates surface points by finding similar image regions in stereo images. In SRF, we predict color and density for each 3D point given an encoding of its stereo correspondence in the input images. The encoding is implicitly learned by an ensemble of pair-wise similarities -- emulating classical stereo. Experiments show that SRF learns structure instead of overfitting on a scene. We train on multiple scenes of the DTU dataset and generalize to new ones without re-training, requiring only 10 sparse and spread-out views as input. We show that 10-15 minutes of fine-tuning further improve the results, achieving significantly sharper, more detailed results than scene-specific models.

    "abstract": "We present STaR, a novel method that performs Self-supervised Tracking and Reconstruction of dynamic scenes with rigid motion from multi-view RGB videos without any manual annotation. Recent work has shown that neural networks are surprisingly effective at the task of compressing many views of a scene into a learned function which maps from a viewing ray to an observed radiance value via volume rendering. Unfortunately, these methods lose all their predictive power once any object in the scene has moved. In this work, we explicitly model rigid motion of objects in the context of neural representations of radiance fields. We show that without any additional human specified supervision, we can reconstruct a dynamic scene with a single rigid object in motion by simultaneously decomposing it into its two constituent parts and encoding each with its own neural representation. We achieve this by jointly optimizing the parameters of two neural radiance fields and a set of rigid poses which align the two fields at each frame. On both synthetic and real world datasets, we demonstrate that our method can render photorealistic novel views, where novelty is measured on both spatial and temporal axes. Our factored representation furthermore enables animation of unseen object motion",

    "abstract": "Generalization of machine learning models trained on a set of source domains on unseen target domains with different statistics, is a challenging problem. While many approaches have been proposed to solve this problem, they only utilize source data during training, but do not take advantage of the fact that a single target example is available at the time of inference. Motivated by this, we propose a method that effectively uses the target sample during inference beyond mere classification. Our method has three components - (i) A label preserving feature or metric transformation on source data such that the source samples are clustered in accordance with their class irrespective of their domain (ii) A generative model trained on the these features (iii) A label-preserving projection of the target point on the source-feature manifold during inference via solving an optimization problem on the input space of the generative model using the learned metric. Finally, the projected target is used in the classifier. Since the projected target feature comes from the source manifold and has the same label as the real target by design, the classifier is expected to perform better on it than the true target. We demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art Domain Generalization methods on multiple datasets and tasks",

    "abstract": "Monocular 3D object detection is an important task in autonomous driving. It can be easily intractable where there exists ego-car pose change w.r.t. ground plane. This is common due to the slight fluctuation of road smoothness and slope. Due to the lack of insight in industrial application, existing methods on open datasets neglect camera pose information, which inevitably results in the detector being susceptible to camera extrinsic parameters. The perturbation of objects is very popular in most autonomous driving cases for industrial products. To this end, we propose a novel method to capture camera pose to formulate the detector free from extrinsic perturbation. Specifically, the proposed framework predicts camera extrinsic parameters by detecting vanishing point and horizon change. A converter is designed to rectify perturbative features in the latent space. By doing so, our 3D detector works independent of the extrinsic parameter variations, and produces accurate results in realistic cases, e.g., potholed and uneven roads, where almost all existing monocular detectors fail to handle. Experiments demonstrate our method yields best performance compared with the other state-of-the-arts by a large margin on both KITTI 3D and nuScenes datasets",

    "abstract": "Gradient compression has been widely adopted in data-parallel distributed training of deep neural networks to reduce communication overhead. Some literatures have demonstrated that large gradients are more important than small ones because they contain more information, such as Top-k compressor. Other mainstream methods, like random-k compressor and gradient quantization, usually treat all gradients equally. Different from all of them, we regard large and small gradients selection as the exploitation and exploration of gradient information, respectively. And we find taking both of them into consideration is the key to boost the final accuracy. So, we propose a novel gradient compressor: Gradient Sampling with Bayes Prior in this paper. Specifically, we sample important/large gradients based on the global gradient distribution, which is periodically updated across multiple workers. Then we introduce Bayes Prior into distribution model to further explore the gradients. We prove the convergence of our method for smooth non-convex problems in the distributed system. Compared with methods that running after high compression ratio at the expense of accuracy, we pursue no loss of accuracy and the actual acceleration benefit in practice. Experimental comparisons on a variety of computer vision tasks (e.g. image classification and object detection) and backbones (ResNet, MobileNetV2, InceptionV3 and AlexNet) show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques in terms of both speed and accuracy, with the limitation of 100* compression ratio",

However, there are still few works considering the situation that the unlabeled data is shallow which widely exists in real-world scenarios. The existing semi-supervised face recognition methods which focus on generating pseudo labels or minimizing softmax classification probabilities of the unlabeled data don't work very well on the unlabeled shallow data. Thus, it is still a challenge on how to effectively utilize the unlabeled shallow face data for improving the performance of face recognition. In this paper, we propose a novel face recognition method, named VirFace, to effectively apply the unlabeled shallow data for face recognition. VirFace consists of VirClass and VirInstance. Specifically, VirClass enlarges the inter-class distance by injecting the unlabeled data as new identities. Furthermore, VirInstance produces virtual instances sampled from the learned distribution of each identity to further enlarge the inter-class distance. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first working on tackling the unlabeled shallow face data.

However, gradient-based optimization of neural mesh, voxel, or function representations suffers from multiple challenges, i.e., topological in-consistencies, high memory footprints, or slow rendering speeds. To alleviate these problems, Pulsar employs: 1) asphere-based scene representation, 2) a modular, efficient differentiable projection operation, and 3) (optional) neural shading. Pulsar executes orders of magnitude faster than existing techniques and allows real-time rendering and optimization of representations with millions of spheres. Using spheres for the scene representation, unprecedented speed is obtained while avoiding topology problems. Pulsar is fully differentiable and thus enables a plethora of applications, ranging from 3D reconstruction to neural rendering",

Given the promising performance contrastive learning has shown recently in representation learning, in this work, we explore effective supervised contrastive learning strategies and tailor them to learn better image representations from imbalanced data in order to boost the classification accuracy thereon. Specifically, we propose a novel hybrid network structure being composed of a supervised contrastive loss to learn image representations and a cross-entropy loss to learn classifiers, where the learning is progressively transited from feature learning to the classifier learning to embody the idea that better features make better classifiers. We explore two variants of contrastive loss for feature learning, which vary in the forms but share a common idea of pulling the samples from the same class together in the normalized embedding space and pushing the samples from different classes apart. One of them is the recently proposed supervised contrastive (SC) loss, which is designed on top of the state-of-the-art unsupervised contrastive loss by incorporating positive samples from the same class. The other is a prototypical supervised contrastive (PSC) learning strategy which addresses the intensive memory consumption in standard SC loss and thus shows more promise under limited memory budget.

Through updating the translated image, we force similar outputs from the two branches. When such requirements are met, differences between the two images can compensate for and hence represent the knowledge difference between models. To enforce similar outputs from the two branches and depict the adapted knowledge, we propose a source-free image translation method that generates source-style images using only target images and the two models. We visualize the adapted knowledge on several datasets with different UDA methods and find that generated images successfully capture the style difference between the two domains.

In this paper, we propose a novel perspective substitute training that focuses on designing the distribution of data used in the knowledge stealing process. More specifically, a diverse data generation module is proposed to synthesize large-scale data with wide distribution. And adversarial substitute training strategy is introduced to focus on the data distributed near the decision boundary. The combination of these two modules can further boost the consistency of the substitute model and target model, which greatly improves the effectiveness of adversarial attack.

Recent research suggests that generative adversarial networks have the ability to overcome this limitation and serve as a multi-modal loss, especially for textures. Together with learned image compression, these two techniques can be used to great effect when relaxing the commonly employed tight measures of distortion. However, convolutional neural network-based algorithms have a large computational footprint. Ideally, an existing conventional codec should stay in place, ensuring faster adoption and adherence to a balanced computational envelope. As a possible avenue to this goal, we propose and investigate how learned image coding can be used as a surrogate to optimise an image for encoding. A learned filter alters the image to optimise a different performance measure or a particular task. Extending this idea with a generative adversarial network, we show how entire textures are replaced by ones that are less costly to encode but preserve a sense of detail. Our approach can remodel a conventional codec to adjust for the MS-SSIM distortion with over 20% rate improvement without any decoding overhead.

This solution always involves more computational costs to bring about time-consuming inference. At present, most blind SR algorithms are dedicated to obtaining high-fidelity results; their loss function generally employs L1 loss. To further improve the visual quality of SR results, perceptual metric, such as NIQE, is necessary to guide the network optimization. However, due to the non-differentiable property of NIQE, it cannot be as the loss function. Towards these issues, we propose an adaptive modulation network (AMNet) for multiple degradations SR, which is composed of the pivotal adaptive modulation layer (AMLayer). It is an efficient yet lightweight fusion layer between blur kernel and image features. Equipped with the blur kernel predictor, we naturally upgrade the AMNet to the blind SR model. Instead of considering iterative strategy, we make the blur kernel predictor trainable in the whole blind SR model, in which AMNet is well-trained. Also, we fit deep reinforcement learning into the blind SR model (AMNet-RL) to tackle the non-differentiable optimization problem. Specifically, the blur kernel predictor will be the actor to estimate the blur kernel from the input low-resolution (LR) image. The reward is designed by the pre-defined differentiable or non-differentiable metric.

To achieve this goal, it is necessary to find correspondences from neighbouring frames to faithfully hallucinate the unknown content. Current methods achieve this goal through attention, flow-based warping, or 3D temporal convolution. However, flow-based warping can create artifacts when optical flow is not accurate, while temporal convolution may suffer from spatial misalignment. We propose `Progressive Temporal Feature Alignment Network', which progressively enriches features extracted from the current frame with the feature warped from neighbouring frames using optical flow. Our approach corrects the spatial misalignment in the temporal feature propagation stage, greatly improving visual quality and temporal consistency of the inpainted videos. Using the proposed architecture, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the DAVIS and FVI datasets compared to existing deep learning approaches.

By just replacing the spatial convolutions with global self-attention in the final three bottleneck blocks of a ResNet and no other changes, our approach improves upon the baselines significantly on instance segmentation and object detection while also reducing the parameters, with minimal overhead in latency. Through the design of BoTNet, we also point out how ResNet bottleneck blocks with self-attention can be viewed as Transformer blocks. Without any bells and whistles, BoTNet achieves 44.4% Mask AP and 49.7% Box AP on the COCO Instance Segmentation benchmark using the Mask R-CNN framework; surpassing the previous best published single model and single scale results of ResNeSt evaluated on the COCO validation set. Finally, we present a simple adaptation of the BoTNet design for image classification, resulting in models that achieve a strong performance of 84.7% top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet benchmark while being up to 1.64x faster in compute time than the popular EfficientNet models on TPU-v3 hardware. We hope our simple and effective approach will serve as a strong baseline for future research in self-attention models for vision",

Meanwhile, this emerging line of research has been considerably hindered by the noise and ambiguity that prevail in raw depth images. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a Depth Calibration and Fusion (DCF) framework that contains two novel components: 1) a learning strategy to calibrate the latent bias in the original depth maps towards boosting the SOD performance; 2) a simple yet effective cross reference module to fuse features from both RGB and depth modalities. Extensive empirical experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior performance against 27 state-of-the-art methods.

Towards this goal, we represent the pedestrian's shape, pose and skinning weights as neural implicit functions that are directly learned from data.

    "abstract": "The last few years have witnessed the great success of non-linear generative models in synthesizing high-quality photorealistic face images. Many recent 3D facial texture reconstruction and pose manipulation from a single image approaches still rely on large and clean face datasets to train image-to-image Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Yet the collection of such a large scale high-resolution 3D texture dataset is still very costly and difficult to maintain age/ethnicity balance. Moreover, regression-based approaches suffer from generalization to the in-the-wild conditions and are unable to fine-tune to a target-image. In this work, we propose an unsupervised approach for one-shot 3D facial texture completion that does not require large-scale texture datasets, but rather harnesses the knowledge stored in 2D face generators. The proposed approach rotates an input image in 3D and fill-in the unseen regions by reconstructing the rotated image in a 2D face generator, based on the visible parts. Finally, we stitch the most visible textures at different angles in the UV image-plane. Further, we frontalize the target image by projecting the completed texture into the generator. The qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that the completed UV textures and frontalized images are of high quality, resembles the original identity, can be used to train a texture GAN model for 3DMM fitting and improve pose-invariant face recognition",

One fundamental challenge lies in how to leverage numerous real 2D images without any 3D ground truth. To address this issue, we take an alternative approach with semi-supervised learning. That is, for a 2D image of a generic object, we decompose it into latent representations of category, shape and albedo, lighting and camera projection matrix, decode the representations to segmented 3D shape and albedo respectively, and fuse these components to render an image well approximating the input image. Using a category-adaptive 3D joint occupancy field (JOF), we show that the complete shape and albedo modeling enables us to leverage real 2D images in both modeling and model fitting.

We study the dense keypoint regression framework that is previously inferior to the keypoint detection and grouping framework.

We present a simple yet effective approach, named disentangled keypoint regression (DEKR). We adopt adaptive convolutions through pixel-wise spatial transformer to activate the pixels in the keypoint regions and accordingly learn representations from them. We use a multi-branch structure for separate regression: each branch learns a representation with dedicated adaptive convolutions and regresses one keypoint. The resulting disentangled representations are able to attend to the keypoint regions, respectively, and thus the keypoint regression is spatially more accurate. We empirically show that the proposed direct regression method outperforms keypoint detection and grouping methods and achieves superior bottom-up pose estimation results on two benchmark datasets, COCO and CrowdPose.

To solve this problem, we design a multi-scale domain adaptation module (MDAM) to reduce the domain gap between the synthetic and real data.

Specifically, we propose a self-distillation module in an inner coarse-update loop and a mean-teacher in an outer fine-update loop to generate new pseudo labels that gradually replace the old ones. Consequently, our model is able to learn from the old pseudo labels at the early stage, and gradually switch to the new pseudo labels to prevent overfitting in the later stage.

In this work, we explore future freespace as an alternative representation to support motion planning. Our key intuition is that it is important to avoid straying into occupied space regardless of what is occupying it. Importantly, computing ground-truth future freespace is annotation-free. First, we explore freespace forecasting as a self-supervised learning task. We then demonstrate how to use forecasted freespace to identify collision-prone plans from off-the-shelf motion planners.

    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed significant progress in 3D hand mesh recovery. Nevertheless, because of the intrinsic 2D-to-3D ambiguity, recovering camera-space 3D information from a single RGB image remains challenging. To tackle this problem, we divide camera-space mesh recovery into two sub-tasks, i.e., root-relative mesh recovery and root recovery. First, joint landmarks and silhouette are extracted from a single input image to provide 2D cues for the 3D tasks. In the root-relative mesh recovery task, we exploit semantic relations among joints to generate a 3D mesh from the extracted 2D cues. Such generated 3D mesh coordinates are expressed relative to a root position, i.e., wrist of the hand. In the root recovery task, the root position is registered to the camera space by aligning the generated 3D mesh back to 2D cues, thereby completing camera-space 3D mesh recovery. Our pipeline is novel in that (1) it explicitly makes use of known semantic relations among joints and (2) it exploits 1D projections of the silhouette and mesh to achieve robust registration. Extensive experiments on popular datasets such as FreiHAND, RHD, and Human3.6M demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on both root-relative mesh recovery and root recovery.

    "abstract": "An LBYL ( 'Look Before You Leap' ) Network is proposed for end-to-end trainable one-stage visual grounding. The idea behind LBYL-Net is intuitive and straightforward: we follow a language's description to localize the target object based on its relative spatial relation to 'Landmarks', which is characterized by some spatial positional words and some descriptive words about the object. The core of our LBYL-Net is a landmark feature convolution module that transmits the visual features with the guidance of linguistic description along with different directions. Consequently, such a module encodes the relative spatial positional relations between the current object and its context. Then we combine the contextual information from the landmark feature convolution module with the target's visual features for grounding. To make this landmark feature convolution light-weight, we introduce a dynamic programming algorithm (termed dynamic max pooling) with low complexity to extract the landmark feature. Thanks to the landmark feature convolution module, we mimic the human behavior of `Look Before You Leap` to design an LBYL-Net, which takes full consideration of contextual information. Extensive experiments show our method's effectiveness in four grounding datasets. Specifically, our LBYL-Net outperforms all state-of-the-art two-stage and one-stage methods on ReferitGame. On RefCOCO and RefCOCO+, Our LBYL-Net also achieves comparable results or even better results than existing one-stage methods. Code is available at https://github.com/svip-lab/LBYLNet",

One core objective of identity swapping is to generate identity-discriminative faces that are distinct from the target while identical to the source. To this end, properly disentangling identity and identity-irrelevant information is critical and remains a challenging endeavor. In this work, we propose a novel information disentangling and swapping network, called InfoSwap, to extract the most expressive information for identity representation from a pre-trained face recognition model. The key insight of our method is to formulate the learning of disentangled representations as optimizing an information bottleneck trade-off, in terms of finding an optimal compression of the pre-trained latent features. Moreover, a novel identity contrastive loss is proposed for further disentanglement by requiring a proper distance between the generated identity and the target. While the most prior works have focused on using various loss functions to implicitly guide the learning of representations, we demonstrate that our model can provide explicit supervision for learning disentangled representations, achieving impressive performance in generating more identity-discriminative swapped faces",

Existing methods of learning with noisy labels primarily take noise-cleaning-based and sample-selection-based methods. However, for numerous studies on account of the above two views, selected samples cannot take full advantage of all data points and cannot represent actual distribution of categories, in particular if label annotation is corrupted. In this paper, we start from a different perspective and propose a robust learning algorithm called DualGraph, which aims to capture structural relations among labels at two different levels with graph neural networks including instance-level and distribution-level relations. Specifically, the instance-level relation utilizes instance similarity characterize sample category, while the distribution-level relation describes instance similarity distribution from each sample to all other samples. Since the distribution-level relation is robust to label noise, our network propagates it as supervised signals to refine instance-level similarity. Combining two level relations, we design an end-to-end training paradigm to counteract noisy labels while generating reliable predictions.

(3) Artists selectively paste irregular screen textures onto the canvas to achieve various background layouts or special effects. Motivated by this workflow, we propose a data-driven framework to convert a digital illustration into three corresponding components: manga line drawing, regular screentone, and irregular screen texture. These components can be directly composed into manga images and can be further retouched for more plentiful manga creations. To this end, we create a large-scale dataset with these three components annotated by artists in a human-in-the-loop manner. We conduct both perceptual user study and qualitative evaluation of the generated manga, and observe that our generated image layers for these three components are practically usable in the daily works of manga artists.

They emphasize learning a mapping from rainy images to rain-free images with supervision.

In this work, we aim to exploit the intrinsic priors of rainy images and develop intrinsic loss functions to facilitate training deraining networks, which decompose a rainy image into a rain-free background layer and a rainy layer containing intact rain streaks. To this end, we introduce the quasi-sparsity prior to train network so as to generate two sparse layers with intact textures of different objects. Then we explore the low-value prior to compensate sparsity, forcing all rain streaks to enter into one layer while non-rain contents into another layer to restore image details. We introduce a multi-decoding structure to specially supervise the generation of multi-type deraining features. This helps to learn the most contributory features to deraining in respective spaces. Moreover, our model stabilizes the feature values from multi-spaces via information sharing to alleviate potential artifacts, which also accelerates the running speed.

In this paper, we put forth a novel formulation of the object detection problem, namely open-vocabulary object detection, which is more general, more practical, and more effective than weakly supervised and zero-shot approaches. We propose a new method to train object detectors using bounding box annotations for a limited set of object categories, as well as image-caption pairs that cover a larger variety of objects at a significantly lower cost. We show that the proposed method can detect and localize objects for which no bounding box annotation is provided during training, at a significantly higher accuracy than zero-shot approaches.

While prior works struggle to localize objects by various spatial regularization strategies, we argue that how to extract object structural information from the trained classification network is neglected. In this paper, we propose a two-stage approach, termed structure-preserving activation (SPA), towards fully leveraging the structure information incorporated in convolutional features for WSOL. In the first stage, a restricted activation module (RAM) is designed to alleviate the structure-missing issue caused by the classification network, based on the observation that the unbounded classification map and global average pooling layer drive the network to focus only on object parts. In the second stage, we propose a post-process approach, termed the self-correlation map generating (SCG) module to obtain structure-preserving localization maps on the basis of the activation maps acquired from the first stage. Specifically, we utilize the high-order self-correlation (HSC) to extract the inherent structural information retained in the learned model and then aggregate HSC of multiple points for precise object localization.

The method formulates 3D shape reconstruction as a shape selection problem, i.e. it selects among exemplar shapes from a given database. This makes it agnostic to shape representations, which enables a lightweight reconstruction of realistic and visually-pleasing shapes based on CAD-models, while the training objective is formulated around point clouds and voxel representations. A collision-loss promotes non-intersecting objects, further increasing the reconstruction realism. Given the RGB image, the presented approach performs lightweight reconstruction in a single-stage, it is real-time capable, fully differentiable and end-to-end trainable.

First, we introduce a novel MIL aggregator that models the relations of the instances in a dual-stream architecture with trainable distance measurement. Second, since WSIs can produce large or unbalanced bags that hinder the training of MIL models, we propose to use self-supervised contrastive learning to extract good representations for MIL and alleviate the issue of prohibitive memory cost for large bags. Third, we adopt a pyramidal fusion mechanism for multiscale WSI features, and further improve the accuracy of classification and localization. Our model is evaluated on two representative WSI datasets. The classification accuracy of our model compares favorably to fully-supervised methods, with less than 2% accuracy gap across datasets. Our results also outperform all previous MIL-based methods.

Though many DA theories and algorithms have been proposed, most of them are tailored into classification settings and may fail in regression tasks, especially in the practical keypoint detection task. To tackle this difficult but significant task, we present a method of regressive domain adaptation (RegDA) for unsupervised keypoint detection. Inspired by the latest theoretical work, we first utilize an adversarial regressor to maximize the disparity on the target domain and train a feature generator to minimize this disparity. However, due to the high dimension of the output space, this regressor fails to detect samples that deviate from the support of the source. To overcome this problem, we propose two important ideas. First, based on our observation that the probability density of the output space is sparse, we introduce a spatial probability distribution to describe this sparsity and then use it to guide the learning of the adversarial regressor. Second, to alleviate the optimization difficulty in the high-dimensional space, we innovatively convert the minimax game in the adversarial training to the minimization of two opposite goals.

    "abstract": "The reflectance field of a face describes the reflectance properties responsible for complex lighting effects including diffuse, specular, inter-reflection and self shadowing. Most existing methods for estimating the face reflectance from a monocular image assume faces to be diffuse with very few approaches adding a specular component. This still leaves out important perceptual aspects of reflectance such as higher-order global illumination effects and self-shadowing. We present a new neural representation for face reflectance where we can estimate all components of the reflectance responsible for the final appearance from a monocular image. Instead of modeling each component of the reflectance separately using parametric models, our neural representation allows us to generate a basis set of faces in a geometric deformation-invariant space, parameterized by the input light direction, viewpoint and face geometry. We learn to reconstruct this reflectance field of a face just from a monocular image, which can be used to render the face from any viewpoint in any light condition. Our method is trained on a light-stage dataset, which captures 300 people illuminated with 150 light conditions from 8 viewpoints. We show that our method outperforms existing monocular reflectance reconstruction methods due to better capturing of physical effects, such as sub-surface scattering, specularities, self-shadows and other higher-order effects",

    "abstract": "Graph convolution networks (GCNs) are a powerful deep learning approach and have been successfully applied to representation learning on graphs in a variety of real-world applications. Despite their success, two fundamental weaknesses of GCNs limit their ability to represent graph-structured data: poor performance when labeled data are severely scarce and indistinguishable features when more layers are stacked. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective Self-Supervised Semantic Alignment Graph Convolution Network (SelfSAGCN), which consists of two crux techniques: Identity Aggregation and Semantic Alignment, to overcome these weaknesses. The behind basic idea is the node features in the same class but learned from semantic and graph structural aspects respectively, are expected to be mapped nearby. Specifically, the Identity Aggregation is applied to extract semantic features from labeled nodes, the Semantic Alignment is utilized to align node features obtained from different aspects using the class central similarity. In this way, the over-smoothing phenomenon is alleviated, while the similarities between the unlabeled features and labeled ones from the same class are enhanced. Experimental results on five popular datasets show that the proposed SelfSAGCN outperforms state-of-the-art methods on various classification tasks",

However, most existing methods ignore exploring the class-level knowledge that can be easily learned by humans from just a handful of samples. In this paper, we propose an Explicit Class Knowledge Propagation Network (ECKPN), which is composed of the comparison, squeeze and calibration modules, to address this problem. Specifically, we first employ the comparison module to explore the pairwise sample relations to learn rich sample representations in the instance-level graph. Then, we squeeze the instance-level graph to generate the class-level graph, which can help obtain the class-level visual knowledge and facilitate modeling the relations of different classes. Next, the calibration module is adopted to characterize the relations of the classes explicitly to obtain the more discriminative class-level knowledge representations. Finally, we combine the class-level knowledge with the instance-level sample representations to guide the inference of the query samples. We conduct extensive experiments on four few-shot classification benchmarks, and the experimental results show that the proposed ECKPN significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods",

Traditional Video models process inputs at one (or few) fixed temporal resolution without any dynamic frame selection. However, we argue that, processing multiple temporal resolutions of the input and doing so dynamically by learning to estimate the importance of each frame can largely improve video representations, specially in the domain of temporal activity localization. To this end, we propose (1) 'Grid Pool', a learned temporal downsampling layer to extract coarse features, and, (2) 'Multi-stage Fusion', a spatio-temporal attention mechanism to fuse a fine-grained context with the coarse features.

For interpreting the multimodal interactions under attacks, we learn a weakly-supervised sound source visual localization model to localize sounding regions in videos. To mitigate multimodal attacks, we propose an audio-visual defense approach based on an audio-visual dissimilarity constraint and external feature memory banks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that audio-visual models are susceptible to multimodal adversarial attacks; audio-visual integration could decrease the model robustness rather than strengthen under multimodal attacks; even a weakly-supervised sound source visual localization model can be successfully fooled; our defense method can improve the invulnerability of audio-visual networks without significantly sacrificing clean model performance",

To save computational cost, most of existing NAS algorithms often train and evaluate intermediate neural architectures on a small proxy dataset with limited training epochs. But it is difficult to expect an accurate performance estimation of an architecture in such a coarse evaluation way. This paper advocates a new neural architecture evaluation scheme, which aims to determine which architecture would perform better instead of accurately predict the absolute architecture performance. Therefore, we propose a relativistic architecture performance predictor in NAS (ReNAS). We encode neural architectures into feature tensors, and further refining the representations with the predictor. The proposed relativistic performance predictor can be deployed in discrete searching methods to search for the desired architectures without additional evaluation. Experimental results on NAS-Bench-101 dataset suggests that, sampling 424 (0.1% of the entire search space) neural architectures and their corresponding validation performance is already enough for learning an accurate architecture performance predictor. The accuracies of our searched neural architectures on NAS-Bench-101 and NAS-Bench-201 datasets are higher than that of the state-of-the-art methods and show the priority of the proposed method",

However, unlike human vision that is robust to various data corruptions such as blur and pixelation, current pose estimators are easily confused by these corruptions. This work comprehensively studies and addresses this problem by building rigorous robust benchmarks, termed COCO-C, MPII-C, and OCHuman-C, to evaluate the weaknesses of current advanced pose estimators, and a new algorithm termed AdvMix is proposed to improve their robustness in different corruptions. Our work has several unique benefits. (1) AdvMix is model-agnostic and capable in a wide-spectrum of pose estimation models. (2) AdvMix consists of adversarial augmentation and knowledge distillation. Adversarial augmentation contains two neural network modules that are trained jointly and competitively in an adversarial manner, where a generator network mixes different corrupted images to confuse a pose estimator, improving the robustness of the pose estimator by learning from harder samples. To compensate for the noise patterns by adversarial augmentation, knowledge distillation is applied to transfer clean pose structure knowledge to the target pose estimator. (3) Extensive experiments show that AdvMix significantly increases the robustness of pose estimations across a wide range of corruptions, while maintaining accuracy on clean data in various challenging benchmark datasets",

More specifically, we study the characteristics of the low-rank matrix, and develop an improved Gerschgorin disk theorem to estimate the rank of the low-rank matrix accurately. Furthermore in view of the issue occurred in the Gerschgorin disk theorem that adjustment factor need to be manually pre-defined, an adaptive setting method, which greatly facilitates the practical implementation of the rank estimation, is presented. Then, the weights of singular values in the nuclear norm are updated adaptively based on iteratively estimated rank, and the resultant low-rank matrix is close to the target.

    "abstract": "Most standard learning approaches lead to fragile models which are prone to drift when sequentially trained on samples of a different nature -- the well-known \"catastrophic forgetting\" issue. In particular, when a model consecutively learns from different visual domains, it tends to forget the past domains in favor of the most recent ones. In this context, we show that one way to learn models that are inherently more robust against forgetting is domain randomization -- for vision tasks, randomizing the current domain's distribution with heavy image manipulations. Building on this result, we devise a meta-learning strategy where a regularizer explicitly penalizes any loss associated with transferring the model from the current domain to different \"auxiliary\" meta-domains, while also easing adaptation to them. Such meta-domains are also generated through randomized image manipulations. We empirically demonstrate in a variety of experiments -- spanning from classification to semantic segmentation -- that our approach results in models that are less prone to catastrophic forgetting when transferred to new domains",

This dense correlation volumes enables the network to accurately discover the structured pair-wise pixel similarities among the common salient objects. Second, we develop a semantic-aware co-attention module (SCAM) to enhance the foreground saliency through predicted categorical information. Specifically, SCAM recognizes the semantic class of the foreground objects; and this information is then projected to the deep representations to localize the related pixels. Third, we design a contrast edge enhanced module (EEM) to capture richer context and preserve fine-grained spatial information. We validate the effectiveness of our model using three popular benchmark datasets (Cosal2015, CoSOD3k and CoCA).

Adversarial examples are slightly modified inputs that are then misclassified, while remaining perceptively close to their originals. Last couple of years have witnessed a striking decrease in the amount of queries a black box attack submits to the target classifier, in order to forge adversarials. This particularly concerns the black box score-based setup, where the attacker has access to top predicted probabilites: the amount of queries went from to millions of to less than a thousand. This paper presents SurFree, a geometrical approach that achieves a similar drastic reduction in the amount of queries in the hardest setup: black box decision-based attacks (only the top-1 label is available). We first highlight that the most recent attacks in that setup, HSJA, QEBA and GeoDA all perform costly gradient surrogate estimations. SurFree proposes to bypass these, by instead focusing on careful trials along diverse directions, guided by precise indications of geometrical properties of the classifier decision boundaries. We motivate this geometric approach before performing a head-to-head comparison with previous attacks with the amount of queries as a first class citizen.

    "abstract": "With the maturing of deep learning systems, trustworthiness is becoming increasingly important for model assessment. We understand trustworthiness as the combination of explainability and robustness. Generative classifiers (GCs) are a promising class of models that are said to naturally accomplish these qualities. However, this has mostly been demonstrated on simple datasets such as MNIST and CIFAR in the past. In this work, we firstly develop an architecture and training scheme that allows GCs to operate on a more relevant level of complexity for practical computer vision, namely the ImageNet challenge. Secondly, we demonstrate the immense potential of GCs for trustworthy image classification. Explainability and some aspects of robustness are vastly improved compared to feed-forward models, even when the GCs are just applied naively. While not all trustworthiness problems are solved completely, we observe that GCs are a highly promising basis for further algorithms and modifications. We release our trained model for download in the hope that it serves as a starting point for other generative classification tasks, in much the same way as pretrained ResNet architectures do for discriminative classification",

    "title": "EffiScene: Efficient Per-Pixel Rigidity Inference for Unsupervised Joint Learning of Optical Flow, Depth, Camera Pose and Motion Segmentation",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "This paper addresses the challenging unsupervised scene flow estimation problem by jointly learning four low-level vision sub-tasks: optical flow F, stereo-depth D, camera pose P and motion segmentation S. Our key insight is that the rigidity of the scene shares the same inherent geometrical structure with object movements and scene depth. Hence, rigidity from S can be inferred by jointly coupling F, D and S to achieve more robust estimation. To this end, we propose a novel scene flow framework named EffiScene with efficient joint rigidity learning, going beyond the existing pipeline with independent auxiliary structures. In EffiScene, we first estimate optical flow and depth at the coarse level and then compute camera pose by Perspective-n-Points method. To jointly learn local rigidity, we design a novel Rigidity From Motion (RfM) layer with three principal components: (i) correlation extraction; (ii) boundary learning; and (iii) outlier exclusion. Final outputs are fused based on the rigid map M_R from RfM at finer levels. To efficiently train EffiScene, two new losses L_bnd and L_unc are designed to prevent trivial solutions and to regularize the flow boundary discontinuity. Extensive experiments on scene flow benchmark KITTI show that our method is effective and significantly improves the state-of-the-art approaches for all sub-tasks, i.e. optical flow (5.19 -> 4.20), depth estimation (3.78 -> 3.46), visual odometry (0.012 -> 0.011) and motion segmentation (0.57 -> 0.62)",

We do so elegantly by introducing a mechanism to mine hard samples and add them to a contrastive learning formulation automatically. We show that our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance on the popular Flickr SoundNet dataset.

This dataset is 20 times larger than analogous existing ones, contains 5K videos spanning over 200 categories, and, differently from Flickr SoundNet, is video-based.

    "abstract": "In this work, we show the generative capability of an image classifier network by synthesizing high-resolution, photo-realistic, and diverse images at scale. The overall methodology, called Synthesize-It-Classifier (STIC), does not require an explicit generator network to estimate the density of the data distribution and sample images from that, but instead uses the classifier's knowledge of the boundary to perform gradient ascent w.r.t. class logits and then synthesizes images using Gram Matrix Metropolis Adjusted Langevin Algorithm (GRMALA) by drawing on a blank canvas. During training, the classifier iteratively uses these synthesized images as fake samples and re-estimates the class boundary in a recurrent fashion to improve both the classification accuracy and quality of synthetic images. The STIC shows that mixing of the hard fake samples (i.e. those synthesized by the one hot class conditioning), and the soft fake samples (which are synthesized as a convex combination of classes, i.e. a mixup of classes) improves class interpolation. We demonstrate an Attentive-STIC network that shows iterative drawing of synthesized images on the ImageNet dataset that has thousands of classes. In addition, we introduce the synthesis using a class conditional score classifier (Score-STIC) instead of a normal image classifier and show improved results on several real world datasets, i.e. ImageNet, LSUN and CIFAR 10",

    "abstract": "Due to the scarcity of annotated scene flow data, self-supervised scene flow learning in point clouds has attracted increasing attention. In the self-supervised manner, establishing correspondences between two point clouds to approximate scene flow is an effective approach. Previous methods often obtain correspondences by applying point-wise matching that only takes the distance on 3D point coordinates into account, introducing two critical issues: (1) it overlooks other discriminative measures, such as color and surface normal, which often bring fruitful clues for accurate matching; and (2) it often generates sub-par performance, as the matching is operated in an unconstrained situation, where multiple points can be ended up with the same corresponding point. To address the issues, we formulate this matching task as an optimal transport problem. The output optimal assignment matrix can be utilized to guide the generation of pseudo ground truth. In this optimal transport, we design the transport cost by considering multiple descriptors and encourage one-to-one matching by mass equality constraints. Also, constructing a graph on the points, a random walk module is introduced to encourage the local consistency of the pseudo labels. Comprehensive experiments on FlyingThings3D and KITTI show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among self-supervised learning methods. Our self-supervised method even performs on par with some supervised learning approaches, although we do not need any ground truth flow for training",

To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel framework, namely Explicit Pseudo-pixel Supervision (EPS), which learns from pixel-level feedback by combining two weak supervisions; the image-level label provides the object identity via the localization map and the saliency map from the off-the-shelf saliency detection model offers rich boundaries. We devise a joint training strategy to fully utilize the complementary relationship between both information. Our method can obtain accurate object boundaries and discard co-occurring pixels, thereby significantly improving the quality of pseudo-masks.

The method operates on a geometric scaffold computed via structure-from-motion and multi-view stereo. Each point on this 3D scaffold is associated with view rays and corresponding feature vectors that encode the appearance of this point in the input images. The core of SVS is view-dependent on-surface feature aggregation, in which directional feature vectors at each 3D point are processed to produce a new feature vector for a ray that maps this point into the new target view. The target view is then rendered by a convolutional network from a tensor of features synthesized in this way for all pixels. The method is composed of differentiable modules and is trained end-to-end. It supports spatially-varying view-dependent importance weighting and feature transformation of source images at each point; spatial and temporal stability due to the smooth dependence of on-surface feature aggregation on the target view; and synthesis of view-dependent effects such as specular reflection. Experimental results demonstrate that SVS outperforms state-of-the-art view synthesis methods both quantitatively and qualitatively on three diverse real-world datasets, achieving unprecedented levels of realism in free-viewpoint video of challenging large-scale scenes.

We argue that a single clip may not have enough temporal coverage to exhibit the label to recognize, since video datasets are often weakly labeled with categorical information but without dense temporal annotations. Furthermore, optimizing the model over brief clips impedes its ability to learn long-term temporal dependencies. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a collaborative memory mechanism that encodes information across multiple sampled clips of a video at each training iteration. This enables the learning of long-range dependencies beyond a single clip. We explore different design choices for the collaborative memory to ease the optimization difficulties. Our proposed framework is end-to-end trainable and significantly improves the accuracy of video classification at a negligible computational overhead.

The tasks in our method can be efficiently engineered by domain experts through a process we call \"task programming\", which uses programs to explicitly encode structured knowledge from domain experts. Total domain expert effort can be reduced by exchanging data annotation time for the construction of a small number of programmed tasks. We evaluate this trade-off using data from behavioral neuroscience, in which specialized domain knowledge is used to identify behaviors. We present experimental results in three datasets across two domains: mice and fruit flies. Using embeddings from TREBA, we reduce annotation burden by up to a factor of 10 without compromising accuracy compared to state-of-the-art features.

However, in contrast to the commonplace trait of human cognition is the lack of a diagnostic benchmark to measure causal induction for modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. Therefore, in this work, we introduce the Abstract Causal REasoning (ACRE) dataset for systematic evaluation of current vision systems in causal induction. Motivated by the stream of research on causal discovery in Blicket experiments, we query a visual reasoning system with the following four types of questions in either an independent scenario or an interventional scenario: direct, indirect, screening-off, and backward-blocking, intentionally going beyond the simple strategy of inducing causal relationships by covariation. By analyzing visual reasoning architectures on this testbed, we notice that pure neural models tend towards an associative strategy under their chance-level performance, whereas neuro-symbolic combinations struggle in backward-blocking reasoning. These deficiencies call for future research in models with a more comprehensive capability of causal induction",

Furthermore, we introduce a stochastic domain decomposition approach that enables batched optimization and preserves convergence for large problems. We evaluate our method by solving bundle adjustment as a fundamental problem. Experiments show that our optimizer significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions and existing deep learning solvers considering quality, efficiency, and memory. Our stochastic domain decomposition enables distributed optimization, consumes little memory and time, and achieves similar quality compared to a global solver.

    "abstract": "Temporal modeling still remains challenging for action recognition in videos. To mitigate this issue, this paper presents a new video architecture, termed as Temporal Difference Network (TDN), with a focus on capturing multi-scale temporal information for efficient action recognition. The core of our TDN is to devise an efficient temporal module (TDM) by explicitly leveraging a temporal difference operator, and systematically assess its effect on short-term and long-term motion modeling. To fully capture temporal information over the entire video, our TDN is established with a two-level difference modeling paradigm. Specifically, for local motion modeling, temporal difference over consecutive frames is used to supply 2D CNNs with finer motion pattern, while for global motion modeling, temporal difference across segments is incorporated to capture long-range structure for motion feature excitation. TDN provides a simple and principled temporal modeling framework and could be instantiated with the existing CNNs at a small extra computational cost. Our TDN presents a new state of the art on the Something-Something V1 & V2 datasets and is on par with the best performance on the Kinetics-400 dataset. In addition, we conduct in-depth ablation studies and plot the visualization results of our TDN, hopefully providing insightful analysis on temporal difference modeling.

We develop and integrate advanced learning techniques to make LiBRe appropriate for adversarial detection. Concretely, we build the few-layer deep ensemble variational and adopt the pre-training & fine-tuning workflow to boost the effectiveness and efficiency of LiBRe. We further provide a novel insight to realise adversarial detection-oriented uncertainty quantification without inefficiently crafting adversarial examples during training. Extensive empirical studies covering a wide range of scenarios verify the practicability of LiBRe.

Recently, there has been a growing interest in estimating class-agnostic motion directly from point clouds.

However, manually labeling point clouds is notoriously difficult, error-prone and time-consuming. In this paper, we seek to answer the research question of whether the abundant unlabeled data collections can be utilized for accurate and efficient motion learning. To this end, we propose a learning framework that leverages free supervisory signals from point clouds and paired camera images to estimate motion purely via self-supervision. Our model involves a point cloud based structural consistency augmented with probabilistic motion masking as well as a cross-sensor motion regularization to realize the desired self-supervision.

In this paper, we make the first attempt in Query-based Attack against Image Retrieval (QAIR), to completely subvert the top-k retrieval results. Specifically, a new relevance-based loss is designed to quantify the attack effects by measuring the set similarity on the top-k retrieval results before and after attacks and guide the gradient optimization. To further boost the attack efficiency, a recursive model stealing method is proposed to acquire transferable priors on the target model and generate the prior-guided gradients. Comprehensive experiments show that the proposed attack achieves a high attack success rate with few queries against the image retrieval systems under the black-box setting. The attack evaluations on real-world visual search engine show that it successfully deceives a commercial system such as Bing Visual Search with 98% attack success rate by only 33 queries on average",

This paper proposes MagFace, a category of losses that learn a universal feature embedding whose magnitude before normalization can measure with the quality of the given face. Under the new loss, it can be proven that the magnitude of the feature embedding monotonically increases if the subject is more likely to be recognized. In addition, MagFace introduces an adaptive mechanism to learn a well-structured within-class feature distributions by pushing easy samples to class centers while pushing hard samples away. This prevents models from overfitting on noisy low-quality samples and improves face recognition in the wild.

In this common, real-world scenario, almost all images belong to the background category in the dataset. We find that state-of-the-art approaches for training on imbalanced datasets do not produce accurate deep models in this regime. Our solution is to split the large, visually diverse background into many smaller, visually similar categories during training. We implement this idea by extending an image classification model with an additional auxiliary loss that learns to mimic the predictions of a pre-existing classification model on the training set. The auxiliary loss requires no additional human labels and regularizes feature learning in the shared network trunk by forcing the model to discriminate between auxiliary categories for all training set examples, including those belonging to the monolithic background of the main rare category classification task. To evaluate our method we contribute modified versions of the iNaturalist and Places365 datasets where only a small subset of rare category labels are available during training (all other images are labeled as background). By jointly learning to recognize both the selected rare categories and auxiliary categories, our approach yields models that perform 8.3 mAP points higher than state-of-the-art imbalanced learning baselines when 98.30% of the data is background, and up to 42.3 mAP points higher than fine-tuning baselines when 99.98% of the data is background",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) aims to design machine learning algorithms that can continually learn new concepts from a few data points, without forgetting knowledge of old classes. The difficulty lies in that limited data from new classes not only lead to significant overfitting issues but also exacerbate the notorious catastrophic forgetting problems. Moreover, as training data come in sequence in FSCIL, the learned classifier can only provide discriminative information in individual sessions, while FSCIL requires all classes to be involved for evaluation. In this paper, we address the FSCIL problem from two aspects. First, we adopt a simple but effective decoupled learning strategy of representations and classifiers that only the classifiers are updated in each incremental session, which avoids knowledge forgetting in the representations. By doing so, we demonstrate that a pre-trained backbone plus a non-parametric class mean classifier can beat state-of-the-art methods. Second, to make the classifiers learned on individual sessions applicable to all classes, we propose a Continually Evolved Classifier (CEC) that employs a graph model to propagate context information between classifiers for adaptation. To enable the learning of CEC, we design a pseudo incremental learning paradigm that episodically constructs a pseudo incremental learning task to optimize the graph parameters by sampling data from the base dataset. Experiments on three popular benchmark datasets, including CIFAR100, miniImageNet, and Caltech-USCD Birds-200-2011 (CUB200), show that our method significantly outperforms the baselines and sets new state-of-the-art results with remarkable advantages",

To train our network, we utilize weak labels obtained by pixel-wise Intersection-over-Union (IoUs) to define the triplet loss. Importantly, LayoutGMN is built with a structural bias which can effectively compensate for the lack of structure awareness in IoUs. We demonstrate this on two prominent forms of layouts, viz., floorplans and UI designs, via retrieval experiments on large-scale datasets. In particular, retrieval results by our network better match human judgement of structural layout similarity compared to both IoUs and other baselines including a state-of-the-art method based on graph neural networks and image convolution. In addition, LayoutGMN is the first deep model to offer both metric learning of structural layout similarity and structural matching between layout elements",

    "abstract": "Recent breakthroughs of Neural Architecture Search (NAS) extend the field's research scope towards a broader range of vision tasks and more diversified search spaces. While existing NAS methods mostly design architectures on a single task, algorithms that look beyond single-task search are surging to pursue a more efficient and universal solution across various tasks. Many of them leverage transfer learning and seek to preserve, reuse, and refine network design knowledge to achieve higher efficiency in future tasks. However, the enormous computational cost and experiment complexity of cross-task NAS are imposing barriers for valuable research in this direction. Existing NAS benchmarks all focus on one type of vision task, i.e., classification. In this work, we propose TransNAS-Bench-101, a benchmark dataset containing network performance across seven tasks, covering classification, regression, pixel-level prediction, and self-supervised tasks. This diversity provides opportunities to transfer NAS methods among tasks and allows for more complex transfer schemes to evolve. We explore two fundamentally different types of search space: cell-level search space and macro-level search space. With 7,352 backbones evaluated on seven tasks, 51,464 trained models with detailed training information are provided. With TransNAS-Bench-101, we hope to encourage the advent of exceptional NAS algorithms that raise cross-task search efficiency and generalizability to the next level.

In contrast to most existing annotation datasets in computer vision, we focus on the affective experience triggered by visual artworks and ask the annotators to indicate the dominant emotion they feel for a given image and, crucially, to also provide a grounded verbal explanation for their emotion choice. As we demonstrate below, this leads to a rich set of signals for both the objective content and the affective impact of an image, creating associations with abstract concepts (e.g., \"freedom\" or \"love\"), or references that go beyond what is directly visible, including visual similes and metaphors, or subjective references to personal experiences. We focus on visual art (e.g., paintings, artistic photographs) as it is a prime example of imagery created to elicit emotional responses from its viewers. Our dataset, termed ArtEmis, contains 455K emotion attributions and explanations from humans, on 80K artworks from WikiArt. Building on this data, we train and demonstrate a series of captioning systems capable of expressing and explaining emotions from visual stimuli. Remarkably, the captions produced by these systems often succeed in reflecting the semantic and abstract content of the image, going well beyond systems trained on existing datasets",

    "abstract": "The dense video captioning task aims to detect and describe a sequence of events in a video for detailed and coherent storytelling. Previous works mainly adopt a \"detect-then-describe\" framework, which firstly detects event proposals in the video and then generates descriptions for the detected events. However, the definitions of events are diverse which could be as simple as a single action or as complex as a set of events, depending on different semantic contexts. Therefore, directly detecting events based on video information is ill-defined and hurts the coherency and accuracy of generated dense captions. In this work, we reverse the predominant \"detect-then-describe\" fashion, proposing a top-down way to first generate paragraphs from a global view and then ground each event description to a video segment for detailed refinement. It is formulated as a Sketch, Ground, and Refine process (SGR). The sketch stage first generates a coarse-grained multi-sentence paragraph to describe the whole video, where each sentence is treated as an event and gets localised in the grounding stage. In the refining stage, we improve captioning quality via refinement-enhanced training and dual-path cross attention on both coarse-grained event captions and aligned event segments. The updated event caption can further adjust its segment boundaries. Our SGR model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on ActivityNet Captioning benchmark under traditional and story-oriented dense caption evaluations.

In addition, we introduce meta-learning to our DPU to form a novel few-shot normalcy learner, namely Meta-Prototype Unit (MPU).

Toward this end, we propose an effective graph-based relation discovery approach to build a contextual understanding of high-order relationships. In our approach, a high-dimensional feature bank is first formed and jointly regularized with semantic- and positional-aware high-order constraints, endowing rich attributes to feature representations. Second, to overcome the high-dimension curse, we propose a graph-based semantic grouping strategy to embed this high-order tensor bank into a low-dimensional space. Meanwhile, a group-wise learning strategy is proposed to regularize the features focusing on the cluster embedding center. With the collaborative learning of three modules, our module is able to grasp the stronger contextual details of fine-grained objects.

    "abstract": "Modern one-stage video instance segmentation networks suffer from two limitations. First, convolutional features are neither aligned with anchor boxes nor with ground-truth bounding boxes, reducing the mask sensitivity to spatial location. Second, a video is directly divided into individual frames for frame-level instance segmentation, ignoring the temporal correlation between adjacent frames. To address these issues, we propose a simple yet effective one-stage video instance segmentation framework by spatial calibration and temporal fusion, namely STMask. To ensure spatial feature calibration with ground-truth bounding boxes, we first predict regressed bounding boxes around ground-truth bounding boxes, and extract features from them for frame-level instance segmentation. To further explore temporal correlation among video frames, we aggregate a temporal fusion module to infer instance masks from each frame to its adjacent frames, which helps our framework to handle challenging videos such as motion blur, partial occlusion and unusual object-to-camera poses. Experiments on the YouTube-VIS valid set show that the proposed STMask with ResNet-50/-101 backbone obtains 33.5 % / 36.8 % mask AP, while achieving 28.6 / 23.4 FPS on video instance segmentation.

Toward this goal, we introduce Asynchronous-Sparse Interaction Graph Networks (ASSIGN), a recurrent graph network that is able to automatically detect the structure of interaction events associated with entities in a video scene. ASSIGN pioneers learning of autonomous behavior of video entities including their dynamic structure and their interaction with the coexisting neighbors. Entities' lives in our model are asynchronous to those of others therefore more flexible in adapting to complex scenarios. Their interactions are sparse in time hence more faithful to the true underlying nature and more robust in inference and learning. ASSIGN is tested on human-object interaction recognition and shows superior performance in segmenting and labeling of human sub-activities and object affordances from raw videos. The native ability of ASSIGN in discovering temporal structure also eliminates the dependence on external segmentation that was previously mandatory for this task",

To further build models with better generalization capability and performance, model ensemble is usually adopted and performs better than stand-alone models. Inspired by the merits of model ensemble, we propose to search for multiple diverse models simultaneously as an alternative way to find powerful models. Searching for ensembles is non-trivial and has two key challenges: enlarged search space and potentially more complexity for the searched model. In this paper, we propose a one-shot neural ensemble architecture search (NEAS) solution that addresses the two challenges.

For the second challenge, we enable a new search dimension to learn layer sharing among different models for efficiency purposes. The experiments on ImageNet clearly demonstrate that our solution can improve the supernet's capacity of ranking ensemble architectures, and further lead to better search results. The discovered architectures achieve superior performance compared with state-of-the-arts such as MobileNetV3 and EfficientNet families under aligned settings.

Current anchor-based monocular 3D object detection methods suffer from feature mismatching. To overcome this, we propose a two-step feature alignment approach. In the first step, the shape alignment is performed to enable the receptive field of the feature map to focus on the pre-defined anchors with high confidence scores. In the second step, the center alignment is used to align the features at 2D/3D centers. Further, it is often difficult to learn global information and capture long-range relationships, which are important for the depth prediction of objects. Therefore, we propose a novel asymmetric non-local attention block with multi-scale sampling to extract depth-wise features.

    "abstract": "Face clustering is a promising method for annotating unlabeled face images. Recent supervised approaches have boosted the face clustering accuracy greatly, however their performance is still far from satisfactory. These methods can be roughly divided into global-based and local-based ones. Global-based methods suffer from the limitation of training data scale, while local-based ones are difficult to grasp the whole graph structure information and usually take a long time for inference. Previous approaches fail to tackle these two challenges simultaneously. To address the dilemma of large-scale training and efficient inference, we propose the STructure-AwaRe Face Clustering (STAR-FC) method. Specifically, we design a structure-preserved subgraph sampling strategy to explore the power of large-scale training data, which can increase the training data scale from 10^5 to 10^7. During inference, the STAR-FC performs efficient full-graph clustering with two steps: graph parsing and graph refinement. And the concept of node intimacy is introduced in the second step to mine the local structural information. The STAR-FC gets 91.97 pairwise F-score on partial MS1M within 310s which surpasses the state-of-the-arts. Furthermore, we are the first to train on very large-scale graph with 20M nodes, and achieve superior inference results on 12M testing data. Overall, as a simple and effective method, the proposed STAR-FC provides a strong baseline for large-scale face clustering. Code is available at https://sstzal.github.io/STAR-FC/",

    "abstract": "The precise localization of 3D objects from a single image without depth information is a highly challenging problem. Most existing methods adopt the same approach for all objects regardless of their diverse distributions, leading to limited performance especially for truncated objects. In this paper, we propose a flexible framework for monocular 3D object detection which explicitly decouples the truncated objects and adaptively combines multiple approaches for object depth estimation. Specifically, we decouple the edge of the feature map for predicting long-tail truncated objects so that the optimization of normal objects is not influenced. Furthermore, we formulate the object depth estimation as an uncertainty-guided ensemble of directly regressed object depth and solved depths from different groups of keypoints. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art method by relatively 27% for moderate level and 30% for hard level in the test set of KITTI benchmark while maintaining real-time efficiency",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recent work has shown that convolutional neural network classifiers overly rely on texture at the expense of shape cues. We make a similar but different distinction between shape and local image cues, on the one hand, and global image statistics, on the other. Our method, called Permuted Adaptive Instance Normalization (pAdaIN), reduces the representation of global statistics in the hidden layers of image classifiers. pAdaIN samples a random permutation p that rearranges the samples in a given batch. Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) is then applied between the activations of each (non-permuted) sample i and the corresponding activations of the sample p(i), thus swapping statistics between the samples of the batch. Since the global image statistics are distorted, this swapping procedure causes the network to rely on cues, such as shape or texture. By choosing the random permutation with probability p and the identity permutation otherwise, one can control the effect's strength. With the correct choice of p, fixed apriori for all experiments and selected without considering test data, our method consistently outperforms baselines in multiple settings. In image classification, our method improves on both CIFAR100 and ImageNet using multiple architectures. In the setting of robustness, our method improves on both ImageNet-C and Cifar-100-C for multiple architectures. In the setting of domain adaptation and domain generalization, our method achieves state of the art results on the transfer learning task from GTAV to Cityscapes and on the PACS benchmark",

In this work, we present the Pixel Codec Avatars (PiCA): a deep generative model of 3D human faces that achieves state of the art reconstruction performance while being computationally efficient and adaptive to the rendering conditions during execution. Our model combines two core ideas: (1) a fully convolutional architecture for decoding spatially varying features, and (2) a rendering-adaptive per-pixel decoder. Both techniques are integrated via a dense surface representation that is learned in a weakly-supervised manner from low-topology mesh tracking over training images. We demonstrate that PiCA improves reconstruction over existing techniques across testing expressions and views on persons of different gender and skin tone.

    "abstract": "A common classification task situation is where one has a large amount of data available for training, but only a small portion is annotated with class labels. The goal of semi-supervised training, in this context, is to improve classification accuracy by leverage information not only from labeled data but also from a large amount of unlabeled data. Recent works have developed significant improvements by exploring the consistency constrain between differently augmented labeled and unlabeled data. Following this path, we propose a novel unsupervised objective that focuses on the less studied relationship between the high confidence unlabeled data that are similar to each other. The new proposed Pair Loss minimizes the statistical distance between high confidence pseudo labels with similarity above a certain threshold. Combining the Pair Loss with the techniques developed by the MixMatch family, our proposed SimPLE algorithm shows significant performance gains over previous algorithms on CIFAR-100 and Mini-ImageNet, and is on par with the state-of-the-art methods on CIFAR-10 and SVHN. Furthermore, SimPLE also outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in the transfer learning setting, where models are initialized by the weights pre-trained on ImageNet or DomainNet-Real.

Built upon the recent advances in generative adversarial networks (GANs), recent L2I models have made great progress. However, a close inspection of their generated images reveals two major limitations: (1) the object-to-object as well as object-to-stuff relations are often broken and (2) each object's appearance is typically distorted lacking the key defining characteristics associated with the object class. We argue that these are caused by the lack of context-aware object and stuff feature encoding in their generators, and location-sensitive appearance representation in their discriminators. To address these limitations, two new modules are proposed in this work. First, a contextual feature transformation module is introduced in the generator to ensure that the generated feature encoding of either object or stuff is aware of other co-existing objects/stuff in the scene. Second, instead of feeding location-insensitive image features to the discriminator, we use the Gram matrix computed from the feature maps of the generated object images to preserve location-sensitive information, resulting in much enhanced object appearance.

Toward this end, we propose a semi-supervised Generative Adversarial Network with a Mask-Embedded Discriminator, which is referred to as MED-GAN. By incorporating a mask embedding module, the discriminator features are associated with spatial information, such that the focus of the discriminator can be limited in the specified regions when distinguishing between real and synthesized images. A generator is enforced to synthesize the instances holding more precise class semantics in order to deceive the enhanced discriminator. Also benefiting from mask embedding, region-based semantic regularization is imposed on the discriminator feature space, and the degree of separation between real and fake classes and among object categories can thus be increased. This eventually improves class-conditional distribution matching between real and synthesized data. In the experiments, the superior performance of MED-GAN demonstrates the effectiveness of mask embedding and associated regularizers in facilitating SSGL",

To address this challenge, we introduce LEAP (LEarning Articulated occupancy of People), a novel neural occupancy representation of the human body. Given a set of bone transformations (i.e. joint locations and rotations) and a query point in space, LEAP first maps the query point to a canonical space via learned linear blend skinning (LBS) functions and then efficiently queries the occupancy value via an occupancy network that models accurate identity- and pose-dependent deformations in the canonical space. Experiments show that our canonicalized occupancy estimation with the learned LBS functions greatly improves the generalization capability of the learned occupancy representation across various human shapes and poses, outperforming existing solutions in all settings",

The combination of a traditional rendering stack with neural networks hits a sweet spot in terms of computational complexity and realism of the resulting images. Using skinned meshes for animatable objects is a natural extension for the framework and would open it up to a plethora of applications. However, in this case the neural shading step must account for deformations that are possibly not captured in the mesh, as well as alignment accuracies and dynamics---which is not well-supported in the DNR pipeline. In this paper, we present an in-depth study of possibilities to develop the DNR framework towards handling these cases. We outline several steps that can be easily integrated into the DNR pipeline for addressing stability and deformation. We demonstrate their efficiency by building a virtual avatar pipeline, a highly challenging case with animation and clothing deformation, and show the superiority of the presented method not only with respect to the DNR pipeline but also with methods specifically for virtual avatar creation and animation. In two user studies, we observe a clear preference for our avatar model and outperform other methods on SSIM and LPIPS metrics.

    "abstract": "Kernel estimation is generally one of the key problems for blind image super-resolution (SR). Recently, Double-DIP proposes to model the kernel via a network architecture prior, while KernelGAN employs the deep linear network and several regularization losses to constrain the kernel space. However, they fail to fully exploit the general SR kernel assumption that anisotropic Gaussian kernels are sufficient for image SR. To address this issue, this paper proposes a normalizing flow-based kernel prior (FKP) for kernel modeling. By learning an invertible mapping between the anisotropic Gaussian kernel distribution and a tractable latent distribution, FKP can be easily used to replace the kernel modeling modules of Double-DIP and KernelGAN. Specifically, FKP optimizes the kernel in the latent space rather than the network parameter space, which allows it to generate reasonable kernel initialization, traverse the learned kernel manifold and improve the optimization stability. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world images demonstrate that the proposed FKP can significantly improve the kernel estimation accuracy with less parameters, runtime and memory usage, leading to state-of-the-art blind SR results",

Inferring these primitives is an important step to attain high-level, abstract scene descriptions. Previous approaches directly estimate shape parameters from a 2D or 3D input, and are only able to reproduce simple objects, yet unable to accurately parse more complex 3D scenes. In contrast, we propose a robust estimator for primitive fitting, which can meaningfully abstract real-world environments using cuboids. A RANSAC estimator guided by a neural network fits these primitives to 3D features, such as a depth map. We condition the network on previously detected parts of the scene, thus parsing it one-by-one. To obtain 3D features from a single RGB image, we additionally optimise a feature extraction CNN in an end-to-end manner. However, naively minimising point-to-primitive distances leads to large or spurious cuboids occluding parts of the scene behind. We thus propose an occlusion-aware distance metric correctly handling opaque scenes. The proposed algorithm does not require labour-intensive labels, such as cuboid annotations, for training.

We argue that the power of contrastive learning has yet to be fully unleashed, as current methods are trained only on instance-level pretext tasks, leading to representations that may be sub-optimal for downstream tasks requiring dense pixel predictions. In this paper, we introduce pixel-level pretext tasks for learning dense feature representations. The first task directly applies contrastive learning at the pixel level. We additionally propose a pixel-to-propagation consistency task that produces better results, even surpassing the state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin. Specifically, it achieves 60.2 AP, 41.4 / 40.5 mAP and 77.2 mIoU when transferred to Pascal VOC object detection (C4), COCO object detection (FPN / C4) and Cityscapes semantic segmentation using a ResNet-50 backbone network, which are 2.6 AP, 0.8 / 1.0 mAP and 1.0 mIoU better than the previous best methods built on instance-level contrastive learning. Moreover, the pixel-level pretext tasks are found to be effective for pre-training not only regular backbone networks but also head networks used for dense downstream tasks, and are complementary to instance-level contrastive methods. These results demonstrate the strong potential of defining pretext tasks at the pixel level, and suggest a new path forward in unsupervised visual representation learning.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Unsupervised video object segmentation (UVOS) aims at segmenting the primary objects in videos without any human intervention. Due to the lack of prior knowledge about the primary objects, identifying them from videos is the major challenge of UVOS. Previous methods often regard the moving objects as primary ones and rely on optical flow to capture the motion cues in videos, but the flow information alone is insufficient to distinguish the primary objects from the background objects that move together. This is because, when the noisy motion features are combined with the appearance features, the localization of the primary objects is misguided. To address this problem, we propose a novel reciprocal transformation network to discover primary objects by correlating three key factors: the intra-frame contrast, the motion cues, and temporal coherence of recurring objects. Each corresponds to a representative type of primary object, and our reciprocal mechanism enables an organic coordination of them to effectively remove ambiguous distractions from videos. Additionally, to exclude the information of the moving background objects from motion features, our transformation module enables to reciprocally transform the appearance features to enhance the motion features, so as to focus on the moving objects with salient appearance while removing the co-moving outliers. Experiments on the public benchmarks demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods",

These models are typically learned from a limited number of 3D scans and thus do not generalize well across different identities and expressions. We present the first approach to learn complete 3D models of face identity and expression geometry, and reflectance, just from images and videos. The virtually endless collection of such data, in combination with our self-supervised learning-based approach allows for learning face models that generalize beyond the span of existing approaches. Our network design and loss functions ensure a disentangled parameterization of not only identity and albedo, but also, for the first time, an expression basis. Our method also allows for in-the-wild monocular reconstruction at test time. We show that our learned models better generalize and lead to higher quality image-based reconstructions than existing approaches. We show that the learned model can also be personalized to a video, for a better capture of the geometry and albedo",

    "abstract": "Referring image segmentation aims to segment the referent that is the corresponding object or stuff referred by a natural language expression in an image. Its main challenge lies in how to effectively and efficiently differentiate between the referent and other objects of the same category as the referent. In this paper, we tackle the challenge by jointly performing compositional visual reasoning and accurate segmentation in a single stage via the proposed novel Bottom-Up Shift (BUS) and Bidirectional Attentive Refinement (BIAR) modules. Specifically, BUS progressively locates the referent along hierarchical reasoning steps implied by the expression. At each step, it locates the corresponding visual region by disambiguating between similar regions, where the disambiguation bases on the relationships between regions. By the explainable visual reasoning, BUS explicitly aligns linguistic components with visual regions so that it can identify all the mentioned entities in the expression. BIAR fuses multi-level features via a two-way attentive message passing, which captures the visual details relevant to the referent to refine segmentation results. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method consisting of BUS and BIAR modules, can not only consistently surpass all existing state-of-the-art algorithms across common benchmark datasets but also visualize interpretable reasoning steps for stepwise segmentation.

A new deformation can then be generated by sampling the coefficients of the meta-handles in a specific range. We employ biharmonic coordinates as the deformation function, which can smoothly propagate the control points' translations to the entire mesh. To avoid learning zero deformation as meta-handles, we incorporate a target-fitting module which deforms the input mesh to match a random target.

Importantly, accurate forecasting hinges upon the chosen scene decomposition. We think that superior forecasting can be achieved by decomposing a dynamic scene into individual 'things' and background 'stuff'. Background 'stuff' largely moves because of camera motion, while foreground 'things' move because of both camera and individual object motion. Following this decomposition, we introduce panoptic segmentation forecasting. Panoptic segmentation forecasting opens up a middle-ground between existing extremes, which either forecast instance trajectories or predict the appearance of future image frames. To address this task we develop a two-component model: one component learns the dynamics of the background stuff by anticipating odometry, the other one anticipates the dynamics of detected things.

In this work, we propose a new cross-dataset 3D object detection method named Scale-aware and Range-aware Domain Adaptation Network (SRDAN). We take advantage of the geometric characteristics of 3D data (i.e., size and distance), and propose the scale-aware domain alignment and the range-aware domain alignment strategies to guide the distribution alignment between two domains. For scale-aware domain alignment, we design a 3D voxel-based feature pyramid network to extract multi-scale semantic voxel features, and align the features and instances with similar scales between two domains. For range-aware domain alignment, we introduce a range-guided domain alignment module to align the features of objects according to their distance to the capture device.

The weakly supervised temporal localization problem investigates whether this task can be adequately solved with only video-level labels, significantly reducing the amount of expensive and error-prone annotation that is required. A common approach is to train a frame-level classifier where frames with the highest class probability are selected to make a video-level prediction. Frame-level activations are then used for localization. However, the absence of frame-level annotations cause the classifier to impart class bias on every frame. To address this, we propose the Action Selection Learning (ASL) approach to capture the general concept of action, a property we refer to as \"actionness\". Under ASL, the model is trained with a novel class-agnostic task to predict which frames will be selected by the classifier. Empirically, we show that ASL outperforms leading baselines on two popular benchmarks THUMOS-14 and ActivityNet-1.2, with 10.3% and 5.7% relative improvement respectively.

Different to previous works, we present to maximally utilize the massive available unlabeled data in the wild. Specifically, we first thoroughly analyze the output differences between teacher and student network on the original data and develop a data collection method.

In practice, an adaptation matrix is learned with the student network for correcting the label noise produced by the teacher network on the collected unlabeled images. The effectiveness of our DFND (Data-Free Noisy Distillation) method is then verified on several benchmarks to demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art data-free distillation methods.

    "abstract": "Due to the intensive cost of labor and expertise in annotating 3D medical images at a voxel level, most benchmark datasets are equipped with the annotations of only one type of organs and/or tumors, resulting in the so-called partially labeling issue. To address this issue, we propose a dynamic on-demand network (DoDNet) that learns to segment multiple organs and tumors on partially labeled datasets. DoDNet consists of a shared encoder-decoder architecture, a task encoding module, a controller for dynamic filter generation, and a single but dynamic segmentation head. The information of current segmentation task is encoded as a task-aware prior to tell the model what the task is expected to achieve. Different from existing approaches which fix kernels after training, the kernels in dynamic head are generated adaptively by the controller, conditioned on both input image and assigned task. Thus, DoDNet is able to segment multiple organs and tumors, as done by multiple networks or a multi-head network, in a much efficient and flexible manner. We created a large-scale partially labeled dataset called MOTS and demonstrated the superior performance of our DoDNet over other competitors on seven organ and tumor segmentation tasks. We also transferred the weights pre-trained on MOTS to a downstream multi-organ segmentation task and achieved state-of-the-art performance. This study provides a general 3D medical image segmentation model that has been pre-trained on a large-scale partially labeled dataset and can be extended (after fine-tuning) to downstream volumetric medical data segmentation tasks.

    "abstract": "Although current deep learning-based face forgery detectors achieve impressive performance in constrained scenarios, they are vulnerable to samples created by unseen manipulation methods. Some recent works show improvements in generalisation but rely on cues that are easily corrupted by common post-processing operations such as compression. In this paper, we propose LipForensics, a detection approach capable of both generalising to novel manipulations and withstanding various distortions. LipForensics targets high-level semantic irregularities in mouth movements, which are common in many generated videos. It consists in first pretraining a spatio-temporal network to perform visual speech recognition (lipreading), thus learning rich internal representations related to natural mouth motion. A temporal network is subsequently finetuned on fixed mouth embeddings of real and forged data in order to detect fake videos based on mouth movements without overfitting to low-level, manipulation-specific artefacts. Extensive experiments show that this simple approach significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art in terms of generalisation to unseen manipulations and robustness to perturbations, as well as shed light on the factors responsible for its performance",

These models maximize the similarity between two augmentations of one image, subject to certain conditions for avoiding collapsing solutions. In this paper, we report surprising empirical results that simple Siamese networks can learn meaningful representations even using none of the following: (i) negative sample pairs, (ii) large batches, (iii) momentum encoders. Our experiments show that collapsing solutions do exist for the loss and structure, but a stop-gradient operation plays an essential role in preventing collapsing. We provide a hypothesis on the implication of stop-gradient, and further show proof-of-concept experiments verifying it.

However, class-insensitivity of the earlier layers in a network only allows saliency computation with low resolution activation maps of the deeper layers, resulting in compromised image saliency. Remedifying this can lead to sanity failures. We propose CAMERAS, a technique to compute high-fidelity backpropagation saliency maps without requiring any external priors and preserving the map sanity. Our method systematically performs multi-scale accumulation and fusion of the activation maps and backpropagated gradients to compute precise saliency maps. From accurate image saliency to articulation of relative importance of input features for different models, and precise discrimination between model perception of visually similar objects, our high-resolution mapping offers multiple novel insights into the black-box deep visual models, which are presented in the paper. We also demonstrate the utility of our saliency maps in adversarial setup by drastically reducing the norm of attack signals by focusing them on the precise regions identified by our maps.

To recover the two sequences, we develop an ordered prototype learning module, which extracts visual and linguistic prototypes representing key-steps. On the other hand, to find weak alignment and perform feature learning, we develop a differentiable weak sequence alignment (DWSA) method that finds ordered one-to-one matching between sequences while allowing some items in a sequence to stay unmatched.

    "abstract": "Deep implicit functions (DIFs), as a kind of 3D shape representation, are becoming more and more popular in the 3D vision community due to their compactness and strong representation power. However, unlike polygon mesh-based templates, it remains a challenge to reason dense correspondences or other semantic relationships across shapes represented by DIFs, which limits its applications in texture transfer, shape analysis and so on. To overcome this limitation and also make DIFs more interpretable, we propose Deep Implicit Templates, a new 3D shape representation that supports explicit correspondence reasoning in deep implicit representations. Our key idea is to formulate DIFs as conditional deformations of a template implicit function. To this end, we propose Spatial Warping LSTM, which decomposes the conditional spatial transformation into multiple point-wise transformations and guarantees generalization capability. Moreover, the training loss is carefully designed in order to achieve high reconstruction accuracy while learning a plausible template with accurate correspondences in an unsupervised manner. Experiments show that our method can not only learn a common implicit template for a collection of shapes, but also establish dense correspondences across all the shapes simultaneously without any supervision",

We show how to obtain better alpha mattes by incorporating into our framework semantic classification of matting regions. Specifically, we consider and learn 20 classes of matting patterns, and propose to extend the conventional trimap to semantic trimap. The proposed semantic trimap can be obtained automatically through patch structure analysis within trimap regions. Meanwhile, we learn a multi-class discriminator to regularize the alpha prediction at semantic level, and content-sensitive weights to balance different regularization losses.

These measures are generic, applying to the checkpoints of different output types without knowing how the checkpoints are pre-trained on which dataset. They also incur low computation cost, making them practically meaningful.

In particular, combining SuperMix with RandAugment achieves 78.2% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with ResNet50.

Instead of domain-level distribution matching, as popularly adopted in the literature, we propose to learn pixel-wise cross-domain correspondences for more precise knowledge transfer. It is realized through a novel cross-domain co-attention scheme trained as region competition. In this scheme, the cross-domain correspondence module seeks for informative features on the target domain image, which after being warped to the source domain image, could best explain its annotations. Meanwhile, a collaborative mask generator competes to mask out the relevant target image region to make the remaining features uninformative. Such competitive learning strives to correlate the full foreground in cross-domain image pairs, revealing the accurate object extent in target domain. To alleviate the ambiguity of inter-domain correspondence learning, a domain-cycle consistency regularizer is futher proposed to leverage the more reliable intra-domain correspondence.

However, it is very hard to directly inherit the existing success of AdderNets on large-scale image classification to the image super-resolution task due to the different calculation paradigm. Specifically, the adder operation cannot easily learn the identity mapping, which is essential for image processing tasks. In addition, the functionality of high-pass filters cannot be ensured by AdderNets. To this end, we thoroughly analyze the relationship between an adder operation and the identity mapping and insert shortcuts to enhance the performance of SR models using adder networks. Then, we develop a learnable power activation for adjusting the feature distribution and refining details. Experiments conducted on several benchmark models and datasets demonstrate that, our image super-resolution models using AdderNets can achieve comparable performance and visual quality to that of their CNN baselines with an about 2.5x reduction on the energy consumption.

However, there is still a large gap on performance compared to their supervised counterparts. We focus on a more practical setting of semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) where both a small set of labeled target data and large amounts of labeled source data are available. To address the task of SSDA, a novel framework based on dual-level domain mixing is proposed. The proposed framework consists of three stages. First, two kinds of data mixing methods are proposed to reduce domain gap in both region-level and sample-level respectively. We can obtain two complementary domain-mixed teachers based on dual-level mixed data from holistic and partial views respectively. Then, a student model is learned by distilling knowledge from these two teachers.

    "abstract": "Despite the great success of Siamese-based trackers, their performance under complicated scenarios is still not satisfying, especially when there are distractors. To this end, we propose a novel Siamese relation network, which introduces two efficient modules, i.e. Relation Detector (RD) and Refinement Module (RM). RD performs in a meta-learning way to obtain a learning ability to filter the distractors from the background while RM aims to effectively integrate the proposed RD into the Siamese framework to generate accurate tracking result.Moreover, to further improve the discriminability and robustness of the tracker, we introduce a contrastive training strategy that attempts not only to learn matching the same target but also to learn how to distinguish the different objects. Therefore, our tracker can achieve accurate tracking results when facing background clutters, fast motion, and occlusion. Experimental results on five popular benchmarks, including VOT2018, VOT2019, OTB100, LaSOT, and UAV123, show that the proposed method is effective and can achieve state-of-the-art results.

    "abstract": "Recent generative models can synthesize \"views\" of artificial images that mimic real-world variations, such as changes in color or pose, simply by learning from unlabeled image collections. Here, we investigate whether such views can be applied to real images to benefit downstream analysis tasks such as image classification. Using a pretrained generator, we first find the latent code corresponding to a given real input image. Applying perturbations to the code creates natural variations of the image, which can then be ensembled together at test-time. We use StyleGAN2 as the source of generative augmentations and investigate this setup on classification tasks involving facial attributes, cat faces, and cars. Critically, we find that several design decisions are required towards making this process work; the perturbation procedure, weighting between the augmentations and original image, and training the classifier on synthesized images can all impact the result. Currently, we find that while test-time ensembling with GAN-based augmentations can offer some small improvements, the remaining bottlenecks are the efficiency and accuracy of the GAN reconstructions, coupled with classifier sensitivities to artifacts in GAN-generated images",

Concretely, on the one hand, a query-guided support weighting module is developed for aggregating different supports to generate the support feature. On the other hand, a support-guided query enhancement module is designed by dynamic kernels. In the second stage, we score and filter proposals via multi-level feature comparison between each proposal and the aggregated support feature based on a distance metric learnt by an effective hybrid loss, which makes the embedding space of distance metric more discriminative.

Existing methods can be divided into two main categories, including proposal-based approaches and proposal-free approaches.

In this paper, we convert this task into a multi-step decision problem and propose a novel Cascaded Prediction Network (CPN) to generate the grounding result in a coarse-to-fine manner. Concretely, we first encode video and query into the same latent space and fuse them into integrated representations. Afterwards, we construct a segment-tree-based structure and make predictions via decision navigation and signal decomposition in a cascaded way.

We propose Outfit Visualization Net (OVNet) to capture these important details (e.g. buttons, shading, textures, realistic hemlines, and interactions between garments) and produce high quality multiple-garment virtual try-on images. OVNet consists of 1) a semantic layout generator and 2) an image generation pipeline using multiple coordinated warps. We train the warper to output multiple warps using a cascade loss, which refines each successive warp to focus on poorly generated regions of a previous warp and yields consistent improvements in detail. In addition, we introduce a method for matching outfits with the most suitable model and produce significant improvements for both our and other previous try-on methods. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, we demonstrate our method generates substantially higher-quality studio images compared to prior works for multi-garment outfits.

We propose a factorized gated spatio-temporal attention module to perform non-local operations across space and time to fully utilize the available information without depending on alignment. First, we perform spatial aggregation followed by a temporal aggregation step. Next, we adaptively distribute the global spatio-temporal information to each pixel. It shows superior performance compared to existing non-local fusion techniques while being considerably more efficient. To complement the attention module, we propose a reinforcement learning-based framework for selecting keyframes from the neighborhood with the most complementary and useful information. Moreover, our adaptive approach can increase or decrease the frame usage at inference time, depending on the user's need.

    "abstract": "Capturing photographs with wrong exposures remains a major source of errors in camera-based imaging. Exposure problems are categorized as either: (i) overexposed, where the camera exposure was too long, resulting in bright and washed-out image regions, or (ii) underexposed, where the exposure was too short, resulting in dark regions. Both under- and overexposure greatly reduce the contrast and visual appeal of an image. Prior work mainly focuses on underexposed images or general image enhancement. In contrast, our proposed method targets both over- and under-exposure errors in photographs. We formulate the exposure correction problem as two main sub-problems: (i) color enhancement and (ii) detail enhancement. Accordingly, we propose a coarse-to-fine deep neural network (DNN) model, trainable in an end-to-end manner, that addresses each sub-problem separately. A key aspect of our solution is a new dataset of over 24,000 images exhibiting the broadest range of exposure values to date with a corresponding properly exposed image. Our method achieves results on par with existing state-of-the-art methods on underexposed images and yields significant improvements for images suffering from overexposure errors",

Recent works have achieved great success to transfer the person image from the source to the target pose.

To address this issue, we propose a new two-stage framework to handle the pose and appearance translation. In the first stage, we predict the target semantic parsing maps to eliminate the difficulties of pose transfer and further benefit the latter translation of per-region appearance style. In the second one, with the predicted target semantic maps, we suggest a new person image generation method by incorporating the region-adaptive normalization, in which it takes the per-region styles to guide the target appearance generation. Extensive experiments show that our proposed SPGNet can generate more semantic, consistent, and photo-realistic results and perform favorably against the state of the art methods in terms of quantitative and qualitative evaluation.

Furthermore, current few-shot learning models capture only the similarity via relation labels, but they are not exposed to class concepts associated with objects, which is likely detrimental to the classification performance due to underutilization of the available class labels. For instance, children learn the concept of tiger from a few of actual examples as well as from comparisons of tiger to other animals. Thus, we hypothesize that both similarity and class concept learning must be occurring simultaneously. With these observations at hand, we study the fundamental problem of simplistic class modeling in current few-shot learning methods. We rethink the relations between class concepts, and propose a novel Absolute-relative Learning paradigm to fully take advantage of label information to refine the image an relation representations in both supervised and unsupervised scenarios.

In practice, however, it is difficult to obtain a large amount of perfectly clean labeled data in a source domain with limited resources. Existing UniDA methods rely on source samples with correct annotations, which greatly limits their application in the real world. Hence, we consider a new realistic setting called Noisy UniDA, in which classifiers are trained with noisy labeled data from the source domain and unlabeled data with an unknown class distribution from the target domain. This paper introduces a two-head convolutional neural network framework to solve all problems simultaneously. Our network consists of one common feature generator and two classifiers with different decision boundaries. By optimizing the divergence between the two classifiers' outputs, we can detect noisy source samples, find \"unknown\" classes in the target domain, and align the distribution of the source and target domains.

Most of the existing methods for feature alignment in few-shot learning only consider image-level or spatial-level alignment while omitting the channel disparity. Our insight is that these methods would lead to poor adaptation with redundant matching, and leveraging channel-wise adjustment is the key to well adapting the learned knowledge to new classes. Therefore, in this paper, we propose to learn a dynamic alignment, which can effectively highlight both query regions and channels according to different local support information. Specifically, this is achieved by first dynamically sampling the neighbourhood of the feature position conditioned on the input few shot, based on which we further predict a both position-dependent and channel-dependent Dynamic Meta-filter. The filter is used to align the query feature with position-specific and channel-specific knowledge. Moreover, we adopt Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) to enable a more accurate control of the alignment. In such a sense our model is able to better capture fine-grained semantic context of the few-shot example and thus facilitates dynamical knowledge adaptation for few-shot learning. The resulting framework establishes the new state-of-the-arts on major few-shot visual recognition benchmarks, including miniImageNet and tieredImageNet",

Since existing category-centric datasets are insufficient for this problem, we contribute with a large-scale crowd-sourced dataset of object-centric videos suitable for this task. We further propose a novel method that learns via differentiable rendering of a predicted implicit surface of the scene. Here, inspired by classic multi-view stereo methods, our key technical contribution is a novel warp-conditioned implicit shape function, which is robust to the noise in the SfM video reconstructions that supervise our learning.

    "abstract": "We investigate the weakly-supervised audio-visual video parsing task, which aims to parse a video into temporal event segments and predict the audible or visible event categories. The task is challenging since there only exist video-level event labels for training, without indicating the temporal boundaries and modalities. Previous works take the overall event labels to supervise both audio and visual model predictions. However, we argue that such overall labels harm the model training due to the audio-visual asynchrony. For example, commentators speak in a basketball video, but we cannot visually find the speakers. In this paper, we tackle this issue by leveraging the cross-modal correspondence of audio and visual signals. We generate reliable event labels individually for each modality by swapping audio and visual tracks with other unrelated videos. If the original visual/audio data contain event clues, the event prediction from the newly assembled data would still be highly confident. In this way, we could protect our models from being misled by ambiguous event labels. In addition, we propose the cross-modal audio-visual contrastive learning to induce temporal difference on attention models within videos, i.e., urging the model to pick the current temporal segment from all context candidates.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "As airborne vehicles are becoming more autonomous and ubiquitous, it has become vital to develop the capability to detect the objects in their surroundings. This paper attempts to address the problem of drones detection from other flying drones. The erratic movement of the source and target drones, small size, arbitrary shape, large intensity variations, and occlusion make this problem quite challenging. In this scenario, region-proposal based methods are not able to capture sufficient discriminative foreground-background information. Also, due to the extremely small size and complex motion of the source and target drones, feature aggregation based methods are unable to perform well. To handle this, instead of using region-proposal based methods, we propose to use a two-stage segmentation-based approach employing spatio-temporal attention cues. During the first stage, given the overlapping frame regions, detailed contextual information is captured over convolution feature maps using pyramid pooling. After that pixel and channel-wise attention is enforced on the feature maps to ensure accurate drone localization. In the second stage, first stage detections are verified and new probable drone locations are explored. To discover new drone locations, motion boundaries are used. This is followed by tracking candidate drone detections for a few frames, cuboid formation, extraction of the 3D convolution feature map, and drones detection within each cuboid. The proposed approach is evaluated on two publicly available drone detection datasets and outperforms over several competitive baselines",

To maximally excavate the capability of transformer, we present to utilize the well-known ImageNet benchmark for generating a large amount of corrupted image pairs.

Noting that most state-of-the-art object detectors benefit from fine-tuning a pre-trained classifier, we first study how the classifiers' gains from various data augmentations transfer to object detection. The results are discouraging; the gains diminish after fine-tuning in terms of either accuracy or robustness. This work instead augments the fine-tuning stage for object detectors by exploring adversarial examples, which can be viewed as a model-dependent data augmentation. Our method dynamically selects the stronger adversarial images sourced from a detector's classification and localization branches and evolves with the detector to ensure the augmentation policy stays current and relevant. This model-dependent augmentation generalizes to different object detectors better than AutoAugment, a model-agnostic augmentation policy searched based on one particular detector.

However, existing UDA approaches in this regard inevitably require the full access to source datasets to reduce the gap between the source and target domains during model adaptation, which are impractical in the real scenarios where the source datasets are private, and thus cannot be released along with the well-trained source models. To cope with this issue, we propose a source-free domain adaptation framework for semantic segmentation, namely SFDA, in which only a well-trained source model and an unlabeled target domain dataset are available for adaptation. SFDA not only enables to recover and preserve the source domain knowledge from the source model via knowledge transfer during model adaptation, but also distills valuable information from the target domain for self-supervised learning. The pixel- and patch-level optimization objectives tailored for semantic segmentation are seamlessly integrated in the framework.

A variety of discriminator loss functions have been developed to train GAN's discriminators and they all have a common structure: a sum of real and fake losses that only depends on the actual and generated data respectively. One challenge associated with an equally weighted sum of two losses is that the training may benefit one loss but harm the other, which we show causes instability and mode collapse. In this paper, we introduce a new family of discriminator loss functions that adopts a weighted sum of real and fake parts, which we call adaptive weighted loss functions or aw-loss functions. Using the gradients of the real and fake parts of the loss, we can adaptively choose weights to train a discriminator in the direction that benefits the GAN's stability. Our method can be potentially applied to any discriminator model with a loss that is a sum of the real and fake parts.

HRP requires that more attention should be paid to human regions, while GLC requires that a group of portrait photos should be retouched to a consistent tone. Models trained on existing general photo retouching datasets, however, can hardly meet these requirements of PPR. To facilitate the research on this high-frequency task, we construct a large-scale PPR dataset, namely PPR10K, which is the first of its kind to our best knowledge.

    "abstract": "This paper defines a new visual reasoning paradigm by introducing an important factor, i.e. transformation. The motivation comes from the fact that most existing visual reasoning tasks, such as CLEVR in VQA, are solely defined to test how well the machine understands the concepts and relations within static settings, like one image. We argue that this kind of state driven visual reasoning approach has limitations in reflecting whether the machine has the ability to infer the dynamics between different states, which has been shown as important as state-level reasoning for human cognition in Piaget's theory. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel transformation driven visual reasoning task. Given both the initial and final states, the target is to infer the corresponding single-step or multi-step transformation, represented as a triplet (object, attribute, value) or a sequence of triplets, respectively. Following this definition, a new dataset namely TRANCE is constructed on the basis of CLEVR, including three levels of settings, i.e. Basic (single-step transformation), Event (multi-step transformation), and View (multi-step transformation with variant views). Experimental results show that the state-of-the-art visual reasoning models perform well on Basic, but are still far from human-level intelligence on Event and View. We believe the proposed new paradigm will boost the development of machine visual reasoning. More advanced methods and real data need to be investigated in this direction.

By eliminating HWk (up to hundreds of thousands) hand-designed object candidates to N (e.g. 100) learnable proposals, Sparse R-CNN completely avoids all efforts related to object candidates design and many-to-one label assignment. More importantly, final predictions are directly output without non-maximum suppression post-procedure. Sparse R-CNN demonstrates accuracy, run-time and training convergence performance on par with the well-established detector baselines on the challenging COCO dataset, e.g., achieving 45.0 AP in standard 3x training schedule and running at 22 fps using ResNet-50 FPN model.

To train and evaluate our system we create indoor surface texture datasets, and augment a dataset of floorplans and photos from prior work with rectified surface crops and additional annotations. Our approach handles the challenge of producing tileable textures for dominant surfaces such as floors, walls, and ceilings from a sparse set of unaligned photos that only partially cover the residence.

    "abstract": "An essential prerequisite for unleashing the potential of supervised deep learning algorithms in the area of 3D scene understanding is the availability of large-scale and richly annotated datasets. However, publicly available datasets are either in relatively small spatial scales or have limited semantic annotations due to the expensive cost of data acquisition and data annotation, which severely limits the development of fine-grained semantic understanding in the context of 3D point clouds. In this paper, we present an urban-scale photogrammetric point cloud dataset with nearly three billion richly annotated points, which is three times the number of labeled points than the existing largest photogrammetric point cloud dataset. Our dataset consists of large areas from three UK cities, covering about 7.6 km^2 of the city landscape. In the dataset, each 3D point is labeled as one of 13 semantic classes. We extensively evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art algorithms on our dataset and provide a comprehensive analysis of the results. In particular, we identify several key challenges towards urban-scale point cloud understanding. The dataset is available at https://github.com/QingyongHu/SensatUrban",

The intrinsic curiosity about these unknown instances aids in learning about them, when the corresponding knowledge is eventually available. This motivates us to propose a novel computer vision problem called: `Open World Object Detection', where a model is tasked to: 1) identify objects that have not been introduced to it as `unknown', without explicit supervision to do so, and 2) incrementally learn these identified unknown categories without forgetting previously learned classes, when the corresponding labels are progressively received. We formulate the problem, introduce a strong evaluation protocol and provide a novel solution, which we call OREO: Open World Object Detector, based on contrastive clustering and energy based unknown identification. Our experimental evaluation and ablation studies analyse the efficacy of OREO in achieving Open World objectives. As an interesting by-product, we find that identifying and characterising unknown instances helps to reduce confusion in an incremental object detection setting, where we achieve state-of-the-art performance, with no extra methodological effort.

In this work, we focus on the conditional distribution shift problem which is of great concern to current conditional invariant models. We aim to seek a kernel covariance embedding for conditional distribution which remains yet unexplored. Theoretically, we propose the Conditional Kernel Bures (CKB) metric for characterizing conditional distribution discrepancy, and derive an empirical estimation for the CKB metric without introducing the implicit kernel feature map. It provides an interpretable approach to understand the knowledge transfer mechanism. The established consistency theory of the empirical estimation provides a theoretical guarantee for convergence.

Training the decoder only needs a few labeled examples to generalize to the rest of the latent space, resulting in an infinite annotated dataset generator! These generated datasets can then be used for training any computer vision architecture just as real datasets are. As only a few images need to be manually segmented, it becomes possible to annotate images in extreme detail and generate datasets with rich object and part segmentations. To showcase the power of our approach, we generated datasets for 7 image segmentation tasks which include pixel-level labels for 34 human face parts, and 32 car parts.

Our key idea is to leverage a trained GAN to extract a pixel-wise representation from the input image and use it as feature vectors for a segmentation network. Our experiments demonstrate that this GAN-derived representation is \"readily discriminative\" and produces surprisingly good results that are comparable to those from supervised baselines trained with significantly more labels.

To tackle these challenges, we propose a unified framework for estimating the 3D hand and object poses with semi-supervised learning. We build a joint learning framework where we perform explicit contextual reasoning between hand and object representations. Going beyond limited 3D annotations in a single image, we leverage the spatial-temporal consistency in large-scale hand-object videos as a constraint for generating pseudo labels in semi-supervised learning. Our method not only improves hand pose estimation in challenging real-world dataset, but also substantially improve the object pose which has fewer ground-truths per instance.

To exploit the trade-off between motion blur at long exposures and low SNR at short exposures, we train a CNN that estimates a sharp high-SNR image by aggregating a burst of noisy short-exposure frames, related by unknown motion. We further suggest learning the burst's exposure times in an end-to-end manner, thus balancing the noise and blur across the frames.

However, facing the lack of high-quality datasets and dedicated investigations, this critical prerequisite has been left as an assumption in many works, and has been largely overlooked by current research. To bridge this gap, we proposed TextSeg, a large-scale fine-annotated text dataset with six types of annotations: word- and character-wise bounding polygons, masks, and transcriptions. We also introduce Text Refinement Network (TexRNet), a novel text segmentation approach that adapts to the unique properties of text, e.g. non-convex boundary, diverse texture, etc., which often impose burdens on traditional segmentation models. In our TexRNet, we propose text-specific network designs to address such challenges, including key features pooling and attention-based similarity checking. We also introduce trimap and discriminator losses that show significant improvement in text segmentation. Extensive experiments are carried out on both our TextSeg dataset and other existing datasets.

Some works incorporate the local comparisons through cross-modal local matching and reasoning. These complex operations introduce tremendous computation. In this paper, we design an efficient global-local alignment method. The multi-modal video sequences and text features are adaptively aggregated with a set of shared semantic centers. The local cross-modal similarities are computed between the video feature and text feature within the same center. This design enables the meticulous local comparison and reduces the computational cost of the interaction between each text-video pair. Moreover, a global alignment method is proposed to provide a global cross-modal measurement that is complementary to the local perspective. The global aggregated visual features also provide additional supervision, which is indispensable to the optimization of the learnable semantic centers.

However, a fundamental challenge in SBIR has been largely ignored so far, that is, sketches are drawn by humans and considerable style variations exist amongst different users. An effective SBIR model needs to explicitly account for this style diversity, crucially, to generalise to unseen user styles. To this end, a novel style-agnostic SBIR model is proposed. Different from existing models, a cross-modal variational autoencoder (VAE) is employed to explicitly disentangle each sketch into a semantic content part shared with the corresponding photo, and a style part unique to the sketcher. Importantly, to make our model dynamically adaptable to any unseen user styles, we propose to meta-train our cross-modal VAE by adding two style-adaptive components: a set of feature transformation layers to its encoder and a regulariser to the disentangled semantic content latent code. With this meta-learning framework, our model can not only disentangle the cross-modal shared semantic content for SBIR, but can adapt the disentanglement to any unseen user style as well, making the SBIR model truly style-agnostic.

Then, we leverage the room layout prior, a strong structural constraint of the indoor scene, to guide the generation of target views. More concretely, we estimate the room layout in the source view and transform it into the target viewpoint as guidance. Meanwhile, we also constrain the room layout of the generated target-view images to enforce geometric consistency. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we further build a large-scale photo-realistic dataset containing both small and large camera translations. The experimental results on our challenging dataset demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. The project page is at https://github.com/bluestyle97/PNVS",

    "abstract": "Boosting performance of the offline trained siamese trackers is getting harder nowadays since the fixed information of the template cropped from the first frame has been almost thoroughly mined, but they are poorly capable of resisting target appearance changes. Existing trackers with template updating mechanisms rely on time-consuming numerical optimization and complex hand-designed strategies to achieve competitive performance, hindering them from real-time tracking and practical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel tracking framework built on top of a space-time memory network that is competent to make full use of historical information related to the target for better adapting to appearance variations during tracking. Specifically, a novel memory mechanism is introduced, which stores the historical information of the target to guide the tracker to focus on the most informative regions in the current frame. Furthermore, the pixel-level similarity computation of the memory network enables our tracker to generate much more accurate bounding boxes of the target. Extensive experiments and comparisons with many competitive trackers on challenging large-scale benchmarks, OTB-2015, TrackingNet, GOT-10k, LaSOT, UAV123, and VOT2018, show that, without bells and whistles, our tracker outperforms all previous state-of-the-art real-time methods while running at 37 FPS.

    "abstract": "Determining which image regions to concentrate is critical for Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection. Conventional HOI detectors focus on either detected human and object pairs or pre-defined interaction locations, which limits learning of the effective features. In this paper, we reformulate HOI detection as an adaptive set prediction problem, with this novel formulation, we propose an Adaptive Set-based one-stage framework (AS-Net) with parallel instance and interaction branches. To attain this, we map a trainable interaction query set to an interaction prediction set with transformer. Each query adaptively aggregates the interaction-relevant features from global contexts through multi-head co-attention. Besides, the training process is supervised adaptively by matching each ground-truth with the interaction prediction. Furthermore, we design an effective instance-aware attention module to introduce instructive features from the instance branch into the interaction branch. Our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods without any extra human pose and language features on three challenging HOI detection datasets. Especially, we achieve over 31% relative improvement on a large scale HICO-DET dataset. Code is available at https://github.com/yoyomimi/AS-Net",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) aims at learning to localize objects of interest by only using the image-level labels as the supervision. While numerous efforts have been made in this field, recent approaches still suffer from two challenges: one is the part domination issue while the other is the learning robustness issue. Specifically, the former makes the localizer prone to the local discriminative object regions rather than the desired whole object, and the latter makes the localizer over-sensitive to the variations of the input images so that one can hardly obtain localization results robust to the arbitrary visual stimulus. To solve these issues, we propose a novel framework to strengthen the learning tolerance, referred to as SLT-Net, for WSOL. Specifically, we consider two-fold learning tolerance strengthening mechanisms. One is the semantic tolerance strengthening mechanism, which allows the localizer to make mistakes for classifying similar semantics so that it will not concentrate too much on the discriminative local regions. The other is the visual stimuli tolerance strengthening mechanism, which enforces the localizer to be robust to different image transformations so that the prediction quality will not be sensitive to each specific input image. Finally, we implement comprehensive experimental comparisons on two widely-used datasets CUB and ILSVRC2012, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach",

This paper proposes a novel deep neural network for learning mesh saliency using image saliency ground truth to 1) investigate whether mesh saliency is an independent perceptual measure or just a derivative of image saliency and 2) provide a weakly supervised method for more accurately predicting mesh saliency. Through extensive experiments, we not only demonstrate that our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art mesh saliency method by 116% and 21% in terms of linear correlation coefficient and AUC respectively, but also reveal that mesh saliency is intrinsically related with both image saliency and object categorical information.

We propose a novel intensity cue based on measuring inter-photon timing, defined as the time delay between detection of successive photons. Based on the statistics of inter-photon times measured by a time-resolved single-photon sensor, we develop theory and algorithms for a scene brightness estimator which works over extreme dynamic range; we experimentally demonstrate imaging scenes with a dynamic range of over ten million to one.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate Universal Domain Adaptation (UniDA) problem, which aims to transfer the knowledge from source to target under unaligned label space. The main challenge of UniDA lies in how to separate common classes (i.e., classes shared across domains), from private classes (i.e., classes only exist in one domain). Previous works treat the private samples in the target as one generic class but ignore their intrinsic structure. Consequently, the resulting representations are not compact enough in the latent space and can be easily confused with common samples. To better exploit the intrinsic structure of the target domain, we propose Domain Consensus Clustering(DCC), which exploits the domain consensus knowledge to discover discriminative clusters on both common samples and private ones. Specifically, we draw the domain consensus knowledge from two aspects to facilitate the clustering and the private class discovery, i.e., the semantic-level consensus, which identifies the cycle-consistent clusters as the common classes, and the sample-level consensus, which utilizes the cross-domain classification agreement to determine the number of clusters and discover the private classes. Based on DCC, we are able to separate the private classes from the common ones, and differentiate the private classes themselves. Finally, we apply a class-aware alignment technique on identified common samples to minimize the distribution shift, and a prototypical regularizer to inspire discriminative target clusters. Experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate DCC significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-arts",

Our framework is driven by three novel components which we also combine on top of existing techniques effortlessly. First, prototypes matching enforces latent space consistency on old classes, constraining the encoder to produce similar latent representation for previously seen classes in the subsequent steps. Second, features sparsification allows to make room in the latent space to accommodate novel classes.

Exploiting the complementarity of these two manners, few-shot auxiliary learning has recently drawn much attention to deal with few labeled data. Previous works benefit from sharing inductive bias between the main task (FSL) and auxiliary tasks (SSL), where the shared parameters of tasks are optimized by minimizing a linear combination of task losses. However, it is challenging to select a proper weight to balance tasks and reduce task conflict. To handle the problem as a whole, we propose a novel approach named as Pareto self-supervised training (PSST) for FSL. PSST explicitly decomposes the few-shot auxiliary problem into multiple constrained multi-objective subproblems with different trade-off preferences, and here a preference region in which the main task achieves the best performance is identified. Then, an effective preferred Pareto exploration is proposed to find a set of optimal solutions in such a preference region.

In particular, we insert an \"\"information bottleneck\"\" at a certain point of the deep neural network, where we disentangle the information about the bias, still letting the useful information for the training task forward-propagating in the rest of the model. One big advantage of EnD is that it does not require additional training complexity (like decoders or extra layers in the model), since it is a regularizer directly applied on the trained model.

For images and their captions, the multiplicity of the correspondences makes the task particularly challenging. Given an image (respectively a caption), there are multiple captions (respectively images) that equally make sense. In this paper, we argue that deterministic functions are not sufficiently powerful to capture such one-to-many correspondences. Instead, we propose to use Probabilistic Cross-Modal Embedding (PCME), where samples from the different modalities are represented as probabilistic distributions in the common embedding space. Since common benchmarks such as COCO suffer from non-exhaustive annotations for cross-modal matches, we propose to additionally evaluate retrieval on the CUB dataset, a smaller yet clean database where all possible image-caption pairs are annotated. We extensively ablate PCME and demonstrate that it not only improves the retrieval performance over its deterministic counterpart but also provides uncertainty estimates that render the embeddings more interpretable.

In this paper, we propose TransFill, a multi-homography transformed fusion method to fill the hole by referring to another source image that shares scene contents with the target image. We first align the source image to the target image by estimating multiple homographies guided by different depth levels. We then learn to adjust the color and apply a pixel-level warping to each homography-warped source image to make it more consistent with the target.

However, we also prove a negative fact that the focal loss is not strictly proper, i.e., the confidence score of the classifier obtained by focal loss minimization does not match the true class-posterior probability. This may cause the trained classifier to give an unreliable confidence score, which can be harmful in critical applications. To mitigate this problem, we prove that there exists a particular closed-form transformation that can recover the true class-posterior probability from the outputs of the focal risk minimizer. Our experiments show that our proposed transformation successfully improves the quality of class-posterior probability estimation and improves the calibration of the trained classifier, while preserving the same prediction accuracy",

To yield effective visual representations for text recognition, we further suggest novel augmentation heuristics, different encoder architectures and custom projection heads. Experiments on handwritten text and on scene text show that when a text decoder is trained on the learned representations, our method outperforms non-sequential contrastive methods. In addition, when the amount of supervision is reduced, SeqCLR significantly improves performance compared with supervised training, and when fine-tuned with 100% of the labels, our method achieves state-of-the-art results on standard handwritten text recognition benchmarks",

    "abstract": "Due to its powerful capability of representation learning and high-efficiency computation, deep hashing has made significant progress in large-scale image retrieval. However, deep hashing networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which is a practical secure problem but seldom studied in hashing-based retrieval field. In this paper, we propose a novel prototype-supervised adversarial network (ProS-GAN), which formulates a flexible generative architecture for efficient and effective targeted hashing attack. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first generation-based method to attack deep hashing networks. Generally, our proposed framework consists of three parts, i.e., a PrototypeNet, a generator and a discriminator. Specifically, the designed PrototypeNet embeds the target label into the semantic representation and learns the prototype code as the category-level representative of the target label. Moreover, the semantic representation and the original image are jointly fed into the generator for flexible targeted attack. Particularly, the prototype code is adopted to supervise the generator to construct the targeted adversarial example by minimizing the Hamming distance between the hash code of the adversarial example and the prototype code. Furthermore, the generator is against the discriminator to simultaneously encourage the adversarial examples visually realistic and the semantic representation informative. Extensive experiments verify that the proposed framework can efficiently produce adversarial examples with better targeted attack performance and transferability over state-of-the-art targeted attack methods of deep hashing",

Given an input image with arbitrary holeregions, PD-GAN produces multiple inpainting results withdiverse and visually realistic content. Our PD-GAN is builtupon a vanilla GAN which generates images based on random noise. During image generation, we modulate deepfeatures of input random noise from coarse-to-fine by injecting an initially restored image and the hole regions inmultiple scales. We argue that during hole filling, the pixels near the hole boundary should be more deterministic(i.e., with higher probability trusting the context and initially restored image to create natural inpainting boundary), while those pixels lie in the center of the hole shouldenjoy more degrees of freedom (i.e., more likely to dependon the random noise for enhancing diversity). To this end, we propose spatially probabilistic diversity normalization(SPDNorm) inside the modulation to model the probabilityof generating a pixel conditioned on the context information. SPDNorm dynamically balances the realism and diversity inside the hole region, making the generated content more diverse towards the hole center and resembleneighboring image content more towards the hole boundary. Meanwhile, we propose a perceptual diversity loss tofurther empower PD-GAN for diverse content generation.

Leveraging data augmentations is a promising direction towards addressing this challenge.

Prior studies on Copy-Paste relied on modeling the surrounding visual context for pasting the objects. However, we find that the simple mechanism of pasting objects randomly is good enough and can provide solid gains on top of strong baselines. Furthermore, we show Copy-Paste is additive with semi-supervised methods that leverage extra data through pseudo labeling (eg. self-training). On COCO instance segmentation, we achieve 49.1 mask AP and 57.3 box AP, an improvement of +0.6 mask AP and +1.5 box AP over the previous state-of-the-art.

In this work, we investigate the optimality of this design pattern over a broad range of mobile accelerators by revisiting the usefulness of regular convolutions. We discover that regular convolutions are a potent component to boost the latency-accuracy trade-off for object detection on accelerators, provided that they are placed strategically in the network via neural architecture search. By incorporating regular convolutions in the search space and directly optimizing the network architectures for object detection, we obtain a family of object detection models, MobileDets, that achieve state-of-the-art results across mobile accelerators. On the COCO object detection task, MobileDets outperform MobileNetV3+SSDLite by 1.7 mAP at comparable mobile CPU inference latencies. MobileDets also outperform MobileNetV2+SSDLite by 1.9 mAP on mobile CPUs, 3.7 mAP on Google EdgeTPU, 3.4 mAP on Qualcomm Hexagon DSP and 2.7 mAP on Nvidia Jetson GPU without increasing latency. Moreover, MobileDets are comparable with the state-of-the-art MnasFPN on mobile CPUs even without using the feature pyramid, and achieve better mAP scores on both EdgeTPUs and DSPs with up to 2x speedup.

Under this optimization formulation, we show that two important streams of research in vision, namely robust model fitting and deep feature learning, correspond to optimizing one block of the unknown variables while fixing the other block. This analysis naturally leads to our second contribution - the SGP algorithm that performs alternating minimization to solve the joint optimization. SGP iteratively executes two meta-algorithms: a teacher that performs robust model fitting given learned features to generate geometric pseudo-labels, and a student that performs deep feature learning under noisy supervision of the pseudo-labels. As a third contribution, we apply SGP to two perception problems on large-scale real datasets, namely relative camera pose estimation on MegaDepth and point cloud registration on 3DMatch.

Our architecture is an integration of a graph-constrained relational GAN and a conditional GAN, where a previously generated layout becomes the next input constraint, enabling iterative refinement. A surprising discovery of our research is that a simple non-iterative training process, dubbed component-wise GT-conditioning, is effective in learning such a generator. The iterative generator further allows us to improve a metric of choice via meta-optimization techniques by controlling when to pass which input constraints during iterative refinement. Our qualitative and quantitative evaluation based on the three standard metrics demonstrate that the proposed system makes significant improvements over the current state-of-the-art, even competitive against the ground-truth floorplans, designed by professional architects.

In this paper, we innovatively revisit the label assignment from a global perspective and propose to formulate the assigning procedure as an Optimal Transport (OT) problem -- a well-studied topic in Optimization Theory. Concretely, we define the unit transportation cost between each demander (anchor) and supplier (gt) pair as the weighted summation of their classification and regression losses. After formulation, finding the best assignment solution is converted to solve the optimal transport plan at minimal transportation costs, which can be solved via Sinkhorn-Knopp Iteration. On COCO, a single FCOS-ResNet-50 detector equipped with Optimal Transport Assignment (OTA) can reach 40.7% mAP under 1x scheduler, outperforming all other existing assigning methods.

In this work, we present MagNet, a multi-scale framework that resolves local ambiguity by looking at the image at multiple magnification levels. MagNet has multiple processing stages, where each stage corresponds to a magnification level, and the output of one stage is fed into the next stage for coarse-to-fine information propagation. Each stage analyzes the image at a higher resolution than the previous stage, recovering the previously lost details due to the lossy downsampling step, and the segmentation output is progressively refined through the processing stages.

In this work, we propose an Efficient Multi-stage Video Denoising algorithm, called EMVD, to drastically reduce the complexity while maintaining or even improving the performance. First, a fusion stage reduces the noise through a recursive combination of all past frames in the video. Then, a denoising stage removes the noise in the fused frame. Finally, a refinement stage restores the missing high frequency in the denoised frame. All stages operate on a transform-domain representation obtained by learnable and invertible linear operators which simultaneously increase accuracy and decrease complexity of the model. A single loss on the final output is sufficient for successful convergence, hence making EMVD easy to train. Experiments on real raw data demonstrate that EMVD outperforms the state of the art when complexity is constrained, and even remains competitive against methods whose complexities are several orders of magnitude higher. Further, the low complexity and memory requirements of EMVD enable real-time video denoising on commercial SoC in mobile devices",

This is achieved by training our model to learn the underlying distribution of natural tracklets. As such, our model allows us not only to assign new detections to existing tracklets, but also to inpaint a tracklet when an object has been lost for a long time, e.g., due to occlusion, by sampling tracklets so as to fill the gap caused by misdetections.

Most image generation methods, however, are ill-suited to this problem setting, as they make the assumption that one can assign arbitrary color to each pixel. In fact, naive application of existing methods fails even in simple domains such as MNIST digits, since one cannot create darker pixels by adding light. We know, however, that the human visual system can be fooled by optical illusions involving certain spatial configurations of brightness and contrast. Our key insight is that one can leverage this behavior to produce high quality images with negligible artifacts. For example, we can create the illusion of darker patches by brightening surrounding pixels. We propose a novel optimization procedure to produce images that satisfy both semantic and non-negativity constraints. Our approach can incorporate existing state-of-the-art methods, and exhibits strong performance in a variety of tasks including image-to-image translation and style transfer",

Second, we design a two-stage dimension normalization scheme to calibrate the 2D and 3D features for better integration. Third, we design a semantic-aware adversarial training model to extend our framework for training with unpaired 3D data.

    "abstract": "Visual Semantic Embedding (VSE) is a dominant approach for vision-language retrieval, which aims at learning a deep embedding space such that visual data are embedded close to their semantic text labels or descriptions. Recent VSE models use complex methods to better contextualize and aggregate multi-modal features into holistic embeddings. However, we discover that surprisingly simple (but carefully selected) global pooling functions (e.g., max pooling) outperform those complex models, across different feature extractors. Despite its simplicity and effectiveness, seeking the best pooling function for different data modality and feature extractor is costly and tedious, especially when the size of features varies (e.g., text, video). Therefore, we propose a Generalized Pooling Operator (GPO), which learns to automatically adapt itself to the best pooling strategy for different features, requiring no manual tuning while staying effective and efficient. We extend the VSE model using this proposed GPO and denote it as VSE. Without bells and whistles, VSE outperforms previous VSE methods significantly on image-text retrieval benchmarks across popular feature extractors. With a simple adaptation, variants of VSE further demonstrate its strength by achieving the new state of the art on two video-text retrieval datasets. Comprehensive experiments and visualizations confirm that GPO always discovers the best pooling strategy and can be a plug-and-play feature aggregation module for standard VSE models",

    "abstract": "Detecting aligned 3D keypoints is essential under many scenarios such as object tracking, shape retrieval and robotics. However, it is generally hard to prepare a high-quality dataset for all types of objects due to the ambiguity of keypoint itself. Meanwhile, current unsupervised detectors are unable to generate aligned keypoints with good coverage. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised aligned keypoint detector, Skeleton Merger, which utilizes skeletons to reconstruct objects. It is based on an Autoencoder architecture. The encoder proposes keypoints and predicts activation strengths of edges between keypoints. The decoder performs uniform sampling on the skeleton and refines it into small point clouds with pointwise offsets. Then the activation strengths are applied and the sub-clouds are merged. Composite Chamfer Distance (CCD) is proposed as a distance between the input point cloud and the reconstruction composed of sub-clouds masked by activation strengths. We demonstrate that Skeleton Merger is capable of detecting semantically-rich salient keypoints with good alignment, and shows comparable performance to supervised methods on the KeypointNet dataset. It is also shown that the detector is robust to noise and subsampling. Our code is available at https://github.com/eliphatfs/SkeletonMerger",

Specifically, the temporal alignment loss (i.e., Soft-DTW) aims for the minimum cost for temporally aligning videos in the embedding space. However, optimizing solely for this term leads to trivial solutions, particularly, one where all frames get mapped to a small cluster in the embedding space. To overcome this problem, we propose a temporal regularization term (i.e., Contrastive-IDM) which encourages different frames to be mapped to different points in the embedding space. Extensive evaluations on various tasks, including action phase classification, action phase progression, and fine-grained frame retrieval, on three datasets, namely Pouring, Penn Action, and IKEA ASM, show superior performance of our approach over state-of-the-art methods for self-supervised representation learning from videos. In addition, our method provides significant performance gain where labeled data is lacking",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "One of the key steps in Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is to estimate the performance of candidate architectures. Existing methods either directly use the validation performance or learn a predictor to estimate the performance. However, these methods can be either computationally expensive or very inaccurate, which may severely affect the search efficiency and performance. Moreover, as it is very difficult to annotate architectures with accurate performance on specific tasks, learning a promising performance predictor is often non-trivial due to the lack of labeled data. In this paper, we argue that it may not be necessary to estimate the absolute performance for NAS. On the contrary, we may need only to understand whether an architecture is better than a baseline one. However, how to exploit this comparison information as the reward and how to well use the limited labeled data remains two great challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel Contrastive Neural Architecture Search (CTNAS) method which performs architecture search by taking the comparison results between architectures as the reward. Specifically, we design and learn a Neural Architecture Comparator (NAC) to compute the probability of candidate architectures being better than a baseline one. Moreover, we present a baseline updating scheme to improve the baseline iteratively in a curriculum learning manner. More critically, we theoretically show that learning NAC is equivalent to optimizing the ranking over architectures. Extensive experiments in three search spaces demonstrate the superiority of our CTNAS over existing methods",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Text recognition is a popular research subject with many associated challenges. Despite the considerable progress made in recent years, the text recognition task itself is still constrained to solve the problem of reading cropped line text images and serves as a subtask of optical character recognition (OCR) systems. As a result, the final text recognition result is limited by the performance of the text detector. In this paper, we propose a simple, elegant and effective paradigm called Implicit Feature Alignment (IFA), which can be easily integrated into current text recognizers, resulting in a novel inference mechanism called IFA-inference. This enables an ordinary text recognizer to process multi-line text such that text detection can be completely freed. Specifically, we integrate IFA into the two most prevailing text recognition streams (attention-based and CTC-based) and propose attention-guided dense prediction (ADP) and Extended CTC (ExCTC). Furthermore, the Wasserstein-based Hollow Aggregation Cross-Entropy (WH-ACE) is proposed to suppress negative predictions to assist in training ADP and ExCTC. We experimentally demonstrate that IFA achieves state-of-the-art performance on end-to-end document recognition tasks while maintaining the fastest speed, and ADP and ExCTC complement each other on the perspective of different application scenarios.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Humans live within a 3D space and constantly interact with it to perform tasks. Such interactions involve physical contact between surfaces that is semantically meaningful. Our goal is to learn how humans interact with scenes and leverage this to enable virtual characters to do the same. To that end, we introduce a novel Human-Scene Interaction (HSI) model that encodes proximal relationships, called POSA for \"Pose with prOximitieS and contActs\". The representation of interaction is body-centric, which enables it to generalize to new scenes. Specifically, POSA augments the SMPL-X parametric human body model such that, for every mesh vertex, it encodes (a) the contact probability with the scene surface and (b) the corresponding semantic scene label. We learn POSA with a VAE conditioned on the SMPL-X vertices, and train on the PROX dataset, which contains SMPL-X meshes of people interacting with 3D scenes, and the corresponding scene semantics from the PROX-E dataset. We demonstrate the value of POSA with two applications. First, we automatically place 3D scans of people in scenes. We use a SMPL-X model fit to the scan as a proxy and then find its most likely placement in 3D. POSA provides an effective representation to search for \"affordances\" in the scene that match the likely contact relationships for that pose. We perform a perceptual study that shows significant improvement over the state of the art on this task. Second, we show that POSA's learned representation of body-scene interaction supports monocular human pose estimation that is consistent with a 3D scene, improving on the state of the art.

    "abstract": "Pan-sharpening is a process of merging a high-resolution (HR) panchromatic (PAN) image and its corresponding low-resolution (LR) multi-spectral (MS) image to create an HR-MS and pan-sharpened image. However, due to the different sensors' locations, characteristics and acquisition time, PAN and MS image pairs often tend to have various amounts of misalignment. Conventional deep-learning-based methods that were trained with such misaligned PAN-MS image pairs suffer from diverse artifacts such as double-edge and blur artifacts in the resultant PAN-sharpened images. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called shift-invariant pan-sharpening with moving object alignment (SIPSA-Net) which is the first method to take into account such large misalignment of moving object regions for PAN sharpening. The SISPA-Net has a feature alignment module (FAM) that can adjust one feature to be aligned to another feature, even between the two different PAN and MS domains. For better alignment in pan-sharpened images, a shift-invariant spectral loss is newly designed, which ignores the inherent misalignment in the original MS input, thereby having the same effect as optimizing the spectral loss with a well-aligned MS image. Extensive experimental results show that our SIPSA-Net can generate pan-sharpened images with remarkable improvements in terms of visual quality and alignment, compared to the state-of-the-art methods",

In this paper, we introduce 5 new indoor datasets for visual localization in challenging real-world environments. They were captured in a large shopping mall and a large metro station in Seoul, South Korea, using a dedicated mapping platform consisting of 10 cameras and 2 laser scanners. In order to obtain accurate ground truth camera poses, we developed a robust LiDAR SLAM which provides initial poses that are then refined using a novel structure-from-motion based optimization.

Based on the causal framework, we propose to distill the Colliding Effect between the old and the new data, which is fundamentally equivalent to the causal effect of data replay, but without any cost of replay storage. Thanks to the causal effect analysis, we can further capture the Incremental Momentum Effect of the data stream, removing which can help to retain the old effect overwhelmed by the new data effect, and thus alleviate the forgetting of the old class in testing.

A critical question remains unanswered: \"can backdoor attacks succeed using physical objects as triggers, making them a credible threat against deep learning systems in the real world?\" We conduct a detailed empirical study to explore this question for facial recognition, a critical deep learning task. Using 7 physical objects as triggers, we collect a custom dataset of 3205 images of 10 volunteers and use it to study the feasibility of \"physical\" backdoor attacks under a variety of real-world conditions. Our study reveals two key findings. First, physical backdoor attacks can be highly successful if they are carefully configured to overcome the constraints imposed by physical objects. In particular, the placement of successful triggers is largely constrained by the victim model's dependence on key facial features. Second, four of today's state-of-the-art defenses against (digital) backdoors are ineffective against physical backdoors, because the use of physical objects breaks core assumptions used to construct these defenses. Our study confirms that (physical) backdoor attacks are not a hypothetical phenomenon but rather pose a serious real-world threat to critical classification tasks.

Therefore, in this paper, we focus on the semi-supervised segmentation problem where only a small set of labeled data is provided with a much larger collection of totally unlabeled images. Nevertheless, due to the limited annotations, models may overly rely on the contexts available in the training data, which causes poor generalization to the scenes unseen before. A preferred high-level representation should capture the contextual information while not losing self-awareness. Therefore, we propose to maintain the context-aware consistency between features of the same identity but with different contexts, making the representations robust to the varying environments. Moreover, we present the Directional Contrastive Loss (DC Loss) to accomplish the consistency in a pixel-to-pixel manner, only requiring the feature with lower quality to be aligned towards its counterpart.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Pedestrian detection is used in many vision based applications ranging from video surveillance to autonomous driving. Despite achieving high performance, it is still largely unknown how well existing detectors generalize to unseen data. This is important because a practical detector should be ready to use in various scenarios in applications. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive study in this paper, using a general principle of direct cross-dataset evaluation. Through this study, we find that existing state-of-the-art pedestrian detectors, though perform quite well when trained and tested on the same dataset, generalize poorly in cross dataset evaluation. We demonstrate that there are two reasons for this trend. Firstly, their designs (e.g. anchor settings) may be biased towards popular benchmarks in the traditional single-dataset training and test pipeline, but as a result largely limit their generalization capability. Secondly, the training source is generally not dense in pedestrians and diverse in scenarios. Under direct cross-dataset evaluation, surprisingly, we find that a general purpose object detector, without pedestrian-tailored adaptation in design, generalizes much better compared to existing state-of-the-art pedestrian detectors. Furthermore, we illustrate that diverse and dense datasets, collected by crawling the web, serve to be an efficient source of pre-training for pedestrian detection. Accordingly, we propose a progressive training pipeline and find that it works well for autonomous-driving oriented pedestrian detection. Consequently, the study conducted in this paper suggests that more emphasis should be put on cross-dataset evaluation for the future design of generalizable pedestrian detectors.

Complex lane line shapes require high-dimensional output of CNNs to model global structures, which further increases the demand for model capacity and training data. In contrast, the locality of a lane marker has finite geometric variations and spatial coverage. We propose a novel lane marker detection solution, FOLOLane, that focuses on modeling local patterns and achieving prediction of global structures in a bottom-up manner. Specifically, the CNN models low-complexity local patterns with two separate heads, the first one predicts the existence of key points, and the second refines the location of key points in the local range and correlates key points of the same lane line. The locality of the task is consistent with the limited FOV of the feature in CNN, which in turn leads to more stable training and better generalization. In addition, an efficiency-oriented decoding algorithm was proposed as well as a greedy one, which achieving 36% runtime gains at the cost of negligible performance degradation. Both of the two decoders integrated local information into the global geometry of lane markers. In the absence of a complex network architecture design, the proposed method greatly outperforms all existing methods on public datasets while achieving the best state-of-the-art results and real-time processing simultaneously",

Although recent advances have been made by incorporating additional object annotations, existing methods often fail to handle images with multiple disparate objects. The main cause is that, during inference, they apply a global style to the whole image and do not consider the large style discrepancy between instance and background, or within instances. To address this problem, we propose a class-aware memory network that explicitly reasons about local style variations. A key-values memory structure, with a set of read/update operations, is introduced to record class-wise style variations and access them without requiring an object detector at the test time. The key stores a domain-agnostic content representation for allocating memory items, while the values encode domain-specific style representations.

In this paper, we address these limitations by presenting the first incremental approach to few-shot instance segmentation: iMTFA. We learn discriminative embeddings for object instances that are merged into class representatives. Storing embedding vectors rather than images effectively solves the memory overhead problem. We match these class embeddings at the RoI-level using cosine similarity. This allows us to add new classes without the need for further training or access to previous training data. In a series of experiments, we consistently outperform the current state-of-the-art.

To accomplish this, we incorporate three different criteria that ranges from a pixel-level matching confidence to a video-level one into a bottom-up pipeline, and plan a curriculum that is aware of current representation power for the adaptive hardness of negative samples during training.

In this paper, we propose a new framework, with the interaction between the scene and the human motion is taken into account. Considering the uncertainty of human motion, we formulate this task as a generative task, whose objective is to generate plausible human motion conditioned on both the scene and the human's initial position. This framework factorizes the distribution of human motions into a distribution of movement trajectories conditioned on scenes and that of body pose dynamics conditioned on both scenes and trajectories. We further derive a GAN-based learning approach, with discriminators to enforce the compatibility between the human motion and the contextual scene as well as the 3D-to-2D projection constraints. We assess the effectiveness of the proposed method on two challenging datasets, which cover both synthetic and real-world environmentemphasizes local structural constraints via depth-map crops, and a projection discriminator that emphasizes global structural constraints via 3D-to-2D motion projections.

Traditionally, 3D position of the camera is represented by Cartesian coordinate and the orientation is represented by Euler angle or quaternions. These representations are manually designed, which may not be the most efficient representation for downstream tasks. In this work, we propose an approach to learn neural representations of camera poses and 3D scenes, coupled with neural representations of local camera movements. Specifically, the camera pose and 3D scene are represented as vectors and the local camera movement is represented as a matrix operating on the vector of the camera pose. We demonstrate that the camera movement can further be parametrized as a matrix Lie algebra that underlies a rotation system in the neural space. The vector representations are then concatenated and generate the posed 2D image through a decoder network. The model is learned from only posed 2D images and corresponding camera poses, without access to depth or shape. We conduct extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets. The results show that compared with other camera pose representations, our learned representation is more robust to noise in novel view synthesis and more effective in camera pose regression",

Conventional methods make strong assumption on that each class owns adequate instances to outline its data distribution, likely leading to bias prediction where the training samples are sparse across age classes. Instead, our PML aims to adaptively refine the age label pattern by enforcing a couple of margins, which fully takes in the in-between discrepancy of the intra-class variance, inter-class variance and class-center. Our PML typically incorporates with the ordinal margin and the variational margin, simultaneously plugging in the globally-tuned deep neural network paradigm. More specifically, the ordinal margin learns to exploit the correlated relationship of the real-world age labels. Accordingly, the variational margin is leveraged to minimize the influence of head classes that misleads the prediction of tailed samples. Moreover, our optimization carefully seeks a series of indicator curricula to achieve robust and efficient model training. Extensive experimental results on three face aging datasets demonstrate that our PML achieves compelling performance compared to state of the arts. Code will be made publicly",

Unlike image where the context information is distributed evenly over the object, most LiDAR points are distributed along the object boundary, which means the boundary features are more critical in LiDAR points 3D detection. However, quantization inevitably introduces ambiguity during both the training and inference stages. To alleviate this problem, we propose a one-stage and voting-based 3D detector, named Point-Voxel-Grid Network (PVGNet). In particular, PVGNet extracts point, voxel and grid-level features in a unified backbone architecture and produces point-wise fusion features. It segments LiDAR points into foreground and background, predicts a 3D bounding box for each foreground point, and performs group voting to get the final detection results. Moreover, we observe that instance-level point imbalance due to occlusion and observation distance also degrades the detection performance. A novel instance-aware focal loss is proposed to alleviate this problem and further improve the detection ability. We conduct experiments on the KITTI and Waymo datasets.

In the case of the latter, it becomes highly difficult for SR methods to disentangle the blur to remove, and that to leave as is. In this paper, we propose a novel blind SR framework based on kernel-oriented adaptive local adjustment (KOALA) of SR features, called KOALAnet, which jointly learns spatially-variant degradation and restoration kernels in order to adapt to the spatially-variant blur characteristics in real images. Our KOALAnet outperforms recent blind SR methods for synthesized LR images obtained with randomized degradations, and we further show that the proposed KOALAnet produces the most natural results for artistic photographs with intentional blur, which are not over-sharpened, by effectively handling images mixed with in-focus and out-of-focus areas",

Specifically, we establish dense correspondences of each spatial location and its context, and explicitly constrain the correlation volumes through self-supervised learning. To exploit the temporal context, existing approaches generally utilize two or more adjacent frames to construct an enhanced feature representation, but the dynamic motion scene is inherently difficult to depict via CNNs. Instead, our paper proposes a learnable correlation operator to establish frame-to-frame matches over convolutional feature maps in the different layers to align and propagate temporal context.

In this work, we present a novel framework for unsupervised domain adaptation based on the notion of target-domain consistency training. Intuitively, our work is based on the insight that in order to perform well on the target domain, a model's output should be consistent with respect to small perturbations of inputs in the target domain. Specifically, we introduce a new loss term to enforce pixelwise consistency between the model's predictions on a target image and perturbed version of the same image. In comparison to popular adversarial adaptation methods, our approach is simpler, easier to implement, and more memory-efficient during training.

However, since missing details in low-resolution (LR) images mainly exist in regions of edges and textures, less computational resources are required for those flat regions.

In this paper, we explore the sparsity in image SR to improve inference efficiency of SR networks. Specifically, we develop a Sparse Mask SR (SMSR) network to learn sparse masks to prune redundant computation. Within our SMSR, spatial masks learn to identify \"important\" regions while channel masks learn to mark redundant channels in those \"unimportant\" regions. Consequently, redundant computation can be accurately localized and skipped while maintaining comparable performance. It is demonstrated that our SMSR achieves state-of-the-art performance with 41%/33%/27% FLOPs being reduced for x2/3/4 SR. Code is available at: https://github.com/LongguangWang/SMSR",

To this end, we propose a new positive sample propagation (PSP) module to discover and exploit the closely related audio-visual pairs by evaluating the relationship within every possible pair. It can be done by constructing an all-pair similarity map between each audio and visual segment, and only aggregating the features from the pairs with high similarity scores.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Unsupervised contrastive learning has achieved outstanding success, while the mechanism of contrastive loss has been less studied. In this paper, we concentrate on the understanding of the behaviours of unsupervised contrastive loss. We will show that the contrastive loss is a hardness-aware loss function, and the temperature t controls the strength of penalties on hard negative samples. The previous study has shown that uniformity is a key property of contrastive learning. We build relations between the uniformity and the temperature t. We will show that uniformity helps the contrastive learning to learn separable features, however excessive pursuit to the uniformity makes the contrastive loss not tolerant to semantically similar samples, which may break the underlying semantic structure and be harmful to the formation of features useful for downstream tasks. This is caused by the inherent defect of the instance discrimination objective. Specifically, instance discrimination objective tries to push all different instances apart, ignoring the underlying relations between samples. Pushing semantically consistent samples apart has no positive effect for acquiring a prior informative to general downstream tasks. A well-designed contrastive loss should have some extents of tolerance to the closeness of semantically similar samples. Therefore, we find that the contrastive loss meets a uniformity-tolerance dilemma, and a good choice of temperature can compromise these two properties properly to both learn separable features and tolerant to semantically similar samples, improving the feature qualities and the downstream performances",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Deep face recognition has achieved remarkable improvements due to the introduction of margin-based softmax loss, in which the prototype stored in the last linear layer represents the center of each class. In these methods, training samples are enforced to be close to positive prototypes and far apart from negative prototypes by a clear margin. However, we argue that prototype learning only employs sample-to-prototype comparisons without considering sample-to-sample comparisons during training and the low loss value gives us an illusion of perfect feature embedding, impeding the further exploration of SGD. To this end, we propose Variational Prototype Learning (VPL), which represents every class as a distribution instead of a point in the latent space. By identifying the slow feature drift phenomenon, we directly inject memorized features into prototypes to approximate variational prototype sampling. The proposed VPL can simulate sample-to-sample comparisons within the classification framework, encouraging the SGD solver to be more exploratory, while boosting performance. Moreover, VPL is conceptually simple, easy to implement, computationally efficient and memory saving. We present extensive experimental results on popular benchmarks, which demonstrate the superiority of the proposed VPL method over the state-of-the-art competitors",

    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed great progress in object detection. However, due to the domain shift problem, applying the knowledge of an object detector learned from one specific domain to another one often suffers severe performance degradation. Most existing methods adopt feature alignment either on the backbone network or instance classifier to increase the transferability of object detector. Different from existing methods, we propose to perform feature alignment of foreground and background in the RPN stage such that the foreground and background RPN proposals in target domain can be effectively separated. Specifically, we first construct one set of learnable RPN prototypes, and then enforce the RPN features to align with the prototypes for both source and target domains. It essentially cooperates the learning of RPN prototypes and features to align the source and target RPN features. In this paradigm, the pseudo label of proposals in target domain need be first generated, and we propose a simple yet effective method suitable for RPN feature alignment,i.e., using the filtered detection results to guide the pseudo label generation of RPN proposals by IoU. Furthermore, we adopt Grad CAM to find the discriminative region within a proposal and use it to increase the discriminability of RPN features for alignment by spatially weighting. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple cross-domain detection scenarios. The results show the effectiveness of our proposed method against previous state-of-the-art methods",

    "abstract": "Time-to-contact (TTC), the time for an object to collide with the observer's plane, is a powerful tool for path planning: it is potentially more informative than the depth, velocity, and acceleration of objects in the scene---even for humans. TTC presents several advantages, including requiring only a monocular, uncalibrated camera. However, regressing TTC for each pixel is not straightforward, and most existing methods make over-simplifying assumptions about the scene. We address this challenge by estimating TTC via a series of simpler, binary classifications. We predict with low latency whether the observer will collide with an obstacle within a certain time, which is often more critical than knowing exact, per-pixel TTC. For such scenarios, our method offers a temporal geofence in 6.4 ms---over 25x faster than existing methods. Our approach can also estimate per-pixel TTC with arbitrarily fine quantization (including continuous values), when the computational budget allows for it. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first to offer TTC information (binary or coarsely quantized) at sufficiently high frame-rates for practical use",

Then we propose a novel appearance-semantic-geometry descriptor to track text instances, in which semantic features can improve the robustness against appearance changes. To overcome the lack of character-level annotations, we propose a novel weakly-supervised character center detection module, which only uses word-level annotated real images to generate character-level labels.

However, these data-driven methods still suffer from one crucial limitation: lack of interpretability. To overcome this limitation, we leverage the power of discrete choice models to learn interpretable rule-based intents, and subsequently utilise the expressibility of neural networks to model scene-specific residual.

The low-dimensionality of the latent space and the high expressivity of the EBM make it easy for the model to capture the multimodality of pedestrian trajectory distributions. LB-EBM is learned from expert demonstrations (i.e., human trajectories) projected into the latent space. Sampling from or optimizing the learned LB-EBM yields a belief vector which is used to make a path plan, which then in turn helps to predict a long-range trajectory. The effectiveness of LB-EBM and the two-step approach are supported by strong empirical results.

We show that standard supervised contrastive learning degrades in the presence of label noise and propose an interpolation training strategy to mitigate this behavior. We further propose a novel label noise detection method that exploits the robust feature representations learned via contrastive learning to estimate per-sample soft-labels whose disagreements with the original labels accurately identify noisy samples.

This higher level of abstraction can also capture key features, such as loops of repeated primitives, that are currently inaccessible at lower levels of representation. We therefore introduce Motion Programs, a neuro-symbolic, program-like representation that expresses motions as a composition of high-level primitives. We also present a system for automatically inducing motion programs from videos of human motion and for leveraging motion programs in video synthesis. Experiments show that motion programs can accurately describe a diverse set of human motions and the inferred programs contain semantically meaningful motion primitives, such as arm swings and jumping jacks.

    "abstract": "Super-resolution based on deep convolutional networks is currently gaining much attention from both academia and industry. However, lack of proper evaluation measures makes it difficult to compare approaches, hampering progress in the field. Traditional measures, such as PSNR or SSIM, are known to poorly correlate with the human perception of image quality. Therefore, in existing works common practice is also to report Mean-Opinion-Score (MOS) -- the results of human evaluation of super-resolved images. Unfortunately, the MOS values from different papers are not directly comparable, due to the varying number of raters, their subjectivity, etc. By this paper, we introduce Neural Side-By-Side -- a new measure that allows super-resolution models to be compared automatically, effectively approximating human preferences. Namely, we collect a large dataset of aligned image pairs, which were produced by different super-resolution models. Then each pair is annotated by several raters, who were instructed to choose a more visually appealing image. Given the dataset and the labels, we trained a CNN model that obtains a pair of images and for each image predicts a probability of being more preferable than its counterpart. In this work, we show that Neural Side-By-Side generalizes across both new models and new data.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recent studies on mobile network design have demonstrated the remarkable effectiveness of channel attention (e.g., the Squeeze-and-Excitation attention) for lifting model performance, but they generally neglect the positional information, which is important for generating spatially selective attention maps. In this paper, we propose a novel attention mechanism for mobile networks by embedding positional information into channel attention, which we call \"coordinate attention\". Unlike channel attention that transforms a feature tensor to a single feature vector via 2D global pooling, the coordinate attention factorizes channel attention into two 1D feature encoding processes that aggregate features along the two spatial directions, respectively. In this way, long-range dependencies can be captured along one spatial direction and meanwhile precise positional information can be preserved along the other spatial direction. The resulting feature maps are then encoded separately into a pair of direction-aware and position-sensitive attention maps that can be complementarily applied to the input feature map to augment the representations of the objects of interest. Our coordinate attention is simple and can be flexibly plugged into classic mobile networks, such as MobileNetV2, MobileNeXt, and EfficientNet with nearly no computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our coordinate attention is not only beneficial to ImageNet classification but more interestingly, behaves better in down-stream tasks, such as object detection and semantic segmentation.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes an image-to-painting translation method that generates vivid and realistic painting artworks with controllable styles. Different from previous image-to-image translation methods that formulate the translation as pixel-wise prediction, we deal with such an artistic creation process in a vectorized environment and produce a sequence of physically meaningful stroke parameters that can be further used for rendering. Since a typical vector render is not differentiable, we design a novel neural renderer which imitates the behavior of the vector renderer and then frame the stroke prediction as a parameter searching process that maximizes the similarity between the input and the rendering output. We explored the zero-gradient problem on parameter searching and propose to solve this problem from an optimal transportation perspective. We also show that previous neural renderers have a parameter coupling problem and we re-design the rendering network with a rasterization network and a shading network that better handles the disentanglement of shape and color. Experiments show that the paintings generated by our method have a high degree of fidelity in both global appearance and local textures. Our method can be also jointly optimized with neural style transfer that further transfers visual style from other images.

While the recent methods mainly focus on proposing new model architectures for this problem, we instead focus on an alternative training scheme. Inspired by the success of multi-task learning, we formulate a training scheme that uses an auxiliary task to improve the training of the change captioning network. We argue that the task of composed query image retrieval is a natural choice as the auxiliary task. Given two almost similar images as the input, the primary network generates a caption describing the fine change between those two images. Next, the auxiliary network is provided with the generated caption and one of those two images. It then tries to pick the second image among a set of candidates. This forces the primary network to generate detailed and precise captions via having an extra supervision loss by the auxiliary network. Furthermore, we propose a new scheme for selecting a negative set of candidates for the retrieval task that can effectively improve the performance. We show that the proposed training strategy performs well on the task of change captioning on benchmark datasets",

However, most of the existing methods need to train a new model for a new domain by accessing data. Due to public privacy, the new domain data are not always accessible, leading to a limited applicability of these methods. In this paper, we study the problem of multi-source domain generalization in ReID, which aims to learn a model that can perform well on unseen domains with only several labeled source domains. To address this problem, we propose the Memory-based Multi-Source Meta-Learning (M^3L) framework to train a generalizable model for unseen domains. Specifically, a meta-learning strategy is introduced to simulate the train-test process of domain generalization for learning more generalizable models. To overcome the unstable meta-optimization caused by the parametric classifier, we propose a memory-based identification loss that is non-parametric and harmonizes with meta-learning. We also present a meta batch normalization layer (MetaBN) to diversify meta-test features, further establishing the advantage of meta-learning. Experiments demonstrate that our M^3L can effectively enhance the generalization ability of the model for unseen domains and can outperform the state-of-the-art methods on four large-scale ReID datasets",

The previous hybrid coding approaches rely on pixel space operations to reduce spatial and temporal redundancy, which may suffer from inaccurate motion estimation or less effective motion compensation. In this work, we propose a feature-space video coding network (FVC) by performing all major operations (i.e., motion estimation, motion compression, motion compensation and residual compression) in the feature space. Specifically, in the proposed deformable compensation module, we first apply motion estimation in the feature space to produce motion information (i.e., the offset maps), which will be compressed by using the auto-encoder style network. Then we perform motion compensation by using deformable convolution and generate the predicted feature. After that, we compress the residual feature between the feature from the current frame and the predicted feature from our deformable compensation module. For better frame reconstruction, the reference features from multiple previous reconstructed frames are also fused by using the non-local attention mechanism in the multi-frame feature fusion module.

We show limitations of such standard undirected tubular graphs producing typical errors at bifurcations where flow \"directedness\" is critical. We introduce a new general concept of \"confluence\" for continuous oriented curves forming vessel trees and show how to enforce it on discrete tubular graphs.

    "abstract": "Shadow removal is still a challenging task due to its inherent background-dependent and spatial-variant properties, leading to unknown and diverse shadow patterns. Even powerful deep neural networks could hardly recover traceless shadow-removed background. This paper proposes a new solution for this task by formulating it as an exposure fusion problem to address the challenges. Intuitively, we first estimate multiple over-exposure images w.r.t. the input image to let the shadow regions in these images have the same color with shadow-free areas in the input image. Then, we fuse the original input with the over-exposure images to generate the final shadow-free counterpart. Nevertheless, the spatial-variant property of the shadow requires the fusion to be sufficiently `smart', that is, it should automatically select proper over-exposure pixels from different images to make the final output natural. To address this challenge, we propose the shadow-aware FusionNet that takes the shadow image as input to generate fusion weight maps across all the over-exposure images. Moreover, we propose the boundary-aware RefineNet to eliminate the remaining shadow trace further. We conduct extensive experiments on the ISTD, ISTD+, and SRD datasets to validate our method's effectiveness and show better performance in shadow regions and comparable performance in non-shadow regions over the state-of-the-art methods.

This decomposes the prediction problem into regressions over the 3D face shape and the corresponding 2D texture atlas. Second, we leverage facial symmetry and approximate albedo constancy of skin to isolate and remove spatiotemporal lighting variations. Together, these normalizations allow simple networks to generate high fidelity lip-sync videos under novel ambient illumination while training with just a single video (of usually < 5 minutes). Further, to stabilize temporal dynamics, we introduce an auto-regressive approach that conditions the model on its previous visual state. Human ratings and objective metrics demonstrate that our method outperforms contemporary state-of-the-art audio-driven video reenactment benchmarks in terms of realism, lip-sync and visual quality scores.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "One strategy for adversarially training a robust model is to maximize its certified radius -- the neighborhood around a given training sample for which the model's prediction remains unchanged. The scheme typically involves analyzing a \"smoothed\" classifier where one estimates the prediction corresponding to Gaussian samples in the neighborhood of each sample in the mini-batch, accomplished in practice by Monte Carlo sampling. In this paper, we investigate the hypothesis that this sampling bottleneck can potentially be mitigated by identifying ways to directly propagate the covariance matrix of the smoothed distribution through the network. To this end, we find that other than certain adjustments to the network, propagating the covariances must also be accompanied by additional accounting that keeps track of how the distributional moments transform and interact at each stage in the network. We show how satisfying these criteria yields an algorithm for maximizing the certified radius on datasets including Cifar-10, ImageNet, and Places365 while offering runtime savings on networks with moderate depth, with a small compromise in overall accuracy. We describe the details of the key modifications that enable practical use. Via various experiments, we evaluate when our simplifications are sensible, and what the key benefits and limitations are",

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) provide a potential solution to this problem due to their ability to generate realistic, synthetic images. However, recent studies have shown that current methods of disentangling pose from identity are inadequate. In this work we incorporate a 3D morphable model into the generator of a GAN in order to learn a nonlinear texture model from in-the-wild images.

    "abstract": "Video deblurring models exploit consecutive frames to remove blurs from camera shakes and object motions. In order to utilize neighboring sharp patches, typical methods rely mainly on homography or optical flows to spatially align neighboring blurry frames. However, such explicit approaches are less effective in the presence of fast motions with large pixel displacements. In this work, we propose a novel implicit method to learn spatial correspondence among blurry frames in the feature space. To construct distant pixel correspondences, our model builds a correlation volume pyramid among all the pixel-pairs between neighboring frames. To enhance the features of the reference frame, we design a correlative aggregation module that maximizes the pixel-pair correlations with its neighbors based on the volume pyramid. Finally, we feed the aggregated features into a reconstruction module to obtain the restored frame. We design a generative adversarial paradigm to optimize the model progressively. Our proposed method is evaluated on the widely-adopted DVD dataset, along with a newly collected High-Frame-Rate (1000 fps) Dataset for Video Deblurring (HFR-DVD).

One main issue, widely known to the community, is that object boundaries derived only from 2D image appearance are ambiguous and unreliable. To address this, we exploit LiDAR clues to aid unsupervised object detection. By exploiting the 3D scene structure, the issue of localization can be considerably mitigated. We further identify another major issue, seldom noticed by the community, that the long-tailed and open-ended (sub-)category distribution should be accommodated. In this paper, we present the first practical method for unsupervised object detection with the aid of LiDAR clues. In our approach, candidate object segments based on 3D point clouds are firstly generated. Then, an iterative segment labeling process is conducted to assign segment labels and to train a segment labeling network, which is based on features from both 2D images and 3D point clouds. The labeling process is carefully designed so as to mitigate the issue of long-tailed and open-ended distribution. The final segment labels are set as pseudo annotations for object detection network training. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Waymo Open dataset suggest that the derived unsupervised object detection method achieves reasonable accuracy compared with that of strong supervision within the LiDAR visible range",

We propose TesseTrack, a novel top-down approachthat simultaneously reasons about multiple individuals' 3Dbody joint reconstructions and associations in space andtime in a single end-to-end learnable framework. At the core of our approach is a novel spatio-temporal formulation that operates in a common voxelized feature space aggregated from single- or multiple-camera views. After a person detection step, a 4D CNN produces short-term person-specific representations which are then linked across time by a differentiable matcher. The linked descriptions are then merged and deconvolved into 3D poses. This joint spatio-temporal formulation contrasts with previous piece-wise strategies that treat 2D pose estimation, 2D-to-3D lifting, and 3D pose tracking as independent sub-problems that are error-prone when solved in isolation. Furthermore, unlike previous methods, TesseTrack is robust to changes in the number of camera views and achieves very good results even if a single view is available at inference time. Quantitative evaluation of 3D pose reconstruction accuracy on standard benchmarks shows significant improvements over the state of the art. Evaluation of multi-person articulated 3D pose tracking in our novel evaluation framework demonstrates the superiority of TesseTrack over strong baselines",

Voxel-based features are efficient to extract, while they fail to preserve fine-grained 3D structures of objects. Point-based features, on the other hand, represent the 3D structures more accurately, but extracting these features is computationally expensive. We introduce in this paper a novel single-stage 3D detection method having the merit of both voxel-based and point-based features. To this end, we propose a new convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, dubbed HVPR, that integrates both features into a single 3D representation effectively and efficiently. Specifically, we augment the point-based features with a memory module to reduce the computational cost. We then aggregate the features in the memory, semantically similar to each voxel-based one, to obtain a hybrid 3D representation in a form of a pseudo image, allowing to localize 3D objects in a single stage efficiently. We also propose an Attentive Multi-scale Feature Module (AMFM) that extracts scale-aware features considering the sparse and irregular patterns of point clouds.

We cast this as the problem of aligning a source 3D object to a target 3D object from the same object category.

This latent representation is in the form of 3D keypoints that are learned in an unsupervised way. The difference between the 3D keypoints of the source and the target objects then informs the shape deformation algorithm that deforms the source object into the target object. The whole model is learned end-to-end and simultaneously discovers 3D keypoints while learning to use them for deforming object shapes. Our approach produces intuitive and semantically consistent control of shape deformations. Moreover, our discovered 3D keypoints are consistent across object category instances despite large shape variations.

In feature extraction, it extracts discriminative features by collecting-distributing multi-level global context features, and mitigates the semantic information loss due to drastically reduced channels. In feature fusion, it aggregates complementary information from adjacent features to generate location-wise reassembly kernels for content-aware sampling, and employs channel-wise reweighting to enhance the semantic consistency before element-wise addition. A^2-FPN shows consistent gains on different instance segmentation frameworks. By replacing FPN with A^2-FPN in Mask R-CNN, our model boosts the performance by 2.1% and 1.6% mask AP when using ResNet-50 and ResNet-101 as backbone, respectively.

    "abstract": "Camouflage is a key defence mechanism across species that is critical to survival. Common camouflage include background matching, imitating the color and pattern of the environment, and disruptive coloration, disguising body outlines. Camouflaged object detection (COD) aims to segment camouflaged objects hiding in their surroundings. Existing COD models are built upon binary ground truth to segment the camouflaged objects without illustrating the level of camouflage. In this paper, we revisit this task and argue that explicitly modeling the conspicuousness of camouflaged objects against their particular backgrounds can not only lead to a better understanding about camouflage and evolution of animals, but also provide guidance to design more sophisticated camouflage techniques. Furthermore, we observe that it is some specific parts of the camouflaged objects that make them detectable by predators. With the above understanding about camouflaged objects, we present the first ranking based COD network to simultaneously localize, segment and rank camouflaged objects. The localization model is proposed to find the discriminative regions that make the camouflaged object obvious. The segmentation model segments the full scope of the camouflaged objects. And, the ranking model infers the detectability of different camouflaged objects. Moreover, we contribute a large COD testing set to evaluate the generalization ability of COD models. Experimental results show that our model achieves new state-of-the-art, leading to a more interpretable COD network",

    "abstract": "Message passing neural network has been an effective method to represent dependencies among nodes by propagating messages. However, most of message passing algorithms focus on one structure and the messages are estimated by one single approach. For the real-world data, like facial action units (AUs), the dependencies may vary in terms of different expressions and individuals. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid message passing neural network with performance-driven structures (HMP-PS), which combines complementary message passing methods and captures more possible structures in a Bayesian manner. Particularly, a performance-driven Monte Carlo Markov Chain sampling method is proposed for generating high performance graph structures. Besides, the hybrid message passing is proposed to combine different types of messages, which provide the complementary information. The contribution of each type of message is adaptively adjusted along with different inputs. The experiments on two widely used benchmark datasets, i.e., BP4D and DISFA, validate that our proposed method can achieve the state-of-the-art performance",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Knowledge distillation is a widely used paradigm for inheriting information from a complicated teacher network to a compact student network and maintaining the strong performance. Different from image classification, object detectors are much more sophisticated with multiple loss functions in which features that semantic information rely on are tangled. In this paper, we point out that the information of features derived from regions excluding objects are also essential for distilling the student detector, which is usually ignored in existing approaches. In addition, we elucidate that features from different regions should be assigned with different importance during distillation. To this end, we present a novel distillation algorithm via decoupled features (DeFeat) for learning a better student detector. Specifically, two levels of decoupled features will be processed for embedding useful information into the student, i.e., decoupled features from neck and decoupled proposals from classification head. Extensive experiments on various detectors with different backbones show that the proposed DeFeat is able to surpass the state-of-the-art distillation methods for object detection. For example, DeFeat improves ResNet50 based Faster R-CNN from 37.4% to 40.9% mAP, and improves ResNet50 based RetinaNet from 36.5% to 39.7% mAP on COCO benchmark. Code will be released",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Neural architecture search (NAS) typically consists of three main steps: training a super-network, training and evaluating sampled deep neural networks (DNNs), and training the discovered DNN. Most of the existing efforts speed up some steps at the cost of a significant slowdown of other steps or sacrificing the support of non-differentiable search metrics. The unbalanced reduction in the time spent per step limits the total search time reduction, and the inability to support non-differentiable search metrics limits the performance of discovered DNNs. In this paper, we present NetAdaptV2 with three innovations to better balance the time spent for each step while supporting non-differentiable search metrics. First, we propose channel-level bypass connections that merge network depth and layer width into a single search dimension to reduce the time for training and evaluating sampled DNNs. Second, ordered dropout is proposed to train multiple DNNs in a single forward-backward pass to decrease the time for training a super-network. Third, we propose the multi-layer coordinate descent optimizer that considers the interplay of multiple layers in each iteration of optimization to improve the performance of discovered DNNs while supporting non-differentiable search metrics. With these innovations, NetAdaptV2 reduces the total search time by up to 5.8x on ImageNet and 2.4x on NYU Depth V2, respectively, and discovers DNNs with better accuracy-latency/accuracy-MAC trade-offs than state-of-the-art NAS works. Moreover, the discovered DNN outperforms NAS-discovered MobileNetV3 by 1.8% higher top-1 accuracy with the same latency",

However, two critical challenges in vehicle re-ID have primarily been underestimated, i.e., 1): how to make full use of raw data, and 2): how to learn a robust re-ID model with noisy data. In this paper, we first create a video vehicle re-ID evaluation benchmark called VVeRI-901 and verify the performance of video-based re-ID is far better than static image-based one. Then we propose a new Pompeiu-hausdorff distance (PhD) learning method for video-to-video matching. It can alleviate the data noise problem caused by the occlusion in videos and thus improve re-ID performance significantly. Extensive empirical results on video-based vehicle and person re-ID datasets, i.e., VVeRI-901, MARS and PRID2011, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.

The backbone of our approach is a real-time capable, lightweight encoder-decoder that relies on cost volumes computed from pairs of images. We extend it by placing a ConvLSTM cell at the bottleneck layer, which compresses an arbitrary amount of past information in its states. The novelty lies in propagating the hidden state of the cell by accounting for the viewpoint changes between time steps. At a given time step, we warp the previous hidden state into the current camera plane using the previous depth prediction. Our extension brings only a small overhead of computation time and memory consumption, while improving the depth predictions significantly. As a result, we outperform the existing state-of-the-art multi-view stereo methods on most of the evaluated metrics in hundreds of indoor scenes while maintaining a real-time performance.

Our mild supervision requirements make our method well suited for recently released massive data collections for autonomous driving, which do not contain dense scene flow annotations.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Text-based image captioning (TextCap) which aims to read and reason images with texts is crucial for a machine to understand a detailed and complex scene environment, considering that texts are omnipresent in daily life. This task, however, is very challenging because an image often contains complex texts and visual information that is hard to be described comprehensively. Existing methods attempt to extend the traditional image captioning methods to solve this task, which focus on describing the overall scene of images by one global caption. This is infeasible because the complex text and visual information cannot be described well within one caption. To resolve this difficulty, we seek to generate multiple captions that accurately describe different parts of an image in detail. To achieve this purpose, there are three key challenges: 1) it is hard to decide which parts of the texts of images to copy or paraphrase; 2) it is non-trivial to capture the complex relationship between diverse texts in an image; 3) how to generate multiple captions with diverse content is still an open problem. To conquer these, we propose a novel Anchor-Captioner method. Specifically, we first find the important tokens which are supposed to be paid more attention to and consider them as anchors. Then, for each chosen anchor, we group its relevant texts to construct the corresponding anchor-centred graph (ACG). Last, based on different ACGs, we conduct the multi-view caption generation to improve the content diversity of generated captions. Experimental results show that our method not only achieves SOTA performance but also generates diverse captions to describe images",

The closed-set models make overconfident predictions over familiar known class instances, so that calibration and thresholding across categories become essential issues when extending to an open-set environment. To this end, we proposed to learn PlaceholdeRs for Open-SEt Recognition (Proser), which prepares for the unknown classes by allocating placeholders for both data and classifier. In detail, learning data placeholders tries to anticipate open-set class data, thus transforms closed-set training into open-set training. Besides, to learn the invariant information between target and non-target classes, we reserve classifier placeholders as the class-specific boundary between known and unknown.

The phase mask creates a depth-dependent point spread function, allowing us to recover sharp image texture and stereo correspondence over a significantly extended depth of field (EDOF) than conventional stereo. The phase mask pattern, the EDOF image reconstruction, and the stereo disparity estimation are all trained together using an end-to-end learned deep neural network.

In this paper, we aim to mitigate such an upper-bound on sketch data, and study whether unlabelled photos alone (of which they are many) can be cultivated for performance gain. In particular, we introduce a novel semi-supervised framework for cross-modal retrieval that can additionally leverage large-scale unlabelled photos to account for data scarcity. At the center of our semi-supervision design is a sequential photo-to-sketch generation model that aims to generate paired sketches for unlabelled photos. Importantly, we further introduce a discriminator-guided mechanism to guide against unfaithful generation, together with a distillation loss-based regularizer to provide tolerance against noisy training samples. Last but not least, we treat generation and retrieval as two conjugate problems, where a joint learning procedure is devised for each module to mutually benefit from each other.

    "abstract": "With increasing fields of application for neural networks and the development of neural networks, the ability to explain deep learning models is also becoming increasingly important. Especially, prior to practical applications, it is crucial to analyze a model's inference and the process of generating the results. A common explanation method is Class Activation Mapping(CAM) based method where it is often used to understand the last layer of the convolutional neural networks popular in the field of Computer Vision. In this paper, we propose a novel CAM method named Relevance-weighted Class Activation Mapping(Relevance-CAM) that utilizes Layer-wise Relevance Propagation to obtain the weighting components. This allows the explanation map to be faithful and robust to the shattered gradient problem, a shared problem of the gradient based CAM methods that causes noisy saliency maps for intermediate layers. Therefore, our proposed method can better explain a model by correctly analyzing the intermediate layers as well as the last convolutional layer. In this paper, we visualize how each layer of the popular image processing models extracts class specific features using Relevance-CAM, evaluate the localization ability, and show why the gradient based CAM cannot be used to explain the intermediate layers, proven by experimenting the weighting component. Relevance-CAM outperforms other CAM-based methods in recognition and localization evaluation in layers of any depth. The source code is available at: https://github.com/mongeoroo/Relevance-CAM",

The new quality measure displays several desirable characteristics like symmetry w.r.t. prediction/ground truth pairs and balanced responsiveness across scales, which makes it more suitable for segmentation evaluation than other boundary-focused measures like Trimap IoU and F-measure.

The idea is first to use the saliency map to detect important regions on the original images and then preserve these informative regions during augmentation. This information-preserving strategy allows us to generate more faithful training examples.

We find that increasing both the training set and model sizes significantly improve the distributional shift robustness.

Although image forensic models have reached great performance in detecting fake images from real ones, these models can be easily fooled with a simple adversarial attack. But, the noise adding adversarial samples are also arousing suspicion. In this paper, instead of adding adversarial noise, we optimally search adversarial points on face manifold to generate anti-forensic fake face images. We iteratively do a gradient-descent with each small step in the latent space of a generative model, e.g. Style-GAN, to find an adversarial latent vector, which is similar to norm-based adversarial attack but in latent space. Then, the generated fake images driven by the adversarial latent vectors with the help of GANs can defeat main-stream forensic models. For examples, they make the accuracy of deepfake detection models based on Xception or EfficientNet drop from over 90% to nearly 0%, meanwhile maintaining high visual quality. In addition, we find manipulating noise vectors n at different levels have different impacts on attack success rate, and the generated adversarial images mainly have changes on facial texture or face attributes",

As optical flow estimation can be very unreliable within matting regions, ST-FAM is designed to effectively align and aggregate information across different spatial scales and temporal frames within the network decoder. To eliminate frame-by-frame trimap annotations, a lightweight interactive trimap propagation network is also introduced. The other contribution consists of a large-scale video matting dataset with groundtruth alpha mattes for quantitative evaluation and real-world high-resolution videos with trimaps for qualitative evaluation.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) aims to segment unseen class objects given very few densely-annotated support images from the same class. Existing FSS methods find the query object by using support prototypes or by directly relying on heuristic multi-scale feature fusion. However, they fail to fully leverage the high-order appearance relationships between multi-scale features among the support-query image pairs, thus leading to an inaccurate localization of the query objects. To tackle the above challenge, we propose an end-to-end scale-aware graph neural network (SAGNN) by reasoning the cross-scale relations among the support-query images for FSS. Specifically, a scale-aware graph is first built by taking support-induced multi-scale query features as nodes and, meanwhile, each edge is modeled as the pairwise interaction of its connected nodes. By progressive message passing over this graph, SAGNN is capable of capturing cross-scale relations and overcoming object variations (e.g., appearance, scale and location), and can thus learn more precise node embeddings. This in turn enables it to predict more accurate foreground objects. Moreover, to make full use of the location relations across scales for the query image, a novel self-node collaboration mechanism is proposed to enrich the current node, which endows SAGNN the ability of perceiving different resolutions of the same objects. Extensive experiments on PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i show that SAGNN achieves state-of-the-art results",

In this work, we propose a unified network structure that embeds a linear age estimator into a GAN-based model, where the embedded age estimator is trained jointly with the encoder and decoder to estimate the age of a face image and provide a personalized target age embedding for age progression/regression. The personalized target age embedding is synthesized by incorporating both personalized residual age embedding of the current age and exemplar-face aging basis of the target age, where all preceding aging bases are derived from the learned weights of the linear age estimator. This formulation brings the unified perspective of estimating the age and generating personalized aged face, where self-estimated age embeddings can be learned for every single age.

We show in real-world experiments with the BAL datasets that even in single precision the proposed solver achieves on average equally accurate solutions compared to Schur complement solvers using double precision. It runs significantly faster, but can require larger amounts of memory on dense problems.

We present a more efficient neighborhood consensus approach based on PatchMatch. For higher accuracy, we propose to use a learned local 4D scoring function for evaluating candidates during the PatchMatch iterations. We have devised an approach to jointly train the scoring function and the feature extraction modules by embedding them into a proxy model which is end-to-end differentiable.

    "abstract": "To address the problem of long-tail distribution for the large vocabulary object detection task, existing methods usually divide the whole categories into several groups and treat each group with different strategies. These methods bring the following two problems. One is the training inconsistency between adjacent categories of similar sizes, and the other is that the learned model is lack of discrimination for tail categories which are semantically similar to some of the head categories. In this paper, we devise a novel Adaptive Class Suppression Loss (ACSL) to effectively tackle the above problems and improve the detection performance of tail categories. Specifically, we introduce a statistic-free perspective to analyze the long-tail distribution, breaking the limitation of manual grouping. According to this perspective, our ACSL adjusts the suppression gradients for each sample of each class adaptively, ensuring the training consistency and boosting the discrimination for rare categories. Extensive experiments on long-tail datasets LVIS and Open Images show that the our ACSL achieves 5.18% and 5.2% improvements with ResNet50-FPN, and sets a new state of the art.

With only a few training examples, the variations are insufficient to train the classifier in novel classes. We propose to build a better model of variation in novel classes by transferring the shared within-class variation from base classes. We introduce a hallucinator network and insert it into a modern object detector model, which learns to generate additional training examples in the Region of Interest (ROI's) feature space.

    "abstract": "Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have shown impressive results in both unconditional and conditional image generation. In recent literature, it is shown that pre-trained GANs, on a different dataset, can be transferred to improve the image generation from a small target data. The same, however, has not been well-studied in the case of conditional GANs (cGANs), which provides new opportunities for knowledge transfer compared to unconditional setup. In particular, the new classes may borrow knowledge from the related old classes, or share knowledge among themselves to improve the training. This motivates us to study the problem of efficient conditional GAN transfer with knowledge propagation across classes. To address this problem, we introduce a new GAN transfer method to explicitly propagate the knowledge from the old classes to the new classes. The key idea is to enforce the popularly used conditional batch normalization (BN) to learn the class-specific information of the new classes from that of the old classes, with implicit knowledge sharing among the new ones. This allows for an efficient knowledge propagation from the old classes to the new ones, with the BN parameters increasing linearly with the number of new classes. The extensive evaluation demonstrates the clear superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art competitors for efficient conditional GAN transfer tasks.

Unlike these approaches, FCSGG is a conceptually elegant and efficient bottom-up approach that encodes objects as bounding box center points, and relationships as 2D vector fields which are named as Relation Affinity Fields (RAFs). RAFs encode both semantic and spatial features, and explicitly represent the relationship between a pair of objects by the integral on a sub-region that points from subject to object. FCSGG only utilizes visual features and still generates strong results for scene graph generation.

In this paper, we propose a Graph-based High-order Relation Modeling (GHRM) module to exploit the high-order relations in the long-term actions for long-term action recognition. In GHRM, each basic relation in the long-term actions will be modeled by a graph, where each node represents a segment in a long video. Moreover, when modeling each basic relation, the information from all the other basic relations will be incorporated by GHRM, and thus the high-order relations in the long-term actions can be well exploited. To better exploit the high-order relations along the time dimension, we design a GHRM-layer consisting of a Temporal-GHRM branch and a Semantic-GHRM branch, which aims to model the local temporal high-order relations and global semantic high-order relations.

    "abstract": "Network quantization aims at reducing bit-widths of weights and/or activations, particularly important for implementing deep neural networks with limited hardware resources. Most methods use the straight-through estimator (STE) to train quantized networks, which avoids a zero-gradient problem by replacing a derivative of a discretizer (i.e., a round function) with that of an identity function. Although quantized networks exploiting the STE have shown decent performance, the STE is sub-optimal in that it simply propagates the same gradient without considering discretization errors between inputs and outputs of the discretizer. In this paper, we propose an element-wise gradient scaling (EWGS), a simple yet effective alternative to the STE, training a quantized network better than the STE in terms of stability and accuracy. Given a gradient of the discretizer output, EWGS adaptively scales up or down each gradient element, and uses the scaled gradient as the one for the discretizer input to train quantized networks via backpropagation. The scaling is performed depending on both the sign of each gradient element and an error between the continuous input and discrete output of the discretizer. We adjust a scaling factor adaptively using Hessian information of a network. We show extensive experimental results on the image classification datasets, including CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, with diverse network architectures under a wide range of bit-width settings, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method",

The undesirable phenomenon of multi-path occurs when a camera pixel simultaneously sees features from multiple projector coordinates. Bimodal multi-path is a particularly common situation found along step edges, where the camera pixel sees both a foreground and background surface. Generalized from bimodal multi-path, this paper looks at sparse or N modal multi-path as a more general case, where the camera pixel sees no less than two reflective surfaces, resulting in decoding errors. Using fringe projection profilometry, our proposed solution is to treat each camera pixel as an underdetermined linear system of equations and to find the sparsest (least number of paths) solution using an application-specific Bayesian learning approach.

    "abstract": "We present NeuroMorph, a new neural network architecture that takes as input two 3D shapes and produces in one go, i.e. in a single feed forward pass, a smooth interpolation and point-to-point correspondences between them. The interpolation, expressed as a deformation field, changes the pose of the source shape to resemble the target, but leaves the object identity unchanged. NeuroMorph uses an elegant architecture combining graph convolutions with global feature pooling to extract local features. During training, the model is incentivized to create realistic deformations by approximating geodesics on the underlying shape space manifold. This strong geometric prior allows to train our model end-to-end and in a fully unsupervised manner without requiring any manual correspondence annotations. NeuroMorph works well for a large variety of input shapes, including non-isometric pairs from different object categories. It obtains state-of-the-art results for both shape correspondence and interpolation tasks, matching or surpassing the performance of recent unsupervised and supervised methods on multiple benchmarks",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The recently introduced introspective variational autoencoder (IntroVAE) exhibits outstanding image generations, and allows for amortized inference using an image encoder. The main idea in IntroVAE is to train a VAE adversarially, using the VAE encoder to discriminate between generated and real data samples. However, the original IntroVAE loss function relied on a particular hinge-loss formulation that is very hard to stabilize in practice, and its theoretical convergence analysis ignored important terms in the loss. In this work, we take a step towards better understanding of the IntroVAE model, its practical implementation, and its applications. We propose the Soft-IntroVAE, a modified IntroVAE that replaces the hinge-loss terms with a smooth exponential loss on generated samples. This change significantly improves training stability, and also enables theoretical analysis of the complete algorithm. Interestingly, we show that the IntroVAE converges to a distribution that minimizes a sum of KL distance from the data distribution and an entropy term. We discuss the implications of this result, and demonstrate that it induces competitive image generation and reconstruction. Finally, we describe an application of Soft-IntroVAE to unsupervised image translation, and demonstrate compelling results.

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art scene text detection methods usually model the text instance with local pixels or components from the bottom-up perspective and, therefore, are sensitive to noises and dependent on the complicated heuristic post-processing especially for arbitrary-shape texts. To relieve these two issues, instead, we propose to progressively evolve the initial text proposal to arbitrarily shaped text contours in a top-down manner. The initial horizontal text proposals are generated by estimating the center and size of texts. To reduce the range of regression, the first stage of the evolution predicts the corner points of oriented text proposals from the initial horizontal ones. In the second stage, the contours of the oriented text proposals are iteratively regressed to arbitrarily shaped ones. In the last iteration of this stage, we rescore the confidence of the final localized text by utilizing the cues from multiple contour points, rather than the single cue from the initial horizontal proposal center that may be out of arbitrary-shape text regions. Moreover, to facilitate the progressive contour evolution, we design a contour information aggregation mechanism to enrich the feature representation on text contours by considering both the circular topology and semantic context. Experiments conducted on CTW1500, Total-Text, ArT, and TD500 have demonstrated that the proposed method especially excels in line-level arbitrary-shape texts.

The B-rep format is widely used in the design, simulation and manufacturing industries to enable sophisticated and precise CAD modeling operations. However, B-rep data presents some unique challenges when used with modern machine learning due to the complexity of the data structure and its support for both continuous non-Euclidean geometric entities and discrete topological entities. In this paper, we propose a unified representation for B-rep data that exploits the U and V parameter domain of curves and surfaces to model geometry, and an adjacency graph to explicitly model topology. This leads to a unique and efficient network architecture, UV-Net, that couples image and graph convolutional neural networks in a compute and memory-efficient manner. To aid in future research we present a synthetic labelled B-rep dataset, SolidLetters, derived from human designed fonts with variations in both geometry and topology. Finally we demonstrate that UV-Net can generalize to supervised and unsupervised tasks on five datasets, while outperforming alternate 3D shape representations such as point clouds, voxels, and meshes",

    "abstract": "High quality Machine Learning (ML) models are often considered valuable intellectual property by companies. Model Stealing (MS) attacks allow an adversary with black-box access to a ML model to replicate its functionality by training a clone model using the predictions of the target model for different inputs. However, best available existing MS attacks fail to produce a high-accuracy clone without access to the target dataset or a representative dataset necessary to query the target model. In this paper, we show that preventing access to the target dataset is not an adequate defense to protect a model. We propose MAZE -- a data-free model stealing attack using zeroth-order gradient estimation that produces high-accuracy clones. In contrast to prior works, MAZE uses only synthetic data created using a generative model to perform MS. Our evaluation with four image classification models shows that MAZE provides a normalized clone accuracy in the range of 0.90x to 0.99x, and outperforms even the recent attacks that rely on partial data (JBDA, clone accuracy 0.13x to 0.69x) and on surrogate data (KnockoffNets, clone accuracy 0.52x to 0.97x). We also study an extension of MAZE in the partial-data setting and develop MAZE-PD, which generates synthetic data closer to the target distribution. MAZE-PD further improves the clone accuracy 0.97x to 1.0x) and reduces the query budget required for the attack by 2x-24x",

However, the existence of \"universal\" attacks (i.e., unique perturbations that transfer across different data points) has only been demonstrated for images to date. Part of the reason lies in the lack of a common domain, for geometric data such as graphs, meshes, and point clouds, where a universal perturbation can be defined. In this paper, we offer a change in perspective and demonstrate the existence of universal attacks for geometric data (shapes). We introduce a computational procedure that operates entirely in the spectral domain, where the attacks take the form of small perturbations to short eigenvalue sequences; the resulting geometry is then synthesized via shape-from-spectrum recovery. Our attacks are universal, in that they transfer across different shapes, different representations (meshes and point clouds), and generalize to previously unseen data",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) transfers predictive models from a fully-labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. In some applications, however, it is expensive even to collect labels in the source domain, making most previous works impractical. To cope with this problem, recent work performed instance-wise cross-domain self-supervised learning, followed by an additional fine-tuning stage. However, the instance-wise self-supervised learning only learns and aligns low-level discriminative features. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end Prototypical Cross-domain Self-Supervised Learning (PCS) framework for Few-shot Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (FUDA). PCS not only performs cross-domain low-level feature alignment, but it also encodes and aligns semantic structures in the shared embedding space across domains. Our framework captures category-wise semantic structures of the data by in-domain prototypical contrastive learning; and performs feature alignment through cross-domain prototypical self-supervision. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, PCS improves the mean classification accuracy over different domain pairs on FUDA by 10.5%, 3.5%, 9.0%, and 13.2% on Office, Office-Home, VisDA-2017, and DomainNet, respectively",

    "abstract": "Model-based 3D pose and shape estimation methods reconstruct a full 3D mesh for the human body by estimating several parameters. However, learning the abstract parameters is a highly non-linear process and suffers from image-model misalignment, leading to mediocre model performance. In contrast, 3D keypoint estimation methods combine deep CNN network with the volumetric representation to achieve pixel-level localization accuracy but may predict unrealistic body structure. In this paper, we address the above issues by bridging the gap between body mesh estimation and 3D keypoint estimation. We propose a novel hybrid inverse kinematics solution (HybrIK). HybrIK directly transforms accurate 3D joints to relative body-part rotations for 3D body mesh reconstruction, via the twist-and-swing decomposition. The swing rotation is analytically solved with 3D joints, and the twist rotation is derived from the visual cues through the neural network. We show that HybrIK preserves both the accuracy of 3D pose and the realistic body structure of the parametric human model, leading to a pixel-aligned 3D body mesh and a more accurate 3D pose than the pure 3D keypoint estimation methods. Without bells and whistles, the proposed method surpasses the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on various 3D human pose and shape benchmarks. As an illustrative example, HybrIK outperforms all the previous methods by 13.2 mm MPJPE and 21.9 mm PVE on 3DPW dataset. Our code is available at https://github.com/Jeff-sjtu/HybrIK",

Additionally, the guidance from human parsing and typical pose masks are leveraged to bring prior information. For the stage of content recovery, a novel parsing guided attention module is applied to isolate body parts and capture context information across multiple scales. Besides, an Amodal Human Perception dataset (AHP) is collected to settle the task of human de-occlusion. AHP has advantages of providing annotations from real-world scenes and the number of humans is comparatively larger than other amodal perception datasets.

The filtering function associated with a given network architecture can be obtained in closed form without need to train the network, being fully characterized by the random initialization of the network weights. While the NTK theory accurately predicts the filter associated with networks trained using standard gradient descent, our analysis shows that it falls short to explain the behaviour of networks trained using the popular Adam optimizer. The latter achieves a larger change of weights in hidden layers, adapting the non-local filtering function during training. We evaluate our findings via extensive image denoising experiments",

This loss function has a direct interpretation in terms of adversarial robustness together with certifiable robustness bound.

This naturally suggests a bijective mapping between the video domain and the static content as well as residual information. In contrast to common stochastic image-to-video synthesis, such a model does not merely generate arbitrary videos progressing the initial image. Given this image, it rather provides a one-to-one mapping between the residual vectors and the video with stochastic outcomes when sampling. The approach is naturally implemented using a conditional invertible neural network (cINN) that can explain videos by independently modelling static and other video characteristics, thus laying the basis for controlled video synthesis.

    "abstract": "Current dynamic networks and dynamic pruning methods have shown their promising capability in reducing theoretical computation complexity. However, dynamic sparse patterns on convolutional filters fail to achieve actual acceleration in real-world implementation, due to the extra burden of indexing, weight-copying, or zero-masking. Here, we explore a dynamic network slimming regime, named Dynamic Slimmable Network (DS-Net), which aims to achieve good hardware-efficiency via dynamically adjusting filter numbers of networks at test time with respect to different inputs, while keeping filters stored statically and contiguously in hardware to prevent the extra burden. Our DS-Net is empowered with the ability of dynamic inference by the proposed double-headed dynamic gate that comprises an attention head and a slimming head to predictively adjust network width with negligible extra computation cost. To ensure generality of each candidate architecture and the fairness of gate, we propose a disentangled two-stage training scheme inspired by one-shot NAS. In the first stage, a novel training technique for weight-sharing networks named In-place Ensemble Bootstrapping is proposed to improve the supernet training efficacy. In the second stage, Sandwich Gate Sparsification is proposed to assist the gate training by identifying easy and hard samples in an online way. Extensive experiments demonstrate our DS-Net consistently outperforms its static counterparts as well as state-of-the-art static and dynamic model compression methods by a large margin (up to 5.9%). Typically, DS-Net achieves 2-4x computation reduction and 1.62x real-world acceleration over ResNet-50 and MobileNet with minimal accuracy drops on ImageNet",

    "abstract": "Due to the memorization effect in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), training with noisy labels usually results in inferior model performance. Existing state-of-the-art methods primarily adopt a sample selection strategy, which selects small-loss samples for subsequent training. However, prior literature tends to perform sample selection within each mini-batch, neglecting the imbalance of noise ratios in different mini-batches. Moreover, valuable knowledge within high-loss samples is wasted. To this end, we propose a noise-robust approach named Jo-SRC (Joint Sample Selection and Model Regularization based on Consistency). Specifically, we train the network in a contrastive learning manner. Predictions from two different views of each sample are used to estimate its \"likelihood\" of being clean or out-of-distribution. Furthermore, we propose a joint loss to advance the model generalization performance by introducing consistency regularization. Extensive experiments and ablation studies have validated the superiority of our approach over existing state-of-the-art methods",

    "abstract": "Estimating homography to align image pairs captured by different sensors or image pairs with large appearance changes is an important and general challenge for many computer vision applications. In contrast to others, we propose a generic solution to pixel-wise align multimodal image pairs by extending the traditional Lucas-Kanade algorithm with networks. The key contribution in our method is how we construct feature maps, named as deep Lucas-Kanade feature map (DLKFM). The learned DLKFM can spontaneously recognize invariant features under various appearance-changing conditions. It also has two nice properties for the Lucas-Kanade algorithm: (1) The template feature map keeps brightness consistency with the input feature map, thus the color difference is very small while they are well-aligned. (2) The Lucas-Kanade objective function built on DLKFM has a smooth landscape around ground truth homography parameters, so the iterative solution of the Lucas-Kanade can easily converge to the ground truth. With those properties, directly updating the Lucas-Kanade algorithm on our feature maps will precisely align image pairs with large appearance changes. We share the dataset, code, and demo video online",

For such structures, the topology is their most important characteristic; particularly preserving connectedness: in the case of vascular networks, missing a connected vessel entirely alters the blood-flow dynamics. We introduce a novel similarity measure termed centerlineDice (short clDice), which is calculated on the intersection of the segmentation masks and their (morphological) skeleta. We theoretically prove that clDice guarantees topology preservation up to homotopy equivalence for binary 2D and 3D segmentation. Extending this, we propose a computationally efficient, differentiable loss function (soft-clDice) for training arbitrary neural segmentation networks. We benchmark the soft-clDice loss on five public datasets, including vessels, roads and neurons (2D and 3D). Training on soft-clDice leads to segmentation with more accurate connectivity information, higher graph similarity, and better volumetric scores",

Given a sequence of tasks, the conventional convolutional filters are factorized into the dynamic base filters which are generated using task specific filter generators, and deterministic weight matrix which linearly combines the base filters and is shared across different tasks. Moreover, the shared weight matrix is multiplied by task specific coefficients to introduce more flexibility in combining task specific base filters differently for different tasks.

To accomplish this task, we propose a Region-adaptive Adversarial Variational AutoEncoder (ReAVAE) that learns the probability distribution of the style of each region individually so that the style of the generated texture can be controlled by sampling from the region-specific distributions. In addition, we introduce a data generation technique to augment our training set with data lifted from single-view RGB inputs. Our training strategy allows the mixing of reference image styles with arbitrary styles for different regions, a property which can be valuable for virtual try-on AR/VR applications.

For this task, the approach that consists of independently mapping text and vision to a joint embedding space, a.k.a. dual encoders, is attractive as retrieval scales and is efficient for billions of images using approximate nearest neighbour search. An alternative approach of using vision-text transformers with cross-attention gives considerable improvements in accuracy over the joint embeddings, but is often inapplicable in practice for large-scale retrieval given the cost of the cross-attention mechanisms required for each sample at test time. This work combines the best of both worlds. We make the following three contributions. First, we equip transformer-based models with a new fine-grained cross-attention architecture, providing significant improvements in retrieval accuracy whilst preserving scalability. Second, we introduce a generic approach for combining a Fast dual encoder model with our Slow but accurate transformer-based model via distillation and re-ranking. Finally, we validate our approach on the Flickr30K image dataset where we show an increase in inference speed by several orders of magnitude while having results competitive to the state of the art.

However, standard 3D sensors fail to capture depth of transparent objects due to refraction and absorption of light.

Key to our approach is a local implicit neural representation built on ray-voxel pairs that allows our method to generalize to unseen objects and achieve fast inference speed. Based on this representation, we present a novel framework that can complete missing depth given noisy RGB-D input. We further improve the depth estimation iteratively using a self-correcting refinement model. To train the whole pipeline, we build a large scale synthetic dataset with transparent objects. Experiments demonstrate that our method performs significantly better than the current state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real world data.

    "abstract": "Humans possess a unique social cognition capability; nonverbal communication can convey rich social information among agents. In contrast, such crucial social characteristics are mostly missing in the existing scene understanding literature. In this paper, we incorporate different nonverbal communication cues (e.g., gaze, human poses, and gestures) to represent, model, learn, and infer agents' mental states from pure visual inputs. Crucially, such a mental representation takes the agent's belief into account so that it represents what the true world state is and infers the beliefs in each agent's mental state, which may differ from the true world states. By aggregating different beliefs and true world states, our model essentially forms \"five minds\" during the interactions between two agents. This \"five minds\" model differs from prior works that infer beliefs in an infinite recursion; instead, agents' beliefs are converged into a \"common mind\". Based on this representation, we further devise a hierarchical energy-based model that jointly tracks and predicts all five minds. From this new perspective, a social event is interpreted by a series of nonverbal communication and belief dynamics, which transcends the classic keyframe video summary. In the experiments, we demonstrate that using such a social account provides a better video summary on videos with rich social interactions compared with state-of-the-art keyframe video summary methods",

Training deep models to restore such degraded images is challenging as real-world paired data is scarcely available and synthetic paired data may suffer from domain-shift issues. In this paper, a zero-shot single real-world image restoration model is proposed leveraging a theoretically deduced property of degradation through the Koschmieder's model. Our zero-shot network estimates the parameters of the Koschmieder's model, which describes the degradation in the input image, to perform image restoration. We show that a suitable degradation of the input image amounts to a controlled perturbation of the Koschmieder's model that describes the image's formation. The optimization of the zero-shot network is achieved by seeking to maintain the relation between its estimates of Koschmieder's model parameters before and after the controlled perturbation, along with the use of a few no-reference losses. Image dehazing and underwater image restoration are carried out using the proposed zero-shot framework, which in general outperforms the state-of-the-art quantitatively and subjectively on multiple standard real-world image datasets.

In our setup, both 3D coordinates and 2D projections of the features are considered uncertain. We propose PnP(L) solvers based on EPnP[20] and DLS[14] for the uncertainty-aware pose estimation.

    "abstract": "Temporal action proposal generation aims to estimate temporal intervals of actions in untrimmed videos, which is a challenging yet important task in the video understanding field. The proposals generated by current methods still suffer from inaccurate temporal boundaries and inferior confidence used for retrieval owing to the lack of efficient temporal modeling and effective boundary context utilization. In this paper, we propose Temporal Context Aggregation Network (TCANet) to generate high-quality action proposals through local and global temporal context aggregation and complementary as well as progressive boundary refinement. Specifically, we first design a Local-Global Temporal Encoder (LGTE), which adopts the channel grouping strategy to efficiently encode both local and global temporal inter-dependencies. Furthermore, both the boundary and internal context of proposals are adopted for frame-level and segment-level boundary regressions, respectively. Temporal Boundary Regressor (TBR) is designed to combine these two regression granularities in an end-to-end fashion, which achieves the precise boundaries and reliable confidence of proposals through progressive refinement. Extensive experiments are conducted on three challenging datasets: HACS, ActivityNet-v1.3, and THUMOS-14, where TCANet can generate proposals with high precision and recall. By combining with the existing action classifier, TCANet can obtain remarkable temporal action detection performance compared with other methods.

    "abstract": "Prototype learning is extensively used for few-shot segmentation. Typically, a single prototype is obtained from the support feature by averaging the global object information. However, using one prototype to represent all the information may lead to ambiguities. In this paper, we propose two novel modules, named superpixel-guided clustering (SGC) and guided prototype allocation (GPA), for multiple prototype extraction and allocation. Specifically, SGC is a parameter-free and training-free approach, which extracts more representative prototypes by aggregating similar feature vectors, while GPA is able to select matched prototypes to provide more accurate guidance. By integrating the SGC and GPA together, we propose the Adaptive Superpixel-guided Network (ASGNet), which is a lightweight model and adapts to object scale and shape variation. In addition, our network can easily generalize to k-shot segmentation with substantial improvement and no additional computational cost. In particular, our evaluations on COCO demonstrate that ASGNet surpasses the state-of-the-art method by 5% in 5-shot segmentation",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The two-stage methods for instance segmentation, e.g. Mask R-CNN, have achieved excellent performance recently. However, the segmented masks are still very coarse due to the downsampling operations in both the feature pyramid and the instance-wise pooling process, especially for large objects. In this work, we propose a new method called RefineMask for high-quality instance segmentation of objects and scenes, which incorporates fine-grained features during the instance-wise segmenting process in a multi-stage manner. Through fusing more detailed information stage by stage, RefineMask is able to refine high-quality masks consistently. RefineMask succeeds in segmenting hard cases such as bent parts of objects that are over-smoothed by most previous methods and outputs accurate boundaries. Without bells and whistles, RefineMask yields significant gains of 2.6, 3.4, 3.8 AP over Mask R-CNN on COCO, LVIS, and Cityscapes benchmarks respectively at a small amount of additional computational cost. Furthermore, our single-model result outperforms the winner of the LVIS Challenge 2020 by 1.3 points on the LVIS test-dev set and establishes a new state-of-the-art.

To allow as wide as possible network architectures and avoid the gap between realistic and proxy setting, we propose a novel Densely Connected NAS (DCNAS) framework, which directly searches the optimal network structures for the multi-scale representations of visual information, over a large-scale target dataset without proxy. Specifically, by connecting cells with each other using learnable weights, we introduce a densely connected search space to cover an abundance of mainstream network designs. Moreover, by combining both path-level and channel-level sampling strategies, we design a fusion module and mixture layer to reduce the memory consumption of ample search space, hence favoring the proxyless searching. Compared with contemporary works, experiments reveal that the proxyless searching scheme is capable of bridging the gap between searching and training environments. Further, DCNAS achieves new state-of-the-art performances on public semantic image segmentation benchmarks, including 84.3% on Cityscapes, and 86.9% on PASCAL VOC 2012.

The training loss will increase and penalize the algorithm when the output does not exactly match the GT target, even when the outputs are mathematically valid candidates according to the SR framework. This becomes more problematic for the blind SR, as diverse unknown blur kernels exacerbate the ill-posedness of the problem. To this end, we propose a fundamentally different approach for the SR by introducing the concept of the adaptive target. The adaptive target is generated from the original GT target by a transformation to match the output of the SR network. The adaptive target provides an effective way for the SR algorithm to deal with the ill-posed nature of the SR, by providing the algorithm with the flexibility of accepting a variety of valid solutions. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our algorithm, especially for improving the perceptual quality of HR outputs",

    "abstract": "Recently, neural architecture search(NAS) has been applied to automatically search high-performance networks for medical image segmentation. The NAS search space usually contains a network topology level(controlling connections among cells with different spatial scales) and a cell level(operations within each cell). Existing methods either require long searching time for large-scale 3D image datasets, or are limited to pre-defined topologies (such as U-shaped or single-path). In this work, we focus on three important aspects of NAS in 3D medical image segmentation: flexible multi-path network topology, high search efficiency, and budgeted GPU memory usage. A novel differentiable search framework is proposed to support fast gradient-based search within a highly flexible network topology search space. The discretization of the searched optimal continuous model in differentiable scheme may produce a sub-optimal final discrete model (discretization gap). Therefore, we propose a topology loss to alleviate this problem. In addition, the GPU memory usage for the searched 3D model is limited with budget constraints during search. Our Differentiable Network Topology Search scheme(DiNTS) is evaluated on the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) challenge, which contains ten challenging segmentation tasks.

    "abstract": "Vector graphics are widely used to represent fonts, logos, digital artworks, and graphic designs. But, while a vast body of work has focused on generative algorithms for raster images, only a handful of options exists for vector graphics. One can always rasterize the input graphic and resort to image-based generative approaches, but this negates the advantages of the vector representation. The current alternative is to use specialized models that require explicit supervision on the vector graphics representation at training time. This is not ideal because large-scale high-quality vector-graphics datasets are difficult to obtain. Furthermore, the vector representation for a given design is not unique, so models that supervise on the vector representation are unnecessarily constrained. Instead, we propose a new neural network that can generate complex vector graphics with varying topologies, and only requires in-direct supervision from readily-available raster training images (i.e., with no vector counterparts). To enable this, we use a differentiable rasterization pipeline that renders the generated vector shapes and composites them together onto a raster canvas. We demonstrate our method on a range of datasets, and provide comparison with state-of-the-art SVG-VAE and DeepSVG, both of which require explicit vector graphics supervision. Finally, we also demonstrate our approach on the MNIST dataset, for which no groundtruth vector representation is available",

    "abstract": "Visual question answering (VQA) takes an image and a natural-language question as input and returns a natural-language answer. To date, VQA models are primarily assessed by their accuracy on high-level reasoning questions. Nevertheless, Given that perception tasks (e.g., recognizing objects) are the building blocks in the compositional process required by high-level reasoning, there is a demanding need to gain insights into how much of a problem low-level perception is. Inspired by the principles of software metamorphic testing, we introduce MetaVQA, a model-agnostic framework for benchmarking perception capability of VQA models. Given an image i, MetaVQA is able to synthesize a low level perception question q. It then jointly transforms (i, q) to one or a set of sub-questions and sub-images. MetaVQA checks whether the answer to (i, q) satisfies metamorphic relationships (MRs), denoting perception consistency, with the composed answers of transformed questions and images. Violating MRs denotes a failure of answering perception questions. MetaVQA successfully detects over 4.9 million perception failures made by popular VQA models with metamorphic testing. The state-of-the-art VQA models (e.g., the champion of VQA 2020 Challenge) suffer from perception consistency problems. In contrast, the Oscar VQA models, by using anchor points to align questions and images, show generally better consistency in perception tasks. We hope MetaVQA will revitalize interest in enhancing the low-level perceptual abilities of VQA models, a cornerstone of high-level reasoning",

To remove such a dependency and further improve the part segmentation performance, we develop a novel approach by disentangling the appearance and shape representations of object parts followed with reconstruction losses without using additional object mask information. To avoid degenerated solutions, a bottleneck block is designed to squeeze and expand the appearance representation, leading to a more effective disentanglement between geometry and appearance. Combined with a self-supervised part classification loss and an improved geometry concentration constraint, we can segment more consistent parts with semantic meanings.

    "abstract": "Adversarial attacks play a critical role in understanding deep neural network predictions and improving their robustness. Existing attack methods aim to deceive convolutional neural network (CNN)-based classifiers by manipulating RGB images that are fed directly to the classifiers. However, these approaches typically neglect the influence of the camera optics and image processing pipeline (ISP) that produce the network inputs. ISPs transform RAW measurements to RGB images and traditionally are assumed to preserve adversarial patterns. In fact, these low-level pipelines can destroy, introduce or amplify adversarial patterns that can deceive a downstream detector. As a result, optimized patterns can become adversarial for the classifier after being transformed by a certain camera ISP or optical lens system but not for others. In this work, we examine and develop such an attack that deceives a specific camera ISP while leaving others intact, using the same downstream classifier. We frame this camera-specific attack as a multi-task optimization problem, relying on a differentiable approximation for the ISP itself. We validate the proposed method using recent state-of-the-art automotive hardware ISPs, achieving 92% fooling rate when attacking a specific ISP. We demonstrate physical optics attacks with 90% fooling rate for a specific camera lens",

In this work, we consider semi-supervised learning and transfer learning jointly, leading to a more practical and competitive paradigm that can utilize both powerful pre-trained models from the source domain as well as labeled/unlabeled data in the target domain. To better exploit the value of both pre-trained weights and unlabeled target examples, we introduce adaptive consistency regularization that consists of two complementary components: Adaptive Knowledge Consistency (AKC) on the examples between the source and target model, and Adaptive Representation Consistency (ARC) on the target model between labeled and unlabeled examples. Examples involved in the consistency regularization are adaptively selected according to their potential contributions to the target task. We conduct extensive experiments on popular benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CUB-200, and MURA, by fine-tuning the ImageNet pre-trained ResNet-50 model. Results show that our proposed adaptive consistency regularization outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning techniques such as Pseudo Label, Mean Teacher, and FixMatch.

The generation of such variety by means of conditional GANs is limited to the expressions encoded in the used label system.

On the other hand, learning from inexpensive and intuitive basic categorical emotion labels leads to limited emotion variability. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN-based framework which learns an expressive and interpretable conditional space (usable as a label space) of emotions, instead of conditioning on handcrafted labels. Our framework only uses the categorical labels of basic emotions to jointly learn the conditional space as well as the emotion manipulation. Such learning can benefit from the image variability within discrete labels, especially when the intrinsic labels reside beyond the discrete space of the defined.

    "abstract": "Heatmap regression has become the most prevalent choice for nowadays human pose estimation methods. The ground-truth heatmaps are usually constructed by covering all skeletal keypoints by 2D gaussian kernels. The standard deviations of these kernels are fixed. However, for bottom-up methods, which need to handle a large variance of human scales and labeling ambiguities, the current practice seems unreasonable. To better cope with these problems, we propose the scale-adaptive heatmap regression (SAHR) method, which can adaptively adjust the standard deviation for each keypoint. In this way, SAHR is more tolerant of various human scales and labeling ambiguities. However, SAHR may aggravate the imbalance between fore-background samples, which potentially hurts the improvement of SAHR. Thus, we further introduce the weight-adaptive heatmap regression (WAHR) to help balance the fore-background samples. Extensive experiments show that SAHR together with WAHR largely improves the accuracy of bottom-up human pose estimation. As a result, we finally outperform the state-of-the-art model by +1.5AP and achieve 72.0 AP on COCO test-dev2017, which is comparable with the performances of most top-down methods.

However, the deep learning based visual-audio fixation prediction is still in its infancy.

Hence, it would be neither efficiency nor necessary to re-collect real fixations under the same visual-audio circumstance. To address the problem, this paper advocate a novel approach in a weakly-supervised manner to alleviating the demand of large-scale training sets for visual-audio model training. By using the video category tags only, we propose the selective class activation mapping (SCAM), which follows a coarse-to-fine strategy to select the most discriminative regions in the spatial-temporal-audio circumstance. Moreover, these regions exhibit high consistency with the real human-eye fixations, which could subsequently be employed as the pseudo GTs to train a new spatial-temporal-audio (STA) network.

    "abstract": "3D video avatars can empower virtual communications by providing compression, privacy, entertainment, and a sense of presence in AR/VR. Best 3D photo-realistic AR/VR avatars driven by video, that can minimize uncanny effects, rely on person-specific models. However, existing person-specific photo-realistic 3D models are not robust to lighting, hence their results typically miss subtle facial behaviors and cause artifacts in the avatar. This is a major drawback for the scalability of these models in communication systems (e.g., Messenger, Skype, FaceTime) and AR/VR. This paper addresses previous limitations by learning a deep learning lighting model, that in combination with a high-quality 3D face tracking algorithm, provides a method for subtle and robust facial motion transfer from a regular video to a 3D photo-realistic avatar. Extensive experimental validation and comparisons to other state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in real-world scenarios with variability in pose, expression, and illumination.

    "abstract": "We show that the influence of a subset of the training samples can be removed -- or \"forgotten\" -- from the weights of a network trained on large-scale image classification tasks, and we provide strong computable bounds on the amount of remaining information after forgetting. Inspired by real-world applications of forgetting techniques, we introduce a novel notion of forgetting in mixed-privacy setting, where we know that a \"core\" subset of the training samples does not need to be forgotten. While this variation of the problem is conceptually simple, we show that working in this setting significantly improves the accuracy and guarantees of forgetting methods applied to vision classification tasks. Moreover, our method allows efficient removal of all information contained in non-core data by simply setting to zero a subset of the weights with minimal loss in performance. We achieve these results by replacing a standard deep network with a suitable linear approximation. With opportune changes to the network architecture and training procedure, we show that such linear approximation achieves comparable performance to the original network and that the forgetting problem becomes quadratic and can be solved efficiently even for large models. Unlike previous forgetting methods on deep networks, ours can achieve close to the state-of-the-art accuracy on large scale vision tasks. In particular, we show that our method allows forgetting without having to trade off the model accuracy",

    "abstract": "In this work, we propose TediGAN, a novel framework for multi-modal image generation and manipulation with textual descriptions. The proposed method consists of three components: StyleGAN inversion module, visual-linguistic similarity learning, and instance-level optimization. The inversion module maps real images to the latent space of a well-trained StyleGAN. The visual-linguistic similarity learns the text-image matching by mapping the image and text into a common embedding space. The instance-level optimization is for identity preservation in manipulation. Our model can produce diverse and high-quality images with an unprecedented resolution at 1024 x 1024. Using a control mechanism based on style-mixing, our TediGAN inherently supports image synthesis with multi-modal inputs, such as sketches or semantic labels, with or without instance guidance. To facilitate text-guided multi-modal synthesis, we propose the Multi-Modal CelebA-HQ, a large-scale dataset consisting of real face images and corresponding semantic segmentation map, sketch, and textual descriptions. Extensive experiments on the introduced dataset demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method. Code and data are available at https://github.com/weihaox/TediGAN",

    "abstract": "View synthesis is usually done by an autoencoder, in which the encoder maps a source view image into a latent content code, and the decoder transforms it into a target view image according to the condition. However, the source contents are often not well kept in this setting, which leads to unnecessary changes during the view translation. Although adding skipped connections, like Unet, alleviates the problem, but it often causes the failure on the view conformity. This paper proposes a new architecture by performing the source-to-target deformation in an iterative way. Instead of simply incorporating the features from multiple layers of the encoder, we design soft and hard deformation modules, which warp the encoder features to the target view at different resolutions, and give results to the decoder to complement the details. Particularly, the current warping flow is not only used to align the feature of the same resolution, but also as an approximation to coarsely deform the high resolution feature. Then the residual flow is estimated and applied in the high resolution, so that the deformation is built up in the coarse-to-fine fashion. To better constrain the model, we synthesize a rough target view image based on the intermediate flows and their warped features. The extensive ablation studies and the final results on two different data sets show the effectiveness of the proposed model",

Such positional encoding is indispensable for generating images with high fidelity. The same phenomenon is observed in other generative architectures such as DCGAN and PGGAN. We further show that zero padding leads to an unbalanced spatial bias with a vague relation between locations. To offer a better spatial inductive bias, we investigate alternative positional encodings and analyze their effects. Based on a more flexible positional encoding explicitly, we propose a new multi-scale training strategy and demonstrate its effectiveness in the state-of-the-art unconditional generator StyleGAN2.

FPs are pervasive artifacts which occur around depth edges, where light paths from both an object and its background are integrated over the aperture. This light mixes at a sensor pixel to produce erroneous depth estimates, which can adversely affect downstream 3D vision tasks. Mask-ToF starts at the source of these FPs, learning a microlens-level occlusion mask which effectively creates a custom-shaped sub-aperture for each sensor pixel. This modulates the selection of foreground and background light mixtures on a per-pixel basis and thereby encodes scene geometric information directly into the ToF measurements. We develop a differentiable ToF simulator to jointly train a convolutional neural network to decode this information and produce high-fidelity, low-FP depth reconstructions. We test the effectiveness of Mask-ToF on a simulated light field dataset and validate the method with an experimental prototype. To this end, we manufacture the learned amplitude mask and design an optical relay system to virtually place it on a high-resolution ToF sensor. We find that Mask-ToF generalizes well to real data without retraining, cutting FP counts in half",

    "abstract": "Modern deep neural networks (DNNs) cannot be effectively used in mobile and embedded devices due to strict requirements for computational complexity, memory, and power consumption. The quantization of weights and feature maps (activations) is a popular approach to solve this problem. Training-aware quantization often shows excellent results but requires a full dataset, which is not always available. Post-training quantization methods, in turn, are applied without fine-tuning but still work well for many classes of tasks like classification, segmentation, and so on. However, they either imply a big overhead for quantization parameters (QPs) calculation at runtime (dynamic methods) or lead to an accuracy drop if pre-computed static QPs are used (static methods). Moreover, most inference frameworks don't support dynamic quantization. Thus we propose a novel quantization approach called QPP: quantization parameter prediction. With a small subset of a training dataset or unlabeled data from the same domain, we find the predictor that can accurately estimate QPs of activations given only the NN's input data. Such a predictor allows us to avoid complex calculation of precise values of QPs while maintaining the quality of the model. To illustrate our method's efficiency, we added QPP into two dynamic approaches: 1) Dense+Sparse quantization, where the predetermined percentage of activations are not quantized, 2) standard quantization with equal quantization steps.

Night images, however, do not only suffer from low light, but also from man-made light effects such as glow, glare, floodlight, etc. Hence, when the existing nighttime visibility enhancement methods are applied to these images, they intensify the effects, degrading the visibility even further. High dynamic range (HDR) imaging methods can address the low light and over-exposed regions, however they cannot remove the light effects, and thus cannot enhance the visibility in the affected regions. In this paper, given a single nighttime image as input, our goal is to enhance its visibility by increasing the dynamic range of the intensity, and thus can boost the intensity of the low light regions, and at the same time, suppress the light effects (glow, glare) simultaneously. First, we use a network to estimate the camera response function (CRF) from the input image to linearise the image. Second, we decompose the linearised image into low-frequency (LF) and high-frequency (HF) feature maps that are processed separately through two networks for light effects suppression and noise removal respectively. Third, we use a network to increase the dynamic range of the processed LF feature maps, which are then combined with the processed HF feature maps to generate the final output that has increased dynamic range and suppressed light effects.

Besides the global low-rank constraint, the local geometrical structure is additionally exploited via a projection distance penalty in our DLRRPD, thus facilitating a more favorable graph.

We also propose a progressive distribution alignment to adaptively adjust the rebalancing strength dubbed CReST+. We show that CReST and CReST+ improve state-of-the-art SSL algorithms on various class-imbalanced datasets and consistently outperform other popular rebalancing methods.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Video paragraph captioning aims to describe multiple events in untrimmed videos with descriptive paragraphs. Existing approaches mainly solve the problem in two steps: event detection and then event captioning. Such two-step manner makes the quality of generated paragraphs highly dependent on the accuracy of event proposal detection which is already a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a paragraph captioning model which eschews the problematic event detection stage and directly generates paragraphs for untrimmed videos. To describe coherent and diverse events, we propose to enhance the conventional temporal attention with dynamic video memories, which progressively exposes new video features and suppresses over-accessed video contents to control visual focuses of the model. In addition, a diversity-driven training strategy is proposed to improve diversity of paragraph on the language perspective. Considering that untrimmed videos generally contain massive but redundant frames, we further augment the video encoder with keyframe awareness to improve efficiency. Experimental results on the ActivityNet and Charades datasets show that our proposed model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art performance on both accuracy and diversity metrics without using any event boundary annotations.

In the context of image tasks, many algorithms have been proposed to make neural networks robust to adversarial perturbations made to the input pixels. These perturbations are typically measured in an l_p norm. However, robustness often holds only for the specific attack used for training. In this work we extend the above setting to consider the problem of training of deep neural networks that can be made simultaneously robust to perturbations applied in multiple natural representations spaces. For the case of image data, examples include the standard pixel representation as well as the representation in the discrete cosine transform (DCT) basis. We design a theoretically sound algorithm with formal guarantees for the above problem. Furthermore, our guarantees also hold when the goal is to require robustness with respect to multiple l_p norm based attacks.

We argue that exploiting local priors allows our method to efficiently use input observations, thus improving generalization in visible areas of novel shapes. At the same time, the combination of local and global priors enables meaningful hallucination of unobserved parts resulting in consistent 3D shapes.

    "abstract": "Face restoration is important in face image processing, and has been widely studied in recent years. However, previous works often fail to generate plausible high quality (HQ) results for real-world low quality (LQ) face images. In this paper, we propose a new progressive semantic-aware style transformation framework, named PSFR-GAN, for face restoration. Specifically, instead of using an encoder-decoder framework as previous methods, we formulate the restoration of LQ face images as a multi-scale progressive restoration procedure through semantic-aware style transformation. Given a pair of LQ face image and its corresponding parsing map, we first generate a multi-scale pyramid of the inputs, and then progressively modulate different scale features from coarse-to-fine in a semantic-aware style transfer way. Compared with previous networks, the proposed PSFR-GAN makes full use of the semantic (parsing maps) and pixel (LQ images) space information from different scales of input pairs. In addition, we further introduce a semantic aware style loss which calculates the feature style loss for each semantic region individually to improve the details of face textures. Finally, we pretrain a face parsing network which can generate decent parsing maps from real-world LQ face images. Experiment results show that our model trained with synthetic data can produce more realistic high-resolution results for synthetic LQ inputs than state-of-the-art methods and generalize better to natural LQ face images",

In this paper, we propose a novel framework to jointly address the above-mentioned issues. Targeting at (a), we propose a two-level modality alignment loss where both global and local information are considered. Compared with the existing methods, we introduce a global loss into the modality alignment process. The global component of the loss is driven by the accuracy of the identity classification. Theoretically, we show that minimizing the loss could maximize the distance between embeddings across different identities while minimizing the distance between embeddings belonging to the same identity, in a global sense (instead of a mini-batch). Targeting at (b), we propose a dynamic reweighting scheme to better explore the hard but valuable identities while filtering out the unlearnable and noisy identities.

Extensive experiments support the analysis results, revealing that the proposed saliency maps retrieve the original classes of adversarial examples crafted against both naturally and adversarially trained models, significantly outperforming previous methods.

    "abstract": "In real application scenarios, the performance of deep networks may be degraded when the dataset contains noisy labels. Existing methods for learning with noisy labels are limited by two aspects. Firstly, methods based on the noise probability modeling can only be applied to class-level noisy labels. Secondly, others based on the memorization effect outperform in synthetic noise but get weak promotion in real-world noisy datasets. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a novel label-noise robust method named Discrepant Adversarial Training (DAT). The DAT method has ability of enforcing prominent feature extraction by matching feature distribution between clean and noisy data. Therefore, under the noise-free feature representation, the deep network can simply output the correct result. To better capture the divergence between the noisy and clean distribution, a new metric is designed to change the distribution divergence into computable. By minimizing the proposed metric with a min-max training of discrepancy on classifiers and generators, DAT can match noisy data to clean data in the feature space. To the best of our knowledge, DAT is the first to address the noisy label problem from the perspective of the feature distribution. Experiments on synthetic and real-world noisy datasets demonstrate that DAT can consistently outperform other state-of-the-art methods. Codes are available at https://github.com/Tyqnn0323/DAT",

    "abstract": "3D point cloud classification has many safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving and robotic grasping. However, several studies showed that it is vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In particular, an attacker can make a classifier predict an incorrect label for a 3D point cloud via carefully modifying, adding, and/or deleting a small number of its points. Randomized smoothing is state-of-the-art technique to build certifiably robust 2D image classifiers. However, when applied to 3D point cloud classification, randomized smoothing can only certify robustness against adversarially modified points. In this work, we propose PointGuard, the first defense that has provable robustness guarantees against adversarially modified, added, and/or deleted points. Specifically, given a 3D point cloud and an arbitrary point cloud classifier, our PointGuard first creates multiple subsampled point clouds, each of which contains a random subset of the points in the original point cloud; then our PointGuard predicts the label of the original point cloud as the majority vote among the labels of the subsampled point clouds predicted by the point cloud classifier. Our first major theoretical contribution is that we show PointGuard provably predicts the same label for a 3D point cloud when the number of adversarially modified, added, and/or deleted points is bounded. Our second major theoretical contribution is that we prove the tightness of our derived bound when no assumptions on the point cloud classifier are made. Moreover, we design an efficient algorithm to compute our certified robustness guarantees. We also empirically evaluate PointGuard on ModelNet40 and ScanNet benchmark datasets",

Among these methods, the pseudo-label-based branch has achieved great success, whereas most of them only use limited data from a single-source domain for model pre-training, making the rich labeled data insufficiently exploited. To make full use of the valuable labeled data, we introduce the multi-source concept into UDA person re-ID field, where multiple source datasets are used during training. However, because of domain gaps, simply combining different datasets only brings limited improvement. In this paper, we try to address this problem from two perspectives, i.e. domain-specific view and domain-fusion view. Two constructive modules are proposed, and they are compatible with each other. First, a rectification domain-specific batch normalization (RDSBN) module is explored to simultaneously reduce domain-specific characteristics and increase the distinctiveness of person features. Second, a graph convolutional network (GCN) based multi-domain information fusion (MDIF) module is developed, which minimizes domain distances by fusing features of different domains. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art UDA person re-ID methods by a large margin, and even achieves comparable performance to the supervised approaches without any post-processing techniques",

    "abstract": "Weakly supervised segmentation methods using bounding box annotations focus on obtaining a pixel-level mask from each box containing an object. Existing methods typically depend on a class-agnostic mask generator, which operates on the low-level information intrinsic to an image. In this work, we utilize higher-level information from the behavior of a trained object detector, by seeking the smallest areas of the image from which the object detector produces almost the same result as it does from the whole image. These areas constitute a bounding-box attribution map (BBAM), which identifies the target object in its bounding box and thus serves as pseudo ground-truth for weakly supervised semantic and instance segmentation. This approach significantly outperforms recent comparable techniques on both the PASCAL VOC and MS COCO benchmarks in weakly supervised semantic and instance segmentation. In addition, we provide a detailed analysis of our method, offering deeper insight into the behavior of the BBAM",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Video content is multifaceted, consisting of objects, scenes, interactions or actions. The existing datasets mostly label only one of the facets for model training, resulting in the video representation that biases to only one facet depending on the training dataset. There is no study yet on how to learn a video representation from multifaceted labels, and whether multifaceted information is helpful for video representation learning. In this paper, we propose a new learning framework, MUlti-Faceted Integration (MUFI), to aggregate facets from different datasets for learning a representation that could reflect the full spectrum of video content. Technically, MUFI formulates the problem as visual-semantic embedding learning, which explicitly maps video representation into a rich semantic embedding space, and jointly optimizes video representation from two perspectives. One is to capitalize on the intra-facet supervision between each video and its own label descriptions, and the second predicts the \"semantic representation\" of each video from the facets of other datasets as the inter-facet supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that learning 3D CNN via our MUFI framework on a union of four large-scale video datasets plus two image datasets leads to superior capability of video representation. The pre-learnt 3D CNN with MUFI also shows clear improvements over other approaches on several downstream video applications. More remarkably, MUFI achieves 98.1%/80.9% on UCF101/HMDB51 for action recognition and 101.5% in terms of CIDEr-D score on MSVD for video captioning",

CFA pursues optimal feature assignment by constructing convex-hull sets and dynamically splitting positive or negative convex-hulls. By simultaneously considering overlapping convex-hulls and objects and penalizing convex-hulls shared by multiple objects, CFA alleviates spatial feature aliasing towards optimal feature adaptation.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The pancreatic disease taxonomy includes ten types of masses (tumors or cysts) [20, 8]. Previous work focuses on developing segmentation or classification methods only for certain mass types. Differential diagnosis of all mass types is clinically highly desirable [20] but has not been investigated using an automated image understanding approach. We exploit the feasibility to distinguish pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) from the nine other nonPDAC masses using multi-phase CT imaging. Both image appearance and the 3D organ-mass geometry relationship are critical. We propose a holistic segmentation-mesh-classification network (SMCN) to provide patient-level diagnosis, by fully utilizing the geometry and location information, which is accomplished by combining the anatomical structure and the semantic detection-by-segmentation network. SMCN learns the pancreas and mass segmentation task and builds an anatomical correspondence-aware organ mesh model by progressively deforming a pancreas prototype on the raw segmentation mask (i.e., mask-to-mesh). A new graph-based residual convolutional network (Graph-ResNet), whose nodes fuse the information of the mesh model and feature vectors extracted from the segmentation network, is developed to produce the patient-level differential classification results. Extensive experiments on 661 patients' CT scans (five phases per patient) show that SMCN can improve the mass segmentation and detection accuracy compared to the strong baseline method nnUNet (e.g., for nonPDAC, Dice: 0.611 vs. 0.478; detection rate: 89% vs. 70%), achieve similar sensitivity and specificity in differentiating PDAC and nonPDAC as expert radiologists (i.e., 94% and 90%), and obtain results comparable to a multimodality test [20] that combines clinical, imaging, and molecular testing for clinical management of patients",

This paper therefore presents a complete protection framework in both black-box and white-box settings to enforce IPR protection on GANs.

    "abstract": "With a 280 dB dynamic range, the real world is a High Dynamic Range (HDR) world. Today's sensors cannot record this dynamic range in a single shot. Instead, HDR cameras acquire multiple measurements with different exposures, gains and photodiodes, from which an Image Signal Processor (ISP) reconstructs an HDR image. HDR image recovery for dynamic scenes is an open challenge because of motion and because stitched captures have different noise characteristics, resulting in artefacts that the ISP has to resolve---in real time and at triple-digit megapixel resolutions. Traditionally, hardware ISP settings used by downstream vision modules have been chosen by domain experts. Such frozen camera designs are then used for training data acquisition and supervised learning of downstream vision modules. We depart from this paradigm and formulate HDR ISP hyperparameter search as an end-to-end optimization problem. We propose a mixed 0th and 1st-order block coordinate descent optimizer to jointly learn ISP and detector network weights using RAW image data augmented with emulated SNR transition region artefacts. We assess the proposed method for human vision and image understanding. For automotive object detection, the method improves mAP and mAR by 33% compared to expert-tuning and by 22% compared to recent state-of-the-art. The method is validated in an HDR laboratory rig and in the field, outperforming conventional handcrafted HDR imaging and vision pipelines in all experiments",

    "abstract": "Image virtual try-on aims to fit a garment image (target clothes) to a person image. Prior methods are heavily based on human parsing. However, slightly-wrong segmentation results would lead to unrealistic try-on images with large artifacts. Inaccurate parsing misleads parser-based methods to produce visually unrealistic results where artifacts usually occur. A recent pioneering work employed knowledge distillation to reduce the dependency of human parsing, where the try-on images produced by a parser-based method are used as supervisions to train a \"student\" network without relying on segmentation, making the student mimic the try-on ability of the parser-based model. However, the image quality of the student is bounded by the parser-based model. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach, \"teacher-tutor-student\" knowledge distillation, which is able to produce highly photo-realistic images without human parsing, possessing several appealing advantages compared to prior arts. (1) Unlike existing work, our approach treats the fake images produced by the parser-based method as \"tutor knowledge\", where the artifacts can be corrected by real \"teacher knowledge\", which is extracted from the real person images in a self-supervised way. (2) Other than using real images as supervisions, we formulate knowledge distillation in the try-on problem as distilling the appearance flows between the person image and the garment image, enabling us to find accurate dense correspondences between them to produce high-quality results. (3) Extensive evaluations show large superiority of our method (see Fig. 1)",

While several recent works investigate how to disentangle underlying factors of variation in the data, most of them operate in 2D and hence ignore that our world is three-dimensional. Further, only few works consider the compositional nature of scenes. Our key hypothesis is that incorporating a compositional 3D scene representation into the generative model leads to more controllable image synthesis. Representing scenes as compositional generative neural feature fields allows us to disentangle one or multiple objects from the background as well as individual objects' shapes and appearances while learning from unstructured and unposed image collections without any additional supervision. Combining this scene representation with a neural rendering pipeline yields a fast and realistic image synthesis model. As evidenced by our experiments, our model is able to disentangle individual objects and allows for translating and rotating them in the scene as well as changing the camera pose",

Although the temporal resolution of visual information is improved, how to reconstruct the scenes is still a challenging problem. In this paper, we present a novel high-speed image reconstruction model through the short-term plasticity (STP) mechanism of the brain. We derive the relationship between postsynaptic potential regulated by STP and the firing frequency of each pixel. By setting up the STP model at each pixel of the spiking camera, we can infer the scene radiance with the temporal regularity of the spike stream. Moreover, we show that STP can be used to distinguish the static and motion areas and further enhance the reconstruction results.

Thus, they may suffer from poor generalization ability in unseen scenarios. This paper proposes a novel adversarial learning approach for rPPG based physiological measurement by using Dual Generative Adversarial Networks (Dual-GAN) to model the BVP estimation and noise distribution jointly. The BVP-GAN aims to learn a noise-resistant mapping from input to ground-truth BVP, and the Noise-GAN aims to learn the noise distribution. The dual GANs can promote each other's capability, leading to improved feature disentanglement between BVP and noises.

To this end, we propose a novel search space called Combined Depth Space (CDS), based on which we search for an efficient network architecture, which we call CDNet, via a differentiable architecture search algorithm. Through the use of the combined basic building blocks in CDS, CDNet tends to focus on combined pattern information that is typically found in images of pedestrians. We then propose a low-cost search strategy named the Top-k Sample Search strategy to make full use of the search space and avoid trapping in local optimal result. Furthermore, an effective Fine-grained Balance Neck (FBLNeck), which is removable at the inference time, is presented to balance the effects of triplet loss and softmax loss during the training process.

However, its principle of adding an extra path to encode spatial information is time-consuming, and the backbones borrowed from pretrained tasks, e.g., image classification, may be inefficient for image segmentation due to the deficiency of task-specific design. To handle these problems, we propose a novel and efficient structure named Short-Term Dense Concatenate network (STDC network) by removing structure redundancy. Specifically, we gradually reduce the dimension of feature maps and use the aggregation of them for image representation, which forms the basic module of STDC network. In the decoder, we propose a Detail Aggregation module by integrating the learning of spatial information into low-level layers in single-stream manner. Finally, the low-level features and deep features are fused to predict the final segmentation results.

    "abstract": "We propose a novel spatially-correlative loss that is simple, efficient, and yet effective for preserving scene structure consistency while supporting large appearance changes during unpaired image-to-image (I2I) translation. Previous methods attempt this by using pixel-level cycle-consistency or feature-level matching losses, but the domain-specific nature of these losses hinder translation across large domain gaps. To address this, we exploit the spatial patterns of self-similarity as a means of defining scene structure. Our spatially-correlative loss is geared towards only capturing spatial relationships within an image rather than domain appearance. We also introduce a new self-supervised learning method to explicitly learn spatially-correlative maps for each specific translation task. We show distinct improvement over baseline models in all three modes of unpaired I2I translation: single-modal, multi-modal, and even single-image translation. This new loss can easily be integrated into existing network architectures and thus allows wide applicability",

Therefore, we propose the first REal-world VIdeo DEhazing (REVIDE) dataset which can be used for the supervised learning of the video dehazing algorithms. By utilizing a well-designed video acquisition system, we can capture paired real-world hazy and haze-free videos that are perfectly aligned by recording the same scene (with or without haze) twice. Considering the challenge of exploiting temporal redundancy among the hazy frames, we also develop a Confidence Guided and Improved Deformable Network (CG-IDN) for video dehazing. The experiments demonstrate that the hazy scenes in the REVIDE dataset are more realistic than the synthetic datasets and the proposed algorithm also performs favorably against state-of-the-art dehazing methods",

    "abstract": "Multi-Camera Multiple Object Tracking (MC-MOT) is a significant computer vision problem due to its emerging applicability in several real-world applications. Despite a large number of existing works, solving the data association problem in any MC-MOT pipeline is arguably one of the most challenging tasks. Developing a robust MC-MOT system, however, is still highly challenging due to many practical issues such as inconsistent lighting conditions, varying object movement patterns, or the trajectory occlusions of the objects between the cameras. To address these problems, this work, therefore, proposes a new Dynamic Graph Model with Link Prediction (DyGLIP) approach to solve the data association task. Compared to existing methods, our new model offers several advantages, including better feature representations and the ability to recover from lost tracks during camera transitions. Moreover, our model works gracefully regardless of the overlapping ratios between the cameras.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Advanced tensor decomposition, such as Tensor train (TT) and Tensor ring (TR), has been widely studied for deep neural network (DNN) model compression, especially for recurrent neural networks (RNNs). However, compressing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using TT/TR always suffers significant accuracy loss. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework for tensor decomposition-based model compression using Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). By formulating TT decomposition-based model compression to an optimization problem with constraints on tensor ranks, we leverage ADMM technique to systemically solve this optimization problem in an iterative way. During this procedure, the entire DNN model is trained in the original structure instead of TT format, but gradually enjoys the desired low tensor rank characteristics. We then decompose this uncompressed model to TT format and fine-tune it to finally obtain a high-accuracy TT-format DNN model. Our framework is very general, and it works for both CNNs and RNNs, and can be easily modified to fit other tensor decomposition approaches. We evaluate our proposed framework on different DNN models for image classification and video recognition tasks. Experimental results show that our ADMM-based TT-format models demonstrate very high compression performance with high accuracy. Notably, on CIFAR-100, with 2.3X and 2.4X compression ratios, our models have 1.96% and 2.21% higher top-1 accuracy than the original ResNet-20 and ResNet-32, respectively. For compressing ResNet-18 on ImageNet, our model achieves 2.47X FLOPs reduction without accuracy loss",

This framework explicitly controls such scribble influence areas for artists to manipulate the colors of image details and avoid color leakage/contamination between scribbles, and simultaneously, leverages data-driven color generation to facilitate content creation. This framework is based on a Split Filling Mechanism (SFM), which first splits the user scribbles into individual groups and then independently processes the colors and influence areas of each group with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Learned from more than a million illustrations, the framework can estimate the scribble influence areas in a content-aware manner, and can smartly generate visually pleasing colors to assist the daily works of artists.

By adopting a fully convolutional neural network (FCN) as the baseline, we can improve video denoising performance without accurate optical flow estimation and registration steps, in contrast to many conventional video restoration methods, due to the translation equivariant property of the FCN. Specifically, the proposed method can take advantage of plentiful similar patches existing across multiple consecutive frames (i.e., patch-recurrence); these patches can boost the performance of the baseline network by a large margin. We analyze the restoration performance of the fine-tuned video denoising networks with the proposed self-supervision-based learning algorithm, and demonstrate that the FCN can utilize recurring patches without requiring accurate registration among adjacent frames. In our experiments, we apply the proposed method to state-of-the-art denoisers and show that our fine-tuned networks achieve a considerable improvement in denoising performance",

In this work, we concentrate on the essential visual task, semantic segmentation, for large-scale point cloud data collected in reality. On the one hand, to reduce the ambiguity in nearby points, we augment their local context by fully utilizing both geometric and semantic features in a bilateral structure. On the other hand, we comprehensively interpret the distinctness of the points from multiple resolutions and represent the feature map following an adaptive fusion method at point-level for accurate semantic segmentation.

Additionally, the predicted detection results vary among different detection models. In this paper, we propose an interactive form of self-training using mean teachers for semi-supervised object detection. Specifically, to alleviate the instability among the detection results in different iterations, we propose using nonmaximum suppression to fuse the detection results from different iterations. Simultaneously, we use multiple detection heads that predict pseudo labels for each other to provide complementary information. Furthermore, to avoid different detection heads collapsing to each other, we use a mean teacher model instead of the original detection model to predict the pseudo labels. Thus, the object detection model can be trained on both labeled and unlabeled data. Extensive experimental results verify the effectiveness of our proposed method",

    "abstract": "User-intended visual content fills the hole regions of an input image in the image editing scenario. The coarse lowlevel inputs, which typically consist of sparse sketch lines and color dots, convey user intentions for content creation (i.e., free-form editing). While existing methods combine an input image and these low-level controls for CNN inputs, the corresponding feature representations are not sufficient to convey user intentions, leading to unfaithfully generated content. In this paper, we propose DeFLOCNet which is based on a deep encoder-decoder CNN to retain the guidance of these controls in the deep feature representations. In each skip connection layer, we design a structure generation block. Instead of attaching low-level controls to an input image, we inject these controls directly into each structure generation block for sketch line refinement and color propagation in the CNN feature space. We then concatenate the modulated features with the original decoder features for structure generation. Meanwhile, DeFLOCNet involves another decoder branch for texture generation and detail enhancement. Both structures and textures are rendered in the decoder, leading to user-intended editing results. Experiments on benchmarks indicate that DeFLOCNet effectively transforms different user intentions to create visually pleasing content",

In order to leverage transformer networks, which have been shown to be effective at modeling language, each modality is first converted into a set of language embeddings by a learnable tokenizer. This allows our approach to perform multimodal fusion in the language space, thus eliminating the need for ad-hoc cross-modal fusion modules. To address the non-differentiability of tokenization on continuous inputs (e.g., video or audio), we utilize a relaxation scheme that enables end-to-end training. Furthermore, unlike prior encoder-only models, our network includes an autoregressive decoder to generate open-ended text from the multimodal embeddings fused by the language encoder. This renders our approach fully generative and makes it directly applicable to different \"video+x to text\" problems without the need to design specialized network heads for each task. The proposed framework is not only conceptually simple but also remarkably effective: experiments demonstrate that our approach based on a single architecture outperforms the state-of-the-art on three video-based text-generation tasks---captioning, question answering and audio-visual scene-aware dialog.

    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNN) could forget the knowledge about earlier tasks when learning new tasks, and this is known as catastrophic forgetting. To learn new task without forgetting, recently, the mask-based learning method (e.g. piggyback ) is proposed to address these issues by learning only a binary element-wise mask, while keeping the backbone model fixed. However, the binary mask has limited modeling capacity for new tasks. A more recent work proposes a compress-grow-based method (CPG) to achieve better accuracy for new tasks by partially training backbone model, but with order-higher training cost, which makes it infeasible to be deployed into popular state-of-the-art edge-/mobile-learning. The primary goal of this work is to simultaneously achieve fast and high-accuracy multi-task adaption in a continual learning setting. Thus motivated, we propose a new training method called Kernel-wise Soft Mask (KSM), which learns a kernel-wise hybrid binary and real-value soft mask for each task. Such a soft mask can be viewed as a superposition of a binary mask and a properly scaled real-value tensor, which offers a richer representation capability without low-level kernel support to meet the objective of low hardware overhead. We validate KSM on multiple benchmark datasets against recent state-of-the-art methods (e.g. Piggyback, Packnet, CPG, etc.), which shows good improvement in both accuracy and training cost",

We observe that humans often rely on identifying reflections in order to sense the existence of glass and on locating the boundary in order to determine the extent of the glass. Hence, we propose a model for glass surface detection, which consists of two novel modules: (1) a rich context aggregation module (RCAM) to extract multi-scale boundary features from rich context features for locating glass surface boundaries of different sizes and shapes, and (2) a reflection-based refinement module (RRM) to detect reflection and then incorporate it so as to differentiate glass regions from non-glass regions.

Among these applications, neural volume rendering has recently been proposed as a new paradigm for view synthesis, achieving photorealistic image quality. However, a fundamental obstacle to making these methods practical is the extreme computational and memory requirements caused by the required volume integrations along the rendered rays during training and inference. Millions of rays, each requiring hundreds of forward passes through a neural network are needed to approximate those integrations with Monte Carlo sampling. Here, we propose automatic integration, a new framework for learning efficient, closed-form solutions to integrals using coordinate-based neural networks. For training, we instantiate the computational graph corresponding to the derivative of the coordinate-based network. The graph is fitted to the signal to integrate. After optimization, we reassemble the graph to obtain a network that represents the antiderivative. By the fundamental theorem of calculus, this enables the calculation of any definite integral in two evaluations of the network. Applying this approach to neural rendering, we improve a tradeoff between rendering speed and image quality: improving render times by greater than 10x with a tradeoff of reduced image quality",

Each modular network is explicitly dedicated to a subtask that can be learned from the synthetic data. At the inference time, we utilize the trained network to produce a unified representation of appearance and its labels in UV coordinates, which remain constant across poses. The unified representation provides incomplete yet strong guidance to generating the appearance in response to the pose change. We use the trained network to complete the appearance and render it with the background.

Different from related VLN tasks, the key to REVERIE is to conduct goal-oriented exploration instead of strict instruction-following, due to the lack of step-by-step navigation guidance. In this paper, we propose a novel Cross-modality Knowledge Reasoning (CKR) model to address the unique challenges of this task. The CKR, based on a transformer-architecture, learns to generate scene memory tokens and utilise these informative history clues for exploration. Particularly, a Room-and-Object Aware Attention (ROAA) mechanism is devised to explicitly perceive the room- and object-type information from both linguistic and visual observations. Moreover, through incorporating commonsense knowledge, we propose a Knowledge-enabled Entity Relationship Reasoning (KERR) module to learn the internal-external correlations among room- and object-entities for agent to make proper action at each viewpoint. Evaluation on REVERIE benchmark demonstrates the superiority of the CKR model, which significantly boosts SPL and REVERIE-success rate by 64.67% and 46.05%, respectively.

    "abstract": "Features that are equivariant to a larger group of symmetries have been shown to be more discriminative and powerful in recent studies. However, higher-order equivariant features often come with an exponentially-growing computational cost. Furthermore, it remains relatively less explored how rotation-equivariant features can be leveraged to tackle 3D shape alignment tasks. While many past approaches have been based on either non-equivariant or invariant descriptors to align 3D shapes, we argue that such tasks may benefit greatly from an equivariant framework. In this paper, we propose an effective and practical SE(3) (3D translation and rotation) equivariant network for point cloud analysis that addresses both problems. First, we present SE(3) separable point convolution, a novel framework that breaks down the 6D convolution into two separable convolutional operators alternatively performed in the 3D Euclidean and SO(3) spaces. This significantly reduces the computational cost without compromising the performance. Second, we introduce an attention layer to effectively harness the expressiveness of the equivariant features. While jointly trained with the network, the attention layer implicitly derives the intrinsic local frame in the feature space and generates attention vectors that can be integrated into different alignment tasks. We evaluate our approach through extensive studies and visual interpretations. The empirical results demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms strong baselines in a variety of benchmarks",

This is challenging because the same state can for example alter the visual appearance of a dog drastically differently from a car. As a solution, we propose a novel graph formulation called Compositional Graph Embedding (CGE) that learns image features, compositional classifiers, and latent representations of visual primitives in an end-to-end manner. The key to our approach is exploit-ing the dependency between states, objects, and their compositions within a graph structure to enforce the relevant knowledge transfer from seen to unseen compositions. By learning a joint compatibility that encodes semantics between concepts, our model allows for generalization to un-seen compositions without relying on an external knowledgebase like WordNet. We show that in the challenging generalized compositional zero-shot setting our CGE significantly outperforms the state of the art on MIT-States and UT-Zappos.

However, detecting 3D symmetry from an image remains a challenging task. Previous works either assume the symmetry is given or detect the symmetry with a heuristic-based method. In this paper, we present NeRD, a Neural 3D Reflection Symmetry Detector, which combines the strength of learning-based recognition and geometry-based reconstruction to accurately recover the normal direction of objects' mirror planes. Specifically, we enumerate the symmetry planes with a coarse-to-fine strategy and find the best ones by building 3D cost volumes to examine the intra-image pixel correspondence from the symmetry. Our experiments show that the symmetry planes detected with our method are significantly more accurate than the planes from direct CNN regression on both synthetic and real datasets. More importantly, we also demonstrate that the detected symmetry can be used to improve the performance of downstream tasks such as pose estimation and depth map regression by a wide margin over existing methods.

    "abstract": "Model quantization is a promising approach to compress deep neural networks and accelerate inference, making it possible to be deployed on mobile and edge devices. To retain the high performance of full-precision models, most existing quantization methods focus on fine-tuning quantized model by assuming training datasets are accessible. However, this assumption sometimes is not satisfied in real situations due to data privacy and security issues, thereby making these quantization methods not applicable. To achieve zero-short model quantization without accessing training data, a tiny number of quantization methods adopt either post-training quantization or batch normalization statistics-guided data generation for fine-tuning. However, both of them inevitably suffer from low performance, since the former is a little too empirical and lacks training support for ultra-low precision quantization, while the latter could not fully restore the peculiarities of original data and is often low efficient for diverse data generation. To address the above issues, we propose a zero-shot adversarial quantization (ZAQ) framework, facilitating effective discrepancy estimation and knowledge transfer from a full-precision model to its quantized model. This is achieved by a novel two-level discrepancy modeling to drive a generator to synthesize informative and diverse data examples to optimize the quantized model in an adversarial learning fashion. We conduct extensive experiments on three fundamental vision tasks, demonstrating the superiority of ZAQ over the strong zero-shot baselines and validating the effectiveness of its main components",

This paper proposes group whitening (GW), which exploits the advantages of the whitening operation and avoids the disadvantages of normalization within mini-batches. In addition, we analyze the constraints imposed on features by normalization, and show how the batch size (group number) affects the performance of batch (group) normalized networks, from the perspective of model's representational capacity. This analysis provides theoretical guidance for applying GW in practice. Finally, we apply the proposed GW to ResNet and ResNeXt architectures and conduct experiments on the ImageNet and COCO benchmarks.

    "abstract": "Adversarial robustness has attracted extensive studies recently by revealing the vulnerability and intrinsic characteristics of deep networks. However, existing works on adversarial robustness mainly focus on balanced datasets, while real-world data usually exhibits a long-tailed distribution. To push adversarial robustness towards more realistic scenarios, in this work we investigate the adversarial vulnerability as well as defense under long-tailed distributions. In particular, we first reveal the negative impacts induced by imbalanced data on both recognition performance and adversarial robustness, uncovering the intrinsic challenges of this problem. We then perform a systematic study on existing long-tailed recognition methods in conjunction with the adversarial training framework. Several valuable observations are obtained: 1) natural accuracy is relatively easy to improve, 2) fake gain of robust accuracy exists under unreliable evaluation, and 3) boundary error limits the promotion of robustness. Inspired by these observations, we propose a clean yet effective framework, RoBal, which consists of two dedicated modules, a scale-invariant classifier and data re-balancing via both margin engineering at training stage and boundary adjustment during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach over other state-of-the-art defense methods. To our best knowledge, we are the first to tackle adversarial robustness under long-tailed distributions, which we believe would be a significant step towards real-world robustness.

Several recent successful methods for training deep neural networks (DNNs) robust to label noise have used two primary techniques: filtering samples based on loss during a warm-up phase to curate an initial set of cleanly labeled samples, and using the output of a network as a pseudo-label for subsequent loss calculations. In this paper, we evaluate different augmentation strategies for algorithms tackling the \"\"learning with noisy labels\"\" problem. We propose and examine multiple augmentation strategies and evaluate them using synthetic datasets based on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, as well as on the real-world dataset Clothing1M. Due to several commonalities in these algorithms, we find that using one set of augmentations for loss modeling tasks and another set for learning is the most effective, improving results on the state-of-the-art and other previous methods. Furthermore, we find that applying augmentation during the warm-up period can negatively impact the loss convergence behavior of correctly versus incorrectly labeled samples. We introduce this augmentation strategy to the state-of-the-art technique and demonstrate that we can improve performance across all evaluated noise levels. In particular, we improve accuracy on the CIFAR-10 benchmark at 90% symmetric noise by more than 15% in absolute accuracy, and we also improve performance on the Clothing1M dataset",

Based on this processing, we found that different image regions have different restoration difficulties and can be processed by networks with different capacities. Intuitively, smooth areas are easier to super-solve than complex textures. To utilize this property, we can adopt appropriate SR networks to process different sub-images after the decomposition. On this basis, we propose a new solution pipeline -- ClassSR that combines classification and SR in a unified framework. In particular, it first uses a Class-Module to classify the sub-images into different classes according to restoration difficulties, then applies an SR-Module to perform SR for different classes. The Class-Module is a conventional classification network, while the SR-Module is a network container that consists of the to-be-accelerated SR network and its simplified versions. We further introduce a new classification method with two losses -- Class-Loss and Average-Loss to produce the classification results. After joint training, a majority of sub-images will pass through smaller networks, thus the computational cost can be significantly reduced. Experiments show that our ClassSR can help most existing methods (e.g., FSRCNN, CARN, SRResNet, RCAN) save up to 50% FLOPs on DIV8K datasets.

Our solution relies on designing a partitioner that breaks the space into smaller regions, each having a simpler distribution, and training a different generator for each partition. This is done in an unsupervised manner without requiring any labels. We formulate two desired criteria for the space partitioner that aid the training of our mixture of generators: 1) to produce connected partitions and 2) provide a proxy of distance between partitions and data samples, along with a direction for reducing that distance. These criteria are developed to avoid producing samples from places with non-existent data density, and also facilitate training by providing additional direction to the generators. We develop theoretical constraints for a space partitioner to satisfy the above criteria.

In this paper, we propose to leverage data augmentation to defeat reconstruction attacks: by preprocessing sensitive images with carefully-selected transformation policies, it becomes infeasible for the adversary to extract any useful information from the corresponding gradients. We design a novel search method to automatically discover qualified policies.

However, the task of cross-modal video moment retrieval is not yet thoroughly addressed as it needs to further identify the fine-grained differences of video moment candidates with high repeatability and similarity. Moveover, the relation among objects in both video and query sentence is intuitive and efficient for understanding semantics but is rarely considered. Toward this end, we contribute a multi-modal relational graph to capture the interactions among objects from the visual and textual content to identify the differences among similar video moment candidates. Specifically, we first introduce a visual relational graph and a textual relational graph to form relation-aware representations via message propagation. Thereafter, a multi-task pre-training is designed to capture domain-specific knowledge about objects and relations, enhancing the structured visual representation after explicitly defined relation.

The existing approach for constructing neural radiance fields (NeRFs) involves optimizing the representation to every scene independently, requiring many calibrated views and significant compute time. We take a step towards resolving these shortcomings by introducing an architecture that conditions a NeRF on image inputs in a fully convolutional manner. This allows the network to be trained across multiple scenes to learn a scene prior, allowing it to perform novel view synthesis in a feed-forward manner from a sparse set of views (as few as one). Leveraging the volume rendering approach of NeRF, our model can be trained directly from images with no explicit 3D supervision. We conduct extensive experiments on ShapeNet benchmarks for single image novel view synthesis tasks under category specific and category agnostic settings. We further demonstrate the flexibility of pixelNeRF by demonstrating it on multi-object ShapeNet scenes as well as real scenes from the DTU dataset. In all cases, pixelNeRF outperforms current state-of-the-art baselines for novel view synthesis and single image 3D reconstruction",

Furthermore, GANs are especially useful for controllable generation since their latent spaces contain a wide range of interpretable directions, well suited for semantic editing operations. By gradually changing latent codes along these directions, one can produce impressive visual effects, unattainable without GANs. In this paper, we significantly expand the range of visual effects achievable with the state-of-the-art models, like StyleGAN2. In contrast to existing works, which mostly operate by latent codes, we discover interpretable directions in the space of the generator parameters. By several simple methods, we explore this space and demonstrate that it also contains a plethora of interpretable directions, which are an excellent source of non-trivial semantic manipulations. The discovered manipulations cannot be achieved by transforming the latent codes and can be used to edit both synthetic and real images. We release our code and models and hope they will serve as a handy tool for further efforts on GAN-based image editing",

    "abstract": "Weakly-supervised temporal action localization (WS-TAL) aims to localize actions in untrimmed videos with only video-level labels. Most existing models follow the \"localization by classification\" procedure: locate temporal regions contributing most to the video-level classification. Generally, they process each snippet (or frame) individually and thus overlook the fruitful temporal context relation. Here arises the single snippet cheating issue: \"hard\" snippets are too vague to be classified. In this paper, we argue that learning by comparing helps identify these hard snippets and we propose to utilize snippet Contrastive learning to Localize Actions, CoLA for short. Specifically, we propose a Snippet Contrast (SniCo) Loss to refine the hard snippet representation in feature space, which guides the network to perceive precise temporal boundaries and avoid the temporal interval interruption. Besides, since it is infeasible to access frame-level annotations, we introduce a Hard Snippet Mining algorithm to locate the potential hard snippets. Substantial analyses verify that this mining strategy efficaciously captures the hard snippets and SniCo Loss leads to more informative feature representation.

This imbalance degrades the performance of typical supervised learning algorithms designed for balanced training sets. In this paper, we address this issue by augmenting minority classes with a recently proposed implicit semantic data augmentation (ISDA) algorithm, which produces diversified augmented samples by translating deep features along many semantically meaningful directions. Importantly, given that ISDA estimates the class-conditional statistics to obtain semantic directions, we find it ineffective to do this on minority classes due to the insufficient training data. To this end, we propose a novel approach to learn transformed semantic directions with meta-learning automatically. In specific, the augmentation strategy during training is dynamically optimized, aiming to minimize the loss on a small balanced validation set, which is approximated via a meta update step.

With our novel training regime for segmentation that flexibly makes use of images that are either fully labeled, marked with bounding boxes, just global labels, or not at all, we are able to cut the requirement for expensive labels by 94.22% - narrowing the gap to the best fully supervised baseline to only 5% mean IoU.

In this paper, we claim that the standard evaluation metric, which consists in measuring the overall in-domain accuracy, is misleading. Since questions and concepts are unbalanced, this tends to favor models which exploit subtle training set statistics. Alternatively, naively introducing artificial distribution shifts between train and test splits is also not completely satisfying. First, the shifts do not reflect real-world tendencies, resulting in unsuitable models; second, since the shifts are handcrafted, trained models are specifically designed for this particular setting, and do not generalize to other configurations. We propose the GQA-OOD benchmark designed to overcome these concerns: we measure and compare accuracy over both rare and frequent question-answer pairs, and argue that the former is better suited to the evaluation of reasoning abilities, which we experimentally validate with models trained to more or less exploit biases. In a large-scale study involving 7 VQA models and 3 bias reduction techniques, we also experimentally demonstrate that these models fail to address questions involving infrequent concepts and provide recommendations for future directions of research",

    "abstract": "The current evaluation protocol of long-tailed visual recognition trains the classification model on the long-tailed source label distribution and evaluates its performance on the uniform target label distribution. Such protocol has questionable practicality since the target may also be long-tailed. Therefore, we formulate long-tailed visual recognition as a label shift problem where the target and source label distributions are different. One of the significant hurdles in dealing with the label shift problem is the entanglement between the source label distribution and the model prediction. In this paper, we focus on disentangling the source label distribution from the model prediction. We first introduce a simple but overlooked baseline method that matches the target label distribution by post-processing the model prediction trained by the cross-entropy loss and the Softmax function. Although this method surpasses state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets, it can be further improved by directly disentangling the source label distribution from the model prediction in the training phase. Thus, we propose a novel method, LAbel distribution DisEntangling (LADE) loss based on the optimal bound of Donsker-Varadhan representation. LADE achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets such as CIFAR-100-LT, Places-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist 2018.

This motivates the adoption of the ensemble technique to learn a number of sub-embeddings using different and diverse subtasks. However, most subtasks impose weaker or contradictory constraints, which essentially sacrifices the discrimination ability of each sub-embedding to improve the generalization ability of their combination. To achieve a better generalization ability without compromising, we propose to separate the sub-embeddings from direct supervisions from the subtasks and apply the losses on different composites of the sub-embeddings. We employ a set of learnable compositors to combine the sub-embeddings and use a self-reinforced loss to train the compositors, which serve as relays to distribute the diverse training signals to avoid destroying the discrimination ability.

Discovering such structures is therefore a rewarding way to reason about the dynamics of interactions and recognize the actions. In this paper, we introduce a new design of sub-graphs to represent and encode the discriminative patterns of each action in the videos. Specifically, we present MUlti-scale Sub-graph LEarning (MUSLE) framework that novelly builds space-time graphs and clusters the graphs into compact sub-graphs on each scale with respect to the number of nodes. Technically, MUSLE produces 3D bounding boxes, i.e., tubelets, in each video clip, as graph nodes and takes dense connectivity as graph edges between tubelets.

    "abstract": "I went to the gym today, but how well did I do? And where should I improve? Ah, my back hurts slightly... User engagement can be sustained and injuries avoided by being able to reconstruct 3d human pose and motion, relate it to good training practices, identify errors, and provide early, real-time feedback. In this paper we introduce the first automatic system, AIFit, that performs 3d human sensing for fitness training. The system can be used at home, outdoors, or at the gym. AIFit is able to reconstruct 3d human pose and motion, reliably segment exercise repetitions, and identify in real-time the deviations between standards learnt from trainers, and the execution of a trainee. As a result, localized, quantitative feedback for correct execution of exercises, reduced risk of injury, and continuous improvement is possible. To support research and evaluation, we introduce the first large scale dataset, Fit3D, containing over 3 million images and corresponding 3d human shape and motion capture ground truth configurations, with over 37 repeated exercises, covering all the major muscle groups, performed by instructors and trainees. Our statistical coach is governed by a global parameter that captures how critical it should be of a trainee's performance. This is an important aspect that helps adapt to a student's level of fitness (i.e. beginner vs. advanced vs. expert), or to the expected accuracy of a 3d pose reconstruction method. We show that, for different values of the global parameter, our feedback system based on 3d pose estimates achieves good accuracy compared to the one based on ground-truth motion capture. Our statistical coach offers feedback in natural language, and with spatio-temporal visual grounding",

While many efforts have been made on generating realistic and natural human motion, most approaches neglect the importance of modeling human-scene interactions and affordances. On the other hand, affordance reasoning (e.g., standing on the floor or sitting on the chair) has mainly been studied with static human pose and gestures, and it has rarely been addressed with human motion. In this paper, we propose to bridge human motion synthesis and scene affordance reasoning. We present a hierarchical generative framework which synthesizes long-term 3D human motion conditioning on the 3D scene structure. We also further enforce multiple geometry constraints between the human mesh and scene point clouds via optimization to improve realistic synthesis.

In contrast to existing work on video prediction, we do not synthesize arbitrary realistic videos but enable local interactive control of the deformation.

After training, a DBB can be equivalently converted into a single conv layer for deployment. Unlike the advancements of novel ConvNet architectures, DBB complicates the training-time microstructure while maintaining the macro architecture, so that it can be used as a drop-in replacement for regular conv layers of any architecture. In this way, the model can be trained to reach a higher level of performance and then transformed into the original inference-time structure for inference. DBB improves ConvNets on image classification (up to 1.9% higher top-1 accuracy on ImageNet), object detection and semantic segmentation.

In this work, we propose a novel latitude adaptive upscaling network (LAU-Net) for ODI super-resolution, which allows pixels at different latitudes to adopt distinct upscaling factors. Specifically, we introduce a Laplacian multi-level separation architecture to split an ODI into different latitude bands, and hierarchically upscale them with different factors. In addition, we propose a deep reinforcement learning scheme with a latitude adaptive reward, in order to automatically select optimal upscaling factors for different latitude bands.

Inspired by the great success of pre-training transformers in natural language processing, we propose a pretext task named random query patch detection to Unsupervisedly Pre-train DETR (UP-DETR) for object detection. Specifically, we randomly crop patches from the given image and then feed them as queries to the decoder. The model is pre-trained to detect these query patches from the original image. During the pre-training, we address two critical issues: multi-task learning and multi-query localization. (1) To trade off classification and localization preferences in the pretext task, we freeze the CNN backbone and propose a patch feature reconstruction branch which is jointly optimized with patch detection. (2) To perform multi-query localization, we introduce UP-DETR from single-query patch and extend it to multi-query patches with object query shuffle and attention mask. In our experiments, UP-DETR significantly boosts the performance of DETR with faster convergence and higher average precision on object detection, one-shot detection and panoptic segmentation.

However, most methods ignore the gap between natural images and scene text images and directly apply ImageNet for pre-training. To address such a problem, some of them firstly pre-train the model using a large amount of synthetic data and then fine-tune it on target datasets, which is task-specific and has limited generalization capability. In this paper, we focus on providing general pre-trained models for text detectors. Considering the importance of exploring text contents for text detection, we propose STKM (Self-attention based Text Knowledge Mining), which consists of a CNN Encoder and a Self-attention Decoder, to learn general prior knowledge for text detection from SynthText. Given only image level text labels, Self-attention Decoder directly decodes features extracted from CNN Encoder to texts without requirement of detection, which guides the CNN backbone to explicitly learn discriminative semantic representations ignored by previous approaches. After that, the text knowledge learned by the backbone can be transferred to various text detectors to significantly improve their detection performance (e.g., 5.89% higher F-measure for EAST on ICDAR15 dataset) without bells and whistles.

    "abstract": "While deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved great success on image de-raining task, most existing methods can only learn fixed mapping rules between paired rainy/clean images on a single dataset. This limits their applications in practical situations with multiple and incremental datasets where the mapping rules may change for different types of rain streaks. However, the catastrophic forgetting of traditional deep CNN model challenges the design of generalized framework for multiple and incremental datasets. A strategy of sharing the network structure but independently updating and storing the network parameters on each dataset has been developed as a potential solution. Nevertheless, this strategy is not applicable to compact systems as it dramatically increases the overall training time and parameter space. To alleviate such limitation, in this study, we propose a parameter importance guided weights modification approach, named PIGWM. Specifically, with new dataset (e.g. new rain dataset), the well-trained network weights are updated according to their importance evaluated on previous training dataset. With extensive experimental validation, we demonstrate that a single network with a single parameter set of our proposed method can process multiple rain datasets almost without performance degradation. The proposed model is capable of achieving superior performance on both inhomogeneous and incremental datasets, and is promising for highly compact systems to gradually learn myriad regularities of the different types of rain streaks.

The approach introduces angular and amplitude angular error loss functions to increase detector capacity. At each layer, it exploits a differentiable binarization search (DBS) to minimize the angular error in a student-teacher framework.

However, generalizing vision-based RL policy to unknown test environments still remains as a challenging problem. Unlike previous works that focus on training a universal RL policy that is invariant to discrepancies between test and training environment, we focus on developing an independent module to disperse interference factors irrelevant to the task, thereby providing \"\"clean\"\" observations for the RL policy. The proposed unsupervised visual attention and invariance method (VAI) contains three key components: 1) an unsupervised keypoint detection model which captures semantically meaningful keypoints in observations; 2) an unsupervised visual attention module which automatically generates the distraction-invariant attention mask for each observation; 3) a self-supervised adapter for visual distraction invariance which reconstructs distraction-invariant attention mask from observations with artificial disturbances generated by a series of foreground and background augmentations. All components are optimized in an unsupervised way, without manual annotation or access to environment internals, and only the adapter is used during inference time to provide distraction-free observations to RL policy. VAI empirically shows powerful generalization capabilities and significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) method by 15% 49% in DeepMind Control suite benchmark and 61% 229% in our proposed robot manipulation benchmark, in term of cumulative rewards per episode",

Recent smartphones can record a video in 8K resolution, but many of the existing face detectors still fail due to the anchor size and training data. We analyze the failure cases and observe a large number of correct predicted boxes with incorrect confidences. To calibrate these confidences, we propose a confidence ranking network with a pairwise ranking loss to re-rank the predicted confidences locally within the same image. Our confidence ranker is model-agnostic, so we can augment the data by choosing the pairs from multiple face detectors during the training, and generalize to a wide range of face detectors during the testing. On WiderFace, we achieve the highest AP on the single-scale, and our AP is competitive with the previous multi-scale methods while being significantly faster. On 8K resolution, our method solves the GPU memory issue and allows us to indirectly train on 8K. We collect 8K resolution test set to show the improvement, and we will release our test set as a new benchmark for future research",

This paper proposes the first Megapixel level method for one shot Face Swapping (or MegaFS for short). Firstly, MegaFS organizes face representation hierarchically by the proposed Hierarchical Representation Face Encoder (HieRFE) in an extended latent space to maintain more facial details, rather than compressed representation in previous face swapping methods. Secondly, a carefully designed Face Transfer Module (FTM) is proposed to transfer the identity from a source image to the target by a non-linear trajectory without explicit feature disentanglement. Finally, the swapped faces can be synthesized by StyleGAN2 with the benefits of its training stability and powerful generative capability. Each part of MegaFS can be trained separately so the requirement of our model for GPU memory can be satisfied for megapixel face swapping. In summary, complete face representation, stable training, and limited memory usage are the three novel contributions to the success of our method. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of MegaFS and the first megapixel level face swapping database is released for research on DeepFake detection and face image editing in the public domain",

    "abstract": "DNN-based frame interpolation--that generates the intermediate frames given two consecutive frames--typically relies on heavy model architectures with a huge number of features, preventing them from being deployed on systems with limited resources, e.g., mobile devices. We propose a compression-driven network design for frame interpolation (CDFI), that leverages model pruning through sparsity-inducing optimization to significantly reduce the model size while achieving superior performance. Concretely, we first compress the recently proposed AdaCoF model and show that a 10X compressed AdaCoF performs similarly as its original counterpart; then we further improve this compressed model by introducing a multi-resolution warping module, which boosts visual consistencies with multi-level details. As a consequence, we achieve a significant performance gain with only a quarter in size compared with the original AdaCoF. Moreover, our model performs favorably against other state-of-the-arts in a broad range of datasets. Finally, the proposed compression-driven framework is generic and can be easily transferred to other DNN-based frame interpolation algorithm.

    "abstract": "We introduce Position Adaptive Convolution (PAConv), a generic convolution operation for 3D point cloud processing. The key of PAConv is to construct the convolution kernel by dynamically assembling basic weight matrices stored in Weight Bank, where the coefficients of these weight matrices are self-adaptively learned from point positions through ScoreNet. In this way, the kernel is built in a data-driven manner, endowing PAConv with more flexibility than 2D convolutions to better handle the irregular and unordered point cloud data. Besides, the complexity of the learning process is reduced by combining weight matrices instead of brutally predicting kernels from point positions. Furthermore, different from the existing point convolution operators whose network architectures are often heavily engineered, we integrate our PAConv into classical MLP-based point cloud pipelines without changing network configurations. Even built on simple networks, our method still approaches or even surpasses the state-of-the-art models, and significantly improves baseline performance on both classification and segmentation tasks, yet with decent efficiency.

Thus, candidate relative poses can be recovered from paths in the partly-built pose-graph. We propose a heuristic for the A* traversal, considering global similarity of images and the quality of the pose-graph edges. Given a relative pose from a path, descriptor-based feature matching is made \"light-weight\" by exploiting the known epipolar geometry. To speed up PROSAC-based sampling when RANSAC is applied, we propose a third method to order the correspondences by their inlier probabilities from previous estimations.

We propose to add a simple yet effective feature calibration scheme into the centering and scaling operations of BatchNorm, enhancing the instance-specific representations with the negligible computational cost. The centering calibration strengthens informative features and reduces noisy features. The scaling calibration restricts the feature intensity to form a more stable feature distribution.

Prior work uses the classification score or a combination of classification and predicted localization scores to rank candidates. However, neither option results in a reliable ranking, thus degrading detection performance. In this paper, we propose to learn an Iou-Aware Classification Score (IACS) as a joint representation of object presence confidence and localization accuracy. We show that dense object detectors can achieve a more accurate ranking of candidate detections based on the IACS. We design a new loss function, named Varifocal Loss, to train a dense object detector to predict the IACS, and propose a new star-shaped bounding box feature representation for IACS prediction and bounding box refinement. Combining these two new components and a bounding box refinement branch, we build an IoU-aware dense object detector based on the FCOS+ATSS architecture, that we call VarifocalNet or VFNet for short. Extensive experiments on MS COCO show that our VFNet consistently surpasses the strong baseline by 2.0 AP with different backbones. Our best model VFNet-X-1200 with Res2Net-101-DCN achieves a single-model single-scale AP of 55.1 on COCO test-dev, which is state-of-the-art among various object detectors.

We find that background regions are perceptually consistent in part within an image, and this can be leveraged to discriminate foreground and background regions inside object bounding boxes. To implement this idea, we propose a novel pooling method, dubbed background-aware pooling (BAP), that focuses more on aggregating foreground features inside the bounding boxes using attention maps. This allows to extract high-quality pseudo segmentation labels to train CNNs for semantic segmentation, but the labels still contain noise especially at object boundaries. To address this problem, we also introduce a noise-aware loss (NAL) that makes the networks less susceptible to incorrect labels.

Recent works have focused on an abstract reasoning task of this kind---Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM). Despite the encouraging progress on RPM that achieves human-level performance in terms of accuracy, modern approaches have neither a treatment of human-like reasoning on generalization, nor a potential to generate answers. To fill in this gap, we propose a neuro-symbolic Probabilistic Abduction and Execution (PrAE) learner; central to the PrAE learner is the process of probabilistic abduction and execution on a probabilistic scene representation, akin to the mental manipulation of objects. Specifically, we disentangle perception and reasoning from a monolithic model. The neural visual perception frontend predicts objects' attributes, later aggregated by a scene inference engine to produce a probabilistic scene representation. In the symbolic logical reasoning backend, the PrAE learner uses the representation to abduce the hidden rules. An answer is predicted by executing the rules on the probabilistic representation. The entire system is trained end-to-end in an analysis-by-synthesis manner without any visual attribute annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the PrAE learner improves cross-configuration generalization and is capable of rendering an answer, in contrast to prior works that merely make a categorical choice from candidates",

Inspired by this, we propose to reduce the intrinsic style bias of CNNs to close the gap between domains. Our Style-Agnostic Networks (SagNets) disentangle style encodings from class categories to prevent style biased predictions and focus more on the contents.

To address these problems, we propose a novel local-to-local matching solution for semi-supervised VOS, namely Regional Memory Network (RMNet). In RMNet, the precise regional memory is constructed by memorizing local regions where the target objects appear in the past frames. For the current query frame, the query regions are tracked and predicted based on the optical flow estimated from the previous frame. The proposed local-to-local matching effectively eliminates the ambiguity of similar objects in both memory and query frames, which allows the information to be passed from the regional memory to the query region efficiently and effectively.

Using IMUs attached at the body limbs and a head mounted camera looking outwards, HPS fuses camera based self-localization with IMU-based human body tracking. The former provides drift-free but noisy position and orientation estimates while the latter is accurate in the short-term but subject to drift over longer periods of time. We show that our optimization-based integration exploits the benefits of the two, resulting in pose accuracy free of drift. Furthermore, we integrate 3D scene constraints into our optimization, such as foot contact with the ground, resulting in physically plausible motion. HPS complements more common third-person-based 3D pose estimation methods. It allows capturing larger recording volumes and longer periods of motion, and could be used for VR/AR applications where humans interact with the scene without requiring direct line of sight with an external camera, or to train agents that navigate and interact with the environment based on first-person visual input, like real humans.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Few-shot object detection is an imperative and long-lasting problem due to the inherent long-tail distribution of real-world data. Its performance is largely affected by the data scarcity of novel classes. But the semantic relation between the novel classes and the base classes is constant regardless of the data availability. In this work, we investigate utilizing this semantic relation together with the visual information and introduce explicit relation reasoning into the learning of novel object detection. Specifically, we represent each class concept by a semantic embedding learned from a large corpus of text. The detector is trained to project the image representations of objects into this embedding space. We also identify the problems of trivially using the raw embeddings with a heuristic knowledge graph and propose to augment the embeddings with a dynamic relation graph. As a result, our few-shot detector, termed SRR-FSD, is robust and stable to the variation of shots of novel objects. Experiments show that SRR-FSD can achieve competitive results at higher shots, and more importantly, a significantly better performance given both lower explicit and implicit shots. The benchmark protocol with implicit shots removed from the pretrained classification dataset can serve as a more realistic setting for future research",

    "title": "Online Multiple Object Tracking With Cross-Task Synergy",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Modern online multiple object tracking (MOT) methods usually focus on two directions to improve tracking performance. One is to predict new positions in an incoming frame based on tracking information from previous frames, and the other is to enhance data association by generating more discriminative identity embeddings. Some works combined both directions within one framework but handled them as two individual tasks, thus gaining little mutual benefits. In this paper, we propose a novel unified model with synergy between position prediction and embedding association. The two tasks are linked by temporal-aware target attention and distractor attention, as well as identity-aware memory aggregation model. Specifically, the attention modules can make the prediction focus more on targets and less on distractors, therefore more reliable embeddings can be extracted accordingly for association. On the other hand, such reliable embeddings can boost identity-awareness through memory aggregation, hence strengthen attention modules and suppress drifts. In this way, the synergy between position prediction and embedding association is achieved, which leads to strong robustness to occlusions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model over a wide range of existing methods on MOTChallenge benchmarks.

Recent work has shown that it is possible to learn a unified dense pose predictor for several categories of related objects. However, training such models requires to initialize inter-category correspondences by hand. This is suboptimal and the resulting models fail to maintain correct correspondences as individual categories are learned. In this paper, we show that improved correspondences can be learned automatically as a natural byproduct of learning category-specific dense pose predictors. To do this, we express correspondences between different categories and between images and categories using a unified embedding. Then, we use the latter to enforce two constraints: symmetric inter-category cycle consistency and a new asymmetric image-to-category cycle consistency. Without any manual annotations for the inter-category correspondences, we obtain state-of-the-art alignment results, outperforming dedicated methods for matching 3D shapes. Moreover, the new model is also better at the task of dense pose prediction than prior work",

Since each human body part is unique, it is infeasible to restore the missing part by borrowing textures from other visible regions. Thus, we propose two types of learned priors to compensate for the damaged region. One is a structure prior, it uses a human parsing map to represent the human body structure. The other is a structure-texture correlation prior. It learns a structure and a texture memory bank, which encodes the common body structures and texture patterns, respectively. With the aid of these memory banks, the model could utilize the visible pattern to query and fetch a similar structure and texture pattern to introduce additional reasonable structures and textures for the corrupted region. Besides, since multiple potential human shapes are underlying the corrupted region, we propose multi-scale structure discriminators to further restore a plausible topological structure.

The pruning objective --- selecting the smallest group of neurons for which the response remains equivalent to the original network --- has been previously proposed for identifying critical pathways. We demonstrate that sparse pathways derived from pruning do not necessarily encode critical input information. To ensure sparse pathways include critical fragments of the encoded input information, we propose pathway selection via neurons' contribution to the response. We proceed to explain how critical pathways can reveal critical input features. We prove that pathways selected via neuron contribution are locally linear (in an L2-ball), a property that we use for proposing a feature attribution method: \"pathway gradient\". We validate our interpretation method using mainstream evaluation experiments. The validation of pathway gradient interpretation method further confirms that selected pathways using neuron contributions correspond to critical input features. The code is publicly available",

Surprisingly, however, this stylization quality is not robust and often degrades significantly when applied to features from more advanced and lightweight networks, such as those in the ResNet family. By performing extensive experiments with different network architectures, we find that residual connections, which represent the main architectural difference between VGG and ResNet, produce feature maps of small entropy, which are not suitable for style transfer. To improve the robustness of the ResNet architecture, we then propose a simple yet effective solution based on a softmax transformation of the feature activations that enhances their entropy. Experimental results demonstrate that this small magic can greatly improve the quality of stylization results, even for networks with random weights. This suggests that the architecture used for feature extraction is more important than the use of learned weights for the task of style transfer",

    "abstract": "Emerging interests have been brought to recognize previously unseen objects given very few training examples, known as few-shot object detection (FSOD). Recent researches demonstrate that good feature embedding is the key to reach favorable few-shot learning performance. We observe object proposals with different Intersection-of-Union (IoU) scores are analogous to the intra-image augmentation used in contrastive visual representation learning. And we exploit this analogy and incorporate supervised contrastive learning to achieve more robust objects representations in FSOD. We present Few-Shot object detection via Contrastive proposals Encoding (FSCE), a simple yet effective approach to learning contrastive-aware object proposal encodings that facilitate the classification of detected objects. We notice the degradation of average precision (AP) for rare objects mainly comes from misclassifying novel instances as confusable classes. And we ease the misclassification issues by promoting instance level intra-class compactness and inter-class variance via our contrastive proposal encoding loss (CPE loss). Our design outperforms current state-of-the-art works in any shot and all data splits, with up to +8.8% on standard benchmark PASCAL VOC and +2.7% on challenging COCO benchmark.

    "abstract": "Face recognition models trained under the assumption of identical training and test distributions often suffer from poor generalization when faced with unknown variations, such as a novel ethnicity or unpredictable individual make-ups during test time. In this paper, we introduce a novel cross-domain metric learning loss, which we dub Cross-Domain Triplet (CDT) loss, to improve face recognition in unseen domains. The CDT loss encourages learning semantically meaningful features by enforcing compact feature clusters of identities from one domain, where the compactness is measured by underlying similarity metrics that belong to another training domain with different statistics. Intuitively, it discriminatively correlates explicit metrics derived from one domain, with triplet samples from another domain in a unified loss function to be minimized within a network, which leads to better alignment of the training domains. The network parameters are further enforced to learn generalized features under domain shift, in a model-agnostic learning pipeline.

    "abstract": "It is well acknowledged that person re-identification (person ReID) highly relies on visual texture information like clothing. Despite significant progress has been made in recent years, texture-confusing situations like clothing changing and persons wearing the same clothes receive little attention from most existing ReID methods. In this paper, rather than relying on texture based information, we propose to improve the robustness of person ReID against clothing texture by exploiting the information of a person's 3D shape. Existing shape learning schemas for person ReID either ignore the 3D information of a person, or require extra physical devices to collect 3D source data. Differently, we propose a novel ReID learning framework that directly extracts a texture-insensitive 3D shape embedding from a 2D image by adding 3D body reconstruction as an auxiliary task and regularization, called 3D Shape Learning (3DSL). The 3D reconstruction based regularization forces the ReID model to decouple the 3D shape information from the visual texture, and acquire discriminative 3D shape ReID features. To solve the problem of lacking 3D ground truth, we design an adversarial self-supervised projection (ASSP) model, performing 3D reconstruction without ground truth. Extensive experiments on common ReID datasets and texture-confusing datasets validate the effectiveness of our model",

    "abstract": "Recently, deep face recognition has achieved significant progress because of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and large-scale datasets. However, training CNNs on a large-scale face recognition dataset with limited computational resources is still a challenge. This is because the classification paradigm needs to train a fully connected layer as the category classifier, and its parameters will be in the hundreds of millions if the training dataset contains millions of identities. This requires many computational resources, such as GPU memory. The metric learning paradigm is an economical computation method, but its performance is greatly inferior to that of the classification paradigm. To address this challenge, we propose a simple but effective CNN layer called the Virtual fully connected (Virtual FC) layer to reduce the computational consumption of the classification paradigm. Without bells and whistles, the proposed Virtual FC reduces the parameters by more than 100 times with respect to the fully connected layer and achieves competitive performance on mainstream face recognition evaluation datasets. Moreover, the performance of our Virtual FC layer on the evaluation datasets is superior to that of the metric learning paradigm by a significant margin.

Third, we propose an efficient one-shot search method to find the optimal path aggregation architecture, that is, we first train a super-net and then find the optimal candidate with an evolutionary algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed OPANAS for object detection: (1) OPANAS is more efficient than state-of-the-art methods (e.g., NAS-FPN and Auto-FPN), at significantly smaller searching cost (e.g., only 4 GPU days on MS-COCO); (2) the optimal architecture found by OPANAS significantly improves main-stream detectors including RetinaNet, Faster R-CNN and Cascade R-CNN, by 2.3 3.2 % mAP comparing to their FPN counterparts; and (3) a new state-of-the-art accuracy-speed trade-off (52.2 % mAP at 7.6 FPS) at smaller training costs than comparable state-of-the-arts",

We propose a novel compositional 3D representation that combines the best of previous methods to produce both higher-resolution and faster results. Our representation bridges the gap between discrete and continuous volumetric representations by combining a coarse 3D-structure-aware grid of animation codes with a continuous learned scene function that maps every position and its corresponding local animation code to its view-dependent emitted radiance and local volume density. Differentiable volume rendering is employed to compute photo-realistic novel views of the human head and upper body as well as to train our novel representation end-to-end using only 2D supervision. In addition, we show that the learned dynamic radiance field can be used to synthesize novel unseen expressions based on a global animation code.

    "abstract": "Person re-identification (Re-ID) is to retrieve a particular person captured by different cameras, which is of great significance for security surveillance and pedestrian behavior analysis. However, due to the large intra-class variation of a person across cameras, e.g., occlusions, illuminations, viewpoints, and poses, Re-ID is still a challenging task in the field of computer vision. In this paper, to attack the issues concerning with intra-class variation, we propose a coarse-to-fine Re-ID framework with the incorporation of auxiliary-domain classification (ADC) and second-order information bottleneck (2O-IB). In particular, as an auxiliary task, ADC is introduced to extract the coarse-grained essential features to distinguish a person from miscellaneous backgrounds, which leads to the effective coarse- and fine-grained feature representations for Re-ID. On the other hand, to cope with the redundancy, irrelevance, and noise contained in the Re-ID features caused by intra-class variations, we integrate 2O-IB into the network to compress and optimize the features, without increasing additional computation overhead during inference. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly reduces the neural network output variance of intra-class person images and achieves the superior performance to state-of-the-art methods",

    "abstract": "Correlation acts as a critical role in the tracking field, especially in recent popular Siamese-based trackers. The correlation operation is a simple fusion manner to consider the similarity between the template and the search region. However, the correlation operation itself is a local linear matching process, leading to lose semantic information and fall into local optimum easily, which may be the bottleneck of designing high-accuracy tracking algorithms. Is there any better feature fusion method than correlation? To address this issue, inspired by Transformer, this work presents a novel attention-based feature fusion network, which effectively combines the template and search region features solely using attention. Specifically, the proposed method includes an ego-context augment module based on self-attention and a cross-feature augment module based on cross-attention. Finally, we present a Transformer tracking (named TransT) method based on the Siamese-like feature extraction backbone, the designed attention-based fusion mechanism, and the classification and regression head. Experiments show that our TransT achieves very promising results on six challenging datasets, especially on large-scale LaSOT, TrackingNet, and GOT-10k benchmarks.

Existing works interact the query with either video frame or moment proposal, and neglect the inherent structure of moment construction for both cross-modal understanding and video content comprehension, which are the two crucial challenges for this task. In this paper, we disentangle the activity moment into boundary and content. Based on the explored moment structure, we propose a novel Structured Multi-level Interaction Network (SMIN) to tackle this problem through multi-levels of cross-modal interaction coupled with content-boundary-moment interaction. In particular, for cross-modal interaction, we interact the sentence-level query with the whole moment while interact the word-level query with content and boundary, as in a coarse-to-fine manner. For content-boundary-moment interaction, we capture the insightful relations between boundary, content, and the whole moment proposal. Through multi-level interactions, the model obtains robust cross-modal representation for accurate moment localization.

    "abstract": "Recently, numerous algorithms have been developed to tackle the problem of vision-language navigation (VLN), i.e., entailing an agent to navigate 3D environments through following linguistic instructions. However, current VLN agents simply store their past experiences/observations as latent states in recurrent networks, failing to capture environment layouts and make long-term planning. To address these limitations, we propose a crucial architecture, called Structured Scene Memory (SSM). It is compartmentalized enough to accurately memorize the percepts during navigation. It also serves as a structured scene representation, which captures and disentangles visual and geometric cues in the environment. SSM has a collect-read controller that adaptively collects information for supporting current decision making and mimics iterative algorithms for long-range reasoning. As SSM provides a complete action space, i.e., all the navigable places on the map, a frontier-exploration based navigation decision making strategy is introduced to enable efficient and global planning. Experiment results on two VLN datasets (i.e., R2R and R4R) show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on several metrics",

This is to address the problem that all existing person Re-ID datasets are all of limited scale due to the costly effort required for data annotation. Previous research tries to leverage models pre-trained on ImageNet to mitigate the shortage of person Re-ID data but suffers from the large domain gap between ImageNet and person Re-ID data. LUPerson is an unlabeled dataset of 4M images of over 200K identities, which is 30xlarger than the largest existing Re-ID dataset. It also covers a much diverse range of capturing environments (e.g., camera settings, scenes, etc.). Based on this dataset, we systematically study the key factors for learning Re-ID features from two perspectives: data augmentation and contrastive loss. Unsupervised pre-training performed on this large-scale dataset effectively leads to a generic Re-ID feature that can benefit all existing person Re-ID methods. Using our pre-trained model in some basic frameworks, our methods achieve state-of-the-art results without bells and whistles on four widely used Re-ID datasets: CUHK03, Market1501, DukeMTMC, and MSMT17.

    "abstract": "Domain adaptation methods face performance degradation in object detection, as the complexity of tasks require more about the transferability of the model. We propose a new perspective on how CNN models gain the transferability, viewing the weights of a model as a series of motion patterns. The directions of weights, and the gradients, can be divided into domain-specific and domain-invariant parts, and the goal of domain adaptation is to concentrate on the domain-invariant direction while eliminating the disturbance from domain-specific one. Current UDA object detection methods view the two directions as a whole while optimizing, which will cause domain-invariant direction mismatch even if the output features are perfectly aligned. In this paper, we propose the domain-specific suppression, an exemplary and generalizable constraint to the original convolution gradients in backpropagation to detach the two parts of directions and suppress the domain-specific one. We further validate our theoretical analysis and methods on several domain adaptive object detection tasks, including weather, camera configuration, and synthetic to real-world adaptation. Our experiment results show significant advance over the state-of-the-art methods in the UDA object detection field, performing a promotion of 10.2 12.2% mAP on all these domain adaptation scenarios",

The failure modes of FSOD are investigated that the performance degradation is mainly due to the classification incapability (false positives), which motivates us to address it from a novel aspect of hard example mining. Specifically, to address the intrinsic architecture limitation of common detectors under low-data constraint, we introduce a novel few-shot classification refinement mechanism where a decoupled Few-Shot Classification Network (FSCN) is employed to improve the classification. Moreover, we specially probe a commonly-overlooked but destructive issue of FSOD, i.e., the presence of distractor samples due to the incomplete annotations where images from base set may contain novel-class objects but remain unlabelled. Retreatment solutions are developed to eliminate the incurred false positives. For FSCN training, the distractor is formulated as a semi-supervised problem, where a distractor utilization loss is proposed to make proper use of it for boosting the data-scarce classes; while a Self-Supervised Dataset Pruning (SSDP) technique is developed to facilitate the few-shot adaptation of base detector.

The base decoder uses the global features to reconstruct a coarse implicit field, while the detail decoder reconstructs, from the local features, two displacement maps, defined over the front and back sides of the captured object.

Recently, generative adversarial networks along with the encoder-decoder architecture have been utilized for this task owing to their ability to create realistic images. However, the existing methods for the unpaired dataset cannot still preserve the attribute-irrelevant regions properly due to the absence of the ground truth image. This work proposes a novel, intuitive loss function called the CAM-consistency loss, which improves the consistency of an input image in image translation. While the existing cycle-consistency loss ensures that the image can be translated back, our approach makes the model further preserve the attribute-irrelevant regions even in a single translation to another domain by using the Grad-CAM output computed from the discriminator. Our CAM-consistency loss directly optimizes such a Grad-CAM output from the discriminator during training, in order to properly capture which local regions the generator should change while keeping the other regions unchanged. In this manner, our approach allows the generator and the discriminator to collaborate with each other to improve the image translation quality. In our experiments, we validate the effectiveness and versatility of our proposed CAM-consistency loss by applying it to several representative models for facial image editing, such as StarGAN, AttGAN, and STGAN",

    "abstract": "Generating and representing human behavior are of major importance for various computer vision applications. Commonly, human video synthesis represents behavior as sequences of postures while directly predicting their likely progressions or merely changing the appearance of the depicted persons, thus not being able to exercise control over their actual behavior during the synthesis process. In contrast, controlled behavior synthesis and transfer across individuals requires a deep understanding of body dynamics and calls for a representation of behavior that is independent of appearance and also of specific postures. In this work, we present a model for human behavior synthesis which learns a dedicated representation of human dynamics independent of postures. Using this representation, we are able to change the behavior of a person depicted in an arbitrary posture, or to even directly transfer behavior observed in a given video sequence. To this end, we propose a conditional variational framework which explicitly disentangles posture from behavior.

Then, based on the user annotations, a segmentation algorithm refines the masks. The previous interactive VOS paradigm selects the frame with some worst evaluation metric, and the ground truth is required for calculating the evaluation metric, which is impractical in the testing phase. In contrast, in this paper, we advocate that the frame with the worst evaluation metric may not be exactly the most valuable frame that leads to the most performance improvement across the video. Thus, we formulate the frame selection problem in the interactive VOS as a Markov Decision Process, where an agent is learned to recommend the frame under a deep reinforcement learning framework. The learned agent can automatically determine the most valuable frame, making the interactive setting more practical in the wild.

Many methods have been proposed to search for high-performance neural architectures automatically. However, these searched architectures are prone to adversarial attacks.

To address this problem, we propose methods to perform differentiable searches of robust neural architectures. In our methods, two differentiable metrics are defined to measure architectures' robustness, based on certified lower bound and Jacobian norm bound. Then we search for robust architectures by maximizing the robustness metrics. Different from previous approaches which aim to improve architectures' robustness in an implicit way: performing adversarial training and injecting random noise, our methods explicitly and directly maximize robustness metrics to harvest robust architectures. On CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and MNIST, we perform game-based evaluation and verification-based evaluation on the robustness of our methods.

Compared to general scenarios of 3D pose estimation from a single view, the mirror reflection provides an additional view for resolving the depth ambiguity. We develop an optimization-based approach that exploits mirror symmetry constraints for accurate 3D pose reconstruction. We also provide a method to estimate the surface normal of the mirror from vanishing points in the single image. To validate the proposed approach, we collect a large-scale dataset named Mirrored-Human, which covers a large variety of human subjects, poses and backgrounds. The experiments demonstrate that, when trained on Mirrored-Human with our reconstructed 3D poses as pseudo ground-truth, the accuracy and generalizability of existing single-view 3D pose estimators can be largely improved",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The recently invented retina-inspired spike camera has shown great potential for capturing dynamic scenes. Different from the conventional digital cameras that compact the photoelectric information within the exposure interval into a single snapshot, the spike camera produces a continuous spike stream to record the dynamic light intensity variation process. For spike cameras, image reconstruction remains an important and challenging issue. To this end, this paper develops a spike-to-image neural network (Spk2ImgNet) to reconstruct the dynamic scene from the continuous spike stream. In particular, to handle the challenges brought by both noise and high-speed motion, we propose a hierarchical architecture to exploit the temporal correlation of the spike stream progressively. Firstly, a spatially adaptive light inference subnet is proposed to exploit the local temporal correlation, producing basic light intensity estimates of different moments. Then, a pyramid deformable alignment is utilized to align the intermediate features such that the feature fusion module can exploit the long-term temporal correlation, while avoiding undesired motion blur. In addition, to train the network, we simulate the working mechanism of spike camera to generate a large-scale spike dataset composed of spike streams and corresponding ground truth images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network evidently outperforms the state-of-the-art spike camera reconstruction methods",

Recent advances in 6DoF pose estimation have shown that predicting dense 2D-3D correspondence maps between image and object 3D model and then estimating object pose via Perspective-n-Point (PnP) algorithm can achieve remarkable localization accuracy. Yet these methods rely on training with ground truth of object geometry, which is difficult to acquire in real outdoor scenes. To address this issue, we propose MonoRUn, a novel detection framework that learns dense correspondences and geometry in a self-supervised manner, with simple 3D bounding box annotations. To regress the pixel-related 3D object coordinates, we employ a regional reconstruction network with uncertainty awareness. For self-supervised training, the predicted 3D coordinates are projected back to the image plane. A Robust KL loss is proposed to minimize the uncertainty-weighted reprojection error. During testing phase, we exploit the network uncertainty by propagating it through all downstream modules. More specifically, the uncertainty-driven PnP algorithm is leveraged to estimate object pose and its covariance.

In this paper, we make contributions to boost the study of GMOT in three aspects. First, we construct the first publicly available dense GMOT dataset, dubbed GMOT-40, which contains 40 carefully annotated sequences evenly distributed among 10 object categories. In addition, two tracking protocols are adopted to evaluate different characteristics of tracking algorithms. Second, by noting the lack of devoted tracking algorithms, we have designed a series of baseline GMOT algorithms. Third, we perform thorough evaluations on GMOT-40, involving popular MOT algorithms (with necessary modifications) and the proposed baselines.

In contrast, we propose Hierarchical Lovasz Embeddings, per pixel feature vectors that simultaneously encode instance- and category-level discriminative information. We use a hierarchical Lovasz hinge loss to learn a low-dimensional embedding space structured into a unified semantic and instance hierarchy without requiring separate network branches or object proposals. Besides modeling instances precisely in a proposal-free manner, our Hierarchical Lovasz Embeddings generalize to categories by using a simple Nearest-Class-Mean classifier, including for non-instance \"\"stuff\"\" classes where instance segmentation methods are not applicable.

Some recent works have shown that learning implicit neural representations of 3D scenes achieves remarkable view synthesis quality given dense input views. However, the representation learning will be ill-posed if the views are highly sparse. To solve this ill-posed problem, our key idea is to integrate observations over video frames. To this end, we propose Neural Body, a new human body representation which assumes that the learned neural representations at different frames share the same set of latent codes anchored to a deformable mesh, so that the observations across frames can be naturally integrated. The deformable mesh also provides geometric guidance for the network to learn 3D representations more efficiently. Experiments on a newly collected multi-view dataset show that our approach outperforms prior works by a large margin in terms of the novel view synthesis quality.

However, most previous methods only used the limited information of RGB images and cannot well discover potential pedestrians in unconstrained scenarios. In this work, we find that incorporating optical and thermal information can greatly help to recognize pedestrians. To promote future researches in this field, we introduce a large-scale RGBT Crowd Counting (RGBT-CC) benchmark, which contains 2,030 pairs of RGB-thermal images with 138,389 annotated people. Furthermore, to facilitate the multimodal crowd counting, we propose a cross-modal collaborative representation learning framework, which consists of multiple modality-specific branches, a modality-shared branch, and an Information Aggregation-Distribution Module (IADM) to capture the complementary information of different modalities fully. Specifically, our IADM incorporates two collaborative information transfers to dynamically enhance the modality-shared and modality-specific representations with a dual information propagation mechanism. Extensive experiments conducted on the RGBT-CC benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework for RGBT crowd counting. Moreover, the proposed approach is universal for multimodal crowd counting and is also capable to achieve superior performance on the ShanghaiTechRGBD dataset.

Given a trained classification model, the proposed VRX extracts relevant class-specific visual concepts and organizes them using structural concept graphs (SCG) based on pairwise concept relationships. By means of knowledge distillation, we show VRX can take a step towards mimicking the reasoning process of NNs and provide logical, concept-level explanations for final model decisions. With extensive experiments, we empirically show VRX can meaningfully answer \"why\" and \"why not\" questions about the prediction, providing easy-to-understand insights about the reasoning process.

These selected anchor pairs are then used to align spectral features (or other appropriate global features) whose dimension adaptively matches the capacity of the selected anchor pairs. Thanks to the effective combination of complementary information in a data-adaptive way, DIR is not only efficient but also robust to render accurate results within a few iterations. By choosing appropriate dual features, DIR has the flexibility to handle patch and partial matching as well. Extensive experiments on various data sets demonstrate the superiority of DIR over other state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency",

In this paper, we investigate their combinations and propose a novel Non-Local Sparse Attention (NLSA) with dynamic sparse attention pattern. NLSA is designed to retain long-range modeling capability from NL operation while enjoying robustness and high-efficiency of sparse representation. Specifically, NLSA rectifies NL attention with spherical locality sensitive hashing (LSH) that partitions the input space into hash buckets of related features. For every query signal, NLSA assigns a bucket to it and only computes attention within the bucket. The resulting sparse attention prevents the model from attending to locations that are noisy and less-informative, while reducing the computational cost from quadratic to asymptotic linear with respect to the spatial size. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and efficiency of NLSA. With a few non-local sparse attention modules, our architecture, called non-local sparse network (NLSN), reaches state-of-the-art performance for SISR quantitatively and qualitatively",

    "abstract": "Video stabilization is an essential component of visual quality enhancement. Early methods rely on feature tracking to recover either 2D or 3D frame motion, which suffer from the robustness of local feature extraction and tracking in shaky videos. Recently, learning-based methods seek to find frame transformations with high-level information via deep neural networks to overcome the robustness issue of feature tracking. Nevertheless, to our best knowledge, no learning-based methods leverage 3D cues for the transformation inference yet; hence they would lead to artifacts on complex scene-depth scenarios. In this paper, we propose Deep3D Stabilizer, a novel 3D depth-based learning method for video stabilization. We take advantage of the recent self-supervised framework on jointly learning depth and camera ego-motion estimation on raw videos. Our approach requires no data for pre-training but stabilizes the input video via 3D reconstruction directly. The rectification stage incorporates the 3D scene depth and camera motion to smooth the camera trajectory and synthesize the stabilized video. Unlike most one-size-fits-all learning-based methods, our smoothing algorithm allows users to manipulate the stability of a video efficiently. Experimental results on challenging benchmarks show that the proposed solution consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on almost all motion categories",

While state-of-the-art models to predict attention focus on estimating a static probabilistic saliency map with free-viewing behavior, real-life scenarios are filled with tasks of varying types and complexities, and visual exploration is a temporal process that contributes to task performance. To bridge the gap, we conduct a first study to understand and predict the temporal sequences of eye fixations (a.k.a. scanpaths) during performing general tasks, and examine how scanpaths affect task performance. We present a new deep reinforcement learning method to predict scanpaths leading to different performances in visual question answering. Conditioned on a task guidance map, the proposed model learns question-specific attention patterns to generate scanpaths. It addresses the exposure bias in scanpath prediction with self-critical sequence training and designs a Consistency-Divergence loss to generate distinguishable scanpaths between correct and incorrect answers. The proposed model not only accurately predicts the spatio-temporal patterns of human behavior in visual question answering, such as fixation position, duration, and order, but also generalizes to free-viewing and visual search tasks, achieving human-level performance in all tasks and significantly outperforming the state of the art",

    "abstract": "We present SCANimate, an end-to-end trainable framework that takes raw 3D scans of a clothed human and turns them into an animatable avatar. These avatars are driven by pose parameters and have realistic clothing that moves and deforms naturally. SCANimate does not rely on a customized mesh template or surface mesh registration. We observe that fitting a parametric 3D body model, like SMPL, to a clothed human scan is tractable while surface registration of the body topology to the scan is often not, because clothing can deviate significantly from the body shape. We also observe that articulated transformations are invertible, resulting in geometric cycle-consistency in the posed and unposed shapes. These observations lead us to a weakly supervised learning method that aligns scans into a canonical pose by disentangling articulated deformations without template-based surface registration. Furthermore, to complete missing regions in the aligned scans while modeling pose-dependent deformations, we introduce a locally pose-aware implicit function that learns to complete and model geometry with learned pose correctives. In contrast to commonly used global pose embeddings, our local pose conditioning significantly reduces long-range spurious correlations and improves generalization to unseen poses, especially when training data is limited. Our method can be applied to pose-aware appearance modeling to generate a fully textured avatar. We demonstrate our approach on various clothing types with different amounts of training data, outperforming existing solutions and other variants in terms of fidelity and generality in every setting.

One of the approaches is to balance the distribution of binary activations so that the amount of information in the binary activations becomes maximum. Based on extensive analysis, in stark contrast to previous work, we argue that unbalanced activation distribution can actually improve the accuracy of BNNs. We also show that adjusting the threshold values of binary activation functions results in the unbalanced distribution of the binary activation, which increases the accuracy of BNN models. Experimental results show that the accuracy of previous BNN models (e.g. XNOR-Net and Bi-Real-Net) can be improved by simply shifting the threshold values of binary activation functions without requiring any other modification",

A natural remedy is to utilize the 3D voxelization and 3D convolution network. However, we found that in the outdoor point cloud, the improvement obtained in this way is quite limited. An important reason is the property of the outdoor point cloud, namely sparsity and varying density. Motivated by this investigation, we propose a new framework for the outdoor LiDAR segmentation, where cylindrical partition and asymmetrical 3D convolution networks are designed to explore the 3D geometric pattern while maintaining these inherent properties. Moreover, a point-wise refinement module is introduced to alleviate the interference of lossy voxel-based label encoding.

In contrast to existing learning-based approaches that require training specific models for each type of garment, SMPLicit can represent in a unified manner different garment topologies (e.g. from sleeveless tops to hoodies and to open jackets), while controlling other properties like the garment size or tightness/looseness. We show our model to be applicable to a large variety of garments including T-shirts, hoodies, jackets, shorts, pants, skirts, shoes and even hair. The representation flexibility of SMPLicit builds upon an implicit model conditioned with the SMPL human body parameters and a learnable latent space which is semantically interpretable and aligned with the clothing attributes. The proposed model is fully differentiable, allowing for its use into larger end-to-end trainable systems. In the experimental section, we demonstrate SMPLicit can be readily used for fitting 3D scans and for 3D reconstruction in images of dressed people. In both cases we are able to go beyond state of the art, by retrieving complex garment geometries, handling situations with multiple clothing layers and providing a tool for easy outfit editing.

We further propose two regularization terms to ensure disentanglement and smoothness of the learned representations. The resulting pose representations can be used for cross-view action recognition. To evaluate the power of the learned representations, in addition to the conventional fully-supervised action recognition settings, we introduce a novel task called single-shot cross-view action recognition. This task trains models with actions from only one single viewpoint while models are evaluated on poses captured from all possible viewpoints. We evaluate the learned representations on standard benchmarks for action recognition, and show that (i) CV-MIM performs competitively compared with the state-of-the-art models in the fully-supervised scenarios; (ii) CV-MIM outperforms other competing methods by a large margin in the single-shot cross-view setting; (iii) and the learned representations can significantly boost the performance when reducing the amount of supervised training data.

Most prior DA approaches leverage complicated and powerful deep neural networks to improve the adaptation capacity and have shown remarkable success. However, they may have a lack of applicability to real-world situations such as real-time interaction, where low target inference latency is an essential requirement under limited computational budget. In this paper, we tackle the problem by proposing a dynamic domain adaptation (DDA) framework, which can simultaneously achieve efficient target inference in low-resource scenarios and inherit the favorable cross-domain generalization brought by DA. In contrast to static models, as a simple yet generic method, DDA can integrate various domain confusion constraints into any typical adaptive network, where multiple intermediate classifiers can be equipped to infer \"easier\" and \"harder\" target data dynamically. Moreover, we present two novel strategies to further boost the adaptation performance of multiple prediction exits: 1) a confidence score learning strategy to derive accurate target pseudo labels by fully exploring the prediction consistency of different classifiers; 2) a class-balanced self-training strategy to explicitly adapt multi-stage classifiers from source to target without losing prediction diversity. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks are conducted to verify that DDA can consistently improve the adaptation performance and accelerate target inference under domain shift and limited resources scenarios",

    "abstract": "Data augmentation is an effective regularization strategy to alleviate the overfitting, which is an inherent drawback of the deep neural networks. However, data augmentation is rarely considered for point cloud processing despite many studies proposing various augmentation methods for image data. Actually, regularization is essential for point clouds since lack of generality is more likely to occur in point cloud due to small datasets. This paper proposes a Rigid Subset Mix (RSMix), a novel data augmentation method for point clouds that generates a virtual mixed sample by replacing part of the sample with shape-preserved subsets from another sample. RSMix preserves structural information of the point cloud sample by extracting subsets from each sample without deformation using a neighboring function. The neighboring function was carefully designed considering unique properties of point cloud, unordered structure and non-grid. Experiments verified that RSMix successfully regularized the deep neural networks with remarkable improvement for shape classification. We also analyzed various combinations of data augmentations including RSMix with single and multi-view evaluations, based on abundant ablation studies",

First, we introduce the effective voxel-aligned features from a stereo vision-based network to enable depth-aware reconstruction. Moreover, the novel relative z-offset is employed to associate predicted high-fidelity human depth and occupancy inference, which helps restore fine-level surface details. Second, a network structure that fully utilizes the geometry information from the stereo images is designed to improve the human body reconstruction quality. Consequently, our StereoPIFu can naturally infer the human body's spatial location in camera space and maintain the correct relative position of different parts of the human body, which enables our method to capture human performance. Compared with previous works, our StereoPIFu significantly improves the robustness, completeness, and accuracy of the clothed human reconstruction, which is demonstrated by extensive experimental results",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) aims to learn a predictor model for an unlabeled dataset by transferring knowledge from a labeled source data, which has been trained on similar tasks. However, most of these conventional UDA approaches have a strong assumption of having access to the source data during training, which may not be very practical due to privacy, security and storage concerns. A recent line of work addressed this problem and proposed an algorithm that transfers knowledge to the unlabeled target domain only from a single learned source model without requiring access to the source data. However, for adaptation purpose, if there are multiple trained source models available to choose from, this method has to go through adapting each and every model individually, to check for the best source. Thus, we ask the question: can we find the optimal combination of source models, with no source data and without target labels, whose performance is no worse than the single best source? To answer this, we propose a novel and efficient algorithm which automatically combines the source models with suitable weights in such a way that it performs at least as good as the best source model. We provide intuitive theoretical insights to justify our claim. Moreover, extensive experiments are conducted on several benchmark datasets to show the effectiveness of our algorithm, where in most cases, our method not only reaches best source accuracy but also outperform it",

It aims to quickly adapt a model to a given small set of labeled samples while rejecting unseen class samples. Since OSR requires rich data and FSL considers closed-set classification, existing OSR and FSL methods show poor performances in solving FSOSR problems. The previous FSOSR method utilizes pseudo-unseen class samples, which are collected from the other dataset or synthesized samples to model unseen class representations. However, this approach is heavily dependent on the composition of the pseudo samples. In this paper, we propose a novel unknown class sample detector, named SnaTCHer, that does not require pseudo-unseen samples. Based on the transformation consistency, our method measures the difference between the transformed prototypes and a modified prototype set. The modified set is composed by replacing a query feature and its predicted class prototype. SnaTCHer rejects samples with large differences to the transformed prototypes. Our method alters the unseen class distribution estimation problem to a relative feature transformation problem, independent of pseudo-unseen class samples. We investigate our SnaTCHer with various prototype transformation methods and observe that our method consistently improves unseen class sample detection performance without closed-set classification reduction",

    "abstract": "In real-world image enhancement, it is often challenging (if not impossible) to acquire ground-truth data, preventing the adoption of distance metrics for objective quality assessment. As a result, one often resorts to subjective quality assessment, the most straightforward and reliable means of evaluating image enhancement. Conventional subjective testing requires manually pre-selecting a small set of visual examples, which may suffer from three sources of biases: 1) sampling bias due to the extremely sparse distribution of the selected samples in the image space; 2) algorithmic bias due to potential overfitting the selected samples; 3) subjective bias due to further potential cherry-picking test results. This eventually makes the field of real-world image enhancement more of an art than a science. Here we take steps towards debiasing conventional subjective assessment by automatically sampling a set of adaptive and diverse images for subsequent testing. This is achieved by casting sample selection into a joint maximization of the discrepancy between the enhancers and the diversity among the selected input images. Careful visual inspection on the resulting enhanced images provides a debiased ranking of the enhancement algorithms. We demonstrate our subjective assessment method using three popular and practically demanding image enhancement tasks: dehazing, super-resolution, and low-light enhancement",

We tackle this issue by proposing a regularization term that aims to maximize the correlation between the performance rankings of the shared-weight network and that of the standalone architectures using a small set of landmark architectures.

PRISM identifies noisy data in a minibatch using average similarity against image features extracted by several previous versions of the neural network. These features are stored in and retrieved from a memory bank. To alleviate the high computational cost brought by the memory bank, we introduce an acceleration method that replaces individual data points with the class centers.

    "title": "Neural Reprojection Error: Merging Feature Learning and Camera Pose Estimation",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Absolute camera pose estimation is usually addressed by sequentially solving two distinct subproblems: First a feature matching problem that seeks to establish putative 2D-3D correspondences, and then a Perspective-n-Point problem that minimizes, w.r.t. the camera pose, the sum of so-called Reprojection Errors (RE). We argue that generating putative 2D-3D correspondences 1) leads to an important loss of information that needs to be compensated as far as possible, within RE, through the choice of a robust loss and the tuning of its hyperparameters and 2) may lead to an RE that conveys erroneous data to the pose estimator. In this paper, we introduce the Neural Reprojection Error (NRE) as a substitute for RE. NRE allows to rethink the camera pose estimation problem by merging it with the feature learning problem, hence leveraging richer information than 2D-3D correspondences and eliminating the need for choosing a robust loss and its hyperparameters. Thus NRE can be used as training loss to learn image descriptors tailored for pose estimation. We also propose a coarse-to-fine optimization method able to very efficiently minimize a sum of NRE terms w.r.t. the camera pose. We experimentally demonstrate that NRE is a good substitute for RE as it significantly improves both the robustness and the accuracy of the camera pose estimate while being computationally and memory highly efficient. From a broader point of view, we believe this new way of merging deep learning and 3D geometry may be useful in other computer vision applications",

Different from previous methods focusing on learning domain-invariant feature representations, some recent methods present generic semi-supervised learning (SSL) techniques and directly apply them to DA tasks, even achieving competitive performance. One of the most popular SSL techniques is pseudo-labeling that assigns pseudo labels for each unlabeled data via the classifier trained by labeled data. However, it ignores the distribution shift in DA problems and is inevitably biased to source data. To address this issue, we propose a new pseudo-labeling framework called Auxiliary Target Domain-Oriented Classifier (ATDOC). ATDOC alleviates the classifier bias by introducing an auxiliary classifier for target data only, to improve the quality of pseudo labels. Specifically, we employ the memory mechanism and develop two types of non-parametric classifiers, i.e. the nearest centroid classifier and neighborhood aggregation, without introducing any additional network parameters. Despite its simplicity in a pseudo classification objective, ATDOC with neighborhood aggregation significantly outperforms domain alignment techniques and prior SSL techniques on a large variety of DA benchmarks and even scare-labeled SSL tasks",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we focus on category-level 6D pose and size estimation from a monocular RGB-D image. Previous methods suffer from inefficient category-level pose feature extraction, which leads to low accuracy and inference speed. To tackle this problem, we propose a fast shape-based network (FS-Net) with efficient category-level feature extraction for 6D pose estimation. First, we design an orientation aware autoencoder with 3D graph convolution for latent feature extraction. Thanks to the shift and scale-invariance properties of 3D graph convolution, the learned latent feature is insensitive to point shift and object size. Then, to efficiently decode category-level rotation information from the latent feature, we propose a novel decoupled rotation mechanism that employs two decoders to complementarily access the rotation information. For translation and size, we estimate them by two residuals: the difference between the mean of object points and ground truth translation, and the difference between the mean size of the category and ground truth size, respectively. Finally, to increase the generalization ability of the FS-Net, we propose an online box-cage based 3D deformation mechanism to augment the training data. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both category- and instance-level 6D object pose estimation. Especially in category-level pose estimation, without extra synthetic data, our method outperforms existing methods by 6.3% on the NOCS-REAL dataset",

In this paper we present a novel method for learning pose estimators for human adults and infants in an unsupervised fashion. We approach this as a learnable template matching problem facilitated by deep feature extractors. Human-interpretable landmarks are estimated by transforming a template consisting of predefined body parts that are characterized by 2D Gaussian distributions.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "OCR-based image captioning aims to automatically describe images based on all the visual entities (both visual objects and scene text) in images. Compared with conventional image captioning, the reasoning of scene text is required for OCR-based image captioning since the generated descriptions often contain multiple OCR tokens. Existing methods attempt to achieve this goal via encoding the OCR tokens with rich visual and semantic representations. However, strong correlations between OCR tokens may not be established with such limited representations. In this paper, we propose to enhance the connections between OCR tokens from the viewpoint of exploiting the geometrical relationship. We comprehensively consider the height, width, distance, IoU and orientation relations between the OCR tokens for constructing the geometrical relationship. To integrate the learned relation as well as the visual and semantic representations into a unified framework, a Long Short-Term Memory plus Relation-aware pointer network (LSTM-R) architecture is presented in this paper. Under the guidance of the geometrical relationship between OCR tokens, our LSTM-R capitalizes on a newly-devised relation-aware pointer network to select OCR tokens from the scene text for OCR-based image captioning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our LSTM-R. More remarkably, LSTM-R achieves state-of-the-art performance on TextCaps, with the CIDEr-D score being increased from 98.0% to 109.3%",

When a mini-batch contains few examples, the statistics upon which the normalization is defined cannot be reliably estimated from it during a training iteration. To address this problem, we present Cross-Iteration Batch Normalization (CBN), in which examples from multiple recent iterations are jointly utilized to enhance estimation quality. A challenge of computing statistics over multiple iterations is that the network activations from different iterations are not comparable to each other due to changes in network weights. We thus compensate for the network weight changes via a proposed technique based on Taylor polynomials, so that the statistics can be accurately estimated and batch normalization can be effectively applied. On object detection and image classification with small mini-batch sizes, CBN is found to outperform the original batch normalization and a direct calculation of statistics over previous iterations without the proposed compensation technique",

Furthermore, it is difficult to add spatial supervision into the generation process, as the AE only gives us a global representation. To remedy these issues, we propose to train the GAN on grids (i.e. each cell covers a part of a shape). In this representation each cell is equipped with a latent vector provided by an AE. This localized representation enables more expressiveness (since the cell-based latent vectors can be combined in novel ways) as well as spatial control of the generation process (e.g. via bounding boxes). Our method outperforms the current state of the art on all established evaluation measures, proposed for quantitatively evaluating the generative capabilities of GANs.

    "abstract": "Image caption evaluation is a crucial task, which involves the semantic perception and matching of image and text. Good evaluation metrics aim to be fair, comprehensive, and consistent with human judge intentions. When humans evaluate a caption, they usually consider multiple aspects, such as whether it is related to the target image without distortion, how much image gist it conveys, as well as how fluent and beautiful the language and wording is. The above three different evaluation orientations can be summarized as fidelity, adequacy, and fluency. The former two rely on the image content, while fluency is purely related to linguistics and more subjective. Inspired by human judges, we propose a learning-based metric named FAIEr to ensure evaluating the fidelity and adequacy of the captions. Since image captioning involves two different modalities, we employ the scene graph as a bridge between them to represent both images and captions. FAIEr mainly regards the visual scene graph as the criterion to measure the fidelity. Then for evaluating the adequacy of the candidate caption, it highlights the image gist on the visual scene graph under the guidance of the reference captions. Comprehensive experimental results show that FAIEr has high consistency with human judgment as well as high stability, low reference dependency, and the capability of reference-free evaluation",

Most existing face detectors heavily rely on extensive annotations, while collecting data is time-consuming and laborious. To reduce the burden of building new datasets for low light conditions, we make full use of existing normal light data and explore how to adapt face detectors from normal light to low light. The challenge of this task is that the gap between normal and low light is too huge and complex for both pixel-level and object-level. Therefore, most existing low-light enhancement and adaptation methods do not achieve desirable performance. To address the issue, we propose a joint High-Low Adaptation (HLA) framework. Through a bidirectional low-level adaptation and multi-task high-level adaptation scheme, our HLA-Face outperforms state-of-the-art methods even without using dark face labels for training.

    "abstract": "Learning to model and predict how humans interact with objects while performing an action is challenging, and most of the existing video prediction models are ineffective in modeling complicated human-object interactions. Our work builds on hierarchical video prediction models, which disentangle the video generation process into two stages: predicting a high-level representation, such as pose sequence, and then learning a pose-to-pixels translation model for pixel generation. An action sequence for a human-object interaction task is typically very complicated, involving the evolution of pose, person's appearance, object locations, and object appearances over time. To this end, we propose a Hierarchical Video Prediction model using Relational Layouts. In the first stage, we learn to predict a sequence of layouts. A layout is a high-level representation of the video containing both pose and objects' information for every frame. The layout sequence is learned by modeling the relationships between the pose and objects using relational reasoning and recurrent neural networks. The layout sequence acts as a strong structure prior to the second stage that learns to map the layouts into pixel space. Experimental evaluation of our method on two datasets, UMD-HOI and Bimanual, shows significant improvements in standard video evaluation metrics such as LPIPS, PSNR, and SSIM.

Most of current state-of-the-art focus on constructing powerful deep models to obtain better deraining results. In this paper, to further improve the deraining performance, we novelly attempt to handle the SIRR task from the perspective of training datasets by exploring a more efficient way to synthesize rainy images. Specifically, we build a full Bayesian generative model for rainy image where the rain layer is parameterized as a generator with the input as some latent variables representing the physical structural rain factors, e.g., direction, scale, and thickness. To solve this model, we employ the variational inference framework to approximate the expected statistical distribution of rainy image in a data-driven manner. With the learned generator, we can automatically and sufficiently generate diverse and non-repetitive training pairs so as to efficiently enrich and augment the existing benchmark datasets. User study qualitatively and quantitatively evaluates the realism of generated rainy images. Comprehensive experiments substantiate that the proposed model can faithfully extract the complex rain distribution that not only helps significantly improve the deraining performance of current deep single image derainers, but also largely loosens the requirement of large training sample pre-collection for the SIRR task.

Here, we attempt object classification from EEG using an array of methods that are representative of the state-of-the-art, with a far larger (20x) dataset of randomized EEG trials, 1,000 stimulus presentations of each of forty classes, all from a single subject. To our knowledge, this is the largest such EEG data-collection effort from a single subject and is at the bounds of feasibility. We obtain classification accuracy that is marginally above chance and above chance in a statistically significant fashion, and further assess how accuracy depends on the classifier used, the amount of training data used, and the number of classes.

In conjunction with a shape reconstruction module exploiting rotational symmetry, we present an end-to-end learning framework that is able to de-render the world's revolutionary artefacts.

Second, the decoder is overburdened during simultaneously reconstructing the content and structure of the image, resulting in vague performance. To solve these two problems, in this paper, we focus on the interpretable correction mechanism of the distortion rectification network and propose a feature-level correction scheme. We embed a correction layer in skip-connection and leverage the appearance flows in different layers to pre-correct the image features. Consequently, the decoder can easily reconstruct a plausible result with the remaining distortion-less information. In addition, we propose a parallel complementary structure.

    "abstract": "We introduce a deep generative network for 3D shape detailization, akin to stylization with the style being geometric details. We address the challenge of creating large varieties of high-resolution and detailed 3D geometry from a small set of exemplars by treating the problem as that of geometric detail transfer. Given a low-resolution coarse voxel shape, our network refines it, via voxel upsampling, into a higher-resolution shape enriched with geometric details. The output shape preserves the overall structure (or content) of the input, while its detail generation is conditioned on an input \"style code\" corresponding to a detailed exemplar. Our 3D detailization via conditional refinement is realized by a generative adversarial network, coined DECOR-GAN. The network utilizes a 3D CNN generator for upsampling coarse voxels and a 3D PatchGAN discriminator to enforce local patches of the generated model to be similar to those in the training detailed shapes. During testing, a style code is fed into the generator to condition the refinement. We demonstrate that our method can refine a coarse shape into a variety of detailed shapes with different styles. The generated results are evaluated in terms of content preservation, plausibility, and diversity. Comprehensive ablation studies are conducted to validate our network designs.

This task involves fine-grained structure understanding of the mapping between the source and target gestures. Current works follow a data-driven paradigm based on sparse 2D joint representation. However, given the insufficient representation capability of 2D joints, this paradigm easily leads to blurry generation results with incorrect structure. In this paper, we propose a novel model-aware gesture-to-gesture translation framework, which introduces hand prior with hand meshes as the intermediate representation. To take full advantage of the structured hand model, we first build a dense topology map aligning the image plane with the encoded embedding of the visible hand mesh. Then, a transformation flow is calculated based on the correspondence of the source and target topology map. During the generation stage, we inject the topology information into generation streams by modulating the activations in a spatially-adaptive manner. Further, we incorporate the source local characteristic to enhance the translated gesture image according to the transformation flow.

Compared with image-based UDA, video-based UDA is comprehensive to bridge the domain shift on both spatial representation and temporal dynamics. Most previous works focus on short-term modeling and alignment with frame-level or clip-level features, which is not discriminative sufficiently for video-based UDA tasks. To address these problems, in this paper we propose to establish the cross-modal domain alignment via self-supervised contrastive framework, i.e., spatio-temporal contrastive domain adaptation (STCDA), to learn the joint clip-level and video-level representation alignment. Since the effective representation is modeled from unlabeled data by self-supervised learning (SSL), spatio-temporal contrastive learning (STCL) is proposed to explore the useful long-term feature representation for classification, using self-supervision setting trained from the contrastive clip/video pairs with positive or negative properties. Besides, we involve a novel domain metric scheme, i.e., video-based contrastive alignment (VCA), to optimize the category-aware video-level alignment and generalization between source and target.

As a matter of fact, AU semantic descriptions provide much more information than the binary AU labels alone, thus we propose to exploit the Semantic Embedding and Visual feature (SEV-Net) for AU detection. More specifically, AU semantic embeddings are obtained through both Intra-AU and Inter-AU attention modules, where the Intra-AU attention module captures the relation among words within each sentence that describes individual AU, and the Inter-AU attention module focuses on the relation among those sentences. The learned AU semantic embeddings are then used as guidance for the generation of attention maps through a cross-modality attention network. The generated cross-modality attention maps are further used as weights for the aggregated feature. Our proposed method is unique in that the semantic features are exploited as the first of this kind. The approach has been evaluated on three public AU-coded facial expression databases, and has achieved a superior performance than the state-of-the-art peer methods",

The main challenge in monocular 3D detection lies in accurately predicting object depth, which must be inferred from object and scene cues due to the lack of direct range measurement. Many methods attempt to directly estimate depth to assist in 3D detection, but show limited performance as a result of depth inaccuracy. Our proposed solution, Categorical Depth Distribution Network (CaDDN), uses a predicted categorical depth distribution for each pixel to project rich contextual feature information to the appropriate depth interval in 3D space. We then use the computationally efficient bird's-eye-view projection and single-stage detector to produce the final output bounding boxes. We design CaDDN as a fully differentiable end-to-end approach for joint depth estimation and object detection. We validate our approach on the KITTI 3D object detection benchmark, where we rank 1st among published monocular methods. We also provide the first monocular 3D detection results on the newly released Waymo Open Dataset. We provide a code release for CaDDN which will be made publicly available",

    "abstract": "Lip reading aims to predict the spoken sentences from silent lip videos. Due to the fact that such a vision task usually performs worse than its counterpart speech recognition, one potential scheme is to distill knowledge from a teacher pretrained by audio signals. However, the latent domain gap between the cross-modal data could lead to an learning ambiguity and thus limits the performance of lip reading. In this paper, we propose a novel collaborative framework for lip reading, and two aspects of issues are considered: 1) the teacher should understand bi-modal knowledge to possibly bridge the inherent cross-modal gap; 2) the teacher should adjust teaching contents adaptively with the evolution of the student. To these ends, we introduce a trainable \"master\" network which ingests both audio signals and silent lip videos instead of a pretrained teacher. The master produces logits from three modalities of features: audio modality, video modality, and their combination. To further provide an interactive strategy to fuse these knowledge organically, we regularize the master with the task-specific feedback from the student, in which the requirement of the student is implicitly embedded. Meanwhile we involve a couple of \"tutor\" networks into our system as guidance for emphasizing the fruitful knowledge flexibly. In addition, we incorporate a curriculum learning design to ensure a better convergence.

While an increasing number of studies have been conducted, the resolution of synthesized images is still limited to low (e.g., 256x192), which acts as the critical limitation against satisfying online consumers. We argue that the limitation stems from several challenges: as the resolution increases, the artifacts in the misaligned areas between the warped clothes and the desired clothing regions become noticeable in the final results; the architectures used in existing methods have low performance in generating high-quality body parts and maintaining the texture sharpness of the clothes. To address the challenges, we propose a novel virtual try-on method called VITON-HD that successfully synthesizes 1024x768 virtual try-on images. Specifically, we first prepare the segmentation map to guide our virtual try-on synthesis, and then roughly fit the target clothing item to a given person's body. Next, we propose ALIgnment-Aware Segment (ALIAS) normalization and ALIAS generator to handle the misaligned areas and preserve the details of 1024x768 inputs. Through rigorous comparison with existing methods, we demonstrate that VITON-HD highly surpasses the baselines in terms of synthesized image quality both qualitatively and quantitatively",

Unfortunately, most existing deep dehazing models have high computational complexity, which hinders their application to high-resolution images, especially for UHD (ultra-high-definition) or 4K resolution images. To address the problem, we propose a novel network capable of real-time dehazing of 4K images on a single GPU, which consists of three deep CNNs. The first CNN extracts haze-relevant features at a reduced resolution of the hazy input and then fits locally-affine models in the bilateral space. Another CNN is used to learn multiple full-resolution guidance maps corresponding to the learned bilateral model. As a result, the feature maps with high-frequency can be reconstructed by multi-guided bilateral upsampling. Finally, the third CNN fuses the high-quality feature maps into a dehazed image. In addition, we create a large-scale 4K image dehazing dataset to support the training and testing of compared models. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art dehazing approaches on various benchmarks",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Modern object detection approaches cast detecting objects as optimizing two subtasks of classification and localization simultaneously. Existing methods often learn the classification task by optimizing each proposal separately and neglect the relationship among different proposals. Such detection paradigm also encounters the mismatch between classification and localization due to the inherent discrepancy of their optimization targets. In this work, we propose a ranking-based optimization algorithm for harmoniously learning to rank and localize proposals in lieu of the classification task. To this end, we comprehensively investigate three types of ranking constraints, i.e., global ranking, class-specific ranking and IoU-guided ranking losses. The global ranking loss encourages foreground samples to rank higher than background. The class-specific ranking loss ensures that positive samples rank higher than negative ones for each specific class. The IoU-guided ranking loss aims to align each pair of confidence scores with the associated pair of IoU overlap between two positive samples of a specific class. Our ranking constraints can sufficiently explore the relationships between samples from three different perspectives. They are easy-to-implement, compatible with mainstream detection frameworks and computation-free for inference. Experiments demonstrate that our RankDetNet consistently surpasses prior anchor-based and anchor-free baselines, e.g., improving RetinaNet baseline by 2.5% AP on the COCO test-dev set without bells and whistles. We also apply the proposed ranking constraints for 3D object detection and achieve improved performance, which further validates the superiority and generality of our method",

Geometry alone may therefore be insufficient for effectively fusing representations in end-to-end driving models. In this work, we demonstrate that imitation learning policies based on existing sensor fusion methods under-perform in the presence of a high density of dynamic agents and complex scenarios, which require global contextual reasoning, such as handling traffic oncoming from multiple directions at uncontrolled intersections.

    "abstract": "This paper studies the problem of semi-supervised video object segmentation(VOS). Multiple works have shown that memory-based approaches can be effective for video object segmentation. They are mostly based on pixel-level matching, both spatially and temporally. The main shortcoming of memory-based approaches is that they do not take into account the sequential order among frames and do not exploit object-level knowledge from the target. To address this limitation, we propose to learn position and target consistency framework for memory-based video object segmentation, termed as LCM. It applies the memory mechanism to retrieve pixels globally, and meanwhile learns position consistency for more reliable segmentation. The learned location response promotes a better discrimination between target and distractors. Besides, LCM introduces an object-level relationship from the target to maintain target consistency, making LCM more robust to error drifting. Experiments show that our LCM achieves state-of-the-art performance on both DAVIS and Youtube-VOS benchmark. And we rank the 1st in the DAVIS 2020 challenge semi-supervised VOS task",

Specifically, we use it to estimate the likelihood of pseudo labels to facilitate online correction in the course of training. Meanwhile, we align the prototypical assignments based on relative feature distances for two different views of the same target, producing a more compact target feature space.

We first apply the kernel field to the no-flash image, and then multiply the result with the gain map to create the final output.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "These days, unsupervised super-resolution (SR) is soaring due to its practical and promising potential in real scenarios. The philosophy of off-the-shelf approaches lies in the augmentation of unpaired data, i.e. first generating synthetic low-resolution (LR) images Y^g corresponding to real-world high-resolution (HR) images X^r in the real-world LR domain Y^r, and then utilizing the pseudo pairs Y^g, X^r for training in a supervised manner. Unfortunately, since image translation itself is an extremely challenging task, the SR performance of these approaches is severely limited by the domain gap between generated synthetic LR images and real LR images. In this paper, we propose a novel domain-distance aware super-resolution (DASR) approach for unsupervised real-world image SR. The domain gap between training data (e.g. Y^g) and testing data (e.g. Y^r) is addressed with our domain-gap aware training and domain-distance weighted supervision strategies. Domain-gap aware training takes additional benefit from real data in the target domain while domain-distance weighted supervision brings forward the more rational use of labeled source domain data. The proposed method is validated on synthetic and real datasets and the experimental results show that DASR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised SR approaches in generating SR outputs with more realistic and natural textures.

With an instance contrastive objective, we learn an embedding to discriminate each instance from the others. We show that even when only trained with images, the learned feature representation is robust to instance appearance variations, and is thus able to track objects steadily across frames. We further enhance the tracking capability of the embedding by learning correspondence from unlabeled videos in a self-supervised manner. In addition, we integrate this module into single-stage instance segmentation and pose estimation frameworks, which significantly reduce the computational complexity of tracking compared to two-stage networks.

    "abstract": "Unsupervised feature learning has made great strides with contrastive learning based on instance discrimination and invariant mapping, as benchmarked on curated class-balanced datasets. However, natural data could be highly correlated and long-tail distributed. Natural between-instance similarity conflicts with the presumed instance distinction, causing unstable training and poor performance. Our idea is to discover and integrate between-instance similarity into contrastive learning, not directly by instance grouping, but by cross-level discrimination (CLD) between instances and local instance groups. While invariant mapping of each instance is imposed by attraction within its augmented views, between-instance similarity emerges from common repulsion against instance groups. Our batch-wise and cross-view comparisons also greatly improve the positive/negative sample ratio of contrastive learning and achieve better invariant mapping. To effect both grouping and discrimination objectives, we impose them on features separately derived from a shared representation. In addition, we propose normalized projection heads and unsupervised hyper-parameter tuning for the first time. Our extensive experimentation demonstrates that CLD is a lean and powerful add-on to existing methods (e.g., NPID, MoCo, InfoMin, BYOL) on highly correlated, long-tail, or balanced datasets. It not only achieves new state-of-the-art on self-supervision, semi-supervision, and transfer learning benchmarks, but also beats MoCo v2 and SimCLR on every reported performance attained with a much larger compute. CLD effectively extends unsupervised learning to natural data and brings it closer to real-world applications",

A lot of efforts have been made to model the compatibility between fashion items. Some have also studied users' personal preferences for the outfits. There is, however, another difficulty in the task that hasn't been dealt with carefully by previous work. Users that are new to the system usually only have several (less than 5) outfits available for learning. With such a limited number of training examples, it is challenging to model the user's preferences reliably. In this work, we propose a new solution for personalized outfit recommendation that is capable of handling this case. We use a stacked self-attention mechanism to model the high-order interactions among the items. We then embed the items in an outfit into a single compact representation within the outfit space. To accommodate the variety of users' preferences, we characterize each user with a set of anchors, i.e. a group of learnable latent vectors in the outfit space that are the representatives of the outfits the user likes. We also learn a set of general anchors to model the general preference shared by all users. Based on this representation of the outfits and the users, we propose a simple but effective strategy for the new user profiling tasks.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "To minimize the effects of age variation in face recognition, previous work either extracts identity-related discriminative features by minimizing the correlation between identity- and age-related features, called age-invariant face recognition (AIFR), or removes age variation by transforming the faces of different age groups into the same age group, called face age synthesis (FAS); however, the former lacks visual results for model interpretation while the latter suffers from artifacts compromising downstream recognition. Therefore, this paper proposes a unified, multi-task framework to jointly handle these two tasks, termed MTLFace, which can learn age-invariant identity-related representation while achieving pleasing face synthesis. Specifically, we first decompose the mixed face features into two uncorrelated components---identity- and age-related features---through an attention mechanism, and then decorrelate these two components using multi-task training and continuous domain adaption. In contrast to the conventional one-hot encoding that achieves group-level FAS, we propose a novel identity conditional module to achieve identity-level FAS, with a weight-sharing strategy to improve the age smoothness of synthesized faces. In addition, we collect and release a large cross-age face dataset with age and gender annotations to advance AIFR and FAS. Extensive experiments on five benchmark cross-age datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed MTLFace over state-of-the-art methods for AIFR and FAS. We further validate MTLFace on two popular general face recognition datasets, showing competitive performance for face recognition in the wild.

Most state-of-the-art approaches rely on first estimating poses in each frame and only then implementing data association and refinement. Despite the promising results achieved, such a strategy is inevitably prone to missed detections especially in heavily-cluttered scenes, since this tracking-by-detection paradigm is, by nature, largely dependent on visual evidences that are absent in the case of occlusion. In this paper, we propose a novel online approach to learning the pose dynamics, which are independent of pose detections in current fame, and hence may serve as a robust estimation even in challenging scenarios including occlusion. Specifically, we derive this prediction of dynamics through a graph neural network (GNN) that explicitly accounts for both spatial-temporal and visual information. It takes as input the historical pose tracklets and directly predicts the corresponding poses in the following frame for each tracklet. The predicted poses will then be aggregated with the detected poses, if any, at the same frame so as to produce the final pose, potentially recovering the occluded joints missed by the estimator. Experiments on PoseTrack 2017 and PoseTrack 2018 datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves results superior to the state of the art on both human pose estimation and tracking tasks",

Existing approaches to image analysis mostly process objects independently and do not take into account the relative occlusion of nearby objects. In this paper, we propose a deep network for multi-object instance segmentation that is robust to occlusion and can be trained from bounding box supervision only. Our work builds on Compositional Networks, which learn a generative model of neural feature activations to locate occluders and to classify objects based on their non-occluded parts. We extend their generative model to include multiple objects and introduce a framework for efficient inference in challenging occlusion scenarios. In particular, we obtain feed-forward predictions of the object classes and their instance and occluder segmentations. We introduce an Occlusion Reasoning Module (ORM) that locates erroneous segmentations and estimates the occlusion order to correct them. The improved segmentation masks are, in turn, integrated into the network in a top-down manner to improve the image classification. Our experiments on the KITTI INStance dataset (KINS) and a synthetic occlusion dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our model at multi-object instance segmentation under occlusion.

However, this option severely hurts the detection performance. This paper focuses on boosting the performance of a low-resolution model, by distilling knowledge from a high/multi-resolution model. We first identify the challenge of applying knowledge distillation to teacher and student networks that act on different input resolutions. To tackle the challenge, we explore the idea of spatially aligning feature maps between models of different input resolutions, by shifting the position of the feature pyramid structure. With the alignment idea, we introduce aligned multi-scale training to train a multi-scale teacher that can distill its knowledge seamlessly to a low-resolution student. Furthermore, we propose cross feature-level fusion to dynamically fuse the multi-resolution features of the same teacher, to better guide the student. On several instance-level detection tasks and datasets, the low-resolution models trained via our approach perform competitively with high-resolution models trained via conventional multi-scale training, while outperforming the latter's low-resolution models by 2.1% to 3.6% in mAP",

    "abstract": "The problem of expert model selection deals with choosing the appropriate pretrained network (\"expert\") to transfer to a target task. Methods, however, generally depend on two separate assumptions: the presence of labeled images and access to powerful \"probe\" networks that yield useful features. In this work, we demonstrate the current reliance on both of these aspects and develop algorithms to operate when either of these assumptions fail. In the unlabeled case, we show that pseudolabels from the probe network provide discriminative enough gradients to perform nearly-equal task selection even when the probe network is trained on imagery unrelated to the tasks. To compute the embedding with no probe network at all, we introduce the Task Tangent Kernel (TTK) which uses a kernelized distance across multiple random networks to achieve performance over double that of other methods with randomly initialized models.

To this end, we devise a novel approach that learns to partition the scene objects into two groups, essential ones and minor ones, under the supervision that if only the essential ones are kept while the minor ones are erased in the input image, a scene recognizer would preserve its original prediction. Specifically, we introduce a learnable graph neural network (GNN) for labelling scene objects, based on which the minor ones are wiped off by an off-the-shelf image inpainter. The features of the inpainted image derived in this way, together with those learned from the GNN with the minor-object nodes pruned, are expected to fool the scene discriminator.

We compiled a novel con-founded visual scene data set, the CLEVR-Hans data set,capturing complex compositions of different objects. The results of our experiments on CLEVR-Hans demonstrate that our semantic explanations, i.e. compositional explanations at a per-object level, can identify confounders that are not identifiable using \"visual\" explanations only.

    "abstract": "Tracking humans in crowded video sequences is an important constituent of visual scene understanding. Increasing crowd density challenges visibility of humans, limiting the scalability of existing pedestrian trackers to higher crowd densities. For that reason, we propose to revitalize head tracking with Crowd of Heads Dataset (CroHD), consisting of 9 sequences of 11,463 frames with over 2,276,838 heads and 5,230 tracks annotated in diverse scenes. For evaluation, we proposed a new metric, IDEucl, to measure an algorithm's efficacy in preserving a unique identity for the longest stretch in image coordinate space, thus building a correspondence between pedestrian crowd motion and the performance of a tracking algorithm. Moreover, we also propose a new head detector, HeadHunter, which is designed for small head detection in crowded scenes. We extend HeadHunter with a Particle Filter and a color histogram based re-identification module for head tracking. To establish this as a strong baseline, we compare our tracker with existing state-of-the-art pedestrian trackers on CroHD and demonstrate superiority, especially in identity preserving tracking metrics. With a light-weight head detector and a tracker which is efficient at identity preservation, we believe our contributions will serve useful in advancement of pedestrian tracking in dense crowds.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Visual object tracking aims to precisely estimate the bounding box for the given target, which is a challenging problem due to factors such as deformation and occlusion. Many recent trackers adopt the multiple-stage tracking strategy to improve the quality of bounding box estimation. These methods first coarsely locate the target and then refine the initial prediction in the following stages. However, existing approaches still suffer from limited precision, and the coupling of different stages severely restricts the method's transferability. This work proposes a novel, flexible, and accurate refinement module called Alpha-Refine (AR), which can significantly improve the base trackers' box estimation quality. By exploring a series of design options, we conclude that the key to successful refinement is extracting and maintaining detailed spatial information as much as possible. Following this principle, Alpha-Refine adopts a pixel-wise correlation, a corner prediction head, and an auxiliary mask head as the core components. Comprehensive experiments on TrackingNet, LaSOT, GOT-10K, and VOT2020 benchmarks with multiple base trackers show that our approach significantly improves the base trackers' performance with little extra latency. The proposed Alpha-Refine method leads to a series of strengthened trackers, among which the ARSiamRPN (AR strengthened SiamRPNpp) and the ARDiMP50 (ARstrengthened DiMP50) achieve good efficiency-precision trade-off, while the ARDiMPsuper (AR strengthened DiMP-super) achieves very competitive performance at a real-time speed.

Our approach is built upon two key ideas: first, we encode the inductive bias that the learned cross-modal representations should be compositional with respect to concepts in each modality--this is achieved through clustering pretrained uni-modal features across each domain and designing a careful regularisation scheme to preserve the resulting structure. Second, we employ mutual information maximisation between cross-modal representations in the source and target domains during learning--this provides a mechanism that preserves commonalities between the domains while discarding signal in each that cannot be inferred from the other.

Subsequently, we employ a transductive label propagation method to exploit the affinities between labeled multi-prototypes and unlabeled points, and among the unlabeled points. Furthermore, we design an attention-aware multi-level feature learning network to learn the discriminative features that capture the geometric dependencies and semantic correlations between points. Our proposed method shows significant and consistent improvements compared to baselines in different few-shot point cloud semantic segmentation settings (i.e., 2/3-way 1/5-shot) on two benchmark datasets.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recently, the ever-increasing capacity of large-scale annotated datasets has led to profound progress in stereo matching. However, most of these successes are limited to a specific dataset and cannot generalize well to other datasets. The main difficulties lie in the large domain differences and unbalanced disparity distribution across a variety of datasets, which greatly limit the real-world applicability of current deep stereo matching models. In this paper, we propose CFNet, a Cascade and Fused cost volume based network to improve the robustness of the stereo matching network. First, we propose a fused cost volume representation to deal with the large domain difference. By fusing multiple low-resolution dense cost volumes to enlarge the receptive field, we can extract robust structural representations for initial disparity estimation. Second, we propose a cascade cost volume representation to alleviate the unbalanced disparity distribution. Specifically, we employ a variance-based uncertainty estimation to adaptively adjust the next stage disparity search space, in this way driving the network progressively prune out the space of unlikely correspondences. By iteratively narrowing down the disparity search space and improving the cost volume resolution, the disparity estimation is gradually refined in a coarse-to-fine manner. When trained on the same training images and evaluated on KITTI, ETH3D, and Middlebury datasets with the fixed model parameters and hyperparameters, our proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art overall performance and obtains the 1st place on the stereo task of Robust Vision Challenge 2020.

First, by introducing a non-linear filtering operator, a reliability matrix, and a high-dimensional feature transformation function into the traditional consistency prior, we propose a novel adaptive consistency prior (ACP). Second, by incorporating the ACP term into the maximum a posteriori framework, a model-based denoising method is proposed. This method is further used to inform the network design, leading to a novel end-to-end trainable and interpretable deep denoising network, called DeamNet. Note that the unfolding process leads to a promising module called dual element-wise attention mechanism (DEAM) module. To the best of our knowledge, both our ACP constraint and DEAM module have not been reported in the previous literature.

The existing solutions rely either on data augmentation or on anti-aliasing, both of which have limitations and neither of which enables perfect shift invariance. Additionally, the gains obtained from these methods do not extend to image patterns not seen during training. To address these challenges, we propose adaptive polyphase sampling (APS), a simple sub-sampling scheme that allows convolutional neural networks to achieve 100% consistency in classification performance under shifts, without any loss in accuracy. With APS, the networks exhibit perfect consistency to shifts even before training, making it the first approach that makes convolutional neural networks truly shift-invariant",

In this paper, we leverage the availability of these two cameras for the task of illumination estimation using a small neural network to perform the illumination prediction. Specifically, if the two cameras' sensors have different spectral sensitivities, the two images provide different spectral measurements of the physical scene. A linear 3x3 color transform that maps between these two observations -- and that is unique to a given scene illuminant -- can be used to train a lightweight neural network comprising no more than 1460 parameters to predict the scene illumination. We demonstrate that this two-camera approach with a lightweight network provides results on par or better than much more complicated illuminant estimation methods operating on a single image. We validate our method's effectiveness through extensive experiments on radiometric data, a quasi-real two-camera dataset we generated from an existing single camera dataset, as well as a new real image dataset that we captured using a smartphone with two rear-facing cameras",

    "abstract": "With the rapid advances of autonomous driving, it becomes critical to equip its sensing system with more holistic 3D perception. However, existing works focus on parsing either the objects (e.g. cars and pedestrians) or scenes (e.g. trees and buildings) from the LiDAR sensor. In this work, we address the task of LiDAR-based panoptic segmentation, which aims to parse both objects and scenes in a unified manner. As one of the first endeavors towards this new challenging task, we propose the Dynamic Shifting Network (DS-Net), which serves as an effective panoptic segmentation framework in the point cloud realm. In particular, DS-Net has three appealing properties: 1) strong backbone design. DS-Net adopts the cylinder convolution that is specifically designed for LiDAR point clouds. The extracted features are shared by the semantic branch and the instance branch which operates in a bottom-up clustering style. 2) Dynamic Shifting for complex point distributions. We observe that commonly-used clustering algorithms like BFS or DBSCAN are incapable of handling complex autonomous driving scenes with non-uniform point cloud distributions and varying instance sizes. Thus, we present an efficient learnable clustering module, dynamic shifting, which adapts kernel functions on-the-fly for different instances. 3) Consensus-driven Fusion. Finally, consensus-driven fusion is used to deal with the disagreement between semantic and instance predictions. To comprehensively evaluate the performance of LiDAR-based panoptic segmentation, we construct and curate benchmarks from two large-scale autonomous driving LiDAR datasets, SemanticKITTI and nuScenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed DS-Net achieves superior accuracies over current state-of-the-art methods. Notably, we achieve 1st place on the public leaderboard of SemanticKITTI, outperforming 2nd place by 2.6% in terms of the PQ metric",

    "abstract": "Predicting accurate and realistic future human poses from historically observed sequences is a fundamental task in the intersection of computer vision, graphics, and artificial intelligence. Recently, continuous efforts have been devoted to addressing this issue, which has achieved remarkable progress. However, the existing work is seriously limited by complete observation, that is, once the historical motion sequence is incomplete (with missing values), it can only produce unexpected predictions or even deformities. Furthermore, due to inevitable reasons such as occlusion and the lack of equipment precision, the incompleteness of motion data occurs frequently, which hinders the practical application of current algorithms. In this work, we first notice this challenging problem, i.e., how to generate high-fidelity human motion predictions from incomplete observations. To solve it, we propose a novel multi-task graph convolutional network (MT-GCN). Specifically, the model involves two branches, in which the primary task is to focus on forecasting future 3D human actions accurately, while the auxiliary one is to repair the missing value of the incomplete observation. Both of them are integrated into a unified framework to share the spatio-temporal representation, which improves the final performance of each collaboratively. On three large-scale datasets, for various data missing scenarios in the real world, extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach is consistently superior to the state-of-the-art methods in which the missing values from incomplete observations are not explicitly analyzed",

We present a new method for scene agnostic camera localization using dense scene matching (DSM), where the cost volume is constructed between a query image and a scene.

    "abstract": "In recent years, Face Image Quality Assessment (FIQA) has become an indispensable part of the face recognition system to guarantee the stability and reliability of recognition performance in an unconstrained scenario. For this purpose, the FIQA method should consider both the intrinsic property and the recognizability of the face image. Most previous works aim to estimate the sample-wise embedding uncertainty or pair-wise similarity as the quality score, which only considers the partial information from the intra-class. However, these methods ignore the valuable information from the inter-class, which is for estimating the recognizability of face image. In this work, we argue that a high-quality face image should be similar to its intra-class samples and dissimilar to its inter-class samples. Thus, we propose a novel unsupervised FIQA method that incorporates Similarity Distribution Distance for Face Image Quality Assessment (SDD-FIQA). Our method generates quality pseudo-labels by calculating the Wasserstein Distance (WD) between the intra-class and inter-class similarity distributions. With these quality pseudo-labels, we are capable of training a regression network for quality prediction.

Existing video based deraining method focus only on rain streak removal, and commonly use optical flow to align the rain video frames. However, besides rain streaks, rain accummulation can considerably degrade visibility; and, optical flow estimation in a rain video is still erroneous, making the deraining performance tend to be inaccurate. Our method employs deformable convolution layers in our encoder to achieve feature-level frame alignment, and hence avoids using optical flow. For rain streaks, our method predicts the current frame from its adjacent frames, such that rain streaks that appear randomly in the temporal domain can be removed. For rain accumulation, our method employs transmission-depth consistency to resolve the ambiguity between the depth and water-droplet density. Our network estimates the depth from consecutive rain-accumulation-removal outputs, and we calculate the transmission map using a commonly used physics model. To ensure photometric-temporal and depth-temporal consistencies, our network also estimate the camera poses, so that we can warp one frame to its adjacent frames.

Particularly, a dynamic relation projection module is proposed to calculate the relation matrix in a shared embedding space and leverage it as the factor for bootstrapping the update of prototypes.

    "abstract": "Anomaly detection methods require high-quality features. In recent years, the anomaly detection community has attempted to obtain better features using advances in deep self-supervised feature learning. Surprisingly, a very promising direction, using pre-trained deep features, has been mostly overlooked. In this paper, we first empirically establish the perhaps expected, but unreported result, that combining pre-trained features with simple anomaly detection and segmentation methods convincingly outperforms, much more complex, state-of-the-art methods. In order to obtain further performance gains in anomaly detection, we adapt pre-trained features to the target distribution. Although transfer learning methods are well established in multi-class classification problems, the one-class classification (OCC) setting is not as well explored. It turns out that naive adaptation methods, which typically work well in supervised learning, often result in catastrophic collapse (feature deterioration) and reduce performance in OCC settings. A popular OCC method, DeepSVDD, advocates using specialized architectures, but this limits the adaptation performance gain. We propose two methods for combating collapse: i) a variant of early stopping that dynamically learns the stopping iteration ii) elastic regularization inspired by continual learning. Our method, PANDA, outperforms the state-of-the-art in the OCC, outlier exposure and anomaly segmentation settings by large margins",

The outputs of these two subtasks are fused to obtain the final instance masks quickly and accurately. Through using the relation among different instances per-frame as well as temporal relation across different frames, the proposed network learns to differentiate multiple instances and associate them properly in one feed-forward manner.

Since the coordinates are continuous, LIIF can be presented in arbitrary resolution. To generate the continuous representation for images, we train an encoder with LIIF representation via a self-supervised task with super-resolution. The learned continuous representation can be presented in arbitrary resolution even extrapolate to x30 higher resolution, where the training tasks are not provided.

    "abstract": "Registering point clouds of dressed humans to parametric human models is a challenging task in computer vision. Traditional approaches often rely on heavily engineered pipelines that require accurate manual initialization of human poses and tedious post-processing. More recently, learning-based methods are proposed in hope to automate this process. We observe that pose initialization is key to accurate registration but existing methods often fail to provide accurate pose initialization. One major obstacle is that, despite recent effort on rotation representation learning in neural networks, regressing joint rotations from point clouds or images of humans is still very challenging. To this end, we propose novel piecewise transformation fields (PTF), a set of functions that learn 3D translation vectors to map any query point in posed space to its correspond position in rest-pose space. We combine PTF with multi-class occupancy networks, obtaining a novel learning-based framework that learns to simultaneously predict shape and per-point correspondences between the posed space and the canonical space for clothed human. Our key insight is that the translation vector for each query point can be effectively estimated using the point-aligned local features; consequently, rigid per bone transformations and joint rotations can be obtained efficiently via a least-square fitting given the estimated point correspondences, circumventing the challenging task of directly regressing joint rotations from neural networks. Furthermore, the proposed PTF facilitate canonicalized occupancy estimation, which greatly improves generalization capability and result in more accurate surface reconstruction with only half of the parameters compared with the state-of-the-art. Both qualitative and quantitative studies show that fitting parametric models with poses initialized by our network results in much better registration quality, especially for extreme poses",

    "abstract": "Siamese network based trackers formulate the visual tracking task as a similarity matching problem. Almost all popular Siamese trackers realize the similarity learning via convolutional feature cross-correlation between a target branch and a search branch. However, since the size of target feature region needs to be pre-fixed, these cross-correlation base methods suffer from either reserving much adverse background information or missing a great deal of foreground information. Moreover, the global matching between the target and search region also largely neglects the target structure and part-level information. In this paper, to solve the above issues, we propose a simple target-aware Siamese graph attention network for general object tracking. We propose to establish part-to-part correspondence between the target and the search region with a complete bipartite graph, and apply the graph attention mechanism to propagate target information from the template feature to the search feature. Further, instead of using the pre-fixed region cropping for template-feature-area selection, we investigate a target-aware area selection mechanism to fit the size and aspect ratio variations of different objects. Experiments on challenging benchmarks including GOT-10k, UAV123, OTB-100 and LaSOT demonstrate that the proposed SiamGAT outperforms many state-of-the-art trackers and achieves leading performance.

    "abstract": "Recently, object detection in aerial images has gained much attention in computer vision. Different from objects in natural images, aerial objects are often distributed with arbitrary orientation. Therefore, the detector requires more parameters to encode the orientation information, which are often highly redundant and inefficient. Moreover, as ordinary CNNs do not explicitly model the orientation variation, large amounts of rotation augmented data is needed to train an accurate object detector. In this paper, we propose a Rotation-equivariant Detector (ReDet) to address these issues, which explicitly encodes rotation equivariance and rotation invariance. More precisely, we incorporate rotation-equivariant networks into the detector to extract rotation-equivariant features, which can accurately predict the orientation and lead to a huge reduction of model size. Based on the rotation-equivariant features, we also present Rotation-invariant RoI Align (RiRoI Align), which adaptively extracts rotation-invariant features from equivariant features according to the orientation of RoI. Extensive experiments on several challenging aerial image datasets DOTA-v1.0, DOTA-v1.5 and HRSC2016, show that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance on the task of aerial object detection. Compared with previous best results, our ReDet gains 1.2, 3.5 and 2.6 mAP on DOTA-v1.0, DOTA-v1.5 and HRSC2016 respectively while reducing the number of parameters by 60% (313 Mb vs. 121 Mb).

Our SSL trains an RNN to recognize positive and negative action sequences, and the RNN's hidden layer is taken as our new action-level feature embedding. The positive and negative sequences consist of action segments sampled from videos, where in the former the sampled action segments respect their time ordering in the video, and in the latter they are shuffled. As supervision of actions is not available and our SSL requires access to action segments, we specify an HMM that explicitly models action lengths, and infer a MAP action segmentation with the Viterbi algorithm. The resulting action segmentation is used as pseudo-ground truth for estimating our action-level feature embedding and updating the HMM.

Due to the variable sampling rates for sequences from different modalities, the collected multimodal streams are usually unaligned. The asynchrony across modalities increases the difficulty on conducting efficient multimodal fusion. Hence, this work mainly focuses on multimodal fusion from unaligned multimodal sequences. To this end, we propose the Progressive Modality Reinforcement (PMR) approach based on the recent advances of crossmodal transformer. Our approach introduces a message hub to exchange information with each modality. The message hub sends common messages to each modality and reinforces their features via crossmodal attention. In turn, it also collects the reinforced features from each modality and uses them to generate a reinforced common message. By repeating the cycle process, the common message and the modalities' features can progressively complement each other. Finally, the reinforced features are used to make predictions for human emotion. Comprehensive experiments on different human multimodal emotion recognition benchmarks clearly demonstrate the superiority of our approach",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we tackle the problem of discovering new classes in unlabeled visual data given labeled data from disjoint classes. Existing methods typically first pre-train a model with labeled data, and then identify new classes in unlabeled data via unsupervised clustering. However, the labeled data that provide essential knowledge are often underexplored in the second step. The challenge is that the labeled and unlabeled examples are from non-overlapping classes, which makes it difficult to build a learning relationship between them. In this work, we introduce OpenMix to mix the unlabeled examples from an open set and the labeled examples from known classes, where their non-overlapping labels and pseudo-labels are simultaneously mixed into a joint label distribution. OpenMix dynamically compounds examples in two ways. First, we produce mixed training images by incorporating labeled examples with unlabeled examples. With the benefit of unique prior knowledge in novel class discovery, the generated pseudo-labels will be more credible than the original unlabeled predictions. As a result, OpenMix helps preventing the model from overfitting on unlabeled samples that may be assigned with wrong pseudo-labels. Second, the first way encourages the unlabeled examples with high class-probabilities to have considerable accuracy. We introduce these examples as reliable anchors and further integrate them with unlabeled samples. This enables us to generate more combinations in unlabeled examples and exploit finer object relations among the new classes. Experiments on three classification datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed OpenMix, which is superior to state-of-the-art methods in novel class discovery",

    "abstract": "Generation of stroke-based non-photorealistic imagery, is an important problem in the computer vision community. As an endeavor in this direction, substantial recent research efforts have been focused on teaching machines \"how to paint\", in a manner similar to a human painter. However, the applicability of previous methods has been limited to datasets with little variation in position, scale and saliency of the foreground object. As a consequence, we find that these methods struggle to cover the granularity and diversity possessed by real world images. To this end, we propose a Semantic Guidance pipeline with 1) a bi-level painting procedure for learning the distinction between foreground and background brush strokes at training time. 2) We also introduce invariance to the position and scale of the foreground object through a neural alignment model, which combines object localization and spatial transformer networks in an end to end manner, to zoom into a particular semantic instance. 3) The distinguishing features of the in-focus object are then amplified by maximizing a novel guided backpropagation based focus reward. The proposed agent does not require any supervision on human stroke-data and successfully handles variations in foreground object attributes, thus, producing much higher quality canvases for the CUB-200 Birds and Stanford Cars-196 datasets. Finally, we demonstrate the further efficacy of our method on complex datasets with multiple foreground object instances by evaluating an extension of our method on the challenging Virtual-KITTI dataset.

In general, the bispectral difference is obtained by subtracting signals at two individual wavelengths captured by ordinary digital cameras, which tends to inherit the drawbacks of conventional cameras in dynamic range, response speed and quantization precision. In this paper, we propose a novel method to obtain a bispectral difference image using an event camera with temporally modulated illumination. Our method is rooted in a key observation on the analogy between the bispectral photometry principle of the participating medium and the event generating mechanism in an event camera. By carefully modulating the bispectral illumination, our method allows to read out the bispectral difference directly from triggered events. Experiments using a prototype imaging system have verified the feasibility of this novel usage of event cameras in photometry based vision tasks, such as 3D shape reconstruction in water",

The proposed LiDAR-Aug is a plug-and-play module that can be easily integrated into different types of 3D object detection frameworks. Compared to the traditional object augmentation methods, LiDAR-Aug is more realistic and effective.

However, previous distillation methods of detection have weak generalization for different detection frameworks and rely heavily on ground truth (GT), ignoring the valuable relation information between instances. Thus, we propose a novel distillation method for detection tasks based on discriminative instances without considering the positive or negative distinguished by GT, which is called general instance distillation (GID). Our approach contains a general instance selection module (GISM) to make full use of feature-based, relation-based and response-based knowledge for distillation. Extensive results demonstrate that the student model achieves significant AP improvement and even outperforms the teacher in various detection frameworks. Specifically, RetinaNet with ResNet-50 achieves 39.1% in mAP with GID on COCO dataset, which surpasses the baseline 36.2% by 2.9%, and even better than the ResNet-101 based teacher model with 38.1% AP",

    "abstract": "This paper considers the problem of unsupervised person re-identification (re-ID), which aims to learn discriminative models with unlabeled data. One popular method is to obtain pseudo-label by clustering and use them to optimize the model. Although this kind of approach has shown promising accuracy, it is hampered by 1) noisy labels produced by clustering and 2) feature variations caused by camera shift. The former will lead to incorrect optimization and thus hinders the model accuracy. The latter will result in assigning the intra-class samples of different cameras to different pseudo-label, making the model sensitive to camera variations. In this paper, we propose a unified framework to solve both problems. Concretely, we propose a Dynamic and Symmetric Cross-Entropy loss (DSCE) to deal with noisy samples and a camera-aware meta-learning algorithm (MetaCam) to adapt camera shift. DSCE can alleviate the negative effects of noisy samples and accommodate the change of clusters after each clustering step. MetaCam simulates cross-camera constraint by splitting the training data into meta-train and meta-test based on camera IDs. With the interacted gradient from meta-train and meta-test, the model is enforced to learn camera-invariant features. Extensive experiments on three re-ID benchmarks show the effectiveness and the complementary of the proposed DSCE and MetaCam. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on both fully unsupervised re-ID and unsupervised domain adaptive re-ID",

    "abstract": "Automatically detecting/segmenting object(s) that blend in with their surroundings is difficult for current models. A major challenge is that the intrinsic similarities between such foreground objects and background surroundings make the features extracted by deep model indistinguishable. To overcome this challenge, an ideal model should be able to seek valuable, extra clues from the given scene and incorporate them into a joint learning framework for representation co-enhancement. With this inspiration, we design a novel Mutual Graph Learning (MGL) model, which generalizes the idea of conventional mutual learning from regular grids to the graph domain. Specifically, MGL decouples an image into two task-specific feature maps -- one for roughly locating the target and the other for accurately capturing its boundary details -- and fully exploits the mutual benefits by recurrently reasoning their high-order relations through graphs. Importantly, in contrast to most mutual learning approaches that use a shared function to model all between-task interactions, MGL is equipped with typed functions for handling different complementary relations to maximize information interactions. Experiments on challenging datasets, including CHAMELEON, CAMO and COD10K, demonstrate the effectiveness of our MGL with superior performance to existing state-of-the-art methods",

    "abstract": "Non-visual imaging sensors are widely used in the industry for different purposes. Those sensors are more expensive than visual (RGB) sensors, and usually produce images with lower resolution. To this end, Cross-Modality Super-Resolution methods were introduced, where an RGB image of a high-resolution assists in increasing the resolution of a low-resolution modality. However, fusing images from different modalities is not a trivial task, since each multi-modal pair varies greatly in its internal correlations. For this reason, traditional state-of-the-arts which are trained on external datasets often struggle with yielding an artifact-free result that is still loyal to the target modality characteristics. We present CMSR, a single-pair approach for Cross-Modality Super-Resolution. The network is internally trained on the two input images only, in a self-supervised manner, learns their internal statistics and correlations, and applies them to upsample the target modality. CMSR contains an internal transformer which is trained on-the-fly together with the up-sampling process itself and without supervision, to allow dealing with pairs that are only weakly aligned. We show that CMSR produces state-of-the-art super resolved images, yet without introducing artifacts or irrelevant details that originate from the RGB image only",

Current approaches follow a two-stage paradigm: 1) detect object proposals using pre-trained Mask R-CNN, and 2) conduct generic feature matching for temporal association using re-identification techniques. However, the generic features, widely used in both stages, are not reliable for characterizing unseen objects, leading to poor generalization. To address this, we introduce a novel approach for more accurate and efficient spatio-temporal segmentation. In particular, to address instance discrimination, we propose to combine foreground region estimation and instance grouping together in one network, and additionally introduce temporal guidance for segmenting each frame, enabling more accurate object discovery. For temporal association, we complement current video object segmentation architectures with a discriminative appearance model, capable of capturing more fine-grained target-specific information. Given object proposals from the instance discrimination network, three essential strategies are adopted to achieve accurate segmentation: 1) target-specific tracking using a memory-augmented appearance model; 2) target-agnostic verification to trace possible tracklets for the proposal; 3) adaptive memory updating using the verified segments. We evaluate the proposed approach on DAVIS_ 17 and YouTube-VIS, and the results demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods both in segmentation accuracy and inference speed",

The proposed LAT enjoys several merits. First, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to formulate lesion discovery as a weakly supervised lesion localization problem via a transformer decoder. Second, to learn lesion filters well with only image-level labels, we design two effective mechanisms including lesion region importance and lesion region diversity for identifying diverse lesion regions.

HOIs are so diverse in spatial distribution in an image that existing CNN-based methods face the following three major drawbacks; they cannot leverage image-wide features due to CNN's locality, they rely on a manually defined location-of-interest for the feature aggregation, which sometimes does not cover contextually important regions, and they cannot help but mix up the features for multiple HOI instances if they are located closely. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a transformer-based feature extractor, in which an attention mechanism and query-based detection play key roles. The attention mechanism is effective in aggregating contextually important information image-wide, while the queries, which we design in such a way that each query captures at most one human-object pair, can avoid mixing up the features from multiple instances. This transformer-based feature extractor produces so effective embeddings that the subsequent detection heads may be fairly simple and intuitive. The extensive analysis reveals that the proposed method successfully extracts contextually important features, and thus outperforms existing methods by large margins (5.37 mAP on HICO-DET, and 5.6 mAP on V-COCO).

    "abstract": "Existing research on action recognition treats activities as monolithic events occurring in videos. Recently, the benefits of formulating actions as a combination of atomic-actions have shown promise in improving action understanding with the emergence of datasets containing such annotations, allowing us to learn representations capturing this information. However, there remains a lack of studies that extend action composition and leverage multiple viewpoints and multiple modalities of data for representation learning. To promote research in this direction, we introduce Home Action Genome (HOMAGE): a multi-view action dataset with multiple modalities and view-points supplemented with hierarchical activity and atomic action labels together with dense scene composition labels. Leveraging rich multi-modal and multi-view settings, we propose Cooperative Compositional Action Understanding (CCAU), a cooperative learning framework for hierarchical action recognition that is aware of compositional action elements. CCAU shows consistent performance improvements across all modalities. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of co-learning compositions in few-shot action recognition by achieving 28.6% mAP with just a single sample",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Monitoring treatment response in longitudinal studies plays an important role in clinical practice. Accurately identifying lesions across serial imaging follow-up is the core to the monitoring procedure. Typically this incorporates both image and anatomical considerations. However, matching lesions manually is labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this work, we present deep lesion tracker (DLT), a deep learning approach that uses both appearance- and anatomical-based signals. To incorporate anatomical constraints, we propose an anatomical signal encoder, which prevents lesions being matched with visually similar but spurious regions. In addition, we present a new formulation for Siamese networks that avoids the heavy computational loads of 3D cross-correlation. To present our network with greater varieties of images, we also propose a self-supervised learning strategy to train trackers with unpaired images, overcoming barriers to data collection. To train and evaluate our tracker, we introduce and release the first lesion tracking benchmark, consisting of 3891 lesion pairs from the public DeepLesion database. The proposed method, DLT, locates lesion centers with a mean error distance of 7mm. This is 5% better than a leading registration algorithm while running 14 times faster with whole CT volumes. We demonstrate even greater improvements over detector or similarity-learning alternatives. DLT also generalizes well on an external clinical test set of 100% longitudinal studies, achieving 88% accuracy. Finally, we plug DLT into an automatic tumor monitoring workflow where it leads to an accuracy of 85% in assessing lesion treatment responses, which is only 0.46% lower than the accuracy of manual inputs",

    "abstract": "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been widely used in sequence analysis and modeling. However, when processing high-dimensional data, RNNs typically require very large model sizes, thereby bringing a series of deployment challenges. Although various prior works have been proposed to reduce the RNN model sizes, executing RNN models in resource-restricted environments is still a very challenging problem. In this paper, we propose to develop extremely compact RNN models with fully decomposed hierarchical Tucker (FDHT) structure. The HT decomposition does not only provide much higher storage cost reduction than the other tensor decomposition approaches but also brings better accuracy performance improvement for the compact RNN models. Meanwhile, unlike the existing tensor decomposition-based methods that can only decompose the input-to-hidden layer of RNNs, our proposed fully decomposition approach enables the comprehensive compression for the entire RNN models with maintaining very high accuracy. Our experimental results on several popular video recognition datasets show that our proposed fully decomposed hierarchical tucker-based LSTM (FDHT-LSTM) is extremely compact and highly efficient. To the best of our knowledge, FDHT-LSTM, for the first time, consistently achieves very high accuracy with only few thousand parameters (3,132 to 8,808) on different datasets. Compared with the state-of-the-art compressed RNN models, such as TT-LSTM, TR-LSTM and BT-LSTM, our FDHT-LSTM simultaneously enjoys both order-of-magnitude (3,985x to 10,711x) fewer parameters and significant accuracy improvement (0.6% to 12.7%)",

    "abstract": "Advances in supervised learning approaches to object recognition flourished in part because of the availability of high-quality datasets and associated benchmarks. However, these benchmarks---such as ILSVRC---are relatively task-specific, focusing predominately on predicting class labels. We introduce a publicly-available dataset that embodies the task-general capabilities of human perception and reasoning. The Human Similarity Judgments extension to ImageNet (ImageNet-HSJ) is composed of a large set of human similarity judgments that supplements the existing ILSVRC validation set. The new dataset supports a range of task and performance metrics, including evaluation of unsupervised algorithms. We demonstrate two methods of assessment: using the similarity judgments directly and using a psychological embedding trained on the similarity judgments. This embedding space contains an order of magnitude more points (i.e., images) than previous efforts based on human judgments. We were able to scale to the full 50,000 image ILSVRC validation set through a selective sampling process that used variational Bayesian inference and model ensembles to sample aspects of the embedding space that were most uncertain. To demonstrate the utility of ImageNet-HSJ, we used the similarity ratings and the embedding space to evaluate how well several popular models conform to human similarity judgments. One finding is that more complex models that perform better on task-specific benchmarks do not better conform to human semantic judgments. In addition to the human similarity judgments, pre-trained psychological embeddings and code for inferring variational embeddings are made publicly available. ImageNet-HSJ supports the appraisal of internal representations and the development of more human-like models",

While extensive research efforts are devoted to improving compression techniques, every method inevitably discards information. Especially at low bit rates, this information often corresponds to semantically meaningful visual cues, so that decompression involves significant ambiguity. In spite of this fact, existing decompression algorithms typically produce only a single output, and do not allow the viewer to explore the set of images that map to the given compressed code. In this work we propose the first image decompression method to facilitate user-exploration of the diverse set of natural images that could have given rise to the compressed input code, thus granting users the ability to determine what could and what could not have been there in the original scene. Specifically, we develop a novel deep-network based decoder architecture for the ubiquitous JPEG standard, which allows traversing the set of decompressed images that are consistent with the compressed JPEG file. To allow for simple user interaction, we develop a graphical user interface comprising several intuitive exploration tools, including an automatic tool for examining specific solutions of interest. We exemplify our framework on graphical, medical and forensic use cases, demonstrating its wide range of potential applications",

The state-of-the-art methods often rely on context modeling methods such as pictorial structure model (PSM) or graph neural network (GNN) to reduce ambiguity. However, there is no study that rigorously compares them side by side. So we first present a general formula for context modeling in which both PSM and GNN are its special cases. By comparing the two methods, we found that the end-to-end training scheme in GNN and the limb length constraints in PSM are two complementary factors to improve results. To combine their advantages, we propose ContextPose based on attention mechanism that allows enforcing soft limb length constraints in a deep network. The approach effectively reduces the chance of getting absurd 3D pose estimates with incorrect limb lengths and achieves state-of-the-art results on two benchmark datasets. More importantly, the introduction of limb length constraints into deep networks enables the approach to achieve much better generalization performance",

    "title": "Less Is More: ClipBERT for Video-and-Language Learning via Sparse Sampling",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The canonical approach to video-and-language learning (e.g., video question answering) dictates a neural model to learn from offline-extracted dense video features from vision models and text features from language models. These feature extractors are trained independently and usually on tasks different from the target domains, rendering these fixed features sub-optimal for downstream tasks. Moreover, due to the high computational overload of dense video features, it is often difficult (or infeasible) to plug feature extractors directly into existing approaches for easy finetuning. To provide a remedy to this dilemma, we propose a generic framework CLIPBERT that enables affordable end-to-end learning for video-and-language tasks, by employing sparse sampling, where only a single or a few sparsely sampled short clips from a video are used at each training step. Experiments on text-to-video retrieval and video question answering on six datasets demonstrate that CLIPBERT outperforms (or is on par with) existing methods that exploit full-length videos, suggesting that end-to-end learning with just a few sparsely sampled clips is often more accurate than using densely extracted offline features from full-length videos, proving the proverbial less-is-more principle. Videos in the datasets are from considerably different domains and lengths, ranging from 3-second generic-domain GIF videos to 180-second YouTube human activity videos, showing the generalization ability of our approach. Comprehensive ablation studies and thorough analyses are provided to dissect what factors lead to this success",

To address this problem, we propose a Discriminative Sample Meta-Mining (DSMM) approach in this paper.

Specifically, we sample an unbalanced train batch and a balanced meta-train batch for each iteration. Then we learn a meta-miner with the meta-gradient on the balanced meta-train batch. In the end, the samples in the unbalanced train batch are re-weighted by the learned meta-miner to optimize the kinship models.

In this paper, we propose an Accurate Quantized object Detection solution, termed AQD, to fully get rid of floating-point computation. To this end, we target using fixed-point operations in all kinds of layers, including the convolutional layers, normalization layers, and skip connections, allowing the inference to be executed using integer-only arithmetic. To demonstrate the improved latency-vs-accuracy trade-off, we apply the proposed methods on RetinaNet and FCOS. In particular, experimental results on MS-COCO dataset show that our AQD achieves comparable or even better performance compared with the full-precision counterpart under extremely low-bit schemes, which is of great practical value.

To tackle the challenge, this paper presents a general Multimodal Robust Learning framework (MRL) for learning with multimodal noisy labels to mitigate noisy samples and correlate distinct modalities simultaneously. To be specific, we propose a Robust Clustering loss (RC) to make the deep networks focus on clean samples instead of noisy ones. Besides, a simple yet effective multimodal loss function, called Multimodal Contrastive loss (MC), is proposed to maximize the mutual information between different modalities, thus alleviating the interference of noisy samples and cross-modal discrepancy.

    "abstract": "Recent supervised multi-view depth estimation networks have achieved promising results. Similar to all supervised approaches, these networks require ground-truth data during training. However, collecting a large amount of multi-view depth data is very challenging. Here, we propose a self-supervised learning framework for multi-view stereo that exploit pseudo labels from the input data. We start by learning to estimate depth maps as initial pseudo labels under an unsupervised learning framework relying on image reconstruction loss as supervision. We then refine the initial pseudo labels using a carefully designed pipeline leveraging depth information inferred from a higher resolution image and neighboring views. We use these high-quality pseudo labels as the supervision signal to train the network and improve, iteratively, its performance by self-training. Extensive experiments on the DTU dataset show that our proposed self-supervised learning framework outperforms existing unsupervised multi-view stereo networks by a large margin and performs on par compared to the supervised counterpart.

In the neighborhood of each coedge, a small collection of faces, edges and coedges can be identified and patterns in the feature vectors from these entities detected by specific learnable parameters. In addition, to encourage further deep learning research with B-reps, we publish the Fusion 360 Gallery segmentation dataset.

    "abstract": "Visual attributes constitute a large portion of information contained in a scene. Objects can be described using a wide variety of attributes which portray their visual appearance (color, texture), geometry (shape, size, posture), and other intrinsic properties (state, action). Existing work is mostly limited to study of attribute prediction in specific domains. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale in-the-wild visual attribute prediction dataset consisting of over 927K attribute annotations for over 260K object instances. Formally, object attribute prediction is a multi-label classification problem where all attributes that apply to an object must be predicted. Our dataset poses significant challenges to existing methods due to large number of attributes, label sparsity, data imbalance, and object occlusion. To this end, we propose several techniques that systematically tackle these challenges, including a base model that utilizes both low- and high-level CNN features with multi-hop attention, reweighting and resampling techniques, a novel negative label expansion scheme, and a novel supervised attribute-aware contrastive learning algorithm. Using these techniques, we achieve near 3.7 mAP and 5.7 overall F1 points improvement over the current state of the art.

We use an image-to-image translation network to encode motion priors of natural scenes collected from online videos, so that for a new photo, we can synthesize a corresponding motion field. The image is then animated using the generated motion through a deep warping technique: pixels are encoded as deep features, those features are warped via Eulerian motion, and the resulting warped feature maps are decoded as images. In order to produce continuous, seamlessly looping video textures, we propose a novel video looping technique that flows features both forward and backward in time and then blends the results. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method by applying it to a large collection of examples including beaches, waterfalls, and flowing rivers",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Localization Quality Estimation (LQE) is crucial and popular in the recent advancement of dense object detectors since it can provide accurate ranking scores that benefit the Non-Maximum Suppression processing and improve detection performance. As a common practice, most existing methods predict LQE scores through vanilla convolutional features shared with object classification or bounding box regression. In this paper, we explore a completely novel and different perspective to perform LQE -- based on the learned distributions of the four parameters of the bounding box. The bounding box distributions are inspired and introduced as \"General Distribution\" in GFLV1, which describes the uncertainty of the predicted bounding boxes well. Such a property makes the distribution statistics of a bounding box highly correlated to its real localization quality. Specifically, a bounding box distribution with a sharp peak usually corresponds to high localization quality, and vice versa. By leveraging the close correlation between distribution statistics and the real localization quality, we develop a considerably lightweight Distribution-Guided Quality Predictor (DGQP) for reliable LQE based on GFLV1, thus producing GFLV2. To our best knowledge, it is the first attempt in object detection to use a highly relevant, statistical representation to facilitate LQE. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Notably, GFLV2 (ResNet-101) achieves 46.2 AP at 14.6 FPS, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art ATSS baseline (43.6 AP at 14.6 FPS) by absolute 2.6 AP on COCO \\tt test-dev , without sacrificing the efficiency both in training and inference",

    "abstract": "In semi-supervised domain adaptation, a few labeled samples per class in the target domain guide features of the remaining target samples to aggregate around them. However, the trained model cannot produce a highly discriminative feature representation for the target domain because the training data is dominated by labeled samples from the source domain. This could lead to disconnection between the labeled and unlabeled target samples as well as misalignment between unlabeled target samples and the source domain. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Cross-domain Adaptive Clustering to address this problem. To achieve both inter-domain and intra-domain adaptation, we first introduce an adversarial adaptive clustering loss to group features of unlabeled target data into clusters and perform cluster-wise feature alignment across the source and target domains. We further apply pseudo labeling to unlabeled samples in the target domain and retain pseudo-labels with high confidence. Pseudo labeling expands the number of \"labeled\" samples in each class in the target domain, and thus produces a more robust and powerful cluster core for each class to facilitate adversarial learning.

To achieve a high level of accuracy, our network not only geometrically reasons about disparities but also infers slanted plane hypotheses allowing to more accurately perform geometric warping and upsampling operations. Our architecture is inherently multi-resolution allowing the propagation of information across different levels.

In this work, we show that this is harmful. We propose a method based on the Bayes' rule, that can naturally incorporate class imbalance into the Active Learning framework. We derive that three terms should be considered together when estimating the probability of a classifier making a mistake for a given sample; i) probability of mislabelling a class, ii) likelihood of the data given a predicted class, and iii) the prior probability on the abundance of a predicted class. Implementing these terms requires a generative model and an intractable likelihood estimation. Therefore, we train a Variational Auto Encoder (VAE) for this purpose. To further tie the VAE with the classifier and facilitate VAE training, we use the classifiers' deep feature representations as input to the VAE. By considering all three probabilities, among them especially the data imbalance, we can substantially improve the potential of existing methods under limited data budget. We show that our method can be applied to classification tasks on multiple different datasets -- including one that is a real-world dataset with heavy data imbalance -- significantly outperforming the state of the art",

However, existing methods for font generation are often in supervised learning. They require a large number of paired data, which is labor-intensive and expensive to collect. Besides, common image-to-image translation models often define style as the set of textures and colors, which cannot be directly applied to font generation. To address these problems, we propose novel deformable generative networks for unsupervised font generation (DG-Font). We introduce a feature deformation skip connection (FDSC) which predicts pairs of displacement maps and employs the predicted maps to apply deformable convolution to the low-level feature maps from the content encoder. The outputs of FDSC are fed into a mixer to generate the final results. Taking advantage of FDSC, the mixer outputs a high-quality character with a complete structure. To further improve the quality of generated images, we use three deformable convolution layers in the content encoder to learn style-invariant feature representations.

    "abstract": "The key to a successful cascade architecture for precise instance segmentation is to fully leverage the relationship between bounding box detection and mask segmentation across multiple stages. Although modern instance segmentation cascades achieve leading performance, they mainly make use of a unidirectional relationship, i.e., mask segmentation can benefit from iteratively refined bounding box detection. In this paper, we investigate an alternative direction, i.e., how to take the advantage of precise mask segmentation for bounding box detection in a cascade architecture. We propose a Deeply Shape-guided Cascade (DSC) for instance segmentation, which iteratively imposes the shape guidances extracted from mask prediction at previous stage on bounding box detection at current stage. It forms a bi-directional relationship between the two tasks by introducing three key components: (1) Initial shape guidance: A mask-supervised Region Proposal Network (mPRN) with the ability to generate class-agnostic masks; (2) Explicit shape guidance: A mask-guided region-of-interest (RoI) feature extractor, which employs mask segmentation at previous stage to focus feature extraction at current stage within a region aligned well with the shape of the instance-of-interest rather than a rectangular RoI; (3) Implicit shape guidance: A feature fusion operation which feeds intermediate mask features at previous stage to the bounding box head at current stage. Experimental results show that DSC outperforms the state-of-the-art instance segmentation cascade, Hybrid Task Cascade (HTC), by a large margin and achieves 51.8 box AP and 45.5 mask AP on COCO test-dev.

This paper alleviates the restrictive assumptions in existing methods.

Specifically, if at least three (or two) scene points share the same chromaticity, the proposed method uniquely recovers their surface normals and spectral reflectance with the illumination of more than or equal to four (or five) spectral lights.

We provide a detailed analysis of the characteristics of the Fashion IQ data, and present a transformer-based user simulator and interactive image retriever that can seamlessly integrate visual attributes with image features, user feedback, and dialog history, leading to improved performance over the state of the art in dialog-based image retrieval. We believe that our dataset will encourage further work on developing more natural and real-world applicable conversational shopping assistants",

    "abstract": "We present a new method for few-shot human motion transfer that achieves realistic human image generation with only a small number of appearance inputs. Despite recent advances in single person motion transfer, prior methods often require a large number of training images and take long training time. One promising direction is to perform few-shot human motion transfer, which only needs a few of source images for appearance transfer. However, it is particularly challenging to obtain satisfactory transfer results. In this paper, we address this issue by rendering a human texture map to a surface geometry (represented as a UV map), which is personalized to the source person. Our geometry generator combines the shape information from source images, and the pose information from 2D keypoints to synthesize the personalized UV map. A texture generator then generates the texture map conditioned on the texture of source images to fill out invisible parts. Furthermore, we may fine-tune the texture map on the manifold of the texture generator from a few source images at the test time, which improves the quality of the texture map without over-fitting or artifacts. Extensive experiments show the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Current works in image simulation either fail to be photorealistic or do not model the 3D environment and the dynamic objects within, losing high-level control and physical realism. In this paper, we present GeoSim, a geometry-aware image composition process which synthesizes novel urban driving scenarios by augmenting existing images with dynamic objects extracted from other scenes and rendered at novel poses. Towards this goal, we first build a diverse bank of 3D objects with both realistic geometry and appearance from sensor data. During simulation, we perform a novel geometry-aware simulation-by-composition procedure which 1) proposes plausible and realistic object placements into a given scene, 2) render novel views of dynamic objects from the asset bank, and 3) composes and blends the rendered image segments. The resulting synthetic images are realistic, traffic-aware, and geometrically consistent, allowing our approach to scale to complex use cases. We demonstrate two such important applications: long-range realistic video simulation across multiple camera sensors, and synthetic data generation for data augmentation on downstream segmentation tasks.

The introduction of optimal transport mitigates the constraint of many-to-one feature matching significantly while building up semantic correspondences between conditional inputs and exemplars. We design a novel unbalanced optimal transport to address the transport between features with deviational distributions which exists widely between conditional inputs and exemplars.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Although existing fully-supervised defocus blur detection (DBD) models significantly improve performance, training such deep models requires abundant pixel-level manual annotation, which is highly time-consuming and error-prone. Addressing this issue, this paper makes an effort to train a deep DBD model without using any pixel-level annotation. The core insight is that a defocus blur region/focused clear area can be arbitrarily pasted to a given realistic full blurred image/full clear image without affecting the judgment of the full blurred image/full clear image. Specifically, we train a generator G in an adversarial manner against dual discriminators Dc and Db. G learns to produce a DBD mask that generates a composite clear image and a composite blurred image through copying the focused area and unfocused region from corresponding source image to another full clear image and full blurred image. Then, Dc and Db can not distinguish them from realistic full clear image and full blurred image simultaneously, achieving a self-generated DBD by an implicit manner to define what a defocus blur area is. Besides, we propose a bilateral triplet-excavating constraint to avoid the degenerate problem caused by the case one discriminator defeats the other one. Comprehensive experiments on two widely-used DBD datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach. Source codes are available at: https://github.com/shangcai1/SG",

As for generalization problems in machine learning, the difficulty is balancing single-view accuracy (cf. training error; bias) with novel view accuracy (cf. test error; variance). We describe a class of models whose geometric rigidity is easily controlled to manage this tradeoff. We describe a cycle consistency loss that improves view generalization (roughly, a model from a generated view should predict the original view well). View generalization of textures requires that models share texture information, so a car seen from the back still has headlights because other cars have headlights. We describe a cycle consistency loss that encourages model textures to be aligned, so as to encourage sharing.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Whether what you see in Figure 1 is a \"flamingo\" or a \"bird\", is the question we ask in this paper. While fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) strives to arrive at the former, for the majority of us non-experts just \"bird\" would probably suffice. The real question is therefore -- how can we tailor for different fine-grained definitions under divergent levels of expertise. For that, we re-envisage the traditional setting of FGVC, from single-label classification, to that of top-down traversal of a pre-defined coarse-to-fine label hierarchy -- so that our answer becomes \"bird\"=\"Phoenicopteriformes\"=\"Phoenicopteridae\"=\"flamingo\". To approach this new problem, we first conduct a comprehensive human study where we confirm that most participants prefer multi-granularity labels, regardless whether they consider themselves experts. We then discover the key intuition that: coarse-level label prediction exacerbates fine-grained feature learning, yet fine-level feature betters the learning of coarse-level classifier. This discovery enables us to design a very simple albeit surprisingly effective solution to our new problem, where we (i) leverage level-specific classification heads to disentangle coarse-level features with fine-grained ones, and (ii) allow finer-grained features to participate in coarser-grained label predictions, which in turn helps with better disentanglement. Experiments show that our method achieves superior performance in the new FGVC setting, and performs better than state-of-the-art on traditional single-label FGVC problem as well. Thanks to its simplicity, our method can be easily implemented on top of any existing FGVC frameworks and is parameter-free. Codes are available at: https://github.com/PRIS-CV/Fine-Grained-or-Not",

Most visual navigation benchmarks, however, focus on navigating toward a target from a fixed starting point, guided by an elaborate set of instructions that depicts step-by-step. This approach deviates from real-world problems in which human-only describes what the object and its surrounding look like and asks the robot to start navigation from anywhere. Accordingly, in this paper, we introduce a Scenario Oriented Object Navigation (SOON) task. In this task, an agent is required to navigate from an arbitrary position in a 3D embodied environment to localize a target following a scene description. To give a promising direction to solve this task, we propose a novel graph-based exploration (GBE) method, which models the navigation state as a graph and introduces a novel graph-based exploration approach to learn knowledge from the graph and stabilize training by learning sub-optimal trajectories. We also propose a new large-scale benchmark named From Anywhere to Object (FAO) dataset. To avoid target ambiguity, the descriptions in FAO provide rich semantic scene information includes: object attribute, object relationship, region description, and nearby region description. Our experiments reveal that the proposed GBE outperforms various state-of-the-arts on both FAO and R2R datasets. And the ablation studies on FAO validates the quality of the dataset",

Suppose that the error bound is zero, i.e., lossless image compression, we formulate the joint optimization problem of compressing both the lossy image and the original residual in terms of variational auto-encoders and solve it with end-to-end training. To achieve scalable compression with the error bound larger than zero, we derive the probability model of the quantized residual by quantizing the learned probability model of the original residual, instead of training multiple networks. We further correct the bias of the derived probability model caused by the context mismatch between training and inference. Finally, the quantized residual is encoded according to the bias-corrected probability model and is concatenated with the bitstream of the compressed lossy image.

Therefore, we explore for the first time to learn the cross-modal knowledge at training stage, where both RGB and depth modalities are available, but test on the target dataset, where only single depth modality exists. Our key idea is to distill the knowledge of scene structural guidance from color modality to the single DSR task without changing its network architecture.

To reliably reconstruct a 3D hand from a monocular image, most state-of-the-art methods heavily rely on 3D annotations at the training stage, but obtaining 3D annotations is expensive. To alleviate reliance on labeled training data, we propose S2HAND, a self-supervised 3D hand reconstruction network that can jointly estimate pose, shape, texture, and the camera viewpoint. Specifically, we obtain geometric cues from the input image through easily accessible 2D detected keypoints. To learn an accurate hand reconstruction model from these noisy geometric cues, we utilize the consistency between 2D and 3D representations and propose a set of novel losses to rationalize outputs of the neural network. For the first time, we demonstrate the feasibility of training an accurate 3D hand reconstruction network without relying on manual annotations. Our experiments show that the proposed method achieves comparable performance with recent fully-supervised methods while using fewer supervision data",

    "abstract": "We propose a simple yet effective reflection-free cue for robust reflection removal from a pair of flash and ambient (no-flash) images. The reflection-free cue exploits a flash-only image obtained by subtracting the ambient image from the corresponding flash image in raw data space. The flash-only image is equivalent to an image taken in a dark environment with only a flash on. We observe that this flash-only image is visually reflection-free, and thus it can provide robust cues to infer the reflection in the ambient image. Since the flash-only image usually has artifacts, we further propose a dedicated model that not only utilizes the reflection-free cue but also avoids introducing artifacts, which helps accurately estimate reflection and transmission. Our experiments on real-world images with various types of reflection demonstrate the effectiveness of our model with reflection-free flash-only cues: our model outperforms state-of-the-art reflection removal approaches by more than 5.23dB in PSNR, 0.04 in SSIM, and 0.068 in LPIPS.

To verify this simplicity, we conduct extensive experiments on various GANs and datasets; and thanks to this simplicity, we are able to learn a semantic segmentation model for a trained GAN from a small number (e.g., 8) of labeled images.

The height maps themselves are reparameterized as the output of an untrained encoder-decoder convolutional neural network (CNN) with the raw camera images as the input, which effectively removes many reconstruction artifacts. Our method also jointly estimates both the camera's dynamic 6D pose and its distortion using a nonparametric model, the latter of which is especially important in mesoscopic applications when using cameras not designed for imaging at short working distances, such as smartphone cameras. We also propose strategies for reducing computation time and memory, applicable to other multi-frame registration problems.

This task is challenging since detecting and matching the same 3D keypoint observed from two very different camera views is difficult, making standard structure-from-motion (SfM) pipelines inapplicable. In such circumstances, treating people in the scene as \"keypoints\" and associating them across different camera views can be an alternative method for obtaining correspondences. Based on this intuition, we propose a method that uses ideas from person re-identification (re-ID) for wide-baseline camera calibration. Our method first employs a re-ID method to associate human bounding boxes across cameras, then converts bounding box correspondences to point correspondences, and finally solves for camera pose using multi-view geometry and bundle adjustment. Since our method does not require specialized calibration targets except for visible people, it applies to situations where frequent calibration updates are required. We perform extensive experiments on datasets captured from scenes of different sizes, camera settings (indoor and outdoor), and human activities (walking, playing basketball, construction).

We propose a transferability metric called Optimal Transport based Conditional Entropy (OTCE), to analytically predict the transfer performance for supervised classification tasks in such cross-domain and cross-task feature transfer settings. Our OTCE score characterizes transferability as a combination of domain difference and task difference, and explicitly evaluates them from data in a unified framework. Specifically, we use optimal transport to estimate domain difference and the optimal coupling between source and target distributions, which is then used to derive the conditional entropy of the target task (task difference). Experiments on the largest cross-domain dataset DomainNet and Office31 demonstrate that OTCE shows an average of 21% gain in the correlation with the ground truth transfer accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Moreover, we propose prior noise remapping, through linear perturbation parameters encoded from paired references, to facilitate supervised training and exemplar-based instance style control at test time.

We introduce a series of extensions to NeRF to address these issues, thereby enabling accurate reconstructions from unstructured image collections taken from the internet. We apply our system, dubbed NeRF-W, to internet photo collections of famous landmarks,and demonstrate temporally consistent novel view renderings that are significantly closer to photorealism than the prior state of the art",

    "abstract": "When in a new situation or geographical location, human drivers have an extraordinary ability to watch others and learn maneuvers that they themselves may have never performed. In contrast, existing techniques for learning to drive preclude such a possibility as they assume direct access to an instrumented ego-vehicle with fully known observations and expert driver actions. However, such measurements cannot be directly accessed for the non-ego vehicles when learning by watching others. Therefore, in an application where data is regarded as a highly valuable asset, current approaches completely discard the vast portion of the training data that can be potentially obtained through indirect observation of surrounding vehicles. Motivated by this key insight, we propose the Learning by Watching (LbW) framework which enables learning a driving policy without requiring full knowledge of neither the state nor expert actions. To increase its data, i.e., with new perspectives and maneuvers, LbW makes use of the demonstrations of other vehicles in a given scene by (1) transforming the ego-vehicle's observations to their points of view, and (2) inferring their expert actions. Our LbW agent learns more robust driving policies while enabling data-efficient learning, including quick adaptation of the policy to rare and novel scenarios. In particular, LbW drives robustly even with a fraction of available driving data required by existing methods, achieving an average success rate of 92% on the original CARLA benchmark with only 30 minutes of total driving data and 82% with only 10 minutes",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Face recognition has achieved a great success in recent years, it is still challenging to recognize those facial images with extreme poses. Traditional methods consider it as a domain gap problem. Many of them settle it by generating fake frontal faces from extreme ones, whereas they are tough to maintain the identity information with high computational consumption and uncontrolled disturbances. Our experimental analysis shows a dramatic precision drop with extreme poses. Meanwhile, those extreme poses just exist minor visual differences after small rotations. Derived from this insight, we attempt to relieve such a huge precision drop by making minor changes to the input images without modifying existing discriminators. A novel lightweight pseudo facial generation is proposed to relieve the problem of extreme poses without generating any frontal facial image. It can depict the facial contour information and make appropriate modifications to preserve the critical identity information. Specifically, the proposed method reconstructs pseudo profile faces by minimizing the pixel-wise differences with original profile faces and maintaining the identity consistent information from their corresponding frontal faces simultaneously. The proposed framework can improve existing discriminators and obtain a great promotion on several benchmark datasets",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Given a monocular face image as input, 3D face geometry reconstruction aims to recover a corresponding 3Dface mesh. Recently, both optimization-based and learning-based face reconstruction methods have taken advantage of the emerging differentiable renderer and shown promising results. However, the differentiable renderer, mainly based on graphics rules, simplifies the realistic mechanism of the illumination, reflection, etc., of the real world, thus can-not produce realistic images. This brings a lot of domain-shift noise to the optimization or training process. In this work, we introduce a novel Generative Adversarial Renderer (GAR) and propose to tailor its inverted version to the general fitting pipeline, to tackle the above problem. Specifically, the carefully designed neural renderer takes a face normal map and a latent code representing other fac-tors as inputs and renders a realistic face image. Since the GAR learns to model the complicated real-world image, instead of relying on the simplified graphics rules, it is capable of producing realistic images, which essentially inhibits the domain-shift noise in training and optimization. Equipped with the elaborated GAR, we further proposed a novel approach to predict 3D face parameters, in which we first obtain fine initial parameters via Renderer Invertingand then refine it with gradient-based optimizers. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed generative adversarial renderer and the novel optimization-based face reconstruction framework. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple face reconstruction datasets",

Unlike prior methods that focus on detecting low-level artifacts generated during the manipulation process, we use an image retrieval approach to tackle this problem. When given a spliced query image, our goal is to retrieve the original image from a database of authentic images. To achieve this goal, we propose representing an image by its constituent objects based on the intuition that the finest granularity of manipulations is oftentimes at the object-level. We introduce a framework, object embeddings for spliced image retrieval (OE-SIR), that utilizes modern object detectors to localize object regions. Each region is then embedded and collectively used to represent the image. Further, we propose a student-teacher training paradigm for learning discriminative embeddings within object regions to avoid expensive multiple forward passes. Detailed analysis of the efficacy of different feature embedding models is also provided in this study. Extensive experimental results show that the OE-SIR achieves state-of-the-art performance in spliced image retrieval",

In this paper, we present and integrate GrooMeD-NMS -- a novel Grouped Mathematically Differentiable NMS for monocular 3D object detection, such that the network is trained end-to-end with a loss on the boxes after NMS. We first formulate NMS as a matrix operation and then group and mask the boxes in an unsupervised manner to obtain a simple closed-form expression of the NMS. GrooMeD-NMS addresses the mismatch between training and inference pipelines and, therefore, forces the network to select the best 3D box in a differentiable manner.

    "abstract": "Human motion retargeting aims to transfer the motion of one person in a driving video or set of images to another person. Existing efforts leverage a long training video from each target person to train a subject-specific motion transfer model. However, the scalability of such methods is limited, as each model can only generate videos for the given target subject, and such training videos are labor-intensive to acquire and process. Few-shot motion transfer techniques, which only require one or a few images from a target, have recently drawn considerable attention. Methods addressing this task generally use either 2D or explicit 3D representations to transfer motion, and in doing so, sacrifice either accurate geometric modeling or the flexibility of an end-to-end learned representation. Inspired by the Transformable Bottleneck Network, which renders novel views and manipulations of rigid objects, we propose an approach based on an implicit volumetric representation of the image content, which can then be spatially manipulated using volumetric flow fields. We address the challenging question of how to aggregate information across different body poses, learning flow fields that allow for combining content from the appropriate regions of input images of highly non-rigid human subjects performing complex motions into a single implicit volumetric representation. This allows us to learn our 3D representation solely from videos of moving people. Armed with both 3D object understanding and end-to-end learned rendering, this categorically novel representation delivers state-of-the-art image generation quality, as shown by our quantitative and qualitative evaluations",

Almost all the existing DG ReID methods follow the same pipeline where they use a hybrid dataset from multiple source domains for training, and then directly apply the trained model to the unseen target domains for testing. These methods often neglect individual source domains' discriminative characteristics and their relevances w.r.t. the unseen target domains, though both of which can be leveraged to help the model's generalization. To handle the above two issues, we propose a novel method called the relevance-aware mixture of experts (RaMoE), using an effective voting-based mixture mechanism to dynamically leverage source domains' diverse characteristics to improve the model's generalization. Specifically, we propose a decorrelation loss to make the source domain networks (experts) keep the diversity and discriminability of individual domains' characteristics. Besides, we design a voting network to adaptively integrate all the experts' features into the more generalizable aggregated features with domain relevance. Considering the target domains' invisibility during training, we propose a novel learning-to-learn algorithm combined with our relation alignment loss to update the voting network.

Nevertheless, degradation estimation methods are usually time-consuming and may lead to SR failure due to large estimation errors.

Specifically, we learn abstract representations to distinguish various degradations in the representation space rather than explicit estimation in the pixel space. Moreover, we introduce a Degradation-Aware SR (DASR) network with flexible adaption to various degradations based on the learned representations.

To capture the dynamics in point cloud videos, point tracking is usually employed. However, as points may flow in and out across frames, computing accurate point trajectories is extremely difficult. Moreover, tracking usually relies on point colors and thus may fail to handle colorless point clouds. In this paper, to avoid point tracking, we propose a novel Point 4D Transformer (P4Transformer) network to model raw point cloud videos. Specifically, P4Transformer consists of (i) a point 4D convolution to embed the spatio-temporal local structures presented in a point cloud video and (ii) a transformer to capture the appearance and motion information across the entire video by performing self-attention on the embedded local features. In this fashion, related or similar local areas are merged with attention weight rather than by explicit tracking.

The model infers a latent 3D representation of the scene in the form of 3D feature points, where each continuous world 3D point is mapped to its corresponding feature vector. The model is trained for contrastive view prediction by rendering 3D feature clouds in queried viewpoints and matching against the 3D feature point cloud predicted from the query view. Notably, the representation can be queried for any 3D location, even if it is not visible from the input view. Our model brings together three powerful ideas of recent exciting research work: 3D feature grids as a neural bottleneck for view prediction, implicit functions for handling resolution limitations of 3D grids, and contrastive learning for unsupervised training of feature representations. We show the resulting 3D visual feature representations effectively scale across objects and scenes, imagine information occluded or missing from the input viewpoints, track objects over time, align semantically related objects in 3D, and improve 3D object detection. We outperform many existing state-of-the-art methods for 3D feature learning and view prediction, which are either limited by 3D grid spatial resolution, do not attempt to build amodal 3D representations, or do not handle combinatorial scene variability due to their non-convolutional bottlenecks",

To address this problem, we first investigate the performance bottleneck of the two-stage learning framework via ablative study. Motivated by our discovery, we develop a unified distribution alignment strategy for long-tail visual recognition. Particularly, we first propose an adaptive calibration strategy for each data point to calibrate its classification scores. Then we introduce a generalized re-weight method to incorporate the class prior, which provides a flexible and unified solution to copy with diverse scenarios of various visual recognition tasks. We validate our method by extensive experiments on four tasks, including image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation. Our approach achieves the state-of-the-art results across all four recognition tasks with a simple and unified framework",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Learning discriminative representation using large-scale face datasets in the wild is crucial for real-world applications, yet it remains challenging. The difficulties lie in many aspects and this work focus on computing resource constraint and long-tailed class distribution. Recently, classification-based representation learning with deep neural networks and well-designed losses have demonstrated good recognition performance. However, the computing and memory cost linearly scales up to the number of identities (classes) in the training set, and the learning process suffers from unbalanced classes. In this work, we propose a dynamic class queue (DCQ) to tackle these two problems. Specifically, for each iteration during training, a subset of classes for recognition are dynamically selected and their class weights are dynamically generated on-the-fly which are stored in a queue. Since only a subset of classes is selected for each iteration, the computing requirement is reduced. By using a single server without model parallel, we empirically verify in large-scale datasets that 10% of classes are sufficient to achieve similar performance as using all classes. Moreover, the class weights are dynamically generated in a few-shot manner and therefore suitable for tail classes with only a few instances. We show clear improvement over a strong baseline in the largest public dataset Megaface Challenge2 (MF2) which has 672K identities and over 88% of them have less than 10 instances.

In particular, our proposed cross-modal center loss minimizes the distances of features from objects belonging to the same class across all modalities. Extensive experiments have been conducted on the retrieval tasks across multi-modalities including 2D image, 3D point cloud and mesh data.

    "abstract": "Scene flow depicts the dynamics of a 3D scene, which is critical for various applications such as autonomous driving, robot navigation, AR/VR, etc. Conventionally, scene flow is estimated from dense/regular RGB video frames. With the development of depth-sensing technologies, precise 3D measurements are available via point clouds which have sparked new research in 3D scene flow. Nevertheless, it remains challenging to extract scene flow from point clouds due to the sparsity and irregularity in typical point cloud sampling patterns. One major issue related to irregular sampling is identified as the randomness during point set abstraction/feature extraction---an elementary process in many flow estimation scenarios. A novel Spatial Abstraction with Attention (SA^2) layer is accordingly proposed to alleviate the unstable abstraction problem. Moreover, a Temporal Abstraction with Attention (TA^2) layer is proposed to rectify attention in temporal domain, leading to benefits with motions scaled in a larger range.

    "abstract": "Learning to recognize actions from only a handful of labeled videos is a challenging problem due to the scarcity of tediously collected activity labels. We approach this problem by learning a two-pathway temporal contrastive model using unlabeled videos at two different speeds leveraging the fact that changing video speed does not change an action. Specifically, we propose to maximize the similarity between encoded representations of the same video at two different speeds as well as minimize the similarity between different videos played at different speeds. This way we use the rich supervisory information in terms of `time' that is present in otherwise unsupervised pool of videos. With this simple yet effective strategy of manipulating video playback rates, we considerably outperform video extensions of sophisticated state-of-the-art semi-supervised image recognition methods across multiple diverse benchmark datasets and network architectures. Interestingly, our proposed approach benefits from out-of-domain unlabeled videos showing generalization and robustness. We also perform rigorous ablations and analysis to validate our approach.

To date, top-performing VIS methods extend the two-stage Mask R-CNN by adding a tracking branch, leaving plenty of room for improvement.

SG-Net demonstrates four advantages: 1) Our task heads (detection, segmentation, and tracking) are crafted interdependently so they can effectively share features and enjoy the joint optimization; 2) Each of our task predictions avoids using proposal-based RoI features, resulting in much reduced runtime complexity per instance; 3) Our mask prediction is dynamically performed on the sub-regions of each detected instance, leading to high-quality masks of fine granularity; 4) Our tracking head models objects' centerness movements for tracking, which effectively enhances the tracking robustness to different object appearances. In evaluation, we present state-of-the-art comparisons on the YouTube-VIS dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our compact one-stage method can achieve improved performance in both accuracy and inference speed.

We propose to explicitly model the Actor-Context-Actor Relation, which is the relation between two actors based on their interactions with the context.

Experiments on AVA and UCF101-24 datasets show the advantages of modeling actor-context-actor relations, and visualization of attention maps further verifies that our model is capable of finding relevant higher-order relations to support action detection.

In this paper, we propose a cross-view cross-scene (CVCS) multi-view crowd counting paradigm, where the training and testing occur on different scenes with arbitrary camera layouts. To dynamically handle the challenge of optimal view fusion under scene and camera layout change and non-correspondence noise due to camera calibration errors or erroneous features, we propose a CVCS model that attentively selects and fuses multiple views together using camera layout geometry, and a noise view regularization method to train the model to handle non-correspondence errors. We also generate a large synthetic multi-camera crowd counting dataset with a large number of scenes and camera views to capture many possible variations, which avoids the difficulty of collecting and annotating such a large real dataset. We then test our trained CVCS model on real multi-view counting datasets, by using unsupervised domain transfer.

To exploit depth information in mirror segmentation, we first construct a large-scale RGB-D mirror segmentation dataset, which we subsequently employ to train a novel depth-aware mirror segmentation framework. Our mirror segmentation framework first locates the mirrors based on color and depth discontinuities and correlations.

There exists a significant gap between the architectures in search and evaluation. As a result, current methods suffer from an inconsistent, inefficient, and inflexible search process. In this paper, we introduce EnTranNAS that is composed of Engine-cells and Transit-cells. The Engine-cell is differentiable for architecture search, while the Transit-cell only transits a sub-graph by architecture derivation. Consequently, the gap between the architectures in search and evaluation is significantly reduced. Our method also spares much memory and computation cost, which speeds up the search process. A feature sharing strategy is introduced for more balanced optimization and more efficient search. Furthermore, we develop an architecture derivation method to replace the traditional one that is based on a hand-crafted rule. Our method enables differentiable sparsification, and keeps the derived architecture equivalent to that of Engine-cell, which further improves the consistency between search and evaluation. More importantly, it supports the search for topology where a node can be connected to prior nodes with any number of connections, so that the searched architectures could be more flexible. Our search on CIFAR-10 has an error rate of 2.22% with only 0.07 GPU-day.

    "abstract": "Recently, a large number of channel attention blocks are proposed to boost the representational power of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). These approaches commonly learn the relationship between global contexts and attention activations by using fully-connected layers or linear transformations. However, we empirically find that though many parameters are introduced, these attention blocks may not learn the relationship well. In this paper, we hypothesize that the relationship is predetermined. Based on this hypothesis, we propose a simple yet extremely efficient channel attention block, called Gaussian Context Transformer (GCT), which achieves contextual feature excitation using a Gaussian function that satisfies the presupposed relationship. According to whether the standard deviation of the Gaussian function is learnable, we develop two versions of GCT: GCT-B0 and GCT-B1. GCT-B0 is a parameter-free channel attention block by fixing the standard deviation. It directly maps global contexts to attention activations without learning. In contrast, GCT-B1 is a parameterized channel attention block, which adaptively learns the standard deviation to enhance the mapping ability. Extensive experiments on ImageNet and MS COCO benchmarks demonstrate that our GCTs lead to consistent improvements across various deep CNNs and detectors. Compared with a bank of state-of-the-art channel attention blocks, such as SE and ECA , our GCTs are superior in effectiveness and efficiency",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Many recent 6D pose estimation methods exploited object 3D models to generate synthetic images for training because labels come for free. However, due to the domain shift of data distributions between real images and synthetic images, the network trained only on synthetic images fails to capture robust features in real images for 6D pose estimation. We propose to solve this problem by making the network insensitive to different domains, rather than taking the more difficult route of forcing synthetic images to be similar to real images. Inspired by domain adaption methods, a Domain Adaptive Keypoints Detection Network (DAKDN) including a domain adaption layer is used to minimize the discrepancy of deep features between synthetic and real images. A unique challenge here is the lack of ground truth labels (i.e., keypoints) for real images. Fortunately, the geometry relations between keypoints are invariant under real/synthetic domains. Hence, we propose to use the domain-invariant geometry structure among keypoints as a \"bridge\" constraint to optimize DAKDN for 6D pose estimation across domains. Specifically, DAKDN employs a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) block to learn the geometry structure from synthetic images and uses the GCN to guide the training for real images. The 6D poses of objects are calculated using Perspective-n-Point (PnP) algorithm based on the predicted keypoints. Experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches without manual poses labels and competes with approaches using manual poses labels",

This key advantage, along with the increasing popularity of burst photography, have made MFSR an important problem for real-world applications. We propose a novel architecture for the burst super-resolution task. Our network takes multiple noisy RAW images as input, and generates a denoised, super-resolved RGB image as output. This is achieved by explicitly aligning deep embeddings of the input frames using pixel-wise optical flow. The information from all frames are then adaptively merged using an attention-based fusion module. In order to enable training and evaluation on real-world data, we additionally introduce the BurstSR dataset, consisting of smartphone bursts and high-resolution DSLR ground-truth.

    "title": "Transferable Semantic Augmentation for Domain Adaptation",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Domain adaptation has been widely explored by transferring the knowledge from a label-rich source domain to a related but unlabeled target domain. Most existing domain adaptation algorithms attend to adapting feature representations across two domains with the guidance of a shared source-supervised classifier. However, such classifier limits the generalization ability towards unlabeled target recognition. To remedy this, we propose a Transferable Semantic Augmentation (TSA) approach to enhance the classifier adaptation ability through implicitly generating source features towards target semantics. Specifically, TSA is inspired by the fact that deep feature transformation towards a certain direction can be represented as meaningful semantic altering in the original input space. Thus, source features can be augmented to effectively equip with target semantics to train a more transferable classifier. To achieve this, for each class, we first use the inter-domain feature mean difference and target intra-class feature covariance to construct a multivariate normal distribution. Then we augment source features with random directions sampled from the distribution class-wisely. Interestingly, such source augmentation is implicitly implemented through an expected transferable cross-entropy loss over the augmented source distribution, where an upper bound of the expected loss is derived and minimized, introducing negligible computational overhead. As a light-weight and general technique, TSA can be easily plugged into various domain adaptation methods, bringing remarkable improvements. Comprehensive experiments on cross-domain benchmarks validate the efficacy of TSA",

Different from prior works that model such distributions implicitly with a top-down latent variable model (i.e., generator), in this work, we propose to explicitly represent the statistical distribution within a single natural image by using an energy-based generative framework, where a pyramid of energy functions parameterized by bottom-up deep neural networks, are used to capture the distributions of patches at different resolutions. Meanwhile, a coarse-to-fine sequential training and sampling strategy is presented to train the model efficiently. Besides learning to generate random samples from white noise, the model can learn in parallel to recover a real image from its incomplete version, which can improve the descriptive power of the learned models. The proposed model not only is simple and natural in that it does not require auxiliary models (e.g., discriminators) to assist the training, but also unifies internal statistics learning and image generation in a single framework.

It aims at explaining distributions of unlabeled visual images by clustering them via a parameterized model of appearance. Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCN) have recently been one of the most popular clustering methods. However, it has reached some limitations. Firstly, it is quite sensitive to hard or noisy samples. Secondly, it is hard to investigate with various deep network models due to its computational training time. Finally, it is hard to design an end-to-end training model between the deep feature extraction and GCN clustering modeling. This work therefore presents the Clusformer, a simple but new perspective of Transformer based approach, to automatic visual clustering via its unsupervised attention mechanism. The proposed method is able to robustly deal with noisy or hard samples. It is also flexible and effective to collaborate with different deep network models with various model sizes in an end-to-end framework.

To make this computational tractable, we first cluster all frame activations along the temporal dimension based on their similarity with respect to the classification task, and then temporally aggregate the frames in the clusters into a smaller number of representations. Our method is end-to-end trainable and computationally efficient as it relies on temporally localized clustering in combination with fast Hamming distances in feature space.

Although many feed-forward networks produce high-quality binary segmentation on different types of images, their final result heavily relies on the post-processing step, which separates instances from the binary mask. In comparison, the existing iterative methods extract a single object at a time using discriminative knowledge-based properties (e.g., shapes, boundaries, etc.) without relying on post-processing. However, they do not scale well with a large number of objects. To exploit the advantages of conventional sequential segmentation methods without impairing the scalability, we propose a novel iterative deep reinforcement learning agent that learns how to differentiate multiple objects in parallel. By constructing a relational graph between pixels, we design a reward function that encourages separating pixels of different objects and grouping pixels that belong to the same instance. We demonstrate that the proposed method can efficiently perform instance segmentation of many objects without heavy post-processing",

    "abstract": "We tackle the problem of visual search under resource constraints. Existing systems use the same embedding model to compute representations (embeddings) for the query and gallery images. Such systems inherently face a hard accuracy-efficiency trade-off: the embedding model needs to be large enough to ensure high accuracy, yet small enough to enable query-embedding computation on resource-constrained platforms. This trade-off could be mitigated if gallery embeddings are generated from a large model and query embeddings are extracted using a compact model. The key to building such a system is to ensure representation compatibility between the query and gallery models. In this paper, we address two forms of compatibility: One enforced by modifying the parameters of each model that computes the embeddings. The other by modifying the architectures that compute the embeddings, leading to compatibility-aware neural architecture search (CMP-NAS). We test CMP-NAS on challenging retrieval tasks for fashion images (DeepFashion2), and face images (IJB-C). Compared to ordinary (homogeneous) visual search using the largest embedding model (paragon), CMP-NAS achieves 80-fold and 23-fold cost reduction while maintaining accuracy within 0.3% and 1.6% of the paragon on DeepFashion2 and IJB-C respectively",

Due to the high illness of the problem and the complex unknown degradation, directly training a deep neural network (DNN) usually cannot lead to acceptable results. Existing generative adversarial network (GAN) based methods can produce better results but tend to generate over-smoothed restorations. In this work, we propose a new method by first learning a GAN for high-quality face image generation and embedding it into a U-shaped DNN as a prior decoder, then fine-tuning the GAN prior embedded DNN with a set of synthesized low-quality face images.

    "abstract": "Language-queried video actor segmentation aims to predict the pixel-level mask of the actor which performs the actions described by a natural language query in the target frames. Existing methods adopt 3D CNNs over the video clip as a general encoder to extract a mixed spatio-temporal feature for the target frame. Though 3D convolutions are amenable to recognizing which actor is performing the queried actions, it also inevitably introduces misaligned spatial information from adjacent frames, which confuses features of the target frame and yields inaccurate segmentation. Therefore, we propose a collaborative spatial-temporal encoder-decoder framework which contains a 3D temporal encoder over the video clip to recognize the queried actions, and a 2D spatial encoder over the target frame to accurately segment the queried actors. In the decoder, a Language-Guided Feature Selection (LGFS) module is proposed to flexibly integrate spatial and temporal features from the two encoders. We also propose a Cross-Modal Adaptive Modulation (CMAM) module to dynamically recombine spatial- and temporal-relevant linguistic features for multimodal feature interaction in each stage of the two encoders. Our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance on two popular benchmarks with less computational overhead than previous approaches",

Currently, optimization-based methods have achieved great stylization quality, but expensive time cost restricts their practical applications. Meanwhile, feed-forward methods still fail to synthesize complex style, especially when holistic global and local patterns exist. Inspired by the common painting process of drawing a draft and revising the details, we introduce a novel feed-forward method Laplacian Pyramid Network (LapStyle). LapStyle first transfers global style pattern in low-resolution via a Drafting Network. It then revises the local details in high-resolution via a Revision Network, which hallucinates a residual image according to the draft and the image textures extracted by Laplacian filtering. Higher resolution details can be easily generated by stacking Revision Networks with multiple Laplacian pyramid levels. The final stylized image is obtained by aggregating outputs of all pyramid levels. Experiments demonstrate that our method can synthesize high quality stylized images in real time, where holistic style patterns are properly transferred",

    "abstract": "Recognition tasks, such as object recognition and keypoint estimation, have seen widespread adoption in recent years. Most state-of-the-art methods for these tasks use deep networks that are computationally expensive and have huge memory footprints. This makes it exceedingly difficult to deploy these systems on low power embedded devices. Hence, the importance of decreasing the storage requirements and the amount of computation in such models is paramount. The recently proposed Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) states that deep neural networks trained on large datasets contain smaller subnetworks that achieve on par performance as the dense networks. In this work, we perform the first empirical study investigating LTH for model pruning in the context of object detection, instance segmentation, and keypoint estimation. Our studies reveal that lottery tickets obtained from ImageNet pretraining do not transfer well to the downstream tasks. We provide guidance on how to find lottery tickets with up to 80% overall sparsity on different sub-tasks without incurring any drop in the performance. Finally, we analyse the behavior of trained tickets with respect to various task attributes such as object size, frequency, and difficulty of detection",

Our approach first fuses the language and the visual features at the bottom level to generate a heatmap that coarsely localizes the relevant regions in the RGBD image. Then our approach conducts an adaptive feature learning based on the heatmap and performs the object-level matching with another visio-linguistic fusion to finally ground the referred object. We evaluate the proposed method by comparing to the state-of-the-art methods on both the RGBD images extracted from the ScanRefer dataset and our newly collected SUNRefer dataset.

Previous attempts to linearize DNNs have led to interesting theoretical insights, but have not impacted the practice due to the substantial performance gap compared to standard non-linear optimization. We present the first method for linearizing a pre-trained model that achieves comparable performance to non-linear fine-tuning on most of real-world image classification tasks tested, thus enjoying the interpretability of linear models without incurring punishing losses in performance. LQF consists of simple modifications to the architecture, loss function and optimization typically used for classification: Leaky-ReLU instead of ReLU, mean squared loss instead of cross-entropy, and pre-conditioning using Kronecker factorization. None of these changes in isolation is sufficient to approach the performance of non-linear fine-tuning.

    "abstract": "Video-based person re-identification (Re-ID) aims to automatically retrieve video sequences of the same person under non-overlapping cameras. To achieve this goal, it is the key to fully utilize abundant spatial and temporal cues in videos. Existing methods usually focus on the most conspicuous image regions, thus they may easily miss out fine-grained clues due to the person varieties in image sequences. To address above issues, in this paper, we propose a novel Global-guided Reciprocal Learning (GRL) framework for video-based person Re-ID. Specifically, we first propose a Global-guided Correlation Estimation (GCE) to generate feature correlation maps of local features and global features, which help to localize the high- and low-correlation regions for identifying the same person. After that, the discriminative features are disentangled into high-correlation features and low-correlation features under the guidance of the global representations. Moreover, a novel Temporal Reciprocal Learning (TRL) mechanism is designed to sequentially enhance the high-correlation semantic information and accumulate the low-correlation sub-critical clues. Extensive experiments are conducted on three public benchmarks. The experimental results indicate that our approach can achieve better performance than other state-of-the-art approaches.

The transformer encoder promotes the target templates via attention-based feature reinforcement, which benefits the high-quality tracking model generation. The transformer decoder propagates the tracking cues from previous templates to the current frame, which facilitates the object searching process.

However, the lack of temporally consistent handling of plausible clothing dynamics, including fine and high-frequency details, significantly limits the attainable visual quality. We address these limitations for the first time in the literature and present a new framework which performs high-fidelity and temporally-consistent human motion transfer with natural pose-dependent non-rigid deformations, for several types of loose garments. In contrast to the previous techniques, we perform image generation in three subsequent stages: synthesizing human shape, structure, and appearance. Given a monocular RGB video of an actor, we train a stack of recurrent deep neural networks that generate these intermediate representations from 2D poses and their temporal derivatives. Splitting the difficult motion transfer problem into subtasks that are aware of the temporal motion context helps us to synthesize results with plausible dynamics and pose-dependent detail. It also allows artistic control of results by manipulation of individual framework stages. In the experimental results, we significantly outperform the state-of-the-art in terms of video realism.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Existing 3D human pose estimators suffer poor generalization performance to new datasets, largely due to the limited diversity of 2D-3D pose pairs in the training data. To address this problem, we present PoseAug, a new auto-augmentation framework that learns to augment the available training poses towards a greater diversity and thus improve generalization of the trained 2D-to-3D pose estimator. Specifically, PoseAug introduces a novel pose augmentor that learns to adjust various geometry factors (e.g., posture, body size, view point and position) of a pose through differentiable operations. With such differentiable capacity, the augmentor can be jointly optimized with the 3D pose estimator and take the estimation error as feedback to generate more diverse and harder poses in an online manner. Moreover, PoseAug introduces a novel part-aware Kinematic Chain Space for evaluating local joint-angle plausibility and develops a discriminative module accordingly to ensure the plausibility of the augmented poses. These elaborate designs enable PoseAug to generate more diverse yet plausible poses than existing offline augmentation methods, and thus yield better generalization of the pose estimator. PoseAug is generic and easy to be applied to various 3D pose estimators. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PoseAug brings clear improvements on both intra-scenario and cross-scenario datasets. Notably, it achieves 88.6% 3D PCK on MPI-INF-3DHP under cross-dataset evaluation setup, improving upon the previous best data augmentation based method by 9.1%.

Our method can be thought of as performing twin-surface extrapolation, rather than interpolation, in these regions. Next our method fuses these extrapolated surfaces into a single depth image leveraging the image data. Key to our method is the use of an asymmetric loss function that operates on a novel twin-surface representation. This enables us to train a network to simultaneously do surface extrapolation and surface fusion. We characterize our loss function and compare with other common losses.

In this paper, we investigate efficient annotation strategies for collecting multi-class classification labels for a large collection of images. While methods that exploit learnt models for labeling exist, a surprisingly prevalent approach is to query humans for a fixed number of labels per datum and aggregate them, which is expensive. Building on prior work on online joint probabilistic modeling of human annotations and machine-generated beliefs, we propose modifications and best practices aimed at minimizing human labeling effort. Specifically, we make use of advances in self-supervised learning, view annotation as a semi-supervised learning problem, identify and mitigate pitfalls and ablate several key design choices to propose effective guidelines for labeling. Our analysis is done in a more realistic simulation that involves querying human labelers, which uncovers issues with evaluation using existing worker simulation methods. Simulated experiments on a 125k image subset of the ImageNet100 show that it can be annotated to 80% top-1 accuracy with 0.35 annotations per image on average, a 2.7x and 6.7x improvement over prior work and manual annotation, respectively",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Instance segmentation has witnessed a remarkable progress on class-balanced benchmarks. However, they fail to perform as accurately in real-world scenarios, where the category distribution of objects naturally comes with a long tail. Instances of head classes dominate a long-tailed dataset and they serve as negative samples of tail categories. The overwhelming gradients of negative samples on tail classes lead to a biased learning process for classifiers. Consequently, objects of tail categories are more likely to be misclassified as backgrounds or head categories. To tackle this problem, we propose Seesaw Loss to dynamically re-balance gradients of positive and negative samples for each category, with two complementary factors, i.e., mitigation factor and compensation factor. The mitigation factor reduces punishments to tail categories w.r.t. the ratio of cumulative training instances between different categories. Meanwhile, the compensation factor increases the penalty of misclassified instances to avoid false positives of tail categories. We conduct extensive experiments on Seesaw Loss with mainstream frameworks and different data sampling strategies. With a simple end-to-end training pipeline, Seesaw Loss obtains significant gains over Cross-Entropy Loss, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on LVIS dataset without bells and whistles.

In contrast to state-of-the-art approaches that model the geometry and material properties explicitly, or are purely image-based, we introduce an implicit representation of the head based on scene representation networks. To handle the dynamics of the face, we combine our scene representation network with a low-dimensional morphable model which provides explicit control over pose and expressions. We use volumetric rendering to generate images from this hybrid representation and demonstrate that such a dynamic neural scene representation can be learned from monocular input data only, without the need of a specialized capture setup.

    "abstract": "Face recognition is greatly improved by deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Recently, these face recognition models have been used for identity authentication in security sensitive applications. However, deep CNNs are vulnerable to adversarial patches, which are physically realizable and stealthy, raising new security concerns on the real-world applications of these models. In this paper, we evaluate the robustness of face recognition models using adversarial patches based on transferability, where the attacker has limited accessibility to the target models. First, we extend the existing transfer-based attack techniques to generate transferable adversarial patches. However, we observe that the transferability is sensitive to initialization and degrades when the perturbation magnitude is large, indicating the overfitting to the substitute models. Second, we propose to regularize the adversarial patches on the low dimensional data manifold. The manifold is represented by generative models pre-trained on legitimate human face images. Using face-like features as adversarial perturbations through optimization on the manifold, we show that the gaps between the responses of substitute models and the target models dramatically decrease, exhibiting a better transferability. Extensive digital world experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in the black-box setting. We apply the proposed method in the physical world as well",

Local and global information are encoded in a combined embedding. A denoising pretext task provides the network with the needed local cues, decoupled from the high-level semantics and naturally shared over multiple classes. On the other hand, contrastive learning maximizes the agreement between variants of the same shape with different missing portions, thus producing a representation which captures the global appearance of the shape. The combined embedding inherits category-agnostic properties from the chosen pretext tasks. Differently from existing approaches, this allows to better generalize the completion properties to new categories unseen at training time. Moreover, while decoding the obtained joint representation, we better blend the reconstructed missing part with the partial shape by paying attention to its known surrounding region and reconstructing this frame as auxiliary objective. Our extensive experiments and detailed ablation on the ShapeNet dataset show the effectiveness of each part of the method with new state of the art results.

These policies are derived with a two-head lightweight selection network conditioned on each input video clip. Then, only frames and convolutions that are selected by the selection network are used in the 3D model to generate predictions. The selection network is optimized with policy gradient methods to maximize a reward that encourages making correct predictions with limited computation. We conduct experiments on three video recognition benchmarks and demonstrate that our method achieves similar accuracies to state-of-the-art 3D models while requiring 20%-50% less computation across different datasets.

    "abstract": "In most existing learning systems, images are typically viewed as 2D pixel arrays. However, in another paradigm gaining popularity, a 2D image is represented as an implicit neural representation (INR) -- an MLP that predicts an RGB pixel value given its (x,y) coordinate. In this paper, we propose two novel architectural techniques for building INR-based image decoders: factorized multiplicative modulation and multi-scale INRs, and use them to build a state-of-the-art continuous image GAN. Previous attempts to adapt INRs for image generation were limited to MNIST-like datasets and do not scale to complex real-world data. Our proposed INR-GAN architecture improves the performance of continuous image generators by several times, greatly reducing the gap between continuous image GANs and pixel-based ones. Apart from that, we explore several exciting properties of the INR-based decoders, like out-of-the-box superresolution, meaningful image-space interpolation, accelerated inference of low-resolution images, an ability to extrapolate outside of image boundaries, and strong geometric prior.

Besides, parameters of V-planes depend on camera yaw rotation, but translation-invariant CNNs are less aware of the yaw change. We thus propose a yaw-invariant V-planar reparameterization for CNNs to learn. We create a benchmark for indoor panorama planar reconstruction by extending existing 360 depth datasets with ground truth H&V-planes (referred to as \"PanoH&V\" dataset) and adopt state-of-the-art planar reconstruction methods to predict H&V-planes as our baselines.

However, such activation maps usually highlight the local discriminative regions rather than the whole object, which deviates from the requirement of semantic segmentation. To explore more comprehensive class-specific activation maps, we propose an Embedded Discriminative Attention Mechanism (EDAM) by integrating the activation map generation into the classification network directly for WSSS. Specifically, a Discriminative Activation (DA) layer is designed to explicitly produce a series of normalized class-specific masks, which are then used to generate class-specific pixel-level pseudo-labels demanded in segmentation. For learning the pseudo-labels, the masks are multiplied with the feature maps after the backbone to generate the discriminative activation maps, each of which encodes the specific information of the corresponding category in the input images. Given such class-specific activation maps, a Collaborative Multi-Attention (CMA) module is proposed to extract the collaborative information of each given category from images in a batch. In inference, we directly use the activation masks from the DA layer as pseudo-labels for segmentation. Based on the generated pseudo-labels, we achieve the mIoU of 70:60% on PASCAL VOC 2012 segmentation test set, which is the new state-of-the-art, to our best knowledge.

    "abstract": "A crucial component for the scene text based reasoning required for TextVQA and TextCaps datasets involve detecting and recognizing text present in the images using an optical character recognition (OCR) system. The current systems are crippled by the unavailability of ground truth text annotations for these datasets as well as lack of scene text detection and recognition datasets on real images disallowing the progress in the field of OCR and evaluation of scene text based reasoning in isolation from OCR systems. In this work, we propose TextOCR, an arbitrary-shaped scene text detection and recognition with 900k annotated words collected on real images from TextVQA dataset. We show that current state-of-the-art text-recognition (OCR) models fail to perform well on TextOCR and that training on TextOCR helps achieve state-of-the-art performance on multiple other OCR datasets as well. We use a TextOCR trained OCR model to create PixelM4C model which can do scene text based reasoning on an image in an end-to-end fashion, allowing us to revisit several design choices to achieve new state-of-the-art performance on TextVQA dataset",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "A practical long-term tracker typically contains three key properties, i.e., an efficient model design, an effective global re-detection strategy and a robust distractor awareness mechanism. However, most state-of-the-art long-term trackers (e.g., Pseudo and re-detecting based ones) do not take all three key properties into account and therefore may either be time-consuming or drift to distractors. To address the issues, we propose a two-task tracking framework (named DMTrack), which utilizes two core components (i.e., one-shot detection and re-identification (re-id) association) to achieve distractor-aware fast tracking via Dynamic convolutions (d-convs) and Multiple object tracking (MOT) philosophy. To achieve precise and fast global detection, we construct a lightweight one-shot detector using a novel dynamic convolutions generation method, which provides a unified and more flexible way for fusing target information into the search field. To distinguish the target from distractors, we resort to the philosophy of MOT to reason distractors explicitly by maintaining all potential similarities' tracklets. Benefited from the strength of high recall detection and explicit object association, our tracker achieves state-of-the-art performance on the LaSOT, OxUvA, TLP, VOT2018LT and VOT2019LT benchmarks and runs in real-time (3x faster than comparisons)",

    "abstract": "Self-attention has the promise of improving computer vision systems due to parameter-independent scaling of receptive fields and content-dependent interactions, in contrast to parameter-dependent scaling and content-independent interactions of convolutions. Self-attention models have recently been shown to have encouraging improvements on accuracy-parameter trade-offs compared to baseline convolutional models such as ResNet-50. In this work, we develop self-attention models that can outperform not just the canonical baseline models, but even the high-performing convolutional models. We propose two extensions to self-attention that, in conjunction with a more efficient implementation of self-attention, improve the speed, memory usage, and accuracy of these models. We leverage these improvements to develop a new self-attention model family, HaloNets, which reach state-of-the-art accuracies on the parameter-limited setting of the ImageNet classification benchmark. In preliminary transfer learning experiments, we find that HaloNet models outperform much larger models and have better inference performance. On harder tasks such as object detection and instance segmentation, our simple local self-attention and convolutional hybrids show improvements over very strong baselines. These results mark another step in demonstrating the efficacy of self-attention models on settings traditionally dominated by convolutions",

Specifically, we adopt a multi-scale joint optimization framework to first model the coherence priors and then accordingly interleavingly optimize image inpainting and semantic segmentation in a coarse-to-fine manner. A Semantic-Wise Attention Propagation (SWAP) module is devised to refine completed image textures across scales by exploring non-local semantic coherence, which effectively mitigates mix-up of textures. We also propose two coherence losses to constrain the consistency between the semantics and the inpainted image in terms of the overall structure and detailed textures.

In this paper, we propose a novel multi-source domain adaptation framework based on collaborative learning for semantic segmentation.

Then, to fully exploit the essential semantic information across source domains, we propose a collaborative learning method for domain adaptation without seeing any data from target domain. In addition, similar to the setting of unsupervised domain adaptation, unlabeled target domain data is leveraged to further improve the performance of domain adaptation. This is achieved by additionally constraining the outputs of multiple adaptation models with pseudo labels online generated by an ensembled model. Extensive experiments and ablation studies are conducted on the widely-used domain adaptation benchmark datasets in semantic segmentation. Our proposed method achieves 59.0% mIoU on the validation set of Cityscapes by training on the labeled Synscapes and GTA5 datasets and unlabeled training set of Cityscapes.

Positive-congruent (PC) training aims at reducing error rate while at the same reducing negative flips, thus maximizing congruency with the reference model only on positive predictions, unlike model distillation. We propose a simple approach for PC training, Focal Distillation, which enforces congruence with the reference model by giving more weights to samples that were correctly classified.

To achieve this, we employ a cascade of gating modules to automatically determine the earliest point in processing where an inference is sufficiently reliable. We generate on-the-fly supervision signals to the gates to provide a dynamic trade-off between accuracy and computational cost.

    "abstract": "In the last few years, image denoising has benefited a lot from the fast development of neural networks. However, the requirement of large amounts of noisy-clean image pairs for supervision limits the wide use of these models. Although there have been a few attempts in training an image denoising model with only single noisy images, existing self-supervised denoising approaches suffer from inefficient network training, loss of useful information, or dependence on noise modeling. In this paper, we present a very simple yet effective method named Neighbor2Neighbor to train an effective image denoising model with only noisy images. Firstly, a random neighbor sub-sampler is proposed for the generation of training image pairs. In detail, input and target used to train a network are images sub-sampled from the same noisy image, satisfying the requirement that paired pixels of paired images are neighbors and have very similar appearance with each other. Secondly, a denoising network is trained on sub-sampled training pairs generated in the first stage, with a proposed regularizer as additional loss for better performance. The proposed Neighbor2Neighbor framework is able to enjoy the progress of state-of-the-art supervised denoising networks in network architecture design. Moreover, it avoids heavy dependence on the assumption of the noise distribution. We explain our approach from a theoretical perspective and further validate it through extensive experiments, including synthetic experiments with different noise distributions in sRGB space and real-world experiments on a denoising benchmark dataset in raw-RGB space",

It is a compact, efficient and powerful framework that exploits structural information over different human granularities and eases the difficulty of person partitioning. Specifically, a dense-to-sparse projection field, which allows explicitly associating dense human semantics with sparse keypoints, is learnt and progressively improved over the network feature pyramid for robustness. Then, the difficult pixel grouping problem is cast as an easier, multi-person joint assembling task. By formulating joint association as maximum-weight bipartite matching, a differentiable solution is developed to exploit projected gradient descent and Dykstra's cyclic projection algorithm. This makes our method end-to-end trainable and allows back-propagating the grouping error to directly supervise multi-granularity human representation learning. This is distinguished from current bottom-up human parsers or pose estimators which require sophisticated post-processing or heuristic greedy algorithms. Experiments on three instance-aware human parsing datasets show that our model outperforms other bottom-up alternatives with much more efficient inference",

Recent approaches explore domain-invariant and class-discriminant representations to tackle this task.

As a result, the missing or inadequate tradeoff between domain alignment and class discrimination are prone to the problem of negative transfer. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Weighted Learning (DWL) to avoid the discriminability vanishing problem caused by excessive alignment learning and domain misalignment problem caused by excessive discriminant learning. Technically, DWL dynamically weights the learning losses of alignment and discriminability by introducing the degree of alignment and discriminability. Besides, the problem of sample imbalance across domains is first considered in our work, and we solve the problem by weighing the samples to guarantee information balance across domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DWL has an excellent performance in several benchmark datasets",

The manipulation procedure is fully automatic, controlled by a domain-adversarial quality assessment network, making our dataset highly scalable with low human cost.

And we also theoretically analyze the validity of utilizing the phase spectrum. Moreover, we notice that local texture information is more crucial than high-level semantic information for the face forgery detection task.

    "abstract": "CNN-based generative modelling has evolved to produce synthetic images indistinguishable from real images in the RGB pixel space. Recent works have observed that CNN-generated images share a systematic shortcoming in replicating high frequency Fourier spectrum decay attributes. Furthermore, these works have successfully exploited this systematic shortcoming to detect CNN-generated images reporting up to 99% accuracy across multiple state-of-the-art GAN models. In this work, we investigate the validity of assertions claiming that CNN-generated images are unable to achieve high frequency spectral decay consistency. We meticulously construct a counterexample space of high frequency spectral decay consistent CNN-generated images emerging from our handcrafted experiments using DCGAN, LSGAN, WGAN-GP and StarGAN, where we empirically show that this frequency discrepancy can be avoided by a minor architecture change in the last upsampling operation. We subsequently use images from this counterexample space to successfully bypass the recently proposed forensics detector which leverages on high frequency Fourier spectrum decay attributes for CNN-generated image detection. Through this study, we show that high frequency Fourier spectrum decay discrepancies are not inherent characteristics for existing CNN-based generative models---contrary to the belief of some existing work---, and such features are not robust to perform synthetic image detection.

FACESEC evaluation is performed along four dimensions of adversarial modeling: the nature of perturbation (e.g., pixel-level or face accessories), the attacker's system knowledge (about training data and learning architecture), goals (dodging or impersonation), and capability (tailored to individual inputs or across sets of these). We use FACESEC to study five face recognition systems in both closed-set and open-set settings, and to evaluate the state-of-the-art approach for defending against physically realizable attacks on these. We find that accurate knowledge of neural architecture is significantly more important than knowledge of the training data in black-box attacks. Moreover, we observe that open-set face recognition systems are more vulnerable than closed-set systems under different types of attacks. The efficacy of attacks for other threat model variations, however, appears highly dependent on both the nature of perturbation and the neural network architecture.

The network first parameterizes the face rig as a compact latent code with a neural decoder, and then estimates the latent code as well as per-image parameters via a learnable optimization. By estimating a personalized face rig, our method goes beyond static reconstructions and enables downstream applications such as video retargeting. In-network optimization explicitly enforces constraints derived from the first principles, thus introduces additional priors than regression-based methods. Finally, data-driven priors from deep learning are utilized to constrain the ill-posed monocular setting and ease the optimization difficulty.

Specifically, at the representation learning stage, we build bidirectional fusion modules in the full flow of the two networks, where fusion is applied to each encoding and decoding layer. In this way, the two networks can leverage local and global complementary information from the other one to obtain better representations. Moreover, at the output representation stage, we designed a simple but effective 3D keypoints selection algorithm considering the texture and geometry information of objects, which simplifies keypoint localization for precise pose estimation.

We derive a polarimetric reflection model of a diffuse plus mirror surface lit by the sun and a clear sky. This model is used to recover the per-pixel surface normal of an object from a single polarimetric image or from multiple polarimetric images captured under the sky at different times of the day. We experimentally evaluate the accuracy of our shape-from-sky method on a number of real objects of different surface compositions. The results clearly show that this passive approach to fine-geometry recovery that fully leverages the unique illumination made by nature is a viable option for 3D sensing.

Existing works focus on studying the adversarial domain augmentation (ADA) to improve the model's generalization capability.

In this paper, we propose a generic normalization approach, adaptive standardization and rescaling normalization (ASR-Norm), to complement the missing part in the previous works. ASR-Norm learns both the standardization and rescaling statistics via neural networks. This new form of normalization can be viewed as a generic form of traditional normalizations. When trained with ADA, the statistics in ASR-Norm are learned to be adaptive to the data coming from different domains, and hence improves the model generalization performance across domains, especially on the target domain with large discrepancy from the source domain. The experimental results show that ASR-Norm can bring consistent improvement to the state-of-the-art ADA approaches by 1.6%, 2.7%, and 6.3% averagely on the Digits, CIFAR-10-C, and PACS benchmarks, respectively.

To this end, we empirically study how to design a single layer properly by analyzing the rank of the output feature. We then investigate the channel configuration of a model by searching network architectures concerning the channel configuration under the computational cost restriction. Based on the investigation, we propose a simple yet effective channel configuration that can be parameterized by the layer index. As a result, our proposed model following the channel parameterization achieves remarkable performance on ImageNet classification and transfer learning tasks including COCO object detection, COCO instance segmentation, and fine-grained classifications.

Existing image captioning methods commonly target at generic images, and lack mechanism to meet this requirement. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose a self-boosting framework that improves radiographic report generation based on the cooperation of the main task of report generation and anauxiliary task of image-text matching. The two tasks are built as the two branches of a network model and influence each other in a cooperative way. On one hand, the image-text matching branch helps to learn highly text-correlated visual features for the report generation branch to output high quality reports. One the other hand, the improved reports produced by the report generation branch provideadditional harder samples for the image-text matching task and enforce the latter to improve itself by learning better visual and text feature representations. This, in turn, helps improve the report generation branch again. These two branches are jointly trained to help improve each other iteratively and progressively, so that the whole model is self-boosted without requiring any external resources. Additionally, in the loss function, our model evaluates the quality of the generated reports not only on the word similarity as common approaches do (via minimizing a cross-entropy loss), but also on the feature similarity at high-level, while the latter is provided by the text-encoder of the image-text matching branch.

By maintaining the minimum hyperspherical energy during training, OPT can greatly improve the empirical generalization. Specifically, OPT fixes the randomly initialized weights of the neurons and learns an orthogonal transformation that applies to these neurons. We consider multiple ways to learn such an orthogonal transformation, including unrolling orthogonalization algorithms, applying orthogonal parameterization, and designing orthogonality-preserving gradient descent. For better scalability, we propose the stochastic OPT which performs orthogonal transformation stochastically for partial dimensions of neurons. Interestingly, OPT reveals that learning a proper coordinate system for neurons is crucial to generalization. We provide some insights on why OPT yields better generalization.

Deep Ensembles are widely considered as being one of the best methods for generating uncertainty estimates but are very expensive to train and evaluate. MC-Dropout is another popular alternative, which is less expensive, but also less reliable. Our central intuition is that there is a continuous spectrum of ensemble-like models of which MC-Dropout and Deep Ensembles are extreme examples. The first uses effectively infinite number of highly correlated models while the second relies on a finite number of independent models. To combine the benefits of both, we introduce Masksembles. Instead of randomly dropping parts of the network as in MC-dropout, Masksemble relies on a fixed number of binary masks, which are parameterized in a way that allows to change correlations between individual models. Namely, by controlling the overlap between the masks and their density one can choose the optimal configuration for the task at hand. This leads to a simple and easy to implement method with performance on par with Ensembles at a fraction of the cost.

However, a sub-network does not necessarily have high accuracy with low classification loss (loss-metric mismatch). In the paper, we first consider the loss-metric mismatch problem for pruning and propose a novel channel pruning method for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) by directly maximizing the performance (i.e., accuracy) of sub-networks. Specifically, we train a stand-alone neural network to predict sub-networks' performance and then maximize the output of the network as a proxy of accuracy to guide pruning. Training such a performance prediction network efficiently is not an easy task, and it may potentially suffer from the problem of catastrophic forgetting and the imbalance distribution of sub-networks. To deal with this challenge, we introduce a corresponding episodic memory to update and collect sub-networks during the pruning process. In the experiment section, we further demonstrate that the gradients from the performance prediction network and the classification loss have different directions.

In this work, we argue that the rain generation and removal are the two sides of the same coin and should be tightly coupled. To close the loop, we propose to jointly learn real rain generation and removal procedure within a unified disentangled image translation framework. Specifically, we propose a bidirectional disentangled translation network, in which each unidirectional network contains two loops of joint rain generation and removal for both the real and synthetic rain image, respectively. Meanwhile, we enforce the disentanglement strategy by decomposing the rainy image into a clean background and rain layer (rain removal), in order to better preserve the identity background via both the cycle-consistency loss and adversarial loss, and ease the rain layer translating between the real and synthetic rainy image.

    "abstract": "Spatial-temporal, channel-wise, and motion patterns are three complementary and crucial types of information for video action recognition. Conventional 2D CNNs are computationally cheap but cannot catch temporal relationships; 3D CNNs can achieve good performance but are computationally intensive. In this work, we tackle this dilemma by designing a generic and effective module that can be embedded into 2D CNNs. To this end, we propose a spAtio-temporal, Channel and moTion excitatION (ACTION) module consisting of three paths: Spatio-Temporal Excitation (STE) path, Channel Excitation (CE) path, and Motion Excitation (ME) path. The STE path employs one channel 3D convolution to characterize spatio-temporal representation. The CE path adaptively recalibrates channel-wise feature responses by explicitly modeling interdependencies between channels in terms of the temporal aspect. The ME path calculates feature-level temporal differences, which is then utilized to excite motion-sensitive channels. We equip 2D CNNs with the proposed ACTION module to form a simple yet effective ACTION-Net with very limited extra computational cost. ACTION-Net is demonstrated by consistently outperforming 2D CNN counterparts on three backbones (i.e., ResNet-50, MobileNet V2 and BNInception) employing three datasets (i.e., Something-Something V2, Jester, and EgoGesture).

To achieve this, we introduce (i) a spatial attention mechanism (a co-attention module, CoAM) for conditioning the learned features on both images, and (ii) a distinctiveness score used to choose the best matches at test time. CoAM can be added to standard architectures and trained using self-supervision or supervised data, and achieves a significant performance improvement under hard conditions, e.g. large viewpoint changes.

To study event signal formation and degradation, we implement a display-camera system which enables multi-resolution event recording. We further propose EventZoom, a deep neural framework with a backbone architecture of 3D U-Net. EventZoom is trained in a noise-to-noise fashion where the two ends of the network are unfiltered noisy events, enforcing noise-free event restoration. For resolution enhancement, EventZoom incorporates an event-to-image module supervised by high resolution images. Our results showed that EventZoom achieves at least 40x temporal efficiency compared to state-of-the-art event denoisers.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "ImageNet has been the most popular image classification benchmark, but it is also the one with a significant level of label noise. Recent studies have shown that many samples contain multiple classes, despite being assumed to be a single-label benchmark. They have thus proposed to turn ImageNet evaluation into a multi-label task, with exhaustive multi-label annotations per image. However, they have not fixed the training set, presumably because of a formidable annotation cost. We argue that the mismatch between single-label annotations and effectively multi-label images is equally, if not more, problematic in the training setup, where random crops are applied. With the single-label annotations, a random crop of an image may contain an entirely different object from the ground truth, introducing noisy or even incorrect supervision during training. We thus re-label the ImageNet training set with multi-labels. We address the annotation cost barrier by letting a strong image classifier, trained on an extra source of data, generate the multi-labels. We utilize the pixel-wise multi-label predictions before the final pooling layer, in order to exploit the additional location-specific supervision signals. Training on the re-labeled samples results in improved model performances across the board. ResNet-50 attains the top-1 accuracy of 78.9% on ImageNet with our localized multi-labels, which can be further boosted to 80.2% with the CutMix regularization. We show that the models trained with localized multi-labels also outperform the baselines on transfer learning to object detection and instance segmentation tasks, and various robustness benchmarks.

Then, we present a simple yet effective method to approximate the unobserved confounder as it cannot be directly sampled from the dataset. 2) Meanwhile, we introduce a dual contrastive learning approach (DCL) to better align the text and video by maximizing the mutual information (MI) between query and video clips, and the MI between start/end frames of a target moment and the others within a video to learn more informative visual representations.

To force the model to capture phase information, we develop a novel Fourier-based data augmentation strategy called amplitude mix which linearly interpolates between the amplitude spectrums of two images.

The ambiguity naturally leads to theissue ofimplicit multi-label, motivating the need for diversepredictions. In this work, we propose a novel plug-and-play Probabilistic Uncertainty Modeling (PUM) module.

Recent approaches extend the scope to real-valued upsampling factors, even with varying aspect ratios to handle the limitation. In this paper, we propose the SRWarp framework to further generalize the SR tasks toward an arbitrary image transformation. We interpret the traditional image warping task, specifically when the input is enlarged, as a spatially-varying SR problem. We also propose several novel formulations, including the adaptive warping layer and multiscale blending, to reconstruct visually favorable results in the transformation process.

By introducing contrastive loss, we maximize the orthogonality of basis vectors while minimizing semantic aliasing between classes. Within the reconstructed representation space, we further suppress interference from other classes by projecting query features to the support vector for precise semantic activation. Our proposed approach, referred to as anti-aliasing semantic reconstruction (ASR), provides a systematic yet interpretable solution for few-shot learning problems.

To this end, we introduce the concept of the key composition map (KCM) to encode the composition rules. The KCM can reveal the common laws hidden behind different composition rules and can inform the cropping model of what is important in composition.

Some learned image compression methods use multiple networks for multiple rates, while others use one single model at the expense of computational complexity increase and performance degradation. In this paper, we propose a continuously rate adjustable learned image compression framework, Asymmetric Gained Variational Autoencoder (AG-VAE). AG-VAE utilizes a pair of gain units to achieve discrete rate adaptation in one single model with a negligible additional computation. Then, by using exponential interpolation, continuous rate adaptation is achieved without compromising performance. Besides, we propose the asymmetric Gaussian entropy model for more accurate entropy estimation. Exhaustive experiments show that our method achieves comparable quantitative performance with SOTA learned image compression methods and better qualitative performance than classical image codecs.

    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks(DNNs) require huge GPU memory when training on modern image/video databases. Unfortunately, the GPU memory is physically finite, which limits the image resolutions and batch sizes that could be used in training for better DNN performance. Unlike solutions that require physically upgrade GPUs, the Gradient CheckPointing(GCP) training trades computation for more memory beyond existing GPU hardware. GCP only stores a subset of intermediate tensors, called Gradient Checkpoints (GCs), during forward. Then during backward, extra local forwards are conducted to compute the missing tensors. The total training memory cost becomes the sum of (1) the memory cost of the gradient checkpoints and (2) the maximum memory cost of local forwards. To achieve maximal memory cut-offs, one needs optimal algorithms to select GCs. Existing GCP approaches rely on either manual input of GCs or heuristics-based GC search on Linear Computation Graphs (LCGs), and cannot apply to Arbitrary Computation Graphs(ACGs). In this paper, we present theories and optimal algorithms on GC selection that, for the first time, are applicable to ACGs and achieve the maximal memory cut-offs. Extensive experiments show that our approach not only outperforms existing approaches (only applicable on LCGs), and is applicable to a vast family of LCG and ACG networks, such as Alexnet, VGG, ResNet, Densenet, Inception Net and highly complicated DNNs by Network Architecture Search. Our work enables GCP training on ACGs, and cuts off up-to 80% of training memory with a moderate time overhead ( 30%-50%). Codes are available",

Unlike previous works, we propose to tackle this challenging problem from a new perspective: noise reduction by image-adaptive projection. Specifically, we propose to train a network that can separate signal and noise by learning a set of reconstruction basis in the feature space. Subsequently, image denosing can be achieved by selecting corresponding basis of the signal subspace and projecting the input into such space. Our key insight is that projection can naturally maintain the local structure of input signal, especially for areas with low light or weak textures. Towards this end, we propose SSA, a non-local attention module we design to explicitly learn the basis generation as well as subspace projection. We further incorporate SSA with NBNet, a UNet structured network designed for end-to-end image denosing based. We conduct evaluations on benchmarks, including SIDD and DND, and NBNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on PSNR and SSIM with significantly less computational cost",

Together, these allow us to render novel views of the object under arbitrary lighting, including indirect illumination effects. The predicted visibility and surface intersection fields are critical to our model's ability to simulate direct and indirect illumination during training, because the brute-force techniques used by prior work are intractable for lighting conditions outside of controlled setups with a single light.

    "abstract": "Since its inception, Visual Question Answering (VQA) is notoriously known as a task, where models are prone to exploit biases in datasets to find shortcuts instead of performing high-level reasoning. Classical methods address this by removing biases from training data, or adding branches to models to detect and remove biases. In this paper, we argue that uncertainty in vision is a dominating factor preventing the successful learning of reasoning in vision and language problems. We train a visual oracle and in a large scale study provide experimental evidence that it is much less prone to exploiting spurious dataset biases compared to standard models. We propose to study the attention mechanisms at work in the visual oracle and compare them with a SOTA Transformer-based model. We provide an in-depth analysis and visualizations of reasoning patterns obtained with an online visualization tool which we make publicly available (https://reasoningpatterns.github.io). We exploit these insights by transferring reasoning patterns from the oracle to a SOTA Transformer-based VQA model taking standard noisy visual inputs via fine-tuning. In experiments we report higher overall accuracy, as well as accuracy on infrequent answers for each question type, which provides evidence for improved generalization and a decrease of the dependency on dataset biases",

Static and dynamic models are represented by deep neural networks trained jointly in a bootstrapping strategy, which enables extrapolation to previously unseen objects. While the training process requires motion, the resulting object segmentation network can be used on either static images or videos at inference time. As the volume of seen videos grows, more and more objects are seen moving, priming their detection, which then serves as a regularizer for new objects, turning our method into unsupervised continual learning to segment objects.

We model the CNN feature maps across different layers, as a dynamic process which carries the statistical self-similarity (SSS), one well-known property of texture, from input image along the network depth dimension. The CLASS module characterizes the cross-layer SSS using a soft histogram of local differential box-counting dimensions of cross-layer features. The resulting descriptor encodes both cross-layer dynamics and local SSS of input image, providing additional discrimination over the often-used global average pooling.

However, the domain gap caused by drastically different light field acquisition conditions poses a main obstacle in practice. To fill this gap, we propose a zero-shot learning framework for light field SR, which learns a mapping to super-resolve the reference view with examples extracted solely from the input low-resolution light field itself. Given highly limited training data under the zero-shot setting, however, we observe that it is difficult to train an end-to-end network successfully. Instead, we divide this challenging task into three sub-tasks, i.e., pre-upsampling, view alignment, and multi-view aggregation, and then conquer them separately with simple yet efficient CNNs. Moreover, the proposed framework can be readily extended to finetune the pre-trained model on a source dataset to better adapt to the target input, which further boosts the performance of light field SR in the wild. Experimental results validate that our method not only outperforms classic non-learning-based methods, but also generalizes better to unseen light fields than state-of-the-art deep-learning-based methods when the domain gap is large",

    "abstract": "An emerging line of research has found that spherical spaces better match the underlying geometry of facial images, as evidenced by the state-of-the-art facial recognition methods which benefit empirically from spherical representations. Yet, these approaches rely on deterministic embeddings and hence suffer from the feature ambiguity dilemma, whereby ambiguous or noisy images are mapped into poorly learned regions of representation space, leading to inaccuracies. Probabilistic Face Embeddings (PFE) is the first attempt to address this dilemma. However, we theoretically and empirically identify two main failures of PFE when it is applied to spherical deterministic embeddings aforementioned. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel framework for face confidence learning in spherical space. Mathematically, we extend the von Mises Fisher density to its r-radius counterpart and derive a new optimization objective in closed form. Theoretically, the proposed probabilistic framework provably allows for better interpretability, leading to principled feature comparison and pooling. Extensive experimental results on multiple challenging benchmarks confirm our hypothesis and theory, and showcase the advantages of our framework over prior probabilistic methods and spherical deterministic embeddings in various face recognition tasks",

It does this via multiple contrastive losses which capture inter-modality and intra-modality correspondences. XMC-GAN uses an attentional self-modulation generator, which enforces strong text-image correspondence, and a contrastive discriminator, which acts as a critic as well as a feature encoder for contrastive learning. The quality of XMC-GAN's output is a major step up from previous models, as we show on three challenging datasets.

Most importantly, iMiGUE focuses on micro-gestures, i,e., unintentional behaviors driven by inner feelings, which are different from ordinary scope of gestures from other gesture datasets which are mostly intentionally performed for illustrative purposes. Furthermore, iMiGUE is designed to evaluate the ability of models to analyze the emotional states by integrating information of recognized micro-gesture, rather than just recognizing prototypes in the sequences separately (or isolatedly). This is because the real need for emotion AI is to understand the emotional states behind gestures in a holistic way. Moreover, to counter for the challenge of imbalanced samples distribution of this dataset, an unsupervised learning method is proposed to capture latent representations from the micro-gesture sequences themselves. We systematically investigate representative methods on this dataset, and comprehensive experimental results reveal several interesting insights from the iMiGUE, e,g., micro-gesture-based analysis can promote emotion understanding.

In this work we present a denoising approach for extremely low-light images of permanently shadowed regions (PSRs) on the lunar surface, taken by the Narrow Angle Camera on board the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter satellite. Our approach extends existing learning-based approaches by combining a physical noise model of the camera with real noise samples and training image scene selection based on 3D ray tracing to generate realistic training data. We also condition our denoising model on the camera's environmental metadata at the time of image capture (such as the camera's temperature and age), showing that this improves performance. Our quantitative and qualitative results show that our method strongly outperforms the existing calibration routine for the camera and other baselines.

    "abstract": "Instance segmentation is an active topic in computer vision that is usually solved by using supervised learning approaches over very large datasets composed of object level masks. Obtaining such a dataset for any new domain can be very expensive and time-consuming. In addition, models trained on certain annotated categories do not generalize well to unseen objects. The goal of this paper is to propose a method that can perform unsupervised discovery of long-tail categories in instance segmentation, through learning instance embeddings of masked regions. Leveraging rich relationship and hierarchical structure between objects in the images, we propose self-supervised losses for learning mask embeddings. Trained on COCO dataset without additional annotations of the long-tail objects, our model is able to discover novel and more fine-grained objects than the common categories in COCO. We show that the model achieves competitive quantitative results on LVIS as compared to the supervised and partially supervised methods",

    "abstract": "Visual localization is the problem of estimating the camera pose of a given image with respect to a known scene. Visual localization algorithms are a fundamental building block in advanced computer vision applications, including Mixed and Virtual Reality systems. Many algorithms used in practice represent the scene through a Structure-from-Motion (SfM) point cloud, where each 3D point is associated with one or more local image features. Establishing 2D-3D matches between features in a query image and the 3D points through descriptor matching Visual localization is the problem of estimating the camera pose of a given image with respect to a known scene. Visual localization algorithms are a fundamental building block in advanced computer vision applications, including Mixed and Virtual Reality systems. Many algorithms used in practice represent the scene through a Structure-from-Motion (SfM) point cloud and use 2D-3D matches between a query image and the 3D points for camera pose estimation. As recently shown, image details can be accurately recovered from SfM point clouds by translating renderings of the sparse point clouds to images. To address the resulting potential privacy risks for user-generated content, it was recently proposed to lift point clouds to line clouds by replacing 3D points by randomly oriented 3D lines passing through these points. The resulting representation is unintelligible to humans and effectively prevents point cloud-to-image translation. This paper shows that a significant amount of information about the 3D scene geometry is preserved in these line clouds, allowing us to (approximately) recover the 3D point positions and thus to (approximately) recover image content. Our approach is based on the observation that the closest points between lines can yield a good approximation to the original 3D points.

    "abstract": "Recovering the 3D geometry of a purely texture-less object with generally unknown surface reflectance (e.g. nonLambertian) is regarded as a challenging task in multiview reconstruction. The major obstacle revolves around establishing cross-view correspondences where photometric constancy is violated. This paper proposes a simple and practical solution to overcome this challenge based on a co-located camera-light scanner device. Unlike existing solutions, we do not explicitly solve for correspondence. Instead, we argue the problem is generally well-posed by multi-view geometrical and photometric constraints, and can be solved from a small number of input views. We formulate the reconstruction task as a joint energy minimization over the surface geometry and reflectance. Despite this energy is highly non-convex, we develop an optimization algorithm that robustly recovers globally optimal shape and reflectance even from a random initialization. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real data have validated our method, and possible future extensions are discussed",

    "abstract": "Deep learning models suffer from catastrophic forgetting when trained in an incremental learning setting. In this work, we propose a novel approach to address the task incremental learning problem, which involves training a model on new tasks that arrive in an incremental manner. The task incremental learning problem becomes even more challenging when the test set contains classes that are not part of the train set, i.e., a task incremental generalized zero-shot learning problem. Our approach can be used in both the zero-shot and non zero-shot task incremental learning settings. Our proposed method uses weight rectifications and affine transformations in order to adapt the model to different tasks that arrive sequentially. Specifically, we adapt the network weights to work for new tasks by \"rectifying\" the weights learned from the previous task. We learn these weight rectifications using very few parameters. We additionally learn affine transformations on the outputs generated by the network in order to better adapt them for the new task. We perform experiments on several datasets in both zero-shot and non zero-shot task incremental learning settings and empirically show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results. Specifically, our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art non zero-shot task incremental learning method by over 5% on the CIFAR-100 dataset. Our approach also significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art task incremental generalized zero-shot learning method by absolute margins of 6.91% and 6.33% for the AWA1 and CUB datasets, respectively.

Spuriousness occurs when some features correlate with labels but are not causal; relying on such features prevents models from generalizing to unseen environments where such correlations break. In this work, we focus on image classification and propose two data generation processes to reduce spuriousness. Given human annotations of the subset of the features responsible (causal) for the labels (e.g. bounding boxes), we modify this causal set to generate a surrogate image that no longer has the same label (i.e. a counterfactual image). We also alter non-causal features to generate images still recognized as the original labels, which helps to learn a model invariant to these features. In several challenging datasets, our data generations outperform state-of-the-art methods in accuracy when spurious correlations break, and increase the saliency focus on causal features providing better explanations",

In order to facilitate progress in this area we present two new natural world visual classification datasets, iNat2021 and NeWT. The former consists of 2.7M images from 10k different species uploaded by users of the citizen science application iNaturalist. We designed the latter, NeWT, in collaboration with domain experts with the aim of benchmarking the performance of representation learning algorithms on a suite of challenging natural world binary classification tasks that go beyond standard species classification. These two new datasets allow us to explore questions related to large-scale representation and transfer learning in the context of fine-grained categories. We provide a comprehensive analysis of feature extractors trained with and without supervision on ImageNet and iNat2021, shedding light on the strengths and weaknesses of different learned features across a diverse set of tasks. We find that features produced by standard supervised methods still outperform those produced by self-supervised approaches such as SimCLR.

Constrained by computational resources, there is no model or training method that can train long video sequences end-to-end. Currently, the main-stream method is to split a raw video into clips, leading to incomplete fragmentary temporal information flow. Inspired by natural language processing techniques dealing with long sentences, we propose to treat videos as serial fragments satisfying Markov property, and train it as a whole by progressively propagating information through the temporal dimension in multiple steps. This progressive training (PGT) method is able to train long videos end-to-end with limited resources and ensures the effective transmission of information. As a general and robust training method, we empirically demonstrate that it yields significant performance improvements on different models and datasets.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "One-shot neural architecture search (NAS) methods significantly reduce the search cost by considering the whole search space as one network, which only needs to be trained once. However, current methods select each operation independently without considering previous layers. Besides, the historical information obtained with huge computation costs is usually used only once and then discarded. In this paper, we introduce a sampling strategy based on Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) with the search space modeled as a Monte Carlo tree (MCT), which captures the dependency among layers. Furthermore, intermediate results are stored in the MCT for future decisions and a better exploration-exploitation balance. Concretely, MCT is updated using the training loss as a reward to the architecture performance; for accurately evaluating the numerous nodes, we propose node communication and hierarchical node selection methods in the training and search stages, respectively, making better uses of the operation rewards and hierarchical information. Moreover, for a fair comparison of different NAS methods, we construct an open-source NAS benchmark of a macro search space evaluated on CIFAR-10, namely NAS-Bench-Macro. Extensive experiments on NAS-Bench-Macro and ImageNet demonstrate that our method significantly improves search efficiency and performance. For example, by only searching 20 architectures, our obtained architecture achieves 78.0% top-1 accuracy with 442M FLOPs on ImageNet.

In contrast, we propose a deep learning framework that maps each pixel to a feature space, where the feature distances reflect the geodesic distances among pixels as if they were projected onto the surface of 3D human scans. To this end, we introduce novel loss functions to push features apart according to their geodesic distances on the surface inside and across images. Without any semantic annotation, the features automatically learn to differentiate visually similar parts and align different subjects into a unified feature space. Extensive experiments show that the learned features can produce accurate correspondences between images with remarkable generalization capabilities on both intra and inter subjects.

Firstly, the autonomous suggests to block gradient flow between vision and language models to enforce explicitly language modeling. Secondly, a novel bidirectional cloze network (BCN) as the language model is proposed based on bidirectional feature representation. Thirdly, we propose an execution manner of iterative correction for language model which can effectively alleviate the impact of noise input. Additionally, based on the ensemble of iterative predictions, we propose a self-training method which can learn from unlabeled images effectively.

It was believed that the success lies in the high-level perceptual feature representations extracted from CNNs pretrained with a large set of images. Here we reveal that what matters is the network structure instead of the trained weights. Without any learning, the structure of a deep network is sufficient to capture the dependencies between multiple levels of variable statistics using multiple layers of CNNs. This insight removes the requirements of pre-training and a particular network structure (commonly, VGG) that are previously assumed for the perceptual loss, thus enabling a significantly wider range of applications. To this end, we demonstrate that a randomly-weighted deep CNN can be used to model the structured dependencies of outputs. On a few dense per-pixel prediction tasks such as semantic segmentation, depth estimation, and instance segmentation, we show improved results of using the extended randomized perceptual loss, compared to the baselines using pixel-wise loss alone.

It, however, is difficult to effectively train the CNNs on some realistic learning situations such as regarding class imbalance, small-scale and label noises. Regularizing CNNs works well on learning with such deteriorated training datasets by mitigating overfitting issues. In this work, we propose a method to effectively impose regularization on feature representation learning. By focusing on the angle between a feature and a classifier which is embedded in cosine similarity at the classification layer, we formulate a novel similarity beyond the cosine based on von Mises-Fisher distribution of directional statistics. In contrast to the cosine similarity, our similarity is compact while having heavy tail, which contributes to regularizing intra-class feature distribution to improve generalization performance. Through the experiments on some realistic learning situations such as of imbalance, small-scale and noisy labels, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for training CNNs, in comparison to the other regularization methods.

Addressing this problem, we propose a learnable module that learns Spatial Contextual Features from large-scale point clouds, called SCF in this paper. The proposed module mainly consists of three blocks, including the local polar representation block, the dual-distance attentive pooling block, and the global contextual feature block. For each 3D point, the local polar representation block is firstly explored to construct a spatial representation that is invariant to the z-axis rotation, then the dual-distance attentive pooling block is designed to utilize the representations of its neighbors for learning more discriminative local features according to both the geometric and feature distances among them, and finally, the global contextual feature block is designed to learn a global context for each 3D point by utilizing its spatial location and the volume ratio of the neighborhood to the global point cloud. The proposed module could be easily embedded into various network architectures for point cloud segmentation, naturally resulting in a new 3D semantic segmentation network with an encoder-decoder architecture, called SCF-Net in this work. Extensive experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate that the proposed SCF-Net performs better than several state-of-the-art methods in most cases",

Without training data, let alone paired data, existing autonomous vehicles often limit themselves to good conditions and stop when dense fog or snow is detected. In this work, we tackle the lack of supervised training data by combining synthetic and indirect supervision.

ZeroScatter exploits model-based, temporal, multi-view, multi-modal, and adversarial cues in a joint fashion, allowing us to train on unpaired, biased data.

In this paper, we investigate the robustness of multimodal neural networks against worst-case (i.e., adversarial) perturbations on a single modality. We first show that standard multimodal fusion models are vulnerable to single-source adversaries: an attack on any single modality can overcome the correct information from multiple unperturbed modalities and cause the model to fail. This surprising vulnerability holds across diverse multimodal tasks and necessitates a solution. Motivated by this finding, we propose an adversarially robust fusion strategy that trains the model to compare information coming from all the input sources, detect inconsistencies in the perturbed modality compared to the other modalities, and only allow information from the unperturbed modalities to pass through. Our approach significantly improves on state-of-the-art methods in single-source robustness, achieving gains of 7.8-25.2% on action recognition, 19.7-48.2% on object detection, and 1.6-6.7% on sentiment analysis, without degrading performance on unperturbed (i.e., clean) data",

GDA covers the major variants as special cases, which allows us to organize them in a comprehensive framework. Moreover, this generalization leads to a new challenging setting where existing methods fail, such as when domain labels are unknown, and class labels are only partially given to each domain. We propose a novel approach to the new setting. The key to our approach is self-supervised class-destructive learning, which enables the learning of class-invariant representations and domain-adversarial classifiers without using any domain labels.

    "abstract": "While the accuracy of 3D human pose estimation from images has steadily improved on benchmark datasets, the best methods still fail in many real-world scenarios. This suggests that there is a domain gap between current datasets and common scenes containing people. To obtain ground-truth 3D pose, current datasets limit the complexity of clothing, environmental conditions, number of subjects, and occlusion. Moreover, current datasets evaluate sparse 3D joint locations corresponding to the major joints of the body, ignoring the hand pose and the face shape. To evaluate the current state-of-the-art methods on more challenging images, and to drive the field to address new problems, we introduce AGORA, a synthetic dataset with high realism and highly accurate ground truth. Here we use 4240 commercially-available, high-quality, textured human scans in diverse poses and natural clothing; this includes 257 scans of children. We create reference 3D poses and body shapes by fitting the SMPL-X body model (with face and hands) to the 3D scans, taking into account clothing. We create around 14K training and 3K test images by rendering between 5 and 15 people per image using either image-based lighting or rendered 3D environments, taking care to make the images physically plausible and photoreal. In total, AGORA consists of 173K individual person crops. We evaluate existing state-of-the-art methods for 3D human pose estimation on this dataset and find that most methods perform poorly on images of children. Hence, we extend the SMPL-X model to better capture the shape of children. Additionally, we fine-tune methods on AGORA and show improved performance on both AGORA and 3DPW, confirming the realism of the dataset.

Yet, this task remains a challenging job for data-driven neural networks, due to the serious visual and textual data biases. To this end, we propose a Posterior-and-Prior Knowledge Exploring-and-Distilling approach (PPKED) to imitate the working patterns of radiologists, who will first examine the abnormal regions and assign the disease topic tags to the abnormal regions, and then rely on the years of prior medical knowledge and prior working experience accumulations to write reports. Thus, the PPKED includes three modules: Posterior Knowledge Explorer (PoKE), Prior Knowledge Explorer (PrKE) and Multi-domain Knowledge Distiller (MKD). In detail, PoKE explores the posterior knowledge, which provides explicit abnormal visual regions to alleviate visual data bias; PrKE explores the prior knowledge from the prior medical knowledge graph (medical knowledge) and prior radiology reports (working experience) to alleviate textual data bias. The explored knowledge is distilled by the MKD to generate the final reports.

In this paper, we present a fast algorithm that achieves global optimality called rotation coordinate descent (RCD). Unlike block coordinate descent (BCD) which solves SDP by updating the semidefinite matrix in a row-by-row fashion, RCD directly maintains and updates all valid rotations throughout the iterations. This obviates the need to store a large dense semidefinite matrix. We mathematically prove the convergence of our algorithm and empirically show its superior efficiency over state-of-the-art global methods on a variety of problem configurations. Maintaining valid rotations also facilitates incorporating local optimisation routines for further speed-ups. Moreover, our algorithm is simple to implement",

We propose a network design that can automatically learn such implicit cues by comparing all pairs of points between the two input images. Our method therefore constructs dense feature correlation volumes and processes these to predict relative 3D rotations. Our predictions are formed over a fine-grained discretization of rotations, bypassing difficulties associated with regressing 3D rotations.

In this paper, we first carefully examine the special designs in CapsNet differing from that of a ConvNet, commonly used for image classification. The examination reveals 5 major new/different components in CapsNet: a transformation process, a dynamic routing layer, a squashing function, a marginal loss other than cross-entropy loss, and an additional class-conditional reconstruction loss for regularization. Along with these major differences, we comprehensively ablate their behavior on 3 kinds of robustness, including affine transformation, overlapping digits, and semantic representation. The study reveals that some designs which are thought critical to CapsNet actually can harm its robustness, i.e., the dynamic routing layer and the transformation process, while others are beneficial for the robustness. Based on these findings, we propose enhanced ConvNets simply by introducing the essential components behind the CapsNet's success.

    "abstract": "Skeletal motion plays a vital role in human activity recognition as either an independent data source or a complement. The robustness of skeleton-based activity recognizers has been questioned recently, which shows that they are vulnerable to adversarial attacks when the full-knowledge of the recognizer is accessible to the attacker. However, this white-box requirement is overly restrictive in most scenarios and the attack is not truly threatening. In this paper, we show that such threats do exist under black-box settings too. To this end, we propose the first black-box adversarial attack method BASAR. Through BASAR, we show that adversarial attack is not only truly a threat but also can be extremely deceitful, because on-manifold adversarial samples are rather common in skeletal motions, in contrast to the common belief that adversarial samples only exist off-manifold. Through exhaustive evaluation and comparison, we show that BASAR can deliver successful attacks across models, data, and attack modes. Through harsh perceptual studies, we show that it achieves effective yet imperceptible attacks. By analyzing the attack on different activity recognizers, BASAR helps identify the potential causes of their vulnerability and provides insights on what classifiers are likely to be more robust against attack",

    "abstract": "While recent pre-training tasks on 2D images have proven very successful for transfer learning, pre-training for 3D data remains challenging. In this work, we introduce a general method for 3D self-supervised representation learning that 1) remains agnostic to the underlying neural network architecture, and 2) specifically leverages the geometric nature of 3D point cloud data. The proposed task softly segments 3D points into a discrete number of geometric partitions. A self-supervised loss is formed under the interpretation that these soft partitions implicitly parameterize a latent Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), and that this generative model establishes a data likelihood function. Our pretext task can therefore be viewed in terms of an encoder-decoder paradigm that squeezes learned representations through an implicitly defined parametric discrete generative model bottleneck. We show that any existing neural network architecture designed for supervised point cloud segmentation can be repurposed for the proposed unsupervised pretext task. By maximizing data likelihood with respect to the soft partitions formed by the unsupervised point-wise segmentation network, learned representations are encouraged to contain compositionally rich geometric information. In tests, we show that our method naturally induces semantic separation in feature space, resulting in state-of-the-art performance on downstream applications like model classification and semantic segmentation",

Such a function can encode a high quality surface with intricate details into the parameters of a deep neural network. However, optimizing for the parameters for accurate and robust reconstructions remains a challenge especially when the input data is noisy or incomplete. In this work, we develop a hybrid neural surface representation that allows us to impose geometry-aware sampling and regularization, which significantly improves the fidelity of reconstructions. We propose to use iso-points as an explicit representation for a neural implicit function. These points are computed and updated on-the-fly during training to capture important geometric features and impose geometric constraints on the optimization. We demonstrate that our method can be adopted to improve state-of-the-art techniques for reconstructing neural implicit surfaces from multi-view images or point clouds.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Conventional deep learning based methods for object detection require a large amount of bounding box annotations for training, which is expensive to obtain such high quality annotated data. Few-shot object detection, which learns to adapt to novel classes with only a few annotated examples, is very challenging since the fine-grained feature of novel object can be easily overlooked with only a few data available. In this work, aiming to fully exploit features of annotated novel object and capture fine-grained features of query object, we propose Dense Relation Distillation with Context-aware Aggregation (DCNet) to tackle the few-shot detection problem. Built on the meta-learning based framework, Dense Relation Distillation module targets at fully exploiting support features, where support features and query feature are densely matched, covering all spatial locations in a feed-forward fashion. The abundant usage of the guidance information endows model the capability to handle common challenges such as appearance changes and occlusions. Moreover, to better capture scale-aware features, Context-aware Aggregation module adaptively harnesses features from different scales for a more comprehensive feature representation. Extensive experiments illustrate that our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets. Code will be made available at https://github.com/hzhupku/DCNet",

Current approaches either decouple HOI task into separated stages of object detection and interaction classification or introduce surrogate interaction problem. In contrast, our method, named HOI Transformer, streamlines the HOI pipeline by eliminating the need for many hand-designed components. HOI Transformer reasons about the relations of objects and humans from global image context and directly predicts HOI instances in parallel. A quintuple matching loss is introduced to force HOI predictions in a unified way. Our method is conceptually much simpler and demonstrates improved accuracy. Without bells and whistles, HOI Transformer achieve 26.61% AP on HICO-DET and 52.9% AProle on V-COCO, surpassing previous methods with the advantage of being much simpler.

In this paper, we reveal that the topology of the concatenation-type skip connections is closely related to the gradient propagation which, in turn, enables a predictable behavior of DNNs' test performance. To this end, we introduce a new metric called NN-Mass to quantify how effectively information flows through DNNs. Moreover, we empirically show that NN-Mass also works for other types of skip connections, e.g., for ResNets, Wide-ResNets (WRNs), and MobileNets, which contain addition-type skip connections (i.e., residuals or inverted residuals). As such, for both DenseNet-like CNNs and ResNets/WRNs/MobileNets, our theoretically grounded NN-Mass can identify models with similar accuracy, despite having significantly different size/compute requirements. Detailed experiments on both synthetic and real datasets (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet) provide extensive evidence for our insights. Finally, the closed-form equation of our NN-Mass enables us to design significantly compressed DenseNets (for CIFAR-10) and MobileNets (for ImageNet) directly at initialization without time-consuming training and/or searching",

    "title": "We Are More Than Our Joints: Predicting How 3D Bodies Move",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "A key step towards understanding human behavior is the prediction of 3D human motion. Successful solutions have many applications in human tracking, HCI, and graphics. Most previous work focuses on predicting a time series of future 3D joint locations given a sequence 3D joints from the past. This Euclidean formulation generally works better than predicting pose in terms of joint rotations. Body joint locations, however, do not fully constrain 3D human pose, leaving degrees of freedom (like rotation about a limb) undefined. Note that 3D joints can be viewed as a sparse point cloud. Thus the problem of human motion prediction can be seen as a problem of point cloud prediction. With this observation, we instead predict a sparse set of locations on the body surface that correspond to motion capture markers. Given such markers, we fit a parametric body model to recover the 3D body of the person. These sparse surface markers also carry detailed information about human movement that is not present in the joints, increasing the naturalness of the predicted motions. Using the AMASS dataset, we train MOJO (More than Our JOints), which is a novel variational autoencoder with a latent DCT space that generates motions from latent frequencies. MOJO preserves the full temporal resolution of the input motion, and sampling from the latent frequencies explicitly introduces high-frequency components into the generated motion. We note that motion prediction methods accumulate errors over time, resulting in joints or markers that diverge from true human bodies. To address this, we fit the SMPL-X body model to the predictions at each time step, projecting the solution back onto the space of valid bodies, before propagating the new markers in time. Quantitative and qualitative experiments show that our approach produces state-of-the-art results and realistic 3D body animations.

We take three important steps to equip such a seemingly simple function with adequate expressivity. First, the parameters of the pixel-wise networks are spatially varying so they can represent a broader function class than simple 1x1 convolutions. Second, these parameters are predicted by a fast convolutional network that processes an aggressively low-resolution representation of the input. Third, we augment the input image with a sinusoidal encoding of spatial coordinates, which provides an effective inductive bias for generating realistic novel high-frequency image content. As a result, our model is up to 18x faster than state-of-the-art baselines. We achieve this speedup while generating comparable visual quality across different image resolutions and translation domains",

    "abstract": "Aerial Image Segmentation is a particular semantic segmentation problem and has several challenging characteristics that general semantic segmentation does not have. There are two critical issues: The one is an extremely foreground-background imbalanced distribution and the other is multiple small objects along with complex background. Such problems make the recent dense affinity context modeling perform poorly even compared with baselines due to over-introduced background context. To handle these problems, we propose a point-wise affinity propagation module based on the FPN framework, named PointFlow. Rather than dense affinity learning, a sparse affinity map is generated upon selected points between the adjacent features, which reduces the noise introduced by the background while keeping efficiency. In particular, we design a dual point matcher to select points from the salient area and object boundaries, respectively. The former samples salient points while the latter samples points from the object boundaries. Experimental results on three different aerial segmentation datasets suggest that the proposed method is more effective and efficient than state-of-the-art general semantic segmentation methods. Especially, our methods achieve the best speed and accuracy trade-off on three aerial benchmarks. Further experiments on three general semantic segmentation datasets prove the generality of our method. Both code and models will be available for further research",

In this paper, we consider a more challenging case where neither of the above assumptions holds. We propose to address this problem by removing the dependencies between features via learning weights for training samples, which helps deep models get rid of spurious correlations and, in turn, concentrate more on the true connection between discriminative features and labels. Extensive experiments clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on multiple distribution generalization benchmarks compared with state-of-the-art counterparts.

From this viewpoint, we then propose a novel continual learning approach called Bit-Level Information Preserving (BLIP) that preserves the information gain on model parameters through updating the parameters at the bit level, which can be conveniently implemented with parameter quantization. More specifically, BLIP first trains a neural network with weight quantization on the new incoming task and then estimates information gain on each parameter provided by the task data to determine the bits to be frozen to prevent forgetting. We conduct extensive experiments ranging from classification tasks to reinforcement learning tasks, and the results show that our method produces better or on par results comparing to previous state-of-the-arts.

Although there is a rich literature of self-supervised methods for either spatial (such as images) or temporal data (sound or text) modalities, a common pre-text task that benefits both modalities is largely missing. In this paper, we are interested in defining a self-supervised pre-text task for sketches and handwriting data. This data is uniquely characterised by its existence in dual modalities of rasterized images and vector coordinate sequences. We address and exploit this dual representation by proposing two novel cross-modal translation pre-text tasks for self-supervised feature learning: Vectorization and Rasterization. Vectorization learns to map image space to vector coordinates and rasterization maps vector coordinates to image space. We show that our learned encoder modules benefit both raster-based and vector-based downstream approaches to analysing hand-drawn data.

    "abstract": "Given an incomplete image without additional constraint, image inpainting natively allows for multiple solutions as long as they appear plausible. Recently, multiple-solution inpainting methods have been proposed and shown the potential of generating diverse results. However, these methods have difficulty in ensuring the quality of each solution, e.g. they produce distorted structure and/or blurry texture. We propose a two-stage model for diverse inpainting, where the first stage generates multiple coarse results each of which has a different structure, and the second stage refines each coarse result separately by augmenting texture. The proposed model is inspired by the hierarchical vector quantized variational auto-encoder (VQ-VAE), whose hierarchical architecture disentangles structural and textural information. In addition, the vector quantization in VQ-VAE enables autoregressive modeling of the discrete distribution over the structural information. Sampling from the distribution can easily generate diverse and high-quality structures, making up the first stage of our model. In the second stage, we propose a structural attention module inside the texture generation network, where the module utilizes the structural information to capture distant correlations. We further reuse the VQ-VAE to calculate two feature losses, which help improve structure coherence and texture realism, respectively. Experimental results on CelebA-HQ, Places2, and ImageNet datasets show that our method not only enhances the diversity of the inpainting solutions but also improves the visual quality of the generated multiple images.

    "abstract": "Knowledge distillation is a method of transferring the knowledge from a pretrained complex teacher model to a student model, so a smaller network can replace a large teacher network at the deployment stage. To reduce the necessity of training a large teacher model, the recent literatures introduced a self-knowledge distillation, which trains a student network progressively to distill its own knowledge without a pretrained teacher network. While Self-knowledge distillation is largely divided into a data augmentation based approach and an auxiliary network based approach, the data augmentation approach looses its local information in the augmentation process, which hinders its applicability to diverse vision tasks, such as semantic segmentation. Moreover, these knowledge distillation approaches do not receive the refined feature maps, which are prevalent in the object detection and semantic segmentation community. This paper proposes a novel self-knowledge distillation method, Feature Refinement via Self-Knowledge Distillation (FRSKD), which utilizes an auxiliary self-teacher network to transfer a refined knowledge for the classifier network. Our proposed method, FRSKD, can utilize both soft label and feature-map distillations for the self-knowledge distillation. Therefore, FRSKD can be applied to classification, and semantic segmentation, which emphasize preserving the local information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of FRSKD by enumerating its performance improvements in diverse tasks and benchmark datasets. The implemented code will be open-sourced",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We address the problem of novel view synthesis (NVS) from a few sparse source view images. Conventional image-based rendering methods estimate scene geometry and synthesize novel views in two separate steps. However, erroneous geometry estimation will decrease NVS performance as view synthesis highly depends on the quality of estimated scene geometry. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end NVS framework to eliminate the error propagation issue. To be specific, we construct a volume under the target view and design a source-view visibility estimation (SVE) module to determine the visibility of the target-view voxels in each source view. Next, we aggregate the visibility of all source views to achieve a consensus volume. Each voxel in the consensus volume indicates a surface existence probability. Then, we present a soft ray-casting (SRC) mechanism to find the most front surface in the target view (i.e. depth). Specifically, our SRC traverses the consensus volume along viewing rays and then estimates a depth probability distribution.

Our method uses a transformer encoder to jointly model vertex-vertex and vertex-joint interactions, and outputs 3D joint coordinates and mesh vertices simultaneously. Compared to existing techniques that regress pose and shape parameters, METRO does not rely on any parametric mesh models like SMPL, thus it can be easily extended to other objects such as hands. We further relax the mesh topology and allow the transformer self-attention mechanism to freely attend between any two vertices, making it possible to learn non-local relationships among mesh vertices and joints. With the proposed masked vertex modeling, our method is more robust and effective in handling challenging situations like partial occlusions. METRO generates new state-of-the-art results for human mesh reconstruction on the public Human3.6M and 3DPW datasets. Moreover, we demonstrate the generalizability of METRO to 3D hand reconstruction in the wild, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods on FreiHAND dataset",

    "abstract": "Regression tracking has gained more and more attention thanks to its easy-to-implement characteristics, while existing regression trackers rarely consider the relationships between the object parts and the complete object. This would ultimately result in drift from the target object when missing some parts of the target object. Recently, Capsule Network (CapsNet) has shown promising results for image classification benefits from its part-object relationships mechanism, while CapsNet is known for its high computational demand even when carrying out simple tasks. Therefore, a primitive adaptation of CapsNet to regression tracking does not make sense, since this will seriously affect speed of a tracker. To solve these problems, we first explore the spatial-temporal relationships endowed by the CapsNet for regression tracking. The entire regression framework, dubbed CapsuleRRT, consists of three parts. One is S-Caps, which captures the spatial relationships between the parts and the object. Meanwhile, a T-Caps module is designed to exploit the temporal relationships within the target. The response of the target is obtained by STCaps Learning. Further, a prior-guided capsule routing algorithm is proposed to generate more accurate capsule assignments for subsequent frames. Apart from this, the heavy computation burden in CapsNet is addressed with a knowledge distillation pose matrix compression strategy that exploits more tight and discriminative representation with few samples. Extensive experimental results show that CapsuleRRT performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and speed",

In this work, we propose a novel self-supervised meta-auxiliary learning to improve the performance of deblurring by integrating both external and internal learning. Concretely, we build a self-supervised auxiliary reconstruction task which shares a portion of the network with the primary deblurring task. The two tasks are jointly trained on an external dataset. Furthermore, we propose a meta-auxiliary training scheme to further optimize the pre-trained model as a base learner which is applicable for fast adaptation at test time. During training, the performance of both tasks is coupled. Therefore, we are able to exploit the internal information at test time via the auxiliary task to enhance the performance of deblurring.

However, due to the high computational cost of large-scale generators (e.g., StyleGAN2), it usually takes seconds to see the results of a single edit on edge devices, prohibiting interactive user experience. In this paper, inspired by quick preview features in modern rendering software, we propose Anycost GAN for interactive natural image editing. We train the Anycost GAN to support elastic resolutions and channels for faster image generation at versatile speeds. Running subsets of the full generator produce outputs that are perceptually similar to the full generator, making them a good proxy for a quick preview. By using sampling-based multi-resolution training, adaptive-channel training, and a generator-conditioned discriminator, the anycost generator can be evaluated at various configurations while achieving better image quality compared to separately trained models. Furthermore, we develop new encoder training and latent code optimization techniques to encourage consistency between the different sub-generators during image projection. Anycost GAN can be executed at various cost budgets (up to 10x computation reduction) and adapt to a wide range of hardware and latency requirements. When deployed on desktop CPUs and edge devices, our model can provide perceptually similar previews at 6-12x speedup, enabling interactive image editing. The code and demo are publicly available",

    "abstract": "Simulation has the potential to massively scale evaluation of self-driving systems, enabling rapid development as well as safe deployment. Bridging the gap between simulation and the real world requires realistic multi-agent behaviors. Existing simulation environments rely on heuristic-based models that directly encode traffic rules, which cannot capture irregular maneuvers (e.g., nudging, U-turns) and complex interactions (e.g., yielding, merging). In contrast, we leverage real-world data to learn directly from human demonstration, and thus capture more naturalistic driving behaviors. To this end, we propose TrafficSim, a multi-agent behavior model for realistic traffic simulation. In particular, we parameterize the policy with an implicit latent variable model that generates socially-consistent plans for all actors in the scene jointly. To learn a robust policy amenable for long horizon simulation, we unroll the policy in training and optimize through the fully differentiable simulation across time. Our learning objective incorporates both human demonstrations as well as common sense. We show TrafficSim generates significantly more realistic traffic scenarios as compared to a diverse set of baselines.

    "abstract": "In monocular video 3D multi-person pose estimation, inter-person occlusion and close interactions can cause human detection to be erroneous and human-joints grouping to be unreliable. Existing top-down methods rely on human detection and thus suffer from these problems. Existing bottom-up methods do not use human detection, but they process all persons at once at the same scale, causing them to be sensitive to multiple-persons scale variations. To address these challenges, we propose the integration of top-down and bottom-up approaches to exploit their strengths. Our top-down network estimates human joints from all persons instead of one in an image patch, making it robust to possible erroneous bounding boxes. Our bottom-up network incorporates human-detection based normalized heatmaps, allowing the network to be more robust in handling scale variations. Finally, the estimated 3D poses from the top-down and bottom-up networks are fed into our integration network for final 3D poses. Besides the integration of top-down and bottom-up networks, unlike existing pose discriminators that are designed solely for single person, and consequently cannot assess natural inter-person interactions, we propose a two-person pose discriminator that enforces natural two-person interactions. Lastly, we also apply a semi-supervised method to overcome the 3D ground-truth data scarcity.

For space distillation, we extract spatial attention maps that hints the high-frequency video content from both networks, which are further used for transferring spatial modeling ability. For time distillation, we narrow the performance gap between compact models and complicated models by distilling the feature similarity of the temporal memory cells, which is encoded from the sequence of feature maps generated in the training clips using ConvLSTM.

First, audio-visual correspondences often produce faulty positives since the audio and video signals can be uninformative of each other. To limit the detrimental impact of faulty positives, we optimize a weighted contrastive learning loss, which down-weighs their contribution to the overall loss. Second, since self-supervised contrastive learning relies on random sampling of negative instances, instances that are semantically similar to the base instance can be used as faulty negatives. To alleviate the impact of faulty negatives, we propose to optimize an instance discrimination loss with a soft target distribution that estimates relationships between instances.

First, we relieve the pressure of the generator to synthesize rich details by directly feeding the high-frequency information of the input image into the end of the generator. Second, we adopt an additional discriminator to encourage the generator to synthesize rich details. Specifically, we apply wavelet transformation to transform the image into multi-frequency domains, among which the high-frequency parts can be used to recover the rich details. We also notice that a fine-grained and wider-range control for the attribute is of great importance for face editing. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel attribute regression loss.

Recently, adversarial attack has been applied to visual object tracking to evaluate the robustness of deep trackers. Assuming that the model structures of deep trackers are known, a variety of white-box attack approaches to visual tracking have demonstrated promising results. However, the model knowledge about deep trackers is usually unavailable in real applications. In this paper, we propose a decision-based black-box attack method for visual object tracking. In contrast to existing black-box adversarial attack methods that deal with static images for image classification, we propose IoU attack that sequentially generates perturbations based on the predicted IoU scores from both current and historical frames. By decreasing the IoU scores, the proposed attack method degrades the accuracy of temporal coherent bounding boxes (i.e., object motions) accordingly. In addition, we transfer the learned perturbations to the next few frames to initialize temporal motion attacks. We validate the proposed IoU attack on state-of-the-art deep trackers (i.e., detection based, correlation filter based, and long-term trackers).

The quadratic constraint minimizes the pairwise structural discrepancy between graphs, which can reduce the ambiguities brought by only using the extracted CNN features. Moreover, we present a differentiable implementation to the quadratic constrained-optimization such that it is compatible with the unconstrained deep learning optimizer. To give more precise and proper supervision, a well-designed false matching loss against class imbalance is proposed, which can better penalize the false negatives and false positives with less overfitting.

Each video depicts dynamic movements of the body and clothes of a single person while lacking the 3D ground truth geometry. To utilize these videos, we present a new method to use the local transformation that warps the predicted local geometry of the person from an image to that of the other image at a different time instant. With the transformation, the predicted geometry can be self-supervised by the warped geometry from the other image. In addition, we jointly learn the depth along with the surface normals, which are highly responsive to local texture, wrinkle, and shade by maximizing their geometric consistency.

    "abstract": "Image-to-image translation aims to preserve source contents while translating to discriminative target styles between two visual domains. Most works apply adversarial learning in the ambient image space, which could be computationally expensive and challenging to train. In this paper, we propose to deploy an energy-based model (EBM) in the latent space of a pretrained autoencoder for this task. The pretrained autoencoder serves as both a latent code extractor and an image reconstruction worker. Our model, LETIT, is based on the assumption that two domains share the same latent space, where latent representation is implicitly decomposed as a content code and a domain-specific style code. Instead of explicitly extracting the two codes and applying adaptive instance normalization to combine them, our latent EBM can implicitly learn to transport the source style code to the target style code while preserving the content code, an advantage over existing image translation methods. This simplified solution is also more efficient in the one-sided unpaired image translation setting. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons demonstrate superior translation quality and faithfulness for content preservation.

    "abstract": "Accuracy of many visiolinguistic tasks has benefited significantly from the application of vision-and-language (V&L) BERT. However, its application for the task of vision-and-language navigation (VLN) remains limited. One reason for this is the difficulty adapting the BERT architecture to the partially observable Markov decision process present in VLN, requiring history-dependent attention and decision making. In this paper we propose a recurrent BERT model that is time-aware for use in VLN. Specifically, we equip the BERT model with a recurrent function that maintains cross-modal state information for the agent. Through extensive experiments on R2R and REVERIE we demonstrate that our model can replace more complex encoder-decoder models to achieve state-of-the-art results. Moreover, our approach can be generalised to other transformer-based architectures, supports pre-training, and is capable of solving navigation and referring expression tasks simultaneously",

    "abstract": "Generative adversarial networks (GANs), e.g., StyleGAN2, play a vital role in various image generation and synthesis tasks, yet their notoriously high computational cost hinders their efficient deployment on edge devices. Directly applying generic compression approaches yields poor results on GANs, which motivates a number of recent GAN compression works. While prior works mainly accelerate conditional GANs, e.g., pix2pix and CycleGAN, compressing state-of-the-art unconditional GANs has rarely been explored and is more challenging. In this paper, we propose novel approaches for unconditional GAN compression. We first introduce effective channel pruning and knowledge distillation schemes specialized for unconditional GANs. We then propose a novel content-aware method to guide the processes of both pruning and distillation. With content-awareness, we can effectively prune channels that are unimportant to the contents of interest, e.g., human faces, and focus our distillation on these regions, which significantly enhances the distillation quality. On StyleGAN2 and SN-GAN, we achieve a substantial improvement over the state-of-the-art compression method. Notably, we reduce the FLOPs of StyleGAN2 by 11x with visually negligible image quality loss compared to the full-size model. More interestingly, when applied to various image manipulation tasks, our compressed model forms a smoother and better disentangled latent manifold, making it more effective for image editing",

    "abstract": "We consider the challenging blind denoising problem for Poisson-Gaussian noise, in which no additional information about clean images or noise level parameters is available. Particularly, when only \"single\" noisy images are available for training a denoiser, the denoising performance of existing methods was not satisfactory. Recently, the blind pixelwise affine image denoiser (BP-AIDE) was proposed and significantly improved the performance in the above setting, to the extent that it is competitive with denoisers which utilized additional information. However, BP-AIDE seriously suffered from slow inference time due to the inefficiency of noise level estimation procedure and that of the blind-spot network (BSN) architecture it used. To that end, we propose Fast Blind Image Denoiser (FBI-Denoiser) for Poisson-Gaussian noise, which consists of two neural network models; 1) PGE-Net that estimates Poisson-Gaussian noise parameters 2000 times faster than the conventional methods and 2) FBI-Net that realizes a much more efficient BSN for pixelwise affine denoiser in terms of the number of parameters and inference speed. Consequently, we show that our FBI-Denoiser blindly trained solely based on single noisy images can achieve the state-of-the-art performance on several real-world noisy image benchmark datasets with much faster inference time (X 10), compared to BP-AIDE",

Specifically, we first learn the tensor low-rank prior of the image features with two steps: (a) we generate rank-1 tensors with discriminative components to collect the contextual information from both spatial and channel dimensions of the image features; (b) we aggregate those rank-1 tensors into a low-rank tensor as a 3D attention map to exploit the global correlation and refine the image features.

    "abstract": "Understanding the 3D world from 2D projected natural images is a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics. Recently, an unsupervised learning approach has garnered considerable attention owing to its advantages in data collection. However, to mitigate training limitations, typical methods need to impose assumptions for viewpoint distribution (e.g., a dataset containing various viewpoint images) or object shape (e.g., symmetric objects). These assumptions often restrict applications; for instance, the application to non-rigid objects or images captured from similar viewpoints (e.g., flower or bird images) remains a challenge. To complement these approaches, we propose aperture rendering generative adversarial networks (AR-GANs), which equip aperture rendering on top of GANs, and adopt focus cues to learn the depth and depth-of-field (DoF) effect of unlabeled natural images. To address the ambiguities triggered by unsupervised setting (i.e., ambiguities between smooth texture and out-of-focus blurs, and between foreground and background blurs), we develop DoF mixture learning, which enables the generator to learn real image distribution while generating diverse DoF images. In addition, we devise a center focus prior to guiding the learning direction. In the experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of AR-GANs in various datasets, such as flower, bird, and face images, demonstrate their portability by incorporating them into other 3D representation learning GANs, and validate their applicability in shallow DoF rendering",

    "abstract": "Shape modeling and reconstruction from raw point clouds of objects stand as a fundamental challenge in vision and graphics research. Classical methods consider analytic shape priors; however, their performance is degraded when the scanned points deviate from the ideal conditions of cleanness and completeness. Important progress has been recently made by data-driven approaches, which learn global and/or local models of implicit surface representations from auxiliary sets of training shapes. Motivated from a universal phenomenon that self-similar shape patterns of local surface patches repeat across the entire surface of an object, we aim to push forward the data-driven strategies and propose to learn a local implicit surface network for a shared, adaptive modeling of the entire surface for a direct surface reconstruction from raw point cloud; we also enhance the leveraging of surface self-similarities by improving correlations among the optimized latent codes of individual surface patches. Given that orientations of raw points could be unavailable or noisy, we extend signagnostic learning into our local implicit model, which enables our recovery of signed implicit fields of local surfaces from the unsigned inputs. We term our framework as Sign-Agnostic Implicit Learning of Surface Self-Similarities (SAIL-S3). With a global post-optimization of local sign flipping, SAIL-S3 is able to directly model raw, un-oriented point clouds and reconstruct high-quality object surfaces.

Compared with traditional bounding box (BBox) based tracking, this setting guides object tracking with high-level semantic information, addresses the ambiguity of BBox, and links local and global search organically together. Those benefits may bring more flexible, robust and accurate tracking performance in practical scenarios. However, existing natural language initialized trackers are developed and compared on benchmark datasets proposed for tracking-by-BBox, which can't reflect the true power of tracking-by-language. In this work, we propose a new benchmark specifically dedicated to the tracking-by-language, including a large scale dataset, strong and diverse baseline methods. Specifically, we collect 2k video sequences (contains a total of 1,244,340 frames, 663 words) and split 1300/700 for the train/testing respectively. We densely annotate one sentence in English and corresponding bounding boxes of the target object for each video. We also introduce two new challenges into TNL2K for the object tracking task, i.e., adversarial samples and modality switch.

This in practice is done by minimizing the dissimilarity between current and previous responses of the network one way or another. Our work contributes a novel method to the arsenal of distillation techniques. In contrast to previous state of the art, we propose to firstly construct low-dimensional manifolds for previous and current responses and minimize the dissimilarity between the responses along the geodesic connecting the manifolds.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The computer vision world has been re-gaining enthusiasm in various pre-trained models, including both classical ImageNet supervised pre-training and recently emerged self-supervised pre-training such as simCLR and MoCo. Pre-trained weights often boost a wide range of downstream tasks including classification, detection, and segmentation. Latest studies suggest that pre-training benefits from gigantic model capacity. We are hereby curious and ask: after pre-training, does a pre-trained model indeed have to stay large for its downstream transferability? In this paper, we examine supervised and self-supervised pre-trained models through the lens of the lottery ticket hypothesis (LTH). LTH identifies highly sparse matching subnetworks that can be trained in isolation from (nearly) scratch yet still reach the full models' performance. We extend the scope of LTH and question whether matching subnetworks still exist in pre-trained computer vision models, that enjoy the same downstream transfer performance. Our extensive experiments convey an overall positive message: from all pre-trained weights obtained by ImageNet classification, simCLR, and MoCo, we are consistently able to locate such matching subnetworks at 59.04% to 96.48% sparsity that transfer universally to multiple downstream tasks, whose performance see no degradation compared to using full pre-trained weights. Further analyses reveal that subnetworks found from different pre-training tend to yield diverse mask structures and perturbation sensitivities. We conclude that the core LTH observations remain generally relevant in the pre-training paradigm of computer vision, but more delicate discussions are needed in some cases.

Such methods, however, fail to utilize the contextual relation between the target and reference objects, and lack interpretability on its reasoning procedure. To solve these problems, we propose an iterative shrinking mechanism to localize the target, where the shrinking direction is decided by a reinforcement learning agent, with all contents within the current image patch comprehensively considered. Beside, the sequential shrinking process enables to demonstrate the reasoning about how to iteratively find the target.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Many adversarial attacks have been proposed to investigate the security issues of deep neural networks. In the black-box setting, current model stealing attacks train a substitute model to counterfeit the functionality of the target model. However, the training requires querying the target model. Consequently, the query complexity remains high, and such attacks can be defended easily. This study aims to train a generalized substitute model called \"Simulator\", which can mimic the functionality of any unknown target model. To this end, we build the training data with the form of multiple tasks by collecting query sequences generated during the attacks of various existing networks. The learning process uses a mean square error-based knowledge-distillation loss in the meta-learning to minimize the difference between the Simulator and the sampled networks. The meta-gradients of this loss are then computed and accumulated from multiple tasks to update the Simulator and subsequently improve generalization. When attacking a target model that is unseen in training, the trained Simulator can accurately simulate its functionality using its limited feedback. As a result, a large fraction of queries can be transferred to the Simulator, thereby reducing query complexity. Results of the comprehensive experiments conducted using the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces query complexity by several orders of magnitude compared to the baseline method.

    "abstract": "We present a probabilistic model for point cloud generation, which is fundamental for various 3D vision tasks such as shape completion, upsampling, synthesis and data augmentation. Inspired by the diffusion process in non-equilibrium thermodynamics, we view points in point clouds as particles in a thermodynamic system in contact with a heat bath, which diffuse from the original distribution to a noise distribution. Point cloud generation thus amounts to learning the reverse diffusion process that transforms the noise distribution to the distribution of a desired shape. Specifically, we propose to model the reverse diffusion process for point clouds as a Markov chain conditioned on certain shape latent. We derive the variational bound in closed form for training and provide implementations of the model. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves competitive performance in point cloud generation and auto-encoding.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The dual-pixel (DP) hardware works by splitting each pixel in half and creating an image pair in a single snapshot. Several works estimate depth/inverse depth by treating the DP pair as a stereo pair. However, dual-pixel disparity only occurs in image regions with the defocus blur. The heavy defocus blur in DP pairs affects the performance of matching-based depth estimation approaches. Instead of removing the blur effect blindly, we study the formation of the DP pair which links the blur and the depth information. In this paper, we propose a mathematical DP model which can benefit depth estimation by the blur. These explorations motivate us to propose an end-to-end DDDNet (DP-based Depth and Deblur Network) to jointly estimate the depth and restore the image. Moreover, we define a reblur loss, which reflects the relationship of the DP image formation process with depth information, to regularise our depth estimate in training. To meet the requirement of a large amount of data for learning, we propose the first DP image simulator which allows us to create datasets with DP pairs from any existing RGBD dataset. As a side contribution, we collect a real dataset for further research. Extensive experimental evaluation on both synthetic and real datasets shows that our approach achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches",

    "abstract": "Integrated Gradients (IG) is a commonly used feature attribution method for deep neural networks. While IG has many desirable properties, the method often produces spurious/noisy pixel attributions in regions that are not related to the predicted class when applied to visual models. While this has been previously noted, most existing solutions are aimed at addressing the symptoms by explicitly reducing the noise in the resulting attributions. In this work, we show that one of the causes of the problem is the accumulation of noise along the IG path. To minimize the effect of this source of noise, we propose adapting the attribution path itself -- conditioning the path not just on the image but also on the model being explained. We introduce Adaptive Path Methods (APMs) as a generalization of path methods, and Guided IG as a specific instance of an APM. Empirically, Guided IG creates saliency maps better aligned with the model's prediction and the input image that is being explained. We show through qualitative and quantitative experiments that Guided IG outperforms other, related methods in nearly every experiment",

    "abstract": "A useful application of event sensing is visual odometry, especially in settings that require high-temporal resolution. The state-of-the-art method of contrast maximisation recovers the motion from a batch of events by maximising the contrast of the image of warped events. However, the cost scales with image resolution and the temporal resolution can be limited by the need for large batch sizes to yield sufficient structure in the contrast image (see supplementary material for demonstration program). In this work, we propose spatiotemporal registration as a compelling technique for event-based rotational motion estimation. We theoretically justify the approach and establish its fundamental and practical advantages over contrast maximisation. In particular, spatiotemporal registration also produces feature tracks as a by-product, which directly supports an efficient visual odometry pipeline with graph-based optimisation for motion averaging. The simplicity of our visual odometry pipeline allows it to process more than 1 M events/second. We also contribute a new event dataset for visual odometry, where motion sequences with large velocity variations were acquired using a high-precision robot arm.

However, annotating videos with frame-wise labels to train such models is very expensive and time consuming. While weakly supervised methods trained using only ordered action lists require less annotation effort, the performance is still worse than fully supervised approaches. In this paper, we propose to use timestamp supervision for the temporal action segmentation task. Timestamps require a comparable annotation effort to weakly supervised approaches, and yet provide a more supervisory signal. To demonstrate the effectiveness of timestamp supervision, we propose an approach to train a segmentation model using only timestamps annotations. Our approach uses the model output and the annotated timestamps to generate frame-wise labels by detecting the action changes. We further introduce a confidence loss that forces the predicted probabilities to monotonically decrease as the distance to the timestamps increases. This ensures that all and not only the most distinctive frames of an action are learned during training. The evaluation on four datasets shows that models trained with timestamps annotations achieve comparable performance to the fully supervised approaches",

As part of our study, we identify that the choice of loss is critical to ensuring that the extracted model is an accurate replica of the victim model. Furthermore, we address difficulties arising from the adversary's limited access to the victim model in a black-box setting. For example, we recover the model's logits from its probability predictions to approximate gradients.

Camera provides rich texture and color cues while LiDAR specializes in relative distance sensing. The challenge of 3D object detection lies in effectively fusing 2D camera images with 3D LiDAR points. In this paper, we present a novel cross-modal 3D object detection algorithm, named PointAugmenting. On one hand, PointAugmenting decorates point clouds with corresponding point-wise CNN features extracted by pretrained 2D detection models, and then performs 3D object detection over the decorated point clouds. In comparison with highly abstract semantic segmentation scores to decorate point clouds, CNN features from detection networks adapt to object appearance variations, achieving significant improvement. On the other hand, PointAugmenting benefits from a novel cross-modal data augmentation algorithm, which consistently pastes virtual objects into images and point clouds during network training. Extensive experiments on the large-scale nuScenes and Waymo datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our PointAugmenting. Notably, PointAugmenting outperforms the LiDAR-only baseline detector by +6.5% mAP and achieves the new state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes leaderboard to date",

While great efforts have been made to design the convolution operator, how to best aggregate vertex features across hierarchical levels deserves further attention. In contrast to resorting to mesh decimation, we propose an attention based module to learn mapping matrices for better feature aggregation across hierarchical levels. Specifically, the mapping matrices are generated by a compatibility function of the keys and queries. The keys and queries are trainable variables, learned by optimizing the target objective, and shared by all data samples of the same object class. Our proposed module can be used as a train-only drop-in replacement for the feature aggregation in existing architectures for both downsampling and upsampling.

Furthermore, the co-occurrence of audiovisual events in videos can be exploited to localize objects over the image field by solely monitoring the sound in the environment.

Moreover, the robustness of these methods has been limited as they primarily rely on RGB images which are highly susceptible to illumination and weather changes. In this work, we present the novel self-supervised MM-DistillNet framework consisting of multiple teachers that leverage diverse modalities including RGB, depth, and thermal images, to simultaneously exploit complementary cues and distill knowledge into a single audio student network. We propose the new MTA loss function that facilitates the distillation of information from multimodal teachers in a self-supervised manner.

Yet, generating these images is very computationally intensive, limiting their applicability in practical scenarios. In this paper, we propose a technique based on spatial decomposition capable of mitigating this issue. Our key observation is that there are diminishing returns in employing larger (deeper and/or wider) networks. Hence, we propose to spatially decompose a scene and dedicate smaller networks for each decomposed part. When working together, these networks can render the whole scene. This allows us near-constant inference time regardless of the number of decomposed parts. Moreover, we show that a Voronoi spatial decomposition is preferable for this purpose, as it is provably compatible with the Painter's Algorithm for efficient and GPU-friendly rendering. Our experiments show that for real-world scenes, our method provides up to 3x more efficient inference than NeRF (with the same rendering quality), or an improvement of up to 1.0 dB in PSNR (for the same inference cost)",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised Domain Adaptive (UDA) person re-identification (ReID) aims at adapting the model trained on a labeled source-domain dataset to a target-domain dataset without any further annotations. Most successful UDA-ReID approaches combine clustering-based pseudo-label prediction with representation learning and perform the two steps in an alternating fashion. However, offline interaction between these two steps may allow noisy pseudo labels to substantially hinder the capability of the model. In this paper, we propose a Group-aware Label Transfer (GLT) algorithm, which enables the online interaction and mutual promotion of pseudo-label prediction and representation learning. Specifically, a label transfer algorithm simultaneously uses pseudo labels to train the data while refining the pseudo labels as an online clustering algorithm. It treats the online label refinery problem as an optimal transport problem, which explores the minimum cost for assigning M samples to N pseudo labels. More importantly, we introduce a group-aware strategy to assign implicit attribute group IDs to samples. The combination of the online label refining algorithm and the group-aware strategy can better correct the noisy pseudo label in an online fashion and narrow down the search space of the target identity. The effectiveness of the proposed GLT is demonstrated by the experimental results (Rank-1 accuracy) for Market1501\\toDukeMTMC (82.0%) and DukeMTMC\\toMarket1501 (92.2%), remarkably closing the gap between unsupervised and supervised performance on person re-identification",

Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown promising ability for MR image super-resolution (SR) given low-resolution (LR) MR images. The LR MR images usually share some visual characteristics: repeating patterns, relatively simpler structures, and less informative background. Most previous CNN-based SR methods treat the spatial pixels (including the background) equally. They also fail to sense the entire space of the input, which is critical for high-quality MR image SR. To address those problems, we propose squeeze and excitation reasoning attention networks (SERAN) for accurate MR image SR. We propose to squeeze attention from global spatial information of the input and obtain global descriptors. Such global descriptors enhance the network's ability to focus on more informative regions and structures in MR images. We further build relationship among those global descriptors and propose primitive relationship reasoning attention. The global descriptors are further refined with the learned attention. To fully make use of the aggregated information, we adaptively recalibrate feature responses with learned adaptive attention vectors. These attention vectors select a subset of global descriptors to complement each spatial location for accurate details and texture reconstruction. We propose squeeze and excitation attention with residual scaling, which not only stabilizes the training but also makes it flexible to other basic networks.

Existing datasets take one of two approaches. Large-scale video datasets contain many action labels but do not contain ground-truth 3D human motion. Alternatively, motion-capture (mocap) datasets have precise body motions but are limited to a small number of actions. To address this, we present BABEL, a large dataset with language labels describing the actions being performed in mocap sequences. BABEL consists of language labels for over 43 hours of mocap sequences from AMASS, containing over 250 unique actions. Each action label in BABEL is precisely aligned with the duration of the corresponding action in the mocap sequence. BABEL also allows overlap of multiple actions, that may each span different durations. This results in a total of over 66000 action segments. The dense annotations can be leveraged for tasks like action recognition, temporal localization, motion synthesis, etc. To demonstrate the value of BABEL as a benchmark, we evaluate the performance of models on 3D action recognition. We demonstrate that BABEL poses interesting learning challenges that are applicable to real-world scenarios, and can serve as a useful benchmark for progress in 3D action recognition.

Specifically, the first generator aims to learn effective point embeddings in a breadth-first manner, while the second generator is used to refine the generated point cloud based on a depth-first point embedding to generate a robust and uniform point cloud. The proposed dual-generators framework thus is able to progressively learn effective point embeddings for accurate point cloud generation. Experimental results on a variety of object categories from the most popular point cloud generation dataset, ShapeNet, demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed method for accurate point cloud generation",

    "abstract": "Data association across frames is at the core of Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) task. This problem is usually solved by a traditional graph-based optimization or directly learned via deep learning. Despite their popularity, we find some points worth studying in current paradigm: 1) Existing methods mostly ignore the context information among tracklets and intra-frame detections, which makes the tracker hard to survive in challenging cases like severe occlusion. 2) The end-to-end association methods solely rely on the data fitting power of deep neural networks, while they hardly utilize the advantage of optimization-based assignment methods. 3) The graph-based optimization methods mostly utilize a separate neural network to extract features, which brings the inconsistency between training and inference. Therefore, in this paper we propose a novel learnable graph matching method to address these issues. Briefly speaking, we model the relationships between tracklets and the intra-frame detections as a general undirected graph. Then the association problem turns into a general graph matching between tracklet graph and detection graph. Furthermore, to make the optimization end-to-end differentiable, we relax the original graph matching into continuous quadratic programming and then incorporate the training of it into a deep graph network with the help of the implicit function theorem. Lastly, our method GMTracker, achieves state-of-the-art performance on several standard MOT datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/jiaweihe1996/GMTracker",

Recent studies prefer point based or voxel based convolution for achieving high performance. However, these methods suffer from the unsatisfied efficiency or complex customized convolution, making them unsuitable for applications with real-time requirements. In this paper, we present an efficient and effective 3D object detection framework, named RangeIoUDet that uses the range image as input. Benefiting from the dense representation of the range image, RangeIoUDet is entirely constructed based on 2D convolution, making it possible to have a fast inference speed. This model learns pointwise features from the range image, which is then passed to a region proposal network for predicting 3D bounding boxes. We optimize the pointwise feature and the 3D box via the point-based IoU and box-based IoU supervision, respectively. The point-based IoU supervision is proposed to make the network better learn the implicit 3D information encoded in the range image. The 3D Hybrid GIoU loss is introduced to generate high-quality boxes while providing an accurate quality evaluation. Through the point-based IoU and the box-based IoU, RangeIoUDet outperforms all single-stage models on the KITTI dataset, while running at 45 FPS for inference.

To tackle these challenges, we first quantify domain shifts between popular VQA datasets, in both visual and textual space. To disentangle shifts between datasets arising from different modalities, we also construct synthetic shifts in the image and question domains separately. Second, we test the robustness of different families of VQA methods (classic two-stream, transformer, and neuro-symbolic methods) to these shifts. Third, we test the applicability of existing domain adaptation methods and devise a new one to bridge VQA domain gaps, adjusted to specific VQA models.

Towards solving this issue, previous works mainly focused on encouraging the correlation between the latent codes and the generated images, while ignoring the relations between images generated from various latent codes. The recent MSGAN tried to encourage the diversity of the generated image but still only considers \"negative\" relations between the image pairs. In this paper, we propose a novel DivCo framework to properly constrain both \"positive\" and \"negative\" relations between the generated images specified in the latent space. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to use contrastive learning for diverse conditional image synthesis. A latent-augmented contrastive loss is introduced, which encourage images generated from adjacent latent codes to be similar and those generated from distinct latent codes to show low affinities. The proposed latent-augmented contrastive loss are well compatible with various cGAN architectures.

    "abstract": "Weight pruning is an effective technique to reduce the model size and inference time for deep neural networks in real world deployments. However, since magnitudes and relative importance of weights are very different for different layers of a neural network, existing methods rely on either manual tuning or handcrafted heuristic rules to find appropriate pruning rates individually for each layer. This approach general leads to suboptimal performance. In this paper, by directly working on the probability space, we propose an effective network sparsification method called probabilistic masking (ProbMask), which solves a natural sparsification formulation under global sparsity constraint. The key idea is to use probability as a global criterion for all layers to measure the weight importance. An appealing feature of ProbMask is that the amounts of weight redundancy can be learned automatically via our constraint and thus we avoid the problem of tuning pruning rates individually for different layers in a network. Extensive experimental results on CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet demonstrate that our method is highly effective, and can outperform previous state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin, especially in the high pruning rate situation. Notably, the gap of Top-1 accuracy between our ProbMask and existing methods can be up to 10%. As a by-product, we show ProbMask is also highly effective in identifying supermasks, which are subnetworks with high performance in a randomly weighted dense neural network",

Deep learning based methods learning the mappings between the compressive images and the HSIs directly achieved much better results. Yet, it is nontrivial to design a powerful deep network heuristically for achieving satisfied results. In this paper, we propose a novel HSI reconstruction method based on the Maximum a Posterior (MAP) estimation framework using learned Gaussian Scale Mixture (GSM) prior.

However, the similarity of the outputs cannot guarantee the accuracy of target samples, i.e., traget samples may match to wrong categories even if the discrepancy between two classifiers is small. To challenge this issue, in this paper, we propose a cross-domain gradient discrepancy minimization (CGDM) method which explicitly minimizes the discrepancy of gradients generated by source samples and target samples. Specifically, the gradient gives a cue for the semantic information of target samples so it can be used as a good supervision to improve the accuracy of target samples. In order to compute the gradient signal of target smaples, we further obtain target pseudo labels through a clustering-based self-supervised learning.

    "abstract": "Generating high-quality stitched images with natural structures is a challenging task in computer vision. In this paper, we succeed in preserving both local and global geometric structures for wide parallax images, while reducing artifacts and distortions. A projective invariant, Characteristic Number, is used to match co-planar local sub-regions for input images. The homography between these well-matched sub-regions produces consistent line and point pairs, suppressing artifacts in overlapping areas. We explore and introduce global collinear structures into an objective function to specify and balance the desired characters for image warping, which can preserve both local and global structures while alleviating distortions. We also develop comprehensive measures for stitching quality to quantify the collinearity of points and the discrepancy of matched line pairs by considering the sensitivity to linear structures for human vision. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art by presenting sharp textures and preserving prominent natural structures in stitched images. Especially, our method not only exhibits lower errors but also the least divergence across all test images. Code is available at https://github.com/dut-media-lab/Image-Stitching",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "3D object detection is an important yet demanding task that heavily relies on difficult to obtain 3D annotations. To reduce the required amount of supervision, we propose 3DIoUMatch, a novel semi-supervised method for 3D object detection applicable to both indoor and outdoor scenes. We leverage a teacher-student mutual learning framework to propagate information from the labeled to the unlabeled train set in the form of pseudo-labels. However, due to the high task complexity, we observe that the pseudo-labels suffer from significant noise and are thus not directly usable. To that end, we introduce a confidence-based filtering mechanism, inspired by FixMatch. We set confidence thresholds based upon the predicted objectness and class probability to filter low-quality pseudo-labels. While effective, we observe that these two measures do not sufficiently capture localization quality. We therefore propose to use the estimated 3D IoU as a localization metric and set category-aware self-adjusted thresholds to filter poorly localized proposals. We adopt VoteNet as our backbone detector on indoor datasets while we use PV-RCNN on the autonomous driving dataset, KITTI. Our method consistently improves state-of-the-art methods on both ScanNet and SUN-RGBD benchmarks by significant margins under all label ratios (including fully labeled setting). For example, when training using only 10% labeled data on ScanNet, 3DIoUMatch achieves 7.7 absolute improvement on mAP@0.25 and 8.5 absolute improvement on mAP@0.5 upon the prior art. On KITTI, we are the first to demonstrate semi-supervised 3D object detection and our method surpasses a fully supervised baseline from 1.8% to 7.6% under different label ratio and categories",

Our neural rendering pipeline accelerates SOTA neural volume rendering by about two orders of magnitude and our implicit surface representation is unique in allowing us to export a mesh with view-dependent texture information. Thus, like other implicit surface representations, ours is compatible with traditional graphics pipelines, enabling real-time rendering rates, while achieving unprecedented image quality compared to other surface methods.

    "abstract": "Vehicle detection with visual sensors like lidar and camera is one of the critical functions enabling autonomous driving. While they generate fine-grained point clouds or high-resolution images with rich information in good weather conditions, they fail in adverse weather (e.g., fog) where opaque particles distort lights and significantly reduce visibility. Thus, existing methods relying on lidar or camera experience significant performance degradation in rare but critical adverse weather conditions. To remedy this, we resort to exploiting complementary radar, which is less impacted by adverse weather and becomes prevalent on vehicles. In this paper, we present Multimodal Vehicle Detection Network (MVDNet), a two-stage deep fusion detector, which first generates proposals from two sensors and then fuses region-wise features between multimodal sensor streams to improve final detection results. To evaluate MVDNet, we create a procedurally generated training dataset based on the collected raw lidar and radar signals from the open-source Oxford Radar Robotcar. We show that the proposed MVDNet surpasses other state-of-the-art methods, notably in terms of Average Precision (AP), especially in adverse weather conditions.

However, since Newton's method initializes the whitening matrix independently at each training step, no information is shared between consecutive steps. In this work, instead of exact computation of whitening matrix at each time step, we estimate it gradually during training in an online fashion, using our proposed Stochastic Whitening Batch Normalization (SWBN) algorithm. We show that while SWBN improves the convergence rate and generalization of DNNs, its computational overhead is less than that of IterNorm. Due to the high efficiency of the proposed method, it can be easily employed in most DNN architectures with a large number of layers.

    "abstract": "Few-shot segmentation has been attracting a lot of attention due to its effectiveness to segment unseen object classes with a few annotated samples. Most existing approaches use masked Global Average Pooling (GAP) to encode an annotated support image to a feature vector to facilitate query image segmentation. However, this pipeline unavoidably loses some discriminative information due to the average operation. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective self-guided learning approach, where the lost critical information is mined. Specifically, through making an initial prediction for the annotated support image, the covered and uncovered foreground regions are encoded to the primary and auxiliary support vectors using masked GAP, respectively. By aggregating both the primary and auxiliary support vectors, better segmentation performance is obtained on query images. Enlightened by our self-guided module for 1-shot segmentation, we propose a cross-guided module for multiple shot segmentation, where the final mask is fused using predictions from multiple annotated samples with high-quality support vectors contributing more and vice versa. This module improves the final prediction in the inference stage without re-training.

Many hand-crafted and in particular learned image descriptors are numerical vectors with a potentially (very) large number of dimensions.

In this paper, we use hyperdimensional computing (HDC) as an approach to systematically combine information from a set of vectors in a single vector of the same dimensionality. HDC is a known technique to perform symbolic processing with distributed representations in numerical vectors with thousands of dimensions. We present a HDC implementation that is suitable for processing the output of existing and future (deep learning based) image descriptors. We discuss how this can be used as a framework to process descriptors together with additional knowledge by simple and fast vector operations. A concrete outcome is a novel HDC-based approach to aggregate a set of local image descriptors together with their image positions in a single holistic descriptor.

However, when learning tasks sequentially, the networks easily forget the knowledge of previous tasks, known as \"catastrophic forgetting\". To achieve the consistencies between the old tasks and the new task, one effective solution is to modify the gradient for update. Previous methods enforce independent gradient constraints for different tasks, while we consider these gradients contain complex information, and propose to leverage inter-task information by gradient decomposition. In particular, the gradient of an old task is decomposed into a part shared by all old tasks and a part specific to that task. The gradient for update should be close to the gradient of the new task, consistent with the gradients shared by all old tasks, and orthogonal to the space spanned by the gradients specific to the old tasks. In this way, our approach will encourage common knowledge consolidation but will not impair the task-specific knowledge. Furthermore, the optimization is performed for the gradients of each layer separately rather than the concatenation of all gradients as in previous works. This effectively avoids the influence of the magnitude variation of the gradients in different layers. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of both gradient-decomposed optimization and layer-wise updates.

Through experiments, we observe that a higher frequency, and hence a smaller pixel displacement between consecutive frames, tends to deliver favorable super-resolved results. This discovery motivates us to introduce Event Cameras, a novel sensing device that responds instantly to pixel intensity changes and produces up to millions of asynchronous events per second, to facilitate VSR. To this end, we propose an Event-based VSR framework (E-VSR), of which the key component is an asynchronous interpolation (EAI) module that reconstructs a high-frequency (HF) video stream with uniform and tiny pixel displacements between neighboring frames from an event stream. The derived HF video stream is then encoded into a VSR module to recover the desired HR videos. Furthermore, an LR bi-directional interpolation loss and an HR self-supervision loss are also introduced to respectively regulate the EAI and VSR modules.

    "abstract": "Hyperspectral photoacoustic (HSPA) spectroscopy is an emerging bi-modal imaging technology that is able to show the wavelength-dependent absorption distribution of the interior of a 3D volume. However, HSPA devices have to scan an object exhaustively in the spatial and spectral domains; and the acquired data tend to suffer from complex noise. This time-consuming scanning process and noise severely affects the usability of HSPA. It is therefore critical to examine the feasibility of 4D HSPA data restoration from an incomplete and noisy observation. In this work, we present a data reliability analysis for the depth and spectral domain. On the basis of this analysis, we explore the inherent data correlations and develop a restoration algorithm to recover 4D HSPA cubes. Experiments on real data verify that the proposed method achieves satisfactory restoration results",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Learning image representations without human supervision is an important and active research field. Several recent approaches have successfully leveraged the idea of making such a representation invariant under different types of perturbations, especially via contrastive-based instance discrimination training. Although effective visual representations should indeed exhibit such invariances, there are other important characteristics, such as encoding contextual reasoning skills, for which alternative reconstruction-based approaches might be better suited. With this in mind, we propose a teacher-student scheme to learn representations by training a convolutional net to reconstruct a bag-of-visual-words (BoW) representation of an image, given as input a perturbed version of that same image. Our strategy performs an online training of both the teacher network (whose role is to generate the BoW targets) and the student network (whose role is to learn representations), along with an online update of the visual-words vocabulary (used for the BoW targets). This idea effectively enables fully online BoW-guided unsupervised learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the interest of our BoW-based strategy, which surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods (including contrastive-based ones) in several applications. For instance, in downstream tasks such Pascal object detection, Pascal classification and Places205 classification, our method improves over all prior unsupervised approaches, thus establishing new state-of-the-art results that are also significantly better even than those of supervised pre-training.

Our method uses a more advanced form of meta-regularization to increase the generalization ability of learned registration models.

The hyperbolic neighborhood aggregation updates each node representation via the Einstein midpoint.

We exploit the peculiarities of NCD to build a new framework, named Neighborhood Contrastive Learning (NCL), to learn discriminative representations that are important to clustering performance. Our contribution is twofold. First, we find that a feature extractor trained on the labeled set generates representations in which a generic query sample and its neighbors are likely to share the same class. We exploit this observation to retrieve and aggregate pseudo positive pairs with contrastive learning, thus encouraging the model to learn more discriminative representations. Second, we notice that most of the instances are easily discriminated by the network, contributing less to the contrastive loss. To overcome this issue, we propose to generate hard negatives by mixing labeled and unlabeled samples in the feature space. We experimentally demonstrate that these two ingredients significantly contribute to clustering performance and lead our model to outperform state of the art by a large margin (e.g., clustering accuracy +13% on CIFAR-100 and +8% on ImageNet)",

To demonstrate this, we present SimPoE, a Simulation-based approach for 3D human Pose Estimation, which integrates image-based kinematic inference and physics-based dynamics modeling. SimPoE learns a policy that takes as input the current-frame pose estimate and the next image frame to control a physically-simulated character to output the next-frame pose estimate. The policy contains a learnable kinematic pose refinement unit that uses 2D keypoints to iteratively refine its kinematic pose estimate of the next frame. Based on this refined kinematic pose, the policy learns to compute dynamics-based control (e.g., joint torques) of the character to advance the current-frame pose estimate to the pose estimate of the next frame. This design couples the kinematic pose refinement unit with the dynamics-based control generation unit, which are learned jointly with reinforcement learning to achieve accurate and physically-plausible pose estimation. Furthermore, we propose a meta-control mechanism that dynamically adjusts the character's dynamics parameters based on the character state to attain more accurate pose estimates.

This, however, has the drawback of ignoring the different geometric meanings provided by those raw attributes. This issue might possibly confuse the network in learning discriminative geometric features and result in many isolated false predictions on the dental model. Against this issue, we propose a two-stream graph convolutional network (TSGCNet) to learn multi-view geometric information from different geometric attributes. Our TSGCNet adopts two graph-learning streams, designed in an input-aware fashion, to extract more discriminative high-level geometric representations from coordinates and normal vectors, respectively. These feature representations learned from the designed two different streams are further fused to integrate the multi-view complementary information for the cell-wise dense prediction task.

In this paper, we propose a novel generalizable Re-ID framework, named Meta Batch-Instance Normalization (MetaBIN). Our main idea is to generalize normalization layers by simulating unsuccessful generalization scenarios beforehand in the meta-learning pipeline. To this end, we combine learnable batch-instance normalization layers with meta-learning and investigate the challenging cases caused by both batch and instance normalization layers. Moreover, we diversify the virtual simulations via our meta-train loss accompanied by a cyclic inner-updating manner to boost generalization capability. After all, the MetaBIN framework prevents our model from overfitting to the given source styles and improves the generalization capability to unseen domains without additional data augmentation or complicated network design.

    "abstract": "Modern human-object interaction (HOI) detection approaches can be divided into one-stage methods and two-stage ones. One-stage models are more efficient due to their straightforward architectures, but the two-stage models are still advantageous in accuracy. Existing one-stage models usually begin by detecting predefined interaction areas or points, and then attend to these areas only for interaction prediction; therefore, they lack reasoning steps that dynamically search for discriminative cues. In this paper, we propose a novel one-stage method, namely Glance and Gaze Network (GGNet), which adaptively models a set of action-aware points (ActPoints) via glance and gaze steps. The glance step quickly determines whether each pixel in the feature maps is an interaction point. The gaze step leverages feature maps produced by the glance step to adaptively infer ActPoints around each pixel in a progressive manner. Features of the refined ActPoints are aggregated for interaction prediction. Moreover, we design an action-aware approach that effectively matches each detected interaction with its associated human-object pair, along with a novel hard negative attentive loss to improve the optimization of GGNet. All the above operations are conducted simultaneously and efficiently for all pixels in the feature maps.

    "abstract": "We present a simple, effective, and general activation function we term ACON which learns to activate the neurons or not. Interestingly, we find Swish, the recent popular NAS-searched activation, can be interpreted as a smooth approximation to ReLU. Intuitively, in the same way, we approximate the more general Maxout family to our novel ACON family, which remarkably improves the performance and makes Swish a special case of ACON. Next, we present meta-ACON, which explicitly learns to optimize the parameter switching between non-linear (activate) and linear (inactivate) and provides a new design space. By simply changing the activation function, we show its effectiveness on both small models and highly optimized large models (e.g. it improves the ImageNet top-1 accuracy rate by 6.7% and 1.8% on MobileNet-0.25 and ResNet-152, respectively). Moreover, our novel ACON can be naturally transferred to object detection and semantic segmentation, showing that ACON is an effective alternative in a variety of tasks.

    "abstract": "Modern deep learning techniques that regress the relative camera pose between two images have difficulty dealing with challenging scenarios, such as large camera motions resulting in occlusions and significant changes in perspective that leave little overlap between images. These models continue to struggle even with the benefit of large supervised training datasets. To address the limitations of these models, we take inspiration from techniques that show regressing keypoint locations in 2D and 3D can be improved by estimating a discrete distribution over keypoint locations. Analogously, in this paper we explore improving camera pose regression by instead predicting a discrete distribution over camera poses. To realize this idea, we introduce DirectionNet, which estimates discrete distributions over the 5D relative pose space using a novel parameterization to make the estimation problem tractable. Specifically, DirectionNet factorizes relative camera pose, specified by a 3D rotation and a translation direction, into a set of 3D direction vectors. Since 3D directions can be identified with points on the sphere, DirectionNet estimates discrete distributions on the sphere as its output. We evaluate our model on challenging synthetic and real pose estimation datasets constructed from Matterport3D and InteriorNet. Promising results show a near 50% reduction in error over direct regression methods",

Accordingly, in geometry processing, maps are ubiquitous and are used in many core applications, such as paramterization, shape analysis, remeshing, and deformation. Unfortunately, most computational representations of surface maps do not lend themselves to manipulation and optimization, usually entailing hard, discrete problems. While algorithms exist to solve these problems, they are problem-specific, and a general framework for surface maps is still in need. In this paper, we advocate to consider neural networks as encoding surface maps. Since neural networks can be composed on one another and are differentiable, we show it is easy to use them to define surfaces via atlases, compose them for surface-to-surface mappings, and optimize differentiable objectives relating to them, such as any notion of distortion, in a trivial manner. In our experiments, we represent surfaces by generating a neural map that approximates a UV parameterization of a 3D model. Then, we compose this map with other neural maps which we optimize with respect to distortion measures. We show that our formulation enables trivial optimization of rather elusive mapping tasks, such as maps between a collection of surfaces",

By further exploiting either the low-rank structure or the Kronecker-product properties of the quasi-Newton approximations, the computation of the quasi-Newton direction is affordable. Global convergence to stationary point and local superlinear convergence rate are established under some mild assumptions.

Existing point cloud completion methods tend to generate global shape skeletons and hence lack fine local details. Furthermore, they mostly learn a deterministic partial-to-complete mapping, but overlook structural relations in man-made objects. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a variational framework, Variational Relational point Completion network (VRCNet) with two appealing properties: 1) Probabilistic Modeling. In particular, we propose a dual-path architecture to enable principled probabilistic modeling across partial and complete clouds. One path consumes complete point clouds for reconstruction by learning a point VAE. The other path generates complete shapes for partial point clouds, whose embedded distribution is guided by distribution obtained from the reconstruction path during training. 2) Relational Enhancement. Specifically, we carefully design point self-attention kernel and point selective kernel module to exploit relational point features, which refines local shape details conditioned on the coarse completion. In addition, we contribute a multi-view partial point cloud dataset (MVP dataset) containing over 100,000 high-quality scans, which renders partial 3D shapes from 26 uniformly distributed camera poses for each 3D CAD model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VRCNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods on all standard point cloud completion benchmarks.

This paper introduces StruMonoNet, which detects and enforces a planar structure to enhance pixel-wise predictions. StruMonoNet innovates in leveraging a hybrid representation that combines visual feature and a surfel representation for plane prediction. This formulation allows us to combine the power of visual feature learning and the flexibility of geometric representations in incorporating geometric relations. As a result, StruMonoNet can detect relations between planes such as adjacent planes, perpendicular planes, and parallel planes, all of which are beneficial for dense 3D prediction.

Semantic segmentation and monocular depth estimation are shown to be complementary tasks; in a multi-task learning setting, a proper encoding of their relationships can further improve performance on both tasks. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel Cross-Task Relation Layer (CTRL), which encodes task dependencies between the semantic and depth predictions. To capture the cross-task relationships, we propose a neural network architecture that contains task-specific and cross-task refinement heads. Furthermore, we propose an Iterative Self-Learning (ISL) training scheme, which exploits semantic pseudo-labels to provide extra supervision on the target domain. We experimentally observe improvements in both tasks' performance because the complementary information present in these tasks is better captured. Specifically, we show that: (1) our approach improves performance on all tasks when they are complementary and mutually dependent; (2) the CTRL helps to improve both semantic segmentation and depth estimation tasks performance in the challenging UDA setting; (3) the proposed ISL training scheme further improves the semantic segmentation performance.

To balance plasticity and stability of network in continual learning, in this paper, we propose a novel network training algorithm called Adam-NSCL, which sequentially optimizes network parameters in the null space of previous tasks. We first propose two mathematical conditions respectively for achieving network stability and plasticity in continual learning. Based on them, the network training for sequential tasks can be simply achieved by projecting the candidate parameter update into the approximate null space of all previous tasks in the network training process, where the candidate parameter update can be generated by Adam. The approximate null space can be derived by applying singular value decomposition to the uncentered covariance matrix of all input features of previous tasks for each linear layer. For efficiency, the uncentered covariance matrix can be incrementally computed after learning each task. We also empirically verify the rationality of the approximate null space at each linear layer. We apply our approach to training networks for continual learning on benchmark datasets of CIFAR-100 and TinyImageNet, and the results suggest that the proposed approach outperforms or matches the state-ot-the-art continual learning approaches",

Off-the-shelf clustering methods are limited to curated, single-label, and object-centric images yet real-world data are dominantly uncurated, multi-label, and scene-centric.

However, solely relying on pixel-wise feature similarity fails to learn high-level semantic concepts and overfits to low-level visual cues. We propose a method to incorporate geometric consistency as an inductive bias to learn invariance and equivariance for photometric and geometric variations.

The inevitable variation in the instance scales can lead bottom-up methods to become particularly sensitive to hyper-parameter values. To this end, we propose instead a dynamic, proposal-free, data-driven approach that generates the appropriate convolution kernels to apply in response to the nature of the instances. To make the kernels discriminative, we explore a large context by gathering homogeneous points that share identical semantic categories and have close votes for the geometric centroids. Instances are then decoded by several simple convolutional layers. Due to the limited receptive field introduced by the sparse convolution, a small light-weight transformer is also devised to capture the long-range dependencies and high-level interactions among point samples. The proposed method achieves promising results on both ScanetNetV2 and S3DIS, and this performance is robust to the particular hyper-parameter values chosen.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Capturing interpretable variations has long been one of the goals in disentanglement learning. However, unlike the independence assumption, interpretability has rarely been exploited to encourage disentanglement in the unsupervised setting. In this paper, we examine the interpretability of disentangled representations by investigating two questions: where to be interpreted and what to be interpreted? A latent code is easily to be interpreted if it would consistently impact a certain subarea of the resulting generated image. We thus propose to learn a spatial mask to localize the effect of each individual latent dimension. On the other hand, interpretability usually comes from latent dimensions that capture simple and basic variations in data. We thus impose a perturbation on a certain dimension of the latent code, and expect to identify the perturbation along this dimension from the generated images so that the encoding of simple variations can be enforced. Additionally, we develop an unsupervised model selection method, which accumulates perceptual distance scores along axes in the latent space. On various datasets, our models can learn high-quality disentangled representations without supervision, showing the proposed modeling of interpretability is an effective proxy for achieving unsupervised disentanglement",

Unfortunately, most existing generative models focus primarily on the geometric or visual plausibility, ignoring the physical or structural constraints. To remedy this, we present a novel method aimed to endow deep generative models with physical reasoning. In particular, we introduce a loss and a learning framework that promote two key characteristics of the generated shapes: their connectivity and physical stability. The former ensures that each generated shape consists of a single connected component, while the latter promotes the stability of that shape when subjected to gravity. Our proposed physical losses are fully differentiable and we demonstrate their use in end-to-end learning. Crucially we demonstrate that such physical objectives can be achieved without sacrificing the expressive power of the model and variability of the generated results. We demonstrate through extensive comparisons with the state-of-the-art deep generative models, the utility and efficiency of our proposed approach, while avoiding the potentially costly differentiable physical simulation at training time",

Since the resulting objective is non-convex one often resorts to using standard splitting schemes such as Alternating Direction Methods of Multipliers (ADMM), or other subgradient methods, which exhibit slow convergence in the neighbourhood of a local minimum. We propose a method using second order methods, in particular the variable Projection method (VarPro), by replacing the non-convex penalties with a surrogate capable of converting the original objectives to differentiable equivalents. In this way we benefit from faster convergence. The bilinear framework is compatible with a large family of regularizers, and we demonstrate the benefits of our approach on real datasets for rigid and non-rigid structure from motion. The qualitative difference in reconstructions show that many popular non-convex objectives enjoy an advantage in transitioning to the proposed framework",

This paper targets to address this challenge by studying a novel intra-inter camera similarity for pseudo-label generation. We decompose the sample similarity computation into two stage, i.e., the intra-camera and inter-camera computations, respectively. The intra-camera computation directly leverages the CNN features for similarity computation within each camera. Pseudo-labels generated on different cameras train the re-id model in a multi-branch network. The second stage considers the classification scores of each sample on different cameras as a new feature vector. This new feature effectively alleviates the distribution discrepancy among cameras and generates more reliable pseudo-labels. We hence train our re-id model in two stages with intra-camera and inter-camera pseudo-labels, respectively. This simple intra-inter camera similarity produces surprisingly good performance on multiple datasets, e.g., achieves rank-1 accuracy of 89.5% on the Market1501 dataset, outperforming the recent unsupervised works by 9+%, and is comparable with the latest transfer learning works that leverage extra annotations",

Methods incorporating network expansion have shown promise by naturally adding model capacity for learning new tasks while simultaneously avoiding catastrophic forgetting.

Instead, we propose a simple task-specific feature map transformation strategy for continual learning, which we call Efficient Feature Transformations (EFTs). These EFTs provide powerful flexibility for learning new tasks, achieved with minimal parameters added to the base architecture. We further propose a feature distance maximization strategy, which significantly improves task prediction in class incremental settings, without needing expensive generative models. We demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of our method with an extensive set of experiments in discriminative (CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K) and generative (LSUN, CUB-200, Cats) sequences of tasks.

Inspired by this task, we introduce asymmetric metric learning, a novel paradigm of using asymmetric representations at training. This acts as a simple combination of knowledge transfer with the original metric learning task. We systematically evaluate different teacher and student models, metric learning and knowledge transfer loss functions on the new asymmetric testing as well as the standard symmetric testing task, where database and queries are represented by the same model. We find that plain regression is surprisingly effective compared to more complex knowledge transfer mechanisms, working best in asymmetric testing. Interestingly, our asymmetric metric learning approach works best in symmetric testing, allowing the student to even outperform the teacher.

Though recent works have reached sound achievements, there are still unignorable problems: a) learned features supervised by softmax loss are separable but not discriminative enough, since softmax loss does not explicitly encourage intra-class compactness and interclass separability; and b) fixed filter banks and hand-crafted features are insufficient to capture forgery patterns of frequency from diverse inputs. To compensate for such limitations, a novel frequency-aware discriminative feature learning framework is proposed in this paper. Specifically, we design a novel single-center loss (SCL) that only compresses intra-class variations of natural faces while boosting interclass differences in the embedding space. In such a case, the network can learn more discriminative features with less optimization difficulty. Besides, an adaptive frequency feature generation module is developed to mine frequency clues in a completely data-driven fashion. With the above two modules, the whole framework can learn more discriminative features in an end-to-end manner.

However, reconstructing a 3D caricature from a 2D caricature image remains a challenging task, mostly due to the lack of data. We propose to fill this gap by introducing 3DCaricShop, the first large-scale 3D caricature dataset that contains 2000 high-quality diversified 3D caricatures manually crafted by professional artists. 3DCaricShop also provides rich annotations including a paired 2D caricature image, camera parameters, and 3D facial landmarks. To demonstrate the advantage of 3DCaricShop, we present a novel baseline approach for single-view 3D caricature reconstruction. To ensure a faithful reconstruction with plausible face deformations, we propose to connect the good ends of the detail-rich implicit functions and the parametric mesh representations. In particular, we first register a template mesh to the output of the implicit generator and iteratively project the registration result onto a pre-trained PCA space to resolve artifacts and self-intersections. To deal with the large deformation during non-rigid registration, we propose a novel view-collaborative graph convolution network (VC-GCN) to extract key points from the implicit mesh for accurate alignment. Our method is able to generate high-fidelity 3D caricature in a pre-defined mesh topology that is animation-ready.

In this work, by intensive diagnosis experiments, we quantify the impact introduced by each sub-task and found the `localization error' is the vital factor in restricting monocular 3D detection. Besides, we also investigate the underlying reasons behind localization errors, analyze the issues they might bring, and propose three strategies. First, we revisit the misalignment between the center of the 2D bounding box and the projected center of the 3D object, which is a vital factor leading to low localization accuracy. Second, we observe that accurately localizing distant objects with existing technologies is almost impossible, while those samples will mislead the learned network. To this end, we propose to remove such samples from the training set for improving the overall performance of the detector. Lastly, we also propose a novel 3D IoU oriented loss for the size estimation of the object, which is not affected by `localization error'.

    "abstract": "Deep clustering gradually becomes an important branch in unsupervised learning methods. However, current approaches hardly take into consideration the semantic sample relationships that existed in both local and global features. In addition, since the deep features are updated on-the-fly, relying on these sample relationships may construct more semantically confident sample pairs, leading to inferior performance. To tackle this issue, we propose a method called Nearest Neighbor Matching (NNM) to match samples with their nearest neighbors from both local (batch) and global (overall) levels. Specifically, for the local level, we match the nearest neighbors based on batch embedded features, as for the global one, we match neighbors from overall embedded features. To keep the clustering assignment consistent in both neighbors and classes, we frame consistent loss and class contrastive loss for both local and global levels.

While improved OOD detection methods have emerged, they often rely on the final layer outputs and require a full feedforward pass for any given input. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, multi-level out-of-distribution detection MOOD, which exploits intermediate classifier outputs for dynamic and efficient OOD inference. We explore and establish a direct relationship between the OOD data complexity and optimal exit level, and show that easy OOD examples can be effectively detected early without propagating to deeper layers. At each exit, the OOD examples can be distinguished through our proposed adjusted energy score, which is both empirically and theoretically suitable for networks with multiple classifiers. We extensively evaluate MOOD across 10 OOD datasets spanning a wide range of complexities. Experiments demonstrate that MOOD achieves up to 71.05% computational reduction in inference, while maintaining competitive OOD detection performance",

    "abstract": "Recently proposed decoupled training methods emerge as a dominant paradigm for long-tailed object detection. But they require an extra fine-tuning stage, and the disjointed optimization of representation and classifier might lead to suboptimal results. However, end-to-end training methods, like equalization loss (EQL), still perform worse than decoupled training methods. In this paper, we reveal the main issue in long-tailed object detection is the imbalanced gradients between positives and negatives, and find that EQL does not solve it well. To address the problem of imbalanced gradients, we introduce a new version of equalization loss, called equalization loss v2 (EQL v2), a novel gradient guided reweighing mechanism that re-balances the training process for each category independently and equally. Extensive experiments are performed on the challenging LVIS benchmark. EQL v2 outperforms origin EQL by about 4 points overall AP with 14 - 18 points improvements on the rare categories. More importantly, it also surpasses decoupled training methods. Without further tuning for the Open Images dataset, EQL v2 improves EQL by 7.3 points AP, showing strong generalization ability.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a new fundamental characteristics, i.e., the dynamic range, from real-world metric tools to deep visual recognition. In metrology, the dynamic range is a basic quality of a metric tool, indicating its flexibility to accommodate various scales. Larger dynamic range offers higher flexibility. We argue that such flexibility is also important for deep metric learning, because different visual concepts indeed correspond to different semantic scales. Introducing the dynamic range to deep metric learning, we get a novel computer vision task, i.e., the Dynamic Metric Learning. Dynamic Metric Learning aims to learn a scalable metric space to accommodate visual concepts across multiple semantic scales. Based on three different types of images, i.e., vehicle, animal and online products, we construct three datasets for Dynamic Metric Learning. We benchmark these datasets with popular deep metric learning methods and find Dynamic Metric Learning to be very challenging. The major difficulty lies in a conflict between different scales: the discriminative ability under a small scale usually compromises the discriminative ability under a large one, and vice versa. As a minor contribution, we propose Cross-Scale Learning (CSL) to alleviate such conflict. We show that CSL consistently improves the baseline on all the three datasets",

We model elements in feature maps as the nodes of an undirected graph. A pooling aggregator and a weighted aggregator are proposed to learn primitive representations, which are transformed into high-level visual text representations by graph convolutional networks. A Primitive REpresentation learning Network (PREN) is constructed to use the visual text representations for parallel decoding. Furthermore, by integrating visual text representations into an encoder-decoder model with the 2D attention mechanism, we propose a framework called PREN2D to alleviate the misalignment problem in attention-based methods.

    "title": "On the Difficulty of Membership Inference Attacks",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recent studies propose membership inference (MI) attacks on deep models, where the goal is to infer if a sample has been used in the training process. Despite their apparent success, these studies only report accuracy, precision, and recall of the positive class (member class). Hence, the performance of these attacks have not been clearly reported on negative class (non-member class). In this paper, we show that the way the MI attack performance has been reported is often misleading because they suffer from high false positive rate or false alarm rate (FAR) that has not been reported. FAR shows how often the attack model mislabel non-training samples (non-member) as training (member) ones. The high FAR makes MI attacks fundamentally impractical, which is particularly more significant for tasks such as membership inference where the majority of samples in reality belong to the negative (non-training) class. Moreover, we show that the current MI attack models can only identify the membership of misclassified samples with mediocre accuracy at best, which only constitute a very small portion of training samples. We analyze several new features that have not been comprehensively explored for membership inference before, including distance to the decision boundary and gradient norms, and conclude that deep models' responses are mostly similar among train and non-train samples. We conduct several experiments on image classification tasks, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, using various model architecture, including LeNet, AlexNet, ResNet, etc. We show that the current state-of-the-art MI attacks cannot achieve high accuracy and low FAR at the same time, even when the attacker is given several advantages.

State-of-the-art methods typically encode the SDF with a large, fixed-size neural network to approximate complex shapes with implicit surfaces.

We introduce an efficient neural representation that, for the first time, enables real-time rendering of high-fidelity neural SDFs, while achieving state-of-the-art geometry reconstruction quality. We represent implicit surfaces using an octree-based feature volume which adaptively fits shapes with multiple discrete levels of detail (LODs), and enables continuous LOD with SDF interpolation. We further develop an efficient algorithm to directly render our novelneural SDF representation in real-time by querying only the necessary LODswith sparse octree traversal. We show that our representation is 2-3 orders of magnitude more efficient in terms of rendering speed compared to previous works. Furthermore, it produces state-of-the-art reconstruction quality for complex shapes under both 3D geometric and 2D image-space metrics",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "To train robust deep neural networks (DNNs), we systematically study several target modification approaches, which include output regularisation, self and non-self label correction (LC). Two key issues are discovered: (1) Self LC is the most appealing as it exploits its own knowledge and requires no extra models. However, how to automatically decide the trust degree of a learner as training goes is not well answered in the literature? (2) Some methods penalise while the others reward low-entropy predictions, prompting us to ask which one is better? To resolve the first issue, taking two well-accepted propositions-deep neural networks learn meaningful patterns before fitting noise (Arpit et al., 2017) and minimum entropy regularisation principle (Grandvalet & Bengio, 2006)-we propose a novel end-to-end method named ProSelfLC, which is designed according to learning time and entropy. Specifically, given a data point, we progressively increase trust in its predicted label distribution versus its annotated one if a model has been trained for enough time and the prediction is of low entropy (high confidence). For the second issue, according to ProSelfLC, we empirically prove that it is better to redefine a meaningful low-entropy status and optimise the learner toward it. This serves as a defence of entropy minimisation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ProSelfLC through extensive experiments in both clean and noisy settings.

To combine the best of both worlds, we propose a modular network, whose architecture is motivated by a geometric analysis of what independent object motions can be recovered from an ego-motion field. It takes two consecutive frames as input and predicts segmentation masks for the background and multiple rigidly moving objects, which are then parameterized by 3D rigid transformations.

The desired MR image and coil sensitivity maps can be obtained by sequentially estimating them with two blocks based on the unrolled network architecture. To demonstrate the performance of Joint-ICNet, we performed experiments with a fastMRI brain dataset for two reduction factors (R = 4 and 8).

Instead of being discarded, these moments are instrumental to the generation process. In this paper we propose Moment Exchange, an implicit data augmentation method that encourages the model to utilize the moment information also for recognition models. Specifically, we replace the moments of the learned features of one training image by those of another, and also interpolate the target labels---forcing the model to extract training signal from the moments in addition to the normalized features. As our approach is fast, operates entirely in feature space, and mixes different signals than prior methods, one can effectively combine it with existing augmentation approaches.

However, current approaches are still based on conventional energy optimization and are developed for static scenes. To enable learning-based approaches to address real-world RSCD problem, we contribute the first dataset, BS-RSCD, which includes both ego-motion and object-motion in dynamic scenes. Real distorted and blurry videos with corresponding ground truth are recorded simultaneously via a beam-splitter-based acquisition system.

Our dataset aims to perform Video Scene Parsing in the Wild (VSPW), which covers a wide range of real-world scenarios and categories. To be specific, our VSPW is featured from the following aspects: 1) Well-trimmed long-temporal clips. Each video contains a complete shot, lasting around 5 seconds on average. 2) Dense annotation. The pixel-level annotations are provided at a high frame rate of 15 f/s. 3) High resolution. Over 96% of the captured videos are with high spatial resolutions from 720P to 4K. We totally annotate 3,337 videos, including 239,934 frames from 124 categories. To the best of our knowledge, our VSPW is the first attempt to tackle the challenging video scene parsing task in the wild by considering diverse scenarios. Based on VSPW, we design a generic Temporal Context Blending (TCB) network, which can effectively harness long-range contextual information from the past frames to help segment the current one. Extensive experiments show that our TCB network improves both the segmentation performance and temporal stability comparing with image-/video-based state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "Predicting all applicable labels for a given image is known as multi-label classification. Compared to the standard multi-class case (where each image has only one label), it is considerably more challenging to annotate training data for multi-label classification. When the number of potential labels is large, human annotators find it difficult to mention all applicable labels for each training image. Furthermore, in some settings detection is intrinsically difficult e.g. finding small object instances in high resolution images. As a result, multi-label training data is often plagued by false negatives. We consider the hardest version of this problem, where annotators provide only one relevant label for each image. As a result, training sets will have only one positive label per image and no confirmed negatives. We explore this special case of learning from missing labels across four different multi-label image classification datasets for both linear classifiers and end-to-end fine-tuned deep networks. We extend existing multi-label losses to this setting and propose novel variants that constrain the number of expected positive labels during training. Surprisingly, we show that in some cases it is possible to approach the performance of fully labeled classifiers despite training with significantly fewer confirmed labels",

However, in many real-world FAR applications, only limited labeled data are available, leading to remarkable deterioration in performance for most existing deep learning-based FAR methods. To address this problem, here we propose a method termed Spatial-Semantic Patch Learning (SSPL). The training of SSPL involves two stages. First, three auxiliary tasks, consisting of a Patch Rotation Task (PRT), a Patch Segmentation Task (PST), and a Patch Classification Task (PCT), are jointly developed to learn the spatial-semantic relationship from large-scale unlabeled facial data. We thus obtain a powerful pre-trained model. In particular, PRT exploits the spatial information of facial images in a self-supervised learning manner. PST and PCT respectively capture the pixel-level and image-level semantic information of facial images based on a facial parsing model. Second, the spatial-semantic knowledge learned from auxiliary tasks is transferred to the FAR task. By doing so, it enables that only a limited number of labeled data are required to fine-tune the pre-trained model. We achieve superior performance compared with state-of-the-art methods, as substantiated by extensive experiments and studies",

    "abstract": "Convolution is one of the basic building blocks of CNN architectures. Despite its common use, standard convolution has two main shortcomings: Content-agnostic and Computation-heavy. Dynamic filters are content-adaptive, while further increasing the computational overhead. Depth-wise convolution is a lightweight variant, but it usually leads to a drop in CNN performance or requires a larger number of channels. In this work, we propose the Decoupled Dynamic Filter (DDF) that can simultaneously tackle both of these shortcomings. Inspired by recent advances in attention, DDF decouples a depth-wise dynamic filter into spatial and channel dynamic filters. This decomposition considerably reduces the number of parameters and limits computational costs to the same level as depth-wise convolution. Meanwhile, we observe a significant boost in performance when replacing standard convolution with DDF in classification networks. ResNet50 / 101 get improved by 1.9% and 1.3% on the top-1 accuracy, while their computational costs are reduced by nearly half. Experiments on the detection and joint upsampling networks also demonstrate the superior performance of the DDF upsampling variant (DDF-Up) in comparison with standard convolution and specialized content-adaptive layers",

The regions correspond to semantically relevant and distinct object parts, that are more easily detected in frames of the driving video. To force decoupling of foreground from background, we model non-object related global motion with an additional affine transformation. To facilitate animation and prevent the leakage of the shape of the driving object, we disentangle shape and pose of objects in the region space. Our model can animate a variety of objects, surpassing previous methods by a large margin on existing benchmarks.

Our approach consists of a Transformer encoder trained to predict a set of target labels given an input set of masked labels, and visual features from a convolutional neural network. A key ingredient of our method is a label mask training objective that uses a ternary encoding scheme to represent the state of the labels as positive, negative, or unknown during training. Our model shows state-of-the-art performance on challenging datasets such as COCO and Visual Genome. Moreover, because our model explicitly represents the label state during training, it is more general by allowing us to produce improved results for images with partial or extra label annotations during inference.

To address this, we develop new datasets and methods that significantly improve human pose estimation with self-contact. First, we create a dataset of 3D Contact Poses (3DCP) containing SMPL-X bodies fit to 3D scans as well as poses from AMASS, which we refine to ensure good contact. Second, we leverage this to create the Mimic-The-Pose (MTP) dataset of images, collected via Amazon Mechanical Turk, containing people mimicking the 3DCP poses with self-contact. Third, we develop a novel HPS optimization method, SMPLify-XMC, that includes contact constraints and uses the known 3DCP body pose during fitting to create near ground-truth poses for MTP images. Fourth, for more image variety, we label a dataset of in-the-wild images with Discrete Self-Contact (DSC) information and use another new optimization method, SMPLify-DC, that exploits discrete contacts during pose optimization. Finally, we use our datasets during SPIN training to learn a new 3D human pose regressor, called TUCH (Towards Understanding Contact in Humans). We show that the new self-contact training data significantly improves 3D human pose estimates on withheld test data and existing datasets like 3DPW. Not only does our method improve results for self-contact poses, but it also improves accuracy for non-contact poses.

In this paper, we instead propose to represent, detect, and track 3D objects as points. Our framework, CenterPoint, first detects centers of objects using a keypoint detector and regresses to other attributes, including 3D size, 3D orientation, and velocity. In a second stage, it refines these estimates using additional point features on the object. In CenterPoint, 3D object tracking simplifies to greedy closest-point matching. The resulting detection and tracking algorithm is simple, efficient, and effective. On the nuScenes and Waymo datasets, CenterPoint surpasses prior methods by a large margin.

Learning to perform spatially distributed tasks is motivated by the frequent availability of only sparse labels across tasks, and the desire for a compact multi-tasking network. To facilitate CompositeTasking, we introduce a novel task conditioning model -- a single encoder-decoder network that performs multiple, spatially varying tasks at once. The proposed network takes an image and a set of pixel-wise dense task requests as inputs, and performs the requested prediction task for each pixel. Moreover, we also learn the composition of tasks that needs to be performed according to some CompositeTasking rules, which includes the decision of where to apply which task. It not only offers us a compact network for multi-tasking, but also allows for task-editing. Another strength of the proposed method is demonstrated by only having to supply sparse supervision per task. The obtained results are on par with our baselines that use dense supervision and a multi-headed multi-tasking design.

However, as neither NAS nor model scaling considers sufficient hardware architecture details, they do not take full advantage of the emerging datacenter (DC) accelerators. In this paper, we search for fast and accurate CNN model families for efficient inference on DC accelerators. We first analyze DC accelerators and find that existing CNNs suffer from insufficient operational intensity, parallelism, and execution efficiency and exhibit FLOPs-latency nonproportionality. These insights let us create a DC-accelerator-optimized search space, with space-to-depth, space-to-batch, hybrid fused convolution structures with vanilla and depthwise convolutions, and block-wise activation functions. We further propose a latency-aware compound scaling (LACS), the first multi-objective compound scaling method optimizing both accuracy and latency. Our LACS discovers that network depth should grow much faster than image size and network width, which is quite different from the observations from previous compound scaling. With the new search space and LACS, our search and scaling on datacenter accelerators results in a new model series named EfficientNet-X. EfficientNet-X is up to more than 2X faster than EfficientNet (a model series with state-of-the-art trade-off on FLOPs and accuracy) on TPUv3 and GPUv100, with comparable accuracy. EfficientNet-X is also up to 7X faster than recent RegNet and ResNeSt on TPUv3 and GPUv100. Source code is at https://github.com/tensorflow/tpu/tree/master/models/official/efficientnet/tpu",

Unfortunately, the former does not exploit structures from tasks and the latter does not seem to well-utilize overall data distribution. Here, we propose task-aware variational adversarial AL (TA-VAAL) that modifies task-agnostic VAAL, that considered data distribution of both label and unlabeled pools, by relaxing task learning loss prediction to ranking loss prediction and by using ranking conditional generative adversarial network to embed normalized ranking loss information on VAAL.

In this paper we show that similar success can be achieved even with losses based on features of a deep CNN with random filters. We use the tool of infinite CNNs to derive an analytical form for perceptual similarity in such CNNs, and prove that the perceptual distance between two images is equivalent to the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) distance between local distributions of small patches in the two images. We use this equivalence to propose a simple metric for comparing two images which directly computes the MMD between local distributions of patches in the two images.

    "abstract": "Object detection is an important computer vision task with plenty of real-world applications; therefore, how to enhance its robustness against adversarial attacks has emerged as a crucial issue. However, most of the previous defense methods focused on the classification task and had few analysis in the context of the object detection task. In this work, to address the issue, we present a novel class-aware robust adversarial training paradigm for the object detection task. For a given image, the proposed approach generates a universal adversarial perturbation to simultaneously attack all the occurred objects in the image through jointly maximizing the respective loss for each object. Meanwhile, instead of normalizing the total loss with the number of objects, the proposed approach decomposes the total loss into class-wise losses and normalizes each class loss using the number of objects for the class. The adversarial training based on the class weighted loss can not only balances the influence of each class but also effectively and evenly improves the adversarial robustness of trained models for all the object classes as compared with the previous defense methods. Furthermore, with the recent development of fast adversarial training, we provide a fast version of the proposed algorithm which can be trained faster than the traditional adversarial training while keeping comparable performance. With extensive experiments on the challenging PASCAL-VOC and MS-COCO datasets, the evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed defense methods can effectively enhance the robustness of the object detection models",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Nested networks or slimmable networks are neural networks whose architectures can be adjusted instantly during testing time, e.g., based on computational constraints. Recent studies have focused on a \"nested dropout\" layer, which is able to order the nodes of a layer by importance during training, thus generating a nested set of sub-networks that are optimal for different configurations of resources. However, the dropout rate is fixed as a hyper-parameter over different layers during the whole training process. Therefore, when nodes are removed, the performance decays in a human-specified trajectory rather than in a trajectory learned from data. Another drawback is the generated sub-networks are deterministic networks without well-calibrated uncertainty. To address these two problems, we develop a Bayesian approach to nested neural networks. We propose a variational ordering unit that draws samples for nested dropout at a low cost, from a proposed Downhill distribution, which provides useful gradients to the parameters of nested dropout. Based on this approach, we design a Bayesian nested neural network that learns the order knowledge of the node distributions. In experiments, we show that the proposed approach outperforms the nested network in terms of accuracy, calibration, and out-of-domain detection in classification tasks. It also outperforms the related approach on uncertainty-critical tasks in computer vision",

    "abstract": "Convolutional neural network (CNN) has achieved unprecedented success in image super-resolution tasks in recent years. However, the network's performance depends on the distribution of the training sets and degrades on out-of-distribution samples. This paper adopts a Bayesian approach for estimating uncertainty associated with output and applies it in a deep image super-resolution model to address the concern mentioned above. We use the uncertainty estimation technique using the batch-normalization layer, where stochasticity of the batch mean and variance generate Monte-Carlo (MC) samples. The MC samples, which are nothing but different super-resolved images using different stochastic parameters, reconstruct the image, and provide a confidence or uncertainty map of the reconstruction. We propose a faster approach for MC sample generation, and it allows the variable image size during testing. Therefore, it will be useful for image reconstruction domain. Our experimental findings show that this uncertainty map strongly relates to the quality of reconstruction generated by the deep CNN model and explains its limitation. Furthermore, this paper proposes an approach to reduce the model's uncertainty for an input image, and it helps to defend the adversarial attacks on the image super-resolution model. The proposed uncertainty reduction technique also improves the performance of the model for out-of-distribution test images. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose an adversarial defense mechanism in any image reconstruction domain",

In particular, our dataset caters more diverse and complex interactions in dense urban scenarios compared to the existing datasets. To address the challenges in predicting future trajectories with dense interactions, we develop a joint inference model that learns an expressive multi-modal shared latent space across agents in the urban scene.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Multi-Source Domain Adaptation (MSDA), which dedicates to transfer the knowledge learned from multiple source domains to an unlabeled target domain, has drawn increasing attention in the research community. By assuming that the source and target domains share consistent key feature representations and identical label space, existing studies on MSDA typically utilize the entire union set of features from both the source and target domains to obtain the feature map and align the map for each category and domain. However, the default setting of MSDA may neglect the issue of \"partialness\", i.e., 1) a part of the features contained in the union set of multiple source domains may not present in the target domain; 2) the label space of the target domain may not completely overlap with the multiple source domains. In this paper, we unify the above two cases to a more generalized MSDA task as Multi-Source Partial Domain Adaptation (MSPDA). We propose a novel model termed Partial Feature Selection and Alignment (PFSA) to jointly cope with both MSDA and MSPDA tasks. Specifically, we firstly employ a feature selection vector based on the correlation among the features of multiple sources and target domains. We then design three effective feature alignment losses to jointly align the selected features by preserving the domain information of the data sample clusters in the same category and the discrimination between different classes. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets for both MSDA and MSPDA tasks demonstrate that our proposed PFSA approach remarkably outperforms the state-of-the-art MSDA and unimodal PDA methods",

    "abstract": "Fast and accurate reconstruction of magnetic resonance (MR) images from under-sampled data is important in many clinical applications. In recent years, deep learning-based methods have been shown to produce superior performance on MR image reconstruction. However, these methods require large amounts of data which is difficult to collect and share due to the high cost of acquisition and medical data privacy regulations. In order to overcome this challenge, we propose a federated learning (FL) based solution in which we take advantage of the MR data available at different institutions while preserving patients' privacy. However, the generalizability of models trained with the FL setting can still be suboptimal due to domain shift, which results from the data collected at multiple institutions with different sensors, disease types, and acquisition protocols, etc. With the motivation of circumventing this challenge, we propose a cross-site modeling for MR image reconstruction in which the learned intermediate latent features among different source sites are aligned with the distribution of the latent features at the target site. Extensive experiments are conducted to provide various insights about FL for MR image reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework is a promising direction to utilize multi-institutional data without compromising patients' privacy for achieving improved MR image reconstruction.

However, existing benchmarks have limitations in terms of the amount of captured data, types of data modalities, categories of provided tasks, and diversities of subjects and environments. Here we propose a new benchmark - UAV-Human - for human behavior understanding with UAVs, which contains 67,428 multi-modal video sequences and 119 subjects for action recognition, 22,476 frames for pose estimation, 41,290 frames and 1,144 identities for person re-identification, and 22,263 frames for attribute recognition.

Such a comprehensive and challenging benchmark shall be able to promote the research of UAV-based human behavior understanding, including action recognition, pose estimation, re-identification, and attribute recognition.

To utilize the Huber loss, a parameter that controls the transitions from a quadratic function to an absolute value function needs to be selected. We believe the standard probabilistic interpretation that relates the Huber loss to the Huber density fails to provide adequate intuition for identifying the transition point. As a result, a hyper-parameter search is often necessary to determine an appropriate value. In this work, we propose an alternative probabilistic interpretation of the Huber loss, which relates minimizing the loss to minimizing an upper-bound on the Kullback-Leibler divergence between Laplace distributions, where one distribution represents the noise in the ground-truth and the other represents the noise in the prediction. In addition, we show that the parameters of the Laplace distributions are directly related to the transition point of the Huber loss. We demonstrate, through a toy problem, that the optimal transition point of the Huber loss is closely related to the distribution of the noise in the ground-truth data. As a result, our interpretation provides an intuitive way to identify well-suited hyper-parameters by approximating the amount of noise in the data, which we demonstrate through a case study and experimentation on the Faster R-CNN and RetinaNet object detectors",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recently, with the emergence of retrieval requirements for certain individual in the same superclass, e.g., birds, persons, cars, fine-grained recognition task has attracted a significant amount of attention from academia and industry. In fine-grained recognition scenario, the inter-class differences are quite diverse and subtle, which makes it challenging to extract all the discriminative cues. Traditional training mechanism optimizes the overall discriminativeness of the whole feature. It may stop early when some feature elements has been trained to distinguish training samples well, leaving other elements insufficiently trained for a feature. This would result in a less generalizable feature extractor that only captures major discriminative cues and ignores subtle ones. Therefore, there is a need for a training mechanism that enforces the discriminativeness of all the elements in the feature to capture more the subtle visual cues. In this paper, we propose a Discrimination-Aware Mechanism (DAM) that iteratively identifies insufficiently trained elements and improves them. DAM is able to increase the number of well learned elements, which captures more visual cues by the feature extractor. In this way, a more informative representation is learned, which brings better generalization performance. We show that DAM can be easily applied to both proxy-based and pair-based loss functions, and thus can be used in most existing fine-grained recognition paradigms. Comprehensive experiments on CUB-200-2011, Cars196, Market-1501, and MSMT17 datasets demonstrate the advantages of our DAM based loss over the related state-of-the-art approaches",

We incorporate IMLS surface generation into deep neural networks for inheriting both the flexibility of point sets and the high quality of implicit surfaces. Our IMLSNet predicts an octree structure as a scaffold for generating MLS points where needed and characterizes shape geometry with learned local priors. Furthermore, our implicit function evaluation is independent of the neural network once the MLS points are predicted, thus enabling fast runtime evaluation.

To predict the future precisely, it is required to capture which long-term motion context (e.g., walking or running) the input motion (e.g., leg movement) belongs to. The bottlenecks arising when dealing with the long-term motion context are: (i) how to predict the long-term motion context naturally matching input sequences with limited dynamics, (ii) how to predict the long-term motion context with high-dimensionality (e.g., complex motion). To address the issues, we propose novel motion context-aware video prediction. To solve the bottleneck (i), we introduce a long-term motion context memory (LMC-Memory) with memory alignment learning. The proposed memory alignment learning enables to store long-term motion contexts into the memory and to match them with sequences including limited dynamics. As a result, the long-term context can be recalled from the limited input sequence. In addition, to resolve the bottleneck (ii), we propose memory query decomposition to store local motion context (i.e., low-dimensional dynamics) and recall the suitable local context for each local part of the input individually. It enables to boost the alignment effects of the memory. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other sophisticated RNN-based methods, especially in long-term condition.

    "abstract": "Accurate vertebra localization and identification are required in many clinical applications of spine disorder diagnosis and surgery planning. However, significant challenges are posed in this task by highly varying pathologies (such as vertebral compression fracture, scoliosis, and vertebral fixation) and imaging conditions (such as limited field of view and metal streak artifacts). This paper proposes a robust and accurate method that effectively exploits the anatomical knowledge of the spine to facilitate vertebra localization and identification. A key point localization model is trained to produce activation maps of vertebra centers. They are then re-sampled along the spine centerline to produce spine-rectified activation maps, which are further aggregated into 1-D activation signals. Following this, an anatomically-constrained optimization module is introduced to jointly search for the optimal vertebra centers under a soft constraint that regulates the distance between vertebrae and a hard constraint on the consecutive vertebra indices. When being evaluated on a major public benchmark of 302 highly pathological CT images, the proposed method reports the state of the art identification (id.) rate of 97.4%, and outperforms the best competing method of 94.7% id. rate by reducing the relative id. error rate by half",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "This paper tackles video prediction from a new dimension of predicting spacetime-varying motions that are incessantly changing across both space and time. Prior methods mainly capture the temporal state transitions but overlook the complex spatiotemporal variations of the motion itself, making them difficult to adapt to ever-changing motions. We observe that physical world motions can be decomposed into transient variation and motion trend, while the latter can be regarded as the accumulation of previous motions. Thus, simultaneously capturing the transient variation and the motion trend is the key to make spacetime-varying motions more predictable. Based on these observations, we propose the MotionRNN framework, which can capture the complex variations within motions and adapt to spacetime-varying scenarios. MotionRNN has two main contributions. The first is that we design the MotionGRU unit, which can model the transient variation and motion trend in a unified way. The second is that we apply the MotionGRU to RNN-based predictive models and indicate a new flexible video prediction architecture with a Motion Highway that can significantly improve the ability to predict changeable motions and avoid motion vanishing for stacked multiple-layer predictive models. With high flexibility, this framework can adapt to a series of models for deterministic spatiotemporal prediction. Our MotionRNN can yield significant improvements on three challenging benchmarks for video prediction with spacetime-varying motions",

Existing solutions are mainly driven by small datasets, with low resolution and very few class labels (e.g., CIFAR). As a result, OOD detection for large-scale image classification tasks remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we bridge this critical gap by proposing a group-based OOD detection framework, along with a novel OOD scoring function termed MOS. Our key idea is to decompose the large semantic space into smaller groups with similar concepts, which allows simplifying the decision boundaries between in- vs. out-of-distribution data for effective OOD detection. Our method scales substantially better for high-dimensional class space than previous approaches. We evaluate models trained on ImageNet against four carefully curated OOD datasets, spanning diverse semantics.

Spatially, PAM selectively performs memory update and match on dynamic pixels while ignoring the static ones, significantly reducing redundant computations wasted on segmentation-irrelevant pixels. To promote efficient reference encoding, light-aggregation encoder is also introduced in SwiftNet deploying reversed sub-pixel.

    "abstract": "Generalized zero-shot learning (GZSL) aims to recognize objects from both seen and unseen classes, when only the labeled examples from seen classes are provided. Recent feature generation methods learn a generative model that can synthesize the missing visual features of unseen classes to mitigate the data-imbalance problem in GZSL. However, the original visual feature space is suboptimal for GZSL classification since it lacks discriminative information. To tackle this issue, we propose to integrate the generation model with the embedding model, yielding a hybrid GZSL framework. The hybrid GZSL approach maps both the real and the synthetic samples produced by the generation model into an embedding space, where we perform the final GZSL classification. Specifically, we propose a contrastive embedding (CE) for our hybrid GZSL framework. The proposed contrastive embedding can leverage not only the class-wise supervision but also the instance-wise supervision, where the latter is usually neglected by existing GZSL researches. We evaluate our proposed hybrid GZSL framework with contrastive embedding, named CE-GZSL, on five benchmark datasets.

We show that indeed different rules are solved by different resolutions and a combined multi-scale approach outperforms the existing state of the art in this task on all benchmarks by 5-54%. The success of our method is shown to arise from multiple novelties. First, it searches for relational patterns in multiple resolutions, which allows it to readily detect visual relations, such as location, in higher resolution, while allowing the lower resolution module to focus on semantic relations, such as shape type. Second, we optimize the reasoning network of each resolution proportionally to its performance, hereby we motivate each resolution to specialize on the rules for which it performs better than the others and ignore cases that are already solved by the other resolutions. Third, we propose a new way to pool information along the rows and the columns of the illustration-grid of the query. Our work also analyses the existing benchmarks, demonstrating that the RAVEN dataset selects the negative examples in a way that is easily exploited.

Active domain adaptation (ADA) mitigates the gap under minimal annotation cost by selecting a small quota of target samples to annotate and incorporating them into training. Due to the domain shift, the query selection criteria of prior active learning methods may be ineffective to select the most informative target samples for annotation. In this paper, we propose Transferable Query Selection (TQS), which selects the most informative samples under domain shift by an ensemble of three new criteria: transferable committee, transferable uncertainty, and transferable domainness. We further develop a randomized selection algorithm to enhance the diversity of the selected samples. Experiments show that TQS remarkably outperforms previous UDA and ADA methods on several domain adaptation datasets.

Therefore, we construct effective contrastive pairs for learning better illuminant-dependent features via a novel raw-domain color augmentation.

As a more threatening type for practical deep learning systems, physical adversarial examples have received extensive research attention in recent years. However, without exploiting the intrinsic characteristics such as model-agnostic and human-specific patterns, existing works generate weak adversarial perturbations in the physical world, which fall short of attacking across different models and show visually suspicious appearance. Motivated by the viewpoint that attention reflects the intrinsic characteristics of the recognition process, this paper proposes the Dual Attention Suppression (DAS) attack to generate visually-natural physical adversarial camouflage with strong transferability by suppressing both model and human attention. As for attacking, we generate transferable adversarial camouflages by distracting the model-shared similar attention patterns from the target to non-target regions. Meanwhile, based on the fact that human visual attention always focuses on salient items (e.g., suspicious distortions), we evade the human-specific bottom-up attention to generate visually-natural camouflage which is correlated to the scenario context. We conduct extensive experiments in both the digital and physical world for classification and detection tasks on up to date models (e.g., Yolo-V5) and significantly demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods",

In this paper, we propose a new approach to train on both uniform and re-balanced samplings in a collaborative way, resulting in performance improvement on both head and tail classes.

We further define a new cross-branch loss to enforce the consistency when the same input image goes through the two branches. We conduct extensive experiments on VOC-LT and COCO-LT datasets.

Recently, data-free quantization has been widely studied as a practical and promising solution. It synthesizes data for calibrating the quantized model according to the batch normalization (BN) statistics of FP32 ones and significantly relieves the heavy dependency on real training data in traditional quantization methods. Unfortunately, we find that in practice, the synthetic data identically constrained by BN statistics suffers serious homogenization at both distribution level and sample level and further causes a significant performance drop of the quantized model. We propose Diverse Sample Generation (DSG) scheme to mitigate the adverse effects caused by homogenization. Specifically, we slack the alignment of feature statistics in the BN layer to relax the constraint at the distribution level and design a layerwise enhancement to reinforce specific layers for different data samples. Our DSG scheme is versatile and even able to be applied to the state-of-the-art post-training quantization method like AdaRound. We evaluate the DSG scheme on the large-scale image classification task and consistently obtain significant improvements over various network architectures and quantization methods, especially when quantized to lower bits (e.g., up to 22% improvement on W4A4). Moreover, benefiting from the enhanced diversity, models calibrated by synthetic data perform close to those calibrated by real data and even outperform them on W4A4",

In this paper, we present a new system for solving the second sub-problem. Central to our approach is a new geometric representation: the zone graph. Zones are the set of solid regions formed by extending all B-Rep faces and partitioning space with them; a zone graph has these zones as its nodes, with edges denoting geometric adjacencies between them. Zone graphs allow us to tractably work with industry-standard CAD operations, unlike prior work using CSG with parametric primitives. We focus on CAD programs consisting of sketch + extrude + Boolean operations, which are common in CAD practice. We phrase our problem as search in the space of such extrusions permitted by the zone graph, and we train a graph neural network to score potential extrusions in order to accelerate the search.

    "abstract": "A rich set of interpretable dimensions has been shown to emerge in the latent space of the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) trained for synthesizing images. In order to identify such latent dimensions for image editing, previous methods typically annotate a collection of synthesized samples and train linear classifiers in the latent space. However, they require a clear definition of the target attribute as well as the corresponding manual annotations, limiting their applications in practice. In this work, we examine the internal representation learned by GANs to reveal the underlying variation factors in an unsupervised manner. In particular, we take a closer look into the generation mechanism of GANs and further propose a closed-form factorization algorithm for latent semantic discovery by directly decomposing the pre-trained weights. With a lightning-fast implementation, our approach is capable of not only finding semantically meaningful dimensions comparably to the state-of-the-art supervised methods, but also resulting in far more versatile concepts across multiple GAN models trained on a wide range of datasets",

In contrast, videos of human interactions in unconstrained environments are abundantly available and can be much more easily annotated with frame-level activity labels. In this work, we tackle the previously unexplored problem of weakly-supervised gaze estimation from videos of human interactions. We leverage the insight that strong gaze-related geometric constraints exist when people perform the activity of \"looking at each other\" (LAEO). To acquire viable 3D gaze supervision from LAEO labels, we propose a training algorithm along with several novel loss functions especially designed for the task. With weak supervision from two large scale CMU-Panoptic and AVA-LAEO activity datasets, we show significant improvements in (a) the accuracy of semi-supervised gaze estimation and (b) cross-domain generalization on the state-of-the-art physically unconstrained in-the-wild Gaze360 gaze estimation benchmark.

    "abstract": "Visual Emotion Analysis (VEA) has attracted increasing attention recently with the prevalence of sharing images on social networks. Since human emotions are ambiguous and subjective, it is more reasonable to address VEA in a label distribution learning (LDL) paradigm rather than a single-label classification task. Different from other LDL tasks, there exist intrinsic relationships between emotions and unique characteristics within them, as demonstrated in psychological theories. Inspired by this, we propose a well-grounded circular-structured representation to utilize the prior knowledge for visual emotion distribution learning. To be specific, we first construct an Emotion Circle to unify any emotional state within it. On the proposed Emotion Circle, each emotion distribution is represented with an emotion vector, which is defined with three attributes (i.e., emotion polarity, emotion type, emotion intensity) as well as two properties (i.e., similarity, additivity). Besides, we design a novel Progressive Circular (PC) loss to penalize the dissimilarities between predicted emotion vector and labeled one in a coarse-to-fine manner, which further boosts the learning process in an emotion-specific way. Extensive experiments and comparisons are conducted on public visual emotion distribution datasets, and the results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods",

Therefore, high-quality correspondence matching is critical. It is also desired to be computationally efficient. Besides, existing RefSR methods tend to ignore the potential large disparity in distributions between the LR and Ref images, which hurts the effectiveness of the information utilization. In this paper, we propose the MASA network for RefSR, where two novel modules are designed to address these problems. The proposed Match & Extraction Module significantly reduces the computational cost by a coarse-to-fine correspondence matching scheme. The Spatial Adaptation Module learns the difference of distribution between the LR and Ref images, and remaps the distribution of Ref features to that of LR features in a spatially adaptive way.

Our representations are learned using a contrastive loss, where two augmented clips from the same short video are pulled together in the embedding space, while clips from different videos are pushed away. We study what makes for good data augmentations for video self-supervised learning and find that both spatial and temporal information are crucial. We carefully design data augmentations involving spatial and temporal cues. Concretely, we propose a temporally consistent spatial augmentation method to impose strong spatial augmentations on each frame of the video while maintaining the temporal consistency across frames. We also propose a sampling-based temporal augmentation method to avoid overly enforcing invariance on clips that are distant in time. On Kinetics-600, a linear classifier trained on the representations learned by CVRL achieves 70.4% top-1 accuracy with a 3D-ResNet-50 (R3D-50) backbone, outperforming ImageNet supervised pre-training by 15.7% and SimCLR unsupervised pre-training by 18.8% using the same inflated R3D-50. The performance of CVRL can be further improved to 72.9% with a larger R3D-152 (2x filters) backbone, significantly closing the gap between unsupervised and supervised video representation learning.

In this context, a major challenge becomes to discern meaningful explainers, particularly in a standardized and quantifiable fashion. To this end, we propose herein a set of novel quantitative metrics based on statistics of class separability using pathologically measurable concepts to characterize graph explainers. We employ the proposed metrics to evaluate three types of graph explainers, namely the layer-wise relevance propagation, gradient-based saliency, and graph pruning approaches, to explain Cell-Graph representations for Breast Cancer Subtyping. The proposed metrics are also applicable in other domains by using domain-specific intuitive concepts. We validate the qualitative and quantitative findings on the BRACS dataset, a large cohort of breast cancer RoIs, by expert pathologists. The code and models will be released upon acceptance",

The knowledge evolution (KE) approach splits a deep network into two hypotheses: the fit-hypothesis and the reset-hypothesis. We iteratively evolve the knowledge inside the fit-hypothesis by perturbing the reset-hypothesis for multiple generations. This approach not only boosts performance, but also learns a slim network with a smaller inference cost. KE integrates seamlessly with both vanilla and residual convolutional networks. KE reduces both overfitting and the burden for data collection. We evaluate KE on various network architectures and loss functions. We evaluate KE using relatively small datasets (e.g., CUB-200) and randomly initialized deep networks. KE achieves an absolute 21% improvement margin on a state-of-the-art baseline.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a popular technique to transfer knowledge from a teacher model or ensemble to a student model. Its success is generally attributed to the privileged information on similarities/consistency between the class distributions or intermediate feature representations of the teacher model and the student model. However, directly pushing the student model to mimic the probabilities/features of the teacher model to a large extent limits the student model in learning undiscovered knowledge/features. In this paper, we propose a novel inheritance and exploration knowledge distillation framework (IE-KD), in which a student model is split into two parts -- inheritance and exploration. The inheritance part is learned with a similarity loss to transfer the existing learned knowledge from the teacher model to the student model, while the exploration part is encouraged to learn representations different from the inherited ones with a dis-similarity loss. Our IE-KD framework is generic and can be easily combined with existing distillation or mutual learning methods for training deep neural networks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that these two parts can jointly push the student model to learn more diversified and effective representations, and our IE-KD can be a general technique to improve the student network to achieve SOTA performance. Furthermore, by applying our IE-KD to the training of two networks, the performance of both can be improved w.r.t. deep mutual learning",

However, these methods are vulnerable to images containing noisy backgrounds and heavy occlusions because the extracted image features do not contain enough information to reconstruct high-quality 3D shapes. Humans routinely use incomplete or noisy visual cues from an image to retrieve similar 3D shapes from their memory and reconstruct the 3D shape of an object. Inspired by this, we propose a novel method, named Mem3D, that explicitly constructs shape priors to supplement the missing information in the image. Specifically, the shape priors are in the forms of \"image-voxel\" pairs in the memory network, which is stored by a well-designed writing strategy during training. We also propose a voxel triplet loss function that helps to retrieve the precise 3D shapes that are highly related to the input image from shape priors. The LSTM-based shape encoder is introduced to extract information from the retrieved 3D shapes, which are useful in recovering the 3D shape of an object that is heavily occluded or in complex environments. Experimental results demonstrate that Mem3D significantly improves reconstruction quality and performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods on the ShapeNet and Pix3D datasets",

    "abstract": "3D object detection is vital for many robotics applications. For tasks where a 2D perspective range image exists, we propose to learn a 3D representation directly from this range image view. To this end, we designed a 2D convolutional network architecture that carries the 3D spherical coordinates of each pixel throughout the network. Its layers can consume any arbitrary convolution kernel in place of the default inner product kernel and exploit the underlying local geometry around each pixel. We outline four such kernels: a dense kernel according to the bag-of-words paradigm, and three graph kernels inspired by recent graph neural network advances: the Transformer, the PointNet, and the Edge Convolution. We also explore cross-modality fusion with the camera image, facilitated by operating in the perspective range image view. Our method performs competitively on the Waymo Open Dataset and improves the state-of-the-art AP for pedestrian detection from 69.7% to 75.5%. It is also efficient in that our smallest model, which still outperforms the popular PointPillars in quality, requires 180 times fewer FLOPS and model parameters",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) in semantic segmentation is a fundamental yet promising task relieving the need for laborious annotation works. However, the domain shifts/discrepancies problem in this task compromise the final segmentation performance. Based on our observation, the main causes of the domain shifts are differences in imaging conditions, called image-level domain shifts, and differences in object category configurations called category-level domain shifts. In this paper, we propose a novel UDA pipeline that unifies image-level alignment and category-level feature distribution regularization in a coarse-to-fine manner. Specifically, on the coarse side, we propose a photometric alignment module that aligns an image in the source domain with a reference image from the target domain using a set of image-level operators; on the fine side, we propose a category-oriented triplet loss that imposes a soft constraint to regularize category centers in the source domain and a self-supervised consistency regularization method in the target domain. Experimental results show that our proposed pipeline improves the generalization capability of the final segmentation model and significantly outperforms all previous state-of-the-arts",

In our proposed method, we first pre-train our CNN using a self-supervised learning method to make a cluster assumption on the unlabeled images. Next, inspired by the Wasserstein metric which considers the geometry of the metric space to provide a natural notion of similarity between discrete empirical measures, we leverage it to cluster the unlabeled images and then match the clusters to their similar class of labeled images to provide a pseudo label for the data within each cluster.

In addition, we show that this grid-based technique for density estimation comes with theoretical guarantees. The runtime is linear in the number of points and exponential in dimension, which makes MeanShift++ ideal on low-dimensional applications such as image segmentation and object tracking.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Local processing is an essential feature of CNNs and other neural network architectures -- it is one of the reasons why they work so well on images where relevant information is, to a large extent, local. However, perspective effects stemming from the projection in a conventional camera vary for different global positions in the image. We introduce Perspective Crop Layers (PCLs) -- a form of perspective crop of the region of interest based on the camera geometry -- and show that accounting for the perspective consistently improves the accuracy of state-of-the-art 3D pose reconstruction methods. PCLs are modular neural network layers, which, when inserted into existing CNN and MLP architectures, deterministically remove the location-dependent perspective effects while leaving end-to-end training and the number of parameters of the underlying neural network unchanged. We demonstrate that PCL leads to improved 3D human pose reconstruction accuracy for CNN architectures that use cropping operations, such as spatial transformer networks (STN), and, somewhat surprisingly, MLPs used for 2D-to-3D keypoint lifting. Our conclusion is that it is important to utilize camera calibration information when available, for classical and deep-learning-based computer vision alike. PCL offers an easy way to improve the accuracy of existing 3D reconstruction networks by making them geometry aware. Our code is publicly available at github.com/yu-frank/PerspectiveCropLayers",

    "title": "Partially View-Aligned Representation Learning With Noise-Robust Contrastive Loss",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In real-world applications, it is common that only a portion of data is aligned across views due to spatial, temporal, or spatiotemporal asynchronism, thus leading to the so-called Partially View-aligned Problem (PVP). To solve such a less-touched problem without the help of labels, we propose simultaneously learning representation and aligning data using a noise-robust contrastive loss. In brief, for each sample from one view, our method aims to identify its within-category counterparts from other views, and thus the cross-view correspondence could be established. As the contrastive learning needs data pairs as input, we construct positive pairs using the known correspondences and negative pairs using random sampling. To alleviate or even eliminate the influence of the false negatives caused by random sampling, we propose a noise-robust contrastive loss that could adaptively prevent the false negatives from dominating the network optimization. To the best of our knowledge, this could be the first successful attempt of enabling contrastive learning robust to noisy labels. In fact, this work might remarkably enrich the learning paradigm with noisy labels. More specifically, the traditional noisy labels are defined as incorrect annotations for the supervised tasks such as classification. In contrast, this work proposes that the view correspondence might be false, which is remarkably different from the widely-accepted definition of noisy label. Extensive experiments show the promising performance of our method comparing with 10 state-of-the-art multi-view approaches in the clustering and classification tasks.

We collect a new dataset consisting of 64 people with different expressions and hairstyles to train i3DMM. Our approach has the following favorable properties: (i) It is the first full head morphable model that includes hair. (ii) In contrast to mesh-based models it can be trained on merely rigidly aligned scans, without requiring difficult non-rigid registration. (iii) We design a novel architecture to decouple the shape model into an implicit reference shape and a deformation of this reference shape. With that, dense correspondences between shapes can be learned implicitly. (iv) This architecture allows us to semantically disentangle the geometry and color components, as color is learned in the reference space. Geometry is further disentangled as identity, expressions, and hairstyle, while color is disentangled as identity and hairstyle components.

However, the search cost is high and N times of searches are needed for N different constraints. In this work, we propose a novel search strategy called architecture generator to search sub-networks by generating them, so that the search process can be much more efficient and flexible. With the trained architecture generator, given target hardware constraints as the input, N good architectures can be generated for N constraints by just one forward pass without re-searching and supernet retraining. Moreover, we propose a novel single-path supernet, called unified supernet, to further improve search efficiency and reduce GPU memory consumption of the architecture generator. With the architecture generator and the unified supernet, we propose a flexible and efficient one-shot NAS framework, called Searching by Generating NAS (SGNAS). With the pre-trained supernt, the search time of SGNAS for N different hardware constraints is only 5 GPU hours, which is 4N times faster than previous SOTA single-path methods. After training from scratch, the top1-accuracy of SGNAS on ImageNet is 77.1%, which is comparable with the SOTAs. The code is available at: https://github.com/eric8607242/SGNAS",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Generative adversarial networks (GANs) learn to map noise latent vectors to high-fidelity image outputs. It is found that the input latent space shows semantic correlations with the output image space. Recent works aim to interpret the latent space and discover meaningful directions that correspond to human interpretable image transformations. However, these methods either rely on explicit scores of attributes (e.g., memorability) or are restricted to binary ones (e.g., gender), which largely limits the applicability of editing tasks, especially for free-form artistic tasks like style/anime editing. In this paper, we propose an adversarial method, AdvStyle, for discovering interpretable directions in the absence of well-labeled scores or binary attributes. In particular, the proposed adversarial method simultaneously optimizes the discovered directions and the attribute assessor using the target attribute data as positive samples, while the generated ones being negative. In this way, arbitrary attributes can be edited by collecting positive data only, and the proposed method learns a controllable representation enabling manipulation of non-binary attributes like anime styles and facial characteristics. Moreover, the proposed learning strategy attenuates the entanglement between attributes, such that multiattribute manipulation can be easily achieved without any additional constraint. Furthermore, we reveal several interesting semantics with the involuntarily learned negative directions. Extensive experiments on 9 anime attributes and 7 human attributes demonstrate the effectiveness of our adversarial approach qualitatively and quantitatively.

Thus, benchmarking and advancing digital forgery analysis have become a pressing issue. However, existing face forgery datasets either have limited diversity or only support coarse-grained analysis. To counter this emerging threat, we construct the ForgeryNet dataset, an extremely large face forgery dataset with unified annotations in image- and video-level data across four tasks: 1) Image Forgery Classification, including two-way (real / fake), three-way (real / fake with identity-replaced forgery approaches / fake with identity-remained forgery approaches), and n-way (real and 15 respective forgery approaches) classification. 2) Spatial Forgery Localization, which segments the manipulated area of fake images compared to their corresponding source real images. 3) Video Forgery Classification, which re-defines the video-level forgery classification with manipulated frames in random positions. This task is important because attackers in real world are free to manipulate any target frame. and 4) Temporal Forgery Localization, to localize the temporal segments which are manipulated. ForgeryNet is by far the largest publicly available deep face forgery dataset in terms of data-scale (2.9 million images, 221,247 videos), manipulations (7 image-level approaches, 8 video-level approaches), perturbations (36 independent and more mixed perturbations) and annotations (6.3 million classification labels, 2.9 million manipulated area annotations and 221,247 temporal forgery segment labels). We perform extensive benchmarking and studies of existing face forensics methods and obtain several valuable observations.We hope that the scale, quality, and variety of ForgeryNet dataset will foster further research and innovation in the area of face forgery classification, spatial and temporal forgery localization etc",

This approach is costly, both in terms of acquisition and computational requirements, and potentially unreliable due to noisy point clouds. We propose Blocks-World Cameras, a class of imaging systems which directly recover dominant planes of piece-wise planar scenes (Blocks-World), without requiring point clouds. The Blocks-World Cameras are based on a structured-light system projecting a single pattern with a sparse set of cross-shaped features. We develop a novel geometric algorithm for recovering scene planes without explicit correspondence matching, thereby avoiding computationally intensive search or optimization routines.

    "abstract": "Video snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) captures a sequence of video frames in a single shot using a 2D detector. The underlying principle is that during one exposure time, different masks are imposed on the high-speed scene to form a compressed measurement. With the knowledge of masks, optimization algorithms or deep learning methods are employed to reconstruct the desired high-speed video frames from this snapshot measurement. Unfortunately, though these methods can achieve decent results, the long running time of optimization algorithms or huge training memory occupation of deep networks still preclude them in practical applications. In this paper, we develop a memory-efficient network for large-scale video SCI based on multi-group reversible 3D convolutional neural networks. In addition to the basic model for the grayscale SCI system, we take one step further to combine demosaicing and SCI reconstruction to directly recover color video from Bayer measurements. Extensive results on both simulation and real data captured by SCI cameras demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms previous state-of-the-art with less memory and thus can be used in large-scale problems.

Our approach strives to connect the good ends of both learning-based and optimization-based methods. In particular, unlike the common practice that fixes the pre-trained priors at test time, we propose to further optimize the learned prior and latent code according to the input physical measurements after the training. We show that the proposed strategy effectively breaks the barriers constrained by the pre-trained priors and could lead to high-quality adaptation to unseen data. We realize our framework using the implicit surface representation and validate the efficacy of our approach in a variety of challenging tasks that take highly sparse or collapsed observations as input.

    "abstract": "Reasoning the human-object interactions (HOI) is essential for deeper scene understanding, while object affordances (or functionalities) are of great importance for human to discover unseen HOIs with novel objects. Inspired by this, we introduce an affordance transfer learning approach to jointly detect HOIs with novel object and recognize affordances. Specifically, HOI representations can be decoupled into a combination of affordance and object representations, making it possible to compose novel interactions by combining affordance representations and novel object representations from additional images, i.e. transferring the affordance to novel objects. With the proposed affordance transfer learning, the model is also capable of inferring the affordances of novel objects from known affordance representations. The proposed method can thus be used to 1) improve the performance of HOI detection, especially for the HOIs with unseen objects; and 2) infer the affordances of novel objects. Experimental results on two datasets, HICO-DET and HOI-COCO (from V-COCO), demonstrate significant improvements over recent state-of-the-art methods for HOI detection and object affordance detection.

This paper investigates whether we can estimate the object poses effectively when only RGB images and 2D object annotations are given. To this end, we present a two-step pose estimation framework to attain 6DoF object poses from 2D object bounding-boxes. In the first step, the framework learns to segment objects from real and synthetic data in a weakly-supervised fashion, and the segmentation masks will act as a prior for pose estimation. In the second step, we design a dual-scale pose estimation network, namely DSC-PoseNet, to predict object poses by employing a differential renderer. To be specific, our DSC-PoseNet firstly predicts object poses in the original image scale by comparing the segmentation masks and the rendered visible object masks. Then, we resize object regions to a fixed scale to estimate poses once again. In this fashion, we eliminate large scale variations and focus on rotation estimation, thus facilitating pose estimation. Moreover, we exploit the initial pose estimation to generate pseudo ground-truth to train our DSC-PoseNet in a self-supervised manner. The estimation results in these two scales are ensembled as our final pose estimation. Extensive experiments on widely-used benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models trained on synthetic data by a large margin and even is on par with several fully-supervised methods",

Inspired by the strong searching capability of neural architecture search (NAS) in CNN, this paper proposes Graph Neural Architecture Search (GNAS) with novel-designed search space. The GNAS can automatically learn better architecture with the optimal depth of message passing on the graph. Specifically, we design Graph Neural Architecture Paradigm (GAP) with tree-topology computation procedure and two types of fine-grained atomic operations (feature filtering & neighbor aggregation) from message-passing mechanism to construct powerful graph network search space. Feature filtering performs adaptive feature selection, and neighbor aggregation captures structural information and calculates neighbors' statistics. Experiments show that our GNAS can search for better GNNs with multiple message-passing mechanisms and optimal message-passing depth.

    "abstract": "Referring image segmentation aims to segment the objects referred by a natural language expression. Previous methods usually focus on designing an implicit and recurrent feature interaction mechanism to fuse the visual-linguistic features to directly generate the final segmentation mask without explicitly modeling the localization of the referent guided by language expression and designing a powerful segmentation module. To tackle these problems, we view this task from another perspective by decoupling it into a \"locate-then-segment\" (LTS) scheme. Given a language expression, people generally first perform attention to the corresponding target image regions, then generate a segmentation mask about the object based on its context. The LTS first extracts and fuses both visual and textual features to get a cross-modal representation, then applies a cross-model interaction on the visual-textual features to locate the referred object with position prior, and finally generates the segmentation result with a light-weight network. Our LTS is simple but surprisingly effective. On three popular benchmark datasets, the LTS outperforms all the previous state-of-the-arts methods by a large margin (e.g., +3.2% on RefCOCO+ and +3.4% on RefCOCOg). In addition, our model is more interpretable with explicitly locating the object, which is also proved by visualization experiments. Accordingly, this framework is very promising to serve as a pipeline for referring image segmentation",

    "abstract": "In many real-world problems, collecting a large number of labeled samples is infeasible. Few-shot learning (FSL) is the dominant approach to address this issue, where the objective is to quickly adapt to novel categories in presence of a limited number of samples. FSL tasks have been predominantly solved by leveraging the ideas from gradient-based meta-learning and metric learning approaches. However, recent works have demonstrated the significance of powerful feature representations with a simple embedding network that can outperform existing sophisticated FSL algorithms. In this work, we build on this insight and propose a novel training mechanism that simultaneously enforces equivariance and invariance to a general set of geometric transformations. Equivariance or invariance has been employed standalone in the previous works; however, to the best of our knowledge, they have not been used jointly. Simultaneous optimization for both of these contrasting objectives allows the model to jointly learn features that are not only independent of the input transformation but also the features that encode the structure of geometric transformations. These complementary sets of features help generalize well to novel classes with only a few data samples. We achieve additional improvements by incorporating a novel self-supervised distillation objective. Our extensive experimentation shows that even without knowledge distillation our proposed method can outperform current state-of-the-art FSL methods on five popular benchmark datasets",

Our pSp framework is based on a novel encoder network that directly generates a series of style vectors which are fed into a pretrained StyleGAN generator, forming the extended W+ latent space. We first show that our encoder can directly embed real images into W+, with no additional optimization. Next, we propose utilizing our encoder to directly solve image-to-image translation tasks, defining them as encoding problems from some input domain into the latent domain. By deviating from the standard invert first, edit later methodology used with previous StyleGAN encoders, our approach can handle a variety of tasks even when the input image is not represented in the StyleGAN domain. We show that solving translation tasks through StyleGAN significantly simplifies the training process, as no adversary is required, has better support for solving tasks without pixel-to-pixel correspondence, and inherently supports multi-modal synthesis via the resampling of styles. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of our framework on a variety of facial image-to-image translation tasks, even when compared to state-of-the-art solutions designed specifically for a single task, and further show that it can be extended beyond the human facial domain.

However, there are few methods trying to tackle this task, and how to connect localization and description remains an open problem. In this paper, we demonstrate that under weak supervision, the event captioning module and localization module should be more closely bridged in order to improve description performance. Different from previous approaches, in our method, the event captioner generates a sentence from a video segment and feeds it to the sentence localizer to reconstruct the segment, and the localizer produces word importance weights as a guidance for the captioner to improve event description. To further bridge the sentence localizer and event captioner, a concept learner is adopted as the basis of the sentence localizer, which can be utilized to construct an induced set of concept features to enhance video features and improve the event captioner.

This adaptivity to unseen classes is especially important for many practical applications where the pre-trained label space cannot remain fixed for effective use and the model needs to be \"specialized\" to support new categories on the fly. One particularly interesting scenario, essentially overlooked by the few-shot literature, is Coarse-to-Fine Few-Shot (C2FS), where the training classes (e.g. animals) are of much `coarser granularity' than the target (test) classes (e.g. breeds). A very practical example of C2FS is when the target classes are sub-classes of the training classes. Intuitively, it is especially challenging as (both regular and few-shot) supervised pre-training tends to learn to ignore intra-class variability which is essential for separating sub-classes. In this paper, we introduce a novel 'Angular normalization' module that allows to effectively combine supervised and self-supervised contrastive pre-training to approach the proposed C2FS task, demonstrating significant gains in a broad study over multiple baselines and datasets.

Our key idea is to introduce a polarimetric cost volume of distance defined on the polarimetric observations and the polarization state computed from the surface normal. We adapt a belief propagation algorithm to filter this cost volume. The filtering algorithm simultaneously estimates the disparities and surface normals as separate entities, while effectively denoising the original noisy polarimetric observations of a quad-Bayer polarization camera.

However, this technique has not been widely used in clinical diagnosis, as a result of the difficulty of motion tracking encountered with t-MRI images. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning-based fully unsupervised method for in vivo motion tracking on t-MRI images. We first estimate the motion field (INF) between any two consecutive t-MRI frames by a bi-directional generative diffeomorphic registration neural network. Using this result, we then estimate the Lagrangian motion field between the reference frame and any other frame through a differentiable composition layer. By utilizing temporal information to perform reasonable estimations on spatio-temporal motion fields, this novel method provides a useful solution for motion tracking and image registration in dynamic medical imaging. Our method has been validated on a representative clinical t-MRI dataset; the experimental results show that our method is superior to conventional motion tracking methods in terms of landmark tracking accuracy and inference efficiency",

    "abstract": "Recently, language-guided global image editing draws increasing attention with growing application potentials. However, previous GAN-based methods are not only confined to domain-specific, low-resolution data but also lacking in interpretability. To overcome the collective difficulties, we develop a text-to-operation model to map the vague editing language request into a series of editing operations, e.g., change contrast, brightness, and saturation. Each operation is interpretable and differentiable. Furthermore, the only supervision in the task is the target image, which is insufficient for a stable training of sequential decisions. Hence, we propose a novel operation planning algorithm to generate possible editing sequences from the target image as pseudo ground truth.

To this end, we propose Curriculum Graph Co-Teaching (CGCT) that uses a dual classifier head, with one of them being a graph convolutional network (GCN) which aggregates features from similar samples across the domains. To prevent the classifiers from over-fitting on its own noisy pseudo-labels we develop a co-teaching strategy with the dual classifier head that is assisted by curriculum learning to obtain more reliable pseudo-labels. Furthermore, when the domain labels are available, we propose Domain-aware Curriculum Learning (DCL), a sequential adaptation strategy that first adapts on the easier target domains, followed by the harder ones. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed frameworks on several benchmarks and advance the state-of-the-art in the MTDA by large margins (e.g. +5.6% on the DomainNet)",

To bypass this difficulty, we propose an uncalibrated neural inverse rendering approach to this problem. Our method first estimates the light directions from the input images and then optimizes an image reconstruction loss to calculate the surface normals, bidirectional reflectance distribution function value, and depth. Additionally, our formulation explicitly models the concave and convex parts of a complex surface to consider the effects of interreflections in the image formation process.

It thus poses security concerns on the deployment of DNNs in practice, particularly in safety- and security-sensitive domains. To investigate the robustness of DNNs, transfer-based attacks have attracted a growing interest recently due to their high practical applicability, where attackers craft adversarial samples with local models and employ the resultant samples to attack a remote black-box model. However, existing transfer-based attacks frequently suffer from low success rates due to overfitting to the adopted local model. To boost the transferability of adversarial samples, we propose to improve the robustness of synthesized adversarial samples via adversarial transformations. Specifically, we employ an adversarial transformation network to model the most harmful distortions that can destroy adversarial noises and require the synthesized adversarial samples to become resistant to such adversarial transformations.

In this paper, we focus on applying the power of self-supervised methods to improve semi-supervised action proposal generation.

The SSTAP contains two crucial branches, i.e., temporal-aware semi-supervised branch and relation-aware self-supervised branch. The semi-supervised branch improves the proposal model by introducing two temporal perturbations, i.e., temporal feature shift and temporal feature flip, in the mean teacher framework. The self-supervised branch defines two pretext tasks, including masked feature reconstruction and clip-order prediction, to learn the relation of temporal clues. By this means, SSTAP can better explore unlabeled videos, and improve the discriminative abilities of learned action features. We extensively evaluate the proposed SSTAP on THUMOS14 and ActivityNet v1.3 datasets.

Each component is represented by a latent code via a trained encoder. To model the motion, a neural Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) is trained to update the initial state conditioned on the learned motion code, and a decoder takes the shape code and the updated state code to reconstruct the 3D model at each time stamp.

To remedy such issue, this paper aims to propose a new effective method by taking advantage of two intrinsic priors of the hyperspectral images, namely deep image denoising and total variation (TV) priors.

To address these problems, we propose a novel SAI system based on the event camera which can produce asynchronous events with extremely low latency and high dynamic range. Thus, it can eliminate the interference of dense occlusions by measuring with almost continuous views, and simultaneously tackle the over/under exposure problems. To reconstruct the occluded targets, we propose a hybrid encoder-decoder network composed of spiking neural networks (SNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In the hybrid network, the spatio-temporal information of the collected events is first encoded by SNN layers, and then transformed to the visual image of the occluded targets by a style-transfer CNN decoder.

This combination allows NFS to adaptively filter background noises and concentrate on informative parts of human bodies in a data-driven manner. Moreover, a cross-modality contrastive optimization scheme further guides NFS to search features that can minimize modality discrepancy whilst maximizing inter-class distance.

In contrast, Probabilistic NAS, such as PARSEC, learns a distribution over high-performing architectures, and uses only as much memory as needed to train a single model. Nevertheless, it needs to sample many architectures, making it computationally expensive for searching in an extensive space. To solve these problems, we propose a sampling method adaptive to the distribution entropy, drawing more samples to encourage explorations at the beginning, and reducing samples as learning proceeds. Furthermore, to search fast in the multi-variate space, we propose a coarse-to-fine strategy by using a factorized distribution at the beginning which can reduce the number of architecture parameters by over an order of magnitude. We call this method Fast Probabilistic NAS (FP-NAS). Compared with PARSEC, it can sample 64% fewer architectures and search 2.1x faster. Compared with FBNetV2, FP-NAS is 1.9x - 3.5x faster, and the searched models outperform FBNetV2 models on ImageNet. FP-NAS allows us to expand the giant FBNetV2 space to be wider (i.e. larger channel choices) and deeper (i.e. more blocks), while adding Split-Attention block and enabling the search over the number of splits. When searching a model of size 0.4G FLOPS, FP-NAS is 132x faster than EfficientNet, and the searched FP-NAS-L0 model outperforms EfficientNet-B0 by 0.7% accuracy.

However, most previous methods based on the parametric SMPL model underperform in new domains with unexpected, domain-specific attributes, such as camera parameters, lengths of bones, backgrounds, and occlusions. Our general idea is to dynamically fine-tune the source model on test video streams with additional temporal constraints, such that it can mitigate the domain gaps without over-fitting the 2D information of individual test frames. A subsequent challenge is how to avoid conflicts between the 2D and temporal constraints. We propose to tackle this problem using a new training algorithm named Bilevel Online Adaptation (BOA), which divides the optimization process of overall multi-objective into two steps of weight probe and weight update in a training iteration. We demonstrate that BOA leads to state-of-the-art results on two human mesh reconstruction benchmarks",

However, for many applications, sequence information in the form of video frames is also available at test time.

Those that do, either use computationally expensive test-time refinement techniques or off-the-shelf recurrent networks, which only indirectly make use of the geometric information that is inherently available. We propose ManyDepth, an adaptive approach to dense depth estimation that can make use of sequence information at test time, when it is available. Taking inspiration from multi-view stereo, we propose a deep end-to-end cost volume based approach that is trained using self-supervision only. We present a novel consistency loss that encourages the network to ignore the cost volume when it is deemed unreliable, e.g. in the case of moving objects, and an augmentation scheme to cope with static cameras.

Based upon DMBQ, we further propose loss-guided bit-width allocation (LBA) to adaptively quantize and even prune the neural network. The first-order Taylor expansion is applied to build a metric for evaluating the loss sensitivity of the quantization of each channel, and automatically adjust the bit-width of weights and activations channel-wisely.

First, implicit knowledge which can be learned effectively from unsupervised language pretraining and supervised training data with transformer-based models. Second, explicit, symbolic knowledge encoded in knowledge bases. Our approach combines both---exploiting the powerful implicit reasoning of transformer models for answer prediction, and integrating symbolic representations from a knowledge graph, while never losing their explicit semantics to an implicit embedding. We combine diverse sources of knowledge to cover the wide variety of knowledge needed to solve knowledge-based questions. We show our approach, KRISP, significantly outperforms state-of-the-art on OK-VQA, the largest available dataset for open-domain knowledge-based VQA.

It is a challenging problem due to the substantial geometry shift from simulated to real data, such that most existing 3D models underperform due to overfitting the complete geometries in the source domain. We propose to tackle this problem with MetaSets, which meta-learns point cloud representations from a set of classification tasks on carefully-designed transformed point sets containing specific geometry priors. The learned representations are more generalizable to various unseen domains of different geometries. We design two benchmarks for Sim-to-Real transfer of 3D point clouds.

To tackle the one-to-many relationship between input and output domains, previous works use complex training objectives to learn a latent embedding, jointly with the generator, that models the variability of the output domain. In contrast, we directly model the style variability of images, independent of the image synthesis task. Specifically, we pre-train a generic style encoder using a novel proxy task to learn an embedding of images, from arbitrary domains, into a low-dimensional style latent space. The learned latent space introduces several advantages over previous traditional approaches to multi-modal I2I translation. First, it is not dependent on the target dataset, and generalizes well across multiple domains. Second, it learns a more powerful and expressive latent space, which improves the fidelity of style capture and transfer. The proposed style pre-training also simplifies the training objective and speeds up the training significantly. Furthermore, we provide a detailed study of the contribution of different loss terms to the task of multi-modal I2I translation, and propose a simple alternative to VAEs to enable sampling from unconstrained latent spaces. Finally, we achieve state-of-the-art results on six challenging benchmarks with a simple training objective that includes only a GAN loss and a reconstruction loss",

Since semantic knowledge is built on attributes shared between different classes, which are highly local, strong prior for localization of object attribute is beneficial for visual-semantic embedding.

Therefore, we introduce a novel goal-oriented gaze estimation module (GEM) to improve the discriminative attribute localization based on the class-level attributes for ZSL. We aim to predict the actual human gaze location to get the visual attention regions for recognizing a novel object guided by attribute description. Specifically, the task-dependent attention is learned with the goal-oriented GEM, and the global image features are simultaneously optimized with the regression of local attribute features. Experiments on three ZSL benchmarks, i.e., CUB, SUN and AWA2, show the superiority or competitiveness of our proposed method against the state-of-the-art ZSL methods.

In this paper, we streamline the temporal language localization as a novel multi-stage aggregated transformer network. Specifically, we first introduce a new visual-language transformer backbone, which enables iterations and alignments among all elements in visual and language sequences. Different from previous multi-modal transformers, our backbone keeps both structure unified and modality specific. Moreover, we also propose a multi-stage aggregation module topped on the transformer backbone. In this module, we compute three stage-specific representations corresponding to different moment stages respectively, i.e. starting, middle and ending stages, for each video element. Then for a moment candidate, we concatenate the starting/middle/ending representations of its starting/middle/ending elements respectively to form the final moment representation. Because the obtained moment representation captures the stage specific information, it is very discriminative for accurate localization.

The key insight is that adapting model across domains is achieved via adapting model across samples. Thus, it breaks down source domain barriers and turns multi-source domains into a single source domain. This also simplifies the alignment between source and target domains, as it only requires the target domain to be aligned with any part of the union of source domains. Furthermore, we find dynamic transfer can be simply modeled by aggregating residual matrices and a static convolution matrix.

    "abstract": "While deep learning (DL)-based video deraining methods have achieved significant success recently, they still exist two major drawbacks. Firstly, most of them do not sufficiently model the characteristics of rain layers of rainy videos. In fact, the rain layers exhibit strong physical properties (e.g., direction, scale and thickness) in spatial dimension and natural continuities in temporal dimension, and thus can be generally modelled by the spatial-temporal process in statistics. Secondly, current DL-based methods seriously depend on the labeled synthetic training data, whose rain types are always deviated from those in unlabeled real data. Such gap between synthetic and real data sets leads to poor performance when applying them in real scenarios. Against these issues, this paper proposes a new semisupervised video deraining method, in which a dynamic rain generator is employed to fit the rain layer, expecting to better depict its insightful characteristics. Specifically, such dynamic generator consists of one emission model and one transition model to simultaneously encode the spatially physical structure and temporally continuous changes of rain streaks, respectively, which both are parameterized as deep neural networks (DNNs). Further more, different prior formats are designed for the labeled synthetic and unlabeled real data, so as to fully exploit the common knowledge underlying them. Last but not least, we also design a Monte Carlo EM algorithm to solve this model. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the superiorities of the proposed semi-supervised deraining model",

Prior work only showed the possibility of recovering input data given gradients under very restrictive conditions - a single input point, or a network with no non-linearities, or a small 32x32 px input batch. Therefore, averaging gradients over larger batches was thought to be safe. In this work, we introduce GradInversion, using which input images from a larger batch (8 - 48 images) can also be recovered for large networks such as ResNets (50 layers), on complex datasets such as ImageNet (1000 classes, 224x224 px). We formulate an optimization task that converts random noise into natural images, matching gradients while regularizing image fidelity. We also propose an algorithm for target class label recovery given gradients. We further propose a group consistency regularization framework, where multiple agents starting from different random seeds work together to find an enhanced reconstruction of original data batch. We show that gradients encode a surprisingly large amount of information, such that all the individual images can be recovered with high fidelity via GradInversion, even for complex datasets, deep networks, and large batch sizes",

Then, FRN captures the intra-feature and inter-feature relationships for latent features to characterize expression-specific variations, and reconstructs the expression feature. To this end, two modules including an intra-feature relation modeling module and an inter-feature relation modeling module are developed in FRN. Experimental results on both the in-the-lab databases (including CK+, MMI, and Oulu-CASIA) and the in-the-wild databases (including RAF-DB and SFEW) show that the proposed FDRL method consistently achieves higher recognition accuracy than several state-of-the-art methods. This clearly highlights the benefit of feature decomposition and reconstruction for classifying expressions",

    "abstract": "Multi-object tracking from RGB-D video sequences is a challenging problem due to the combination of changing viewpoints, motion, and occlusions over time. We observe that having the complete geometry of objects aids in their tracking, and thus propose to jointly infer the complete geometry of objects as well as track them, for rigidly moving objects over time. Our key insight is that inferring the complete geometry of the objects significantly helps in tracking. By hallucinating unseen regions of objects, we can obtain additional correspondences between the same instance, thus providing robust tracking even under strong change of appearance. From a sequence of RGB-D frames, we detect objects in each frame and learn to predict their complete object geometry as well as a dense correspondence mapping into a canonical space. This allows us to derive 6DoF poses for the objects in each frame, along with their correspondence between frames, providing robust object tracking across the RGB-D sequence. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world RGB-D data demonstrate that we achieve state-of-the-art performance on 3D multi-object tracking. Furthermore, we show that our object completion significantly helps tracking, providing an improvement of 8% in mean MOTA",

Moreover, current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models mostly adopt a fully 3D convolution network for cost regularization and therefore require high computational cost, thus limiting their deployment in real-world applications. Our method achieves temporally coherent depth estimation results by using a novel Epipolar Spatio-Temporal (EST) transformer to explicitly associate geometric and temporal correlation with multiple estimated depth maps. Furthermore, to reduce the computational cost, inspired by recent Mixture-of-Experts models, we design a compact hybrid network consisting of a 2D context-aware network and a 3D matching network which learn 2D context information and 3D disparity cues separately. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves higher accuracy in depth estimation and significant speedup than the SOTA methods",

Specifically, we first use causal analysis to point out that the common localization errors are due to the unobserved confounder that resides ubiquitously in visual recognition. Then, we propose a Temporal Smoothing PCA-based (TS-PCA) deconfounder, which exploits the unlabelled background to model an observed substitute for the unobserved confounder, to remove the confounding effect. Note that the proposed deconfounder is model-agnostic and non-intrusive, and hence can be applied in any WTAL method without model re-designs.

Most existing deep learning methods for this problem are supervised and trained by registered motion pairs. In addition, these methods are often limited to yielding a deterministic output, given a pair of style and content motions. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised approach for motion style transfer by synthesizing stylized motions autoregressively using a generative flow model M. M is trained to maximize the exact likelihood of a collection of unlabeled motions, based on an autoregressive context of poses in previous frames and a control signal representing the movement of a root joint. Thanks to invertible flow transformations, latent codes that encode deep properties of motion styles are efficiently inferred by M. By combining the latent codes (from an input style motion S) with the autoregressive context and control signal (from an input content motion C), M outputs a stylized motion which transfers style from S to C. Moreover, our model is probabilistic and is able to generate various plausible motions with a specific style. We evaluate the proposed model on motion capture datasets containing different human motion styles. Experiment results show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, despite not requiring manually labeled training data",

    "abstract": "Despite considerable similarities between multiple object tracking (MOT) and single object tracking (SOT) tasks, modern MOT methods have not benefited from the development of SOT ones to achieve satisfactory performance. The major reason for this situation is that it is inappropriate and inefficient to apply multiple SOT models directly to the MOT task, although advanced SOT methods are of the strong discriminative power and can run at fast speeds. In this paper, we propose a novel and end-to-end trainable MOT architecture that extends CenterNet by adding an SOT branch for tracking objects in parallel with the existing branch for object detection, allowing the MOT task to benefit from the strong discriminative power of SOT methods in an effective and efficient way. Unlike most existing SOT methods which learn to distinguish the target object from its local backgrounds, the added SOT branch trains a separate SOT model per target online to distinguish the target from its surrounding targets, assigning SOT models the novel discrimination. Moreover, similar to the detection branch, the SOT branch treats objects as points, making its online learning efficient even if multiple targets are processed simultaneously. Without tricks, the proposed tracker achieves MOTAs of 0.710 and 0.686, IDF1s of 0.719 and 0.714, on MOT17 and MOT20 benchmarks, respectively, while running at 16 FPS on MOT17",

However, due to the various appearances of real rain streaks that may be different from those in the synthetic training data, it is challenging to directly extend existing methods to the real-world scenes. To address this issue, we propose a memory-oriented semi-supervised (MOSS) method which enables the network to explore and exploit the properties of rain streaks from both synthetic and real data. The key aspect of our method is designing an encoder-decoder neural network that is augmented with a self-supervised memory module, where items in the memory record the prototypical patterns of rain degradations and are updated in a self-supervised way. Consequently, the rainy styles can be comprehensively derived from synthetic or real-world degraded images without the need for clean labels. Furthermore, we present a self-training mechanism that attempts to transfer deraining knowledge from supervised rain removal to unsupervised cases. An additional target network, which is updated with an exponential moving average of the online deraining network, is utilized to produce pseudo-labels for unlabeled rainy images. Meanwhile, the deraining network is optimized with supervised objectives on both synthetic paired data and pseudo-paired noisy data.

    "abstract": "In the animation industry, cartoon videos are usually produced at low frame rate since hand drawing of such frames is costly and time-consuming. Therefore, it is desirable to develop computational models that can automatically interpolate the in-between animation frames. However, existing video interpolation methods fail to produce satisfying results on animation data. Compared to natural videos, animation videos possess two unique characteristics that make frame interpolation difficult: 1) cartoons comprise lines and smooth color pieces. The smooth areas lack textures and make it difficult to estimate accurate motions on animation videos. 2) cartoons express stories via exaggeration. Some of the motions are non-linear and extremely large. In this work, we formally define and study the animation video interpolation problem for the first time. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose an effective framework, AnimeInterp, with two dedicated modules in a coarse-to-fine manner. Specifically, 1) Segment-Guided Matching resolves the \"lack of textures\" challenge by exploiting global matching among color pieces that are piece-wise coherent. 2) Recurrent Flow Refinement resolves the \"non-linear and extremely large motion\" challenge by recurrent predictions using a transformer-like architecture. To facilitate comprehensive training and evaluations, we build a large-scale animation triplet dataset, ATD-12K, which comprises 12,000 triplets with rich annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art interpolation methods for animation videos.

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning has been widely used to obtain transferrable representations from unlabeled images. Especially, recent contrastive learning methods have shown impressive performances on downstream image classification tasks. While these contrastive methods mainly focus on generating invariant global representations at the image-level under semantic-preserving transformations, they are prone to overlook spatial consistency of local representations and therefore have a limitation in pretraining for localization tasks such as object detection and instance segmentation. Moreover, aggressively cropped views used in existing contrastive methods can minimize representation distances between the semantically different regions of a single image. In this paper, we propose a spatially consistent representation learning algorithm (SCRL) for multi-object and location-specific tasks. In particular, we devise a novel self-supervised objective that tries to produce coherent spatial representations of a randomly cropped local region according to geometric translations and zooming operations.

    "abstract": "Semantic Scene Completion aims at reconstructing a complete 3D scene with precise voxel-wise semantics from a single-view depth or RGBD image. It is a crucial but challenging problem for indoor scene understanding. In this work, we present a novel framework named Scene-Instance-Scene Network (SISNet), which takes advantages of both instance and scene level semantic information. Our method is capable of inferring fine-grained shape details as well as nearby objects whose semantic categories are easily mixedup. The key insight is that we decouple the instances from a coarsely completed semantic scene instead of a raw input image to guide the reconstruction of instances and the overall scene. SISNet conducts iterative scene-to-instance (SI) and instance-to-scene (IS) semantic completion. Specifically, the SI is able to encode objects' surrounding context for effectively decoupling instances from the scene and each instance could be voxelized into higher resolution to capture finer details. With IS, fine-grained instance information can be integrated back into the 3D scene and thus leads to more accurate semantic scene completion. Utilizing such an iterative mechanism, the scene and instance completion benefits each other to achieve higher completion accuracy.

    "abstract": "The functional map framework has proven to be extremely effective for representing dense correspondences between deformable shapes. A key step in this framework is to formulate suitable preservation constraints to encode the geometric information that must be preserved by the unknown map. For this issue, we construct novel and powerful constraints to determine the functional map, where multiscale spectral manifold wavelets are required to be preserved at each scale correspondingly. Such constraints allow us to extract significantly more information than previous methods, especially those based on descriptor preservation constraints, and strongly ensure the isometric property of the map. In addition, we also propose a remarkable efficient iterative method to alternatively update the functional maps and pointwise maps. Moreover, when we use the tight wavelet frames in iterations, the computation of the functional maps boils down to a simple filtering procedure with low-pass and various band-pass filters, which avoids time-consuming solving large systems of linear equations commonly presented in functional maps. We demonstrate on a wide variety of experiments with different datasets that our approach achieves significant improvements both in the shape correspondence quality and the computing efficiency",

Despite the recent success of point cloud processing with geometric deep learning, it remains arduous to capture the complex topologies of point cloud data with a learning model. Given a point cloud dataset containing objects with various genera, or scenes with multiple objects, we propose an autoencoder, TearingNet, which tackles the challenging task of representing the point clouds using a fixed-length descriptor. Unlike existing works directly deforming predefined primitives of genus zero (e.g., a 2D square patch) to an object-level point cloud, our TearingNet is characterized by a proposed Tearing network module and a Folding network module interacting with each other iteratively. Particularly, the Tearing network module learns the point cloud topology explicitly. By breaking the edges of a primitive graph, it tears the graph into patches or with holes to emulate the topology of a target point cloud, leading to faithful reconstructions. Experimentation shows the superiority of our proposal in terms of reconstructing point clouds as well as generating more topology-friendly representations than benchmarks",

We make three original contributions. First, we revisit the ensemble diversity metrics in the literature and analyze the inherent problems of poor correlation between ensemble diversity and ensemble accuracy, which leads to the low quality ensemble selection using such diversity metrics. Second, instead of computing diversity scores for ensemble teams of different sizes using the same criteria, we introduce focal model based ensemble diversity metrics, coined as FQ-diversity metrics. Our new metrics significantly improve the intrinsic correlation between high ensemble diversity and high ensemble accuracy. Third, we introduce a diversity fusion method, coined as the EQ-diversity metric, by integrating the top three most representative FQ-diversity metrics.

Firstly, we collect 4M name list and download 260M faces from the Internet.

Equipped with this benchmark, we delve into million-scale face recognition problems. A distributed framework is developed to train face recognition models efficiently without tampering with the performance. Empowered by WebFace42M, we reduce relative 40% failure rate on the challenging IJB-C set, and rank the 3rd among 430 entries on NIST-FRVT.

Safe, high speed driving needs larger detection ranges, which are enabled by new LiDARs. These larger detection ranges require more efficient and accurate detection models. Towards this goal, we propose Range Sparse Net (RSN) - a simple, efficient, and accurate 3D object detector - in order to tackle real time 3D object detection in this extended detection regime. RSN predicts foreground points from range images and applies sparse convolutions on the selected fore-ground points to detect objects. The lightweight 2D convolutions on dense range images results in significantly fewer selected foreground points, thus enabling the later sparse convolutions in RSN to efficiently operate. Combining features from the range image further enhance detection ac-curacy. RSN runs at more than 60 frames per second on a 150mx150m detection region on Waymo Open Dataset (WOD) while being more accurate than previously published detectors.

This paper proposes a pioneering work by introducing zero and few-shot learning strategies for data-efficient HDR deghosting. Our approach consists of two stages of training. In stage one, we train the model with few labeled (5 or less) dynamic samples and a pool of unlabeled samples with a self-supervised loss. We use the trained model to predict HDRs for the unlabeled samples. To derive data for the next stage of training, we propose a novel method for generating corresponding dynamic inputs from the predicted HDRs of unlabeled data. The generated artificial dynamic inputs and predicted HDRs are used as paired labeled data. In stage two, we finetune the model with the original few labeled data and artificially generated labeled data. Our few-shot approach outperforms many fully-supervised methods in two publicly available datasets, using as little as five labeled dynamic samples",

Firstly, we construct a combined volume which incorporates contextual information from the squeezed concatenation volume and feature similarity measurement from the correlation volume. The combined volume can be next aggregated by 2D convolutions which are faster and require less memory than 3D convolutions.

In the proposed pretraining framework, we cut an image patch from a given video and let it scale and move according to a pre-set trajectory. The proxy task is to estimate the position and size of the image patch in a sequence of video frames, given only the target bounding box in the first frame. We discover that using multiple image patches simultaneously brings clear benefits. We further increase the difficulty of the game by randomly making patches invisible. Extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of CtP against other video pretraining methods. In addition, CtP-pretrained features are less sensitive to domain gaps than those trained by a supervised action recognition task. When both trained on Kinetics-400, we are pleasantly surprised to find that CtP-pretrained representation achieves much higher action classification accuracy than its fully supervised counterpart on Something-Something dataset",

Specifically, we propose a novel bilevel optimization-based data poisoning attack that degrades the robustness guarantees of certifiably robust classifiers. Unlike other poisoning attacks that reduce the accuracy of the poisoned models on a small set of target points, our attack reduces the average certified radius (ACR) of an entire target class in the dataset. Moreover, our attack is effective even when the victim trains the models from scratch using state-of-the-art robust training methods such as Gaussian data augmentation [??], MACER [??], and SmoothAdv [??] that achieve high certified adversarial robustness. To make the attack harder to detect, we use clean-label poisoning points with imperceptible distortions. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated by poisoning MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets and training deep neural networks using previously mentioned training methods and certifying the robustness with randomized smoothing. The ACR of the target class, for models trained on generated poison data, can be reduced by more than 30%.

In this model, the Pyramid, Warping, and Cost volume (PWC) structure for the LiDAR odometry task is built to refine the estimated pose in a coarse-to-fine approach hierarchically. An attentive cost volume is built to associate two point clouds and obtain embedding motion patterns. Then, a novel trainable embedding mask is proposed to weigh the local motion patterns of all points to regress the overall pose and filter outlier points. The estimated current pose is used to warp the first point cloud to bridge the distance to the second point cloud, and then the cost volume of the residual motion is built. At the same time, the embedding mask is optimized hierarchically from coarse to fine to obtain more accurate filtering information for pose refinement. The trainable pose warp-refinement process is iteratively used to make the pose estimation more robust for outliers. The superior performance and effectiveness of our LiDAR odometry model are demonstrated on KITTI odometry dataset.

    "abstract": "Continual learning usually assumes the incoming data are fully labeled, which might not be applicable in real applications. In this work, we consider semi-supervised continual learning (SSCL) that incrementally learns from partially labeled data. Observing that existing continual learning methods lack the ability to continually exploit the unlabeled data, we propose deep Online Replay with Discriminator Consistency (ORDisCo) to interdependently learn a classifier with a conditional generative adversarial network (GAN), which continually passes the learned data distribution to the classifier. In particular, ORDisCo replays data sampled from the conditional generator to the classifier in an online manner, exploiting unlabeled data in a time- and storage-efficient way. Further, to explicitly overcome the catastrophic forgetting of unlabeled data, we selectively stabilize parameters of the discriminator that are important for discriminating the pairs of old unlabeled data and their pseudo-labels predicted by the classifier. We extensively evaluate ORDisCo on various semi-supervised learning benchmark datasets for SSCL, and show that ORDisCo achieves significant performance improvement on SVHN, CIFAR10 and Tiny-ImageNet, compared to strong baselines",

More gracefully, our DRConv transfers the increasing channel-wise filters to spatial dimension with learnable instructor, which not only improve representation ability of convolution, but also maintains computational cost and the translation-invariance as standard convolution dose. DRConv is an effective and elegant method for handling complex and variable spatial information distribution. It can substitute standard convolution in any existing networks for its plug-and-play property, especially to power convolution layers in efficient networks. We evaluate DRConv on a wide range of models (MobileNet series, ShuffleNetV2, etc.) and tasks (Classification, Face Recognition, Detection and Segmentation). On ImageNet classification, DRConv-based ShuffleNetV2-0.5x achieves state-of-the-art performance of 67.1% at 46M multiply-adds level with 6.3% relative improvement",

Unlike recent deep-learning-based methods, our system can handle unseen blur kernel, while avoiding using complicated handcrafted priors on the blur operator often found in classical methods. Due to the method's design, the encoded kernel space is fully differentiable, thus can be easily adopted in deep neural network models. Moreover, our method can be used for blur synthesis by transferring existing blur operators from a given dataset into a new domain.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Searching for a more compact network width recently serves as an effective way of channel pruning for the deployment of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) under hardware constraints. To fulfill the searching, a one-shot supernet is usually leveraged to efficiently evaluate the performance \\wrt different network widths. However, current methods mainly follow a unilaterally augmented (UA) principle for the evaluation of each width, which induces the training unfairness of channels in supernet. In this paper, we introduce a new supernet called Bilaterally Coupled Network (BCNet) to address this issue. In BCNet, each channel is fairly trained and responsible for the same amount of network widths, thus each network width can be evaluated more accurately. Besides, we leverage a stochastic complementary strategy for training the BCNet, and propose a prior initial population sampling method to boost the performance of the evolutionary search. Extensive experiments on benchmark CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets indicate that our method can achieve state-of-the-art or competing performance over other baseline methods. Moreover, our method turns out to further boost the performance of NAS models by refining their network widths. For example, with the same FLOPs budget, our obtained EfficientNet-B0 achieves 77.36% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet dataset, surpassing the performance of original setting by 0.48%",

First, we introduce a simple perspective-aware data augmentation that synthesizes new training examples with more diverse views by perturbing the existing ones in a geometrically consistent manner. Second, we propose a conditional model that exploits the per-image camera pose as prior knowledge by encoding it as a part of the input. We show that jointly applying the two methods improves depth prediction on images captured under uncommon and even never-before-seen camera poses.

We alleviate this issue by proposing a novel network architecture called Adaptive Aggregation Networks (AANets), in which we explicitly build two types of residual blocks at each residual level (taking ResNet as the baseline architecture): a stable block and a plastic block. We aggregate the output feature maps from these two blocks and then feed the results to the next-level blocks. We adapt the aggregation weights in order to balance these two types of blocks, i.e., to balance stability and plasticity, dynamically.

    "abstract": "Visual localization is of great importance in robotics and computer vision. Recently, scene coordinate regression based methods have shown good performance in visual localization in small static scenes. However, it still estimates camera poses from many inferior scene coordinates. To address this problem, we propose a novel visual localization framework that establishes 2D-to-3D correspondences between the query image and the 3D map with a series of learnable scene-specific landmarks. In the landmark generation stage, the 3D surfaces of the target scene are over-segmented into mosaic patches whose centers are regarded as the scene-specific landmarks. To robustly and accurately recover the scene-specific landmarks, we propose the Voting with Segmentation Network (VS-Net) to segment the pixels into different landmark patches with a segmentation branch and estimate the landmark locations within each patch with a landmark location voting branch. Since the number of landmarks in a scene may reach up to 5000, training a segmentation network with such a large number of classes is both computation and memory costly for the commonly used cross-entropy loss. We propose a novel prototype-based triplet loss with hard negative mining, which is able to train semantic segmentation networks with a large number of labels efficiently. Our proposed VS-Net is extensively tested on multiple public benchmarks and can outperform state-of-the-art visual localization methods.

We use these vectors to encode both angular and positional variations of image lines, which is more reliable and concise than directly using inclinations, midpoints or endpoints of image lines. Neighboring vectors mapped from correct matches exhibit a spatial regularity called local trend consistency, regardless of the type of scenes. To encode this regularity, we design a neural network and also propose a novel loss function that enforces the smoothness constraint of vector field.

However, there has been implicit common knowledge that training STR models on real data is nearly impossible because real data is insufficient. We consider that this common knowledge has obstructed the study of STR with fewer labels. In this work, we would like to reactivate STR with fewer labels by disproving the common knowledge. We consolidate recently accumulated public real data and show that we can train STR models satisfactorily only with real labeled data. Subsequently, we find simple data augmentation to fully exploit real data. Furthermore, we improve the models by collecting unlabeled data and introducing semi- and self-supervised methods. As a result, we obtain a competitive model to state-of-the-art methods.

To overcome the problem of catastrophic forgetting, we propose utilizing an alternative \"white box\" architecture derived from the principle of rate reduction, where each layer of the network is explicitly computed without back propagation.

Learning HR representations is typically ignored in previous Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods that focus on image classification. This work proposes a novel NAS method, called HR-NAS, which is able to find efficient and accurate networks for different tasks, by effectively encoding multiscale contextual information while maintaining high-resolution representations. In HR-NAS, we renovate the NAS search space as well as its searching strategy. To better encode multiscale image contexts in the search space of HR-NAS, we first carefully design a lightweight transformer, whose computational complexity can be dynamically changed with respect to different objective functions and computation budgets. To maintain high-resolution representations of the learned networks, HR-NAS adopts a multi-branch architecture that provides convolutional encoding of multiple feature resolutions, inspired by HRNet. Last, we proposed an efficient fine-grained search strategy to train HR-NAS, which effectively explores the search space, and finds optimal architectures given various tasks and computation resources. HR-NAS is capable of achieving state-of-the-art trade-offs between performance and FLOPs for three dense prediction tasks and an image classification task, given only small computational budgets. For example, HR-NAS surpasses SqueezeNAS that is specially designed for semantic segmentation by a large margin of 3.61% while improving efficiency by 45.9%.

    "abstract": "Previous models for vision-to-language generation tasks usually pretrain a visual encoder and a language generator in the respective domains and jointly finetune them with the target task. However, this direct transfer practice may suffer from the discord between visual specificity and language fluency since they are often separately trained from large corpora of visual and text data with no common ground. In this work, we claim that a transitional adaptation task is required between pretraining and finetuning to harmonize the visual encoder and the language model for challenging downstream target tasks like visual storytelling. We propose a novel approach named Transitional Adaptation of Pretrained Model (TAPM) that adapts the multi-modal modules to each other with a simpler alignment task between visual inputs only with no need for text labels. Through extensive experiments, we show that the adaptation step significantly improves the performance of multiple language models for sequential video and image captioning tasks. We achieve new state-of-the-art performance on both language metrics and human evaluation in the multi-sentence description task of LSMDC 2019 and the image storytelling task of VIST. Our experiments reveal that this improvement in caption quality does not depend on the specific choice of language models",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Quantifying the importance of each training point to a learning task is a fundamental problem in machine learning and the estimated importance scores have been leveraged to guide a range of data workflows such as data summarization and domain adaption. One simple idea is to use the leave-one-out error of each training point to indicate its importance. Recent work has also proposed to use the Shapley value, as it defines a unique value distribution scheme that satisfies a set of appealing properties. However, calculating Shapley values is often expensive, which limits its applicability in real-world applications at scale. Multiple heuristics to improve the scalability of calculating Shapley values have been proposed recently, with the potential risk of compromising their utility in real-world applications. How well do existing data quantification methods perform on existing workflows? How do these methods compare with each other, empirically and theoretically? Must we sacrifice scalability for the utility in these workflows when using these methods? In this paper, we conduct a novel theoretical analysis comparing the utility of different importance quantification methods, and report extensive experimental studies on settings such as noisy label detection, watermark removal, data summarization, data acquisition, and domain adaptation on existing and proposed workflows. We show that Shapley value approximation based on a KNN surrogate over pre-trained feature embeddings obtains comparable utility with existing algorithms while achieving significant scalability improvement, often by orders of magnitude. Our theoretical analysis also justifies its advantage over the leave-one-out error. The code is available at https://github.com/AI-secure/Shapley-Study",

    "abstract": "Learning computational models of image aesthetics can have a substantial impact on visual art and graphic design. Although automatic image aesthetics assessment is a challenging topic by its subjective nature, psychological studies have confirmed a strong correlation between image layouts and perceived image quality. While previous state-of-the-art methods attempt to learn holistic information using deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), our approach is motivated by the fact that Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) architecture is conceivably more suited for modeling complex relations among image regions than vanilla convolutional layers. Specifically, we present a Hierarchical Layout-Aware Graph Convolutional Network (HLA-GCN) to capture layout information. It is a dedicated double-subnet neural network consisting of two LAGCN modules. The first LA-GCN module constructs an aesthetics-related graph in the coordinate space and performs reasoning over spatial nodes. The second LA-GCN module performs graph reasoning after aggregating significant regions in a latent space. The model output is a hierarchical representation with layout-aware features from both spatial and aggregated nodes for unified aesthetics assessment. Extensive evaluations show that our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art on the AVA and AADB datasets across three different tasks.

    "abstract": "We introduce a highly robust GAN-based framework for digitizing a normalized 3D avatar of a person from a single unconstrained photo. While the input image can be of a smiling person or taken in extreme lighting conditions, our method can reliably produce a high-quality textured model of a person's face in neutral expression and skin textures under diffuse lighting condition. Cutting-edge 3D face reconstruction methods use non-linear morphable face models combined with GAN-based decoders to capture the likeness and details of a person but fail to produce neutral head models with unshaded albedo textures which is critical for creating relightable and animation-friendly avatars for integration in virtual environments. The key challenges for existing methods to work is the lack of training and ground truth data containing normalized 3D faces. We propose a two-stage approach to address this problem. First, we adopt a highly robust normalized 3D face generator by embedding a non-linear morphable face model into a StyleGAN2 network. This allows us to generate detailed but normalized facial assets. This inference is then followed by a perceptual refinement step that uses the generated assets as regularization to cope with the limited available training samples of normalized faces. We further introduce a Normalized Face Dataset, which consists of a combination photogrammetry scans, carefully selected photographs, and generated fake people with neutral expressions in diffuse lighting conditions. While our prepared dataset contains two orders of magnitude less subjects than cutting edge GAN-based 3D facial reconstruction methods, we show that it is possible to produce high-quality normalized face models for very challenging unconstrained input images, and demonstrate superior performance to the current state-of-the-art",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer the knowledge from the labeled source domain to the unlabeled target domain. Existing self-training based UDA approaches assign pseudo labels for target data and treat them as ground truth labels to fully leverage unlabeled target data for model adaptation. However, the generated pseudo labels from the model optimized on the source domain inevitably contain noise due to the domain gap. To tackle this issue, we advance a MetaCorrection framework, where a Domain-aware Meta-learning strategy is devised to benefit Loss Correction (DMLC) for UDA semantic segmentation. In particular, we model the noise distribution of pseudo labels in target domain by introducing a noise transition matrix (NTM) and construct meta data set with domain-invariant source data to guide the estimation of NTM. Through the risk minimization on the meta data set, the optimized NTM thus can correct the noisy issues in pseudo labels and enhance the generalization ability of the model on the target data. Considering the capacity gap between shallow and deep features, we further employ the proposed DMLC strategy to provide matched and compatible supervision signals for different level features, thereby ensuring deep adaptation. Extensive experimental results highlight the effectiveness of our method against existing state-of-the-art methods on three benchmarks",

    "abstract": "Image restoration tasks demand a complex balance between spatial details and high-level contextualized information while recovering images. In this paper, we propose a novel synergistic design that can optimally balance these competing goals. Our main proposal is a multi-stage architecture, that progressively learns restoration functions for the degraded inputs, thereby breaking down the overall recovery process into more manageable steps. Specifically, our model first learns the contextualized features using encoder-decoder architectures and later combines them with a high-resolution branch that retains local information. At each stage, we introduce a novel per-pixel adaptive design that leverages in-situ supervised attention to reweight the local features. A key ingredient in such a multi-stage architecture is the information exchange between different stages. To this end, we propose a two-faceted approach where the information is not only exchanged sequentially from early to late stages, but lateral connections between feature processing blocks also exist to avoid any loss of information. The resulting tightly interlinked multi-stage architecture, named as MPRNet, delivers strong performance gains on ten datasets across a range of tasks including image deraining, deblurring, and denoising.

Hybrid learning methods, that use learning for predicting point correspondences and then a deterministic step for alignment, have offered some respite, but are still limited in their generalization abilities. We revisit a recent innovation---PointNetLK---and show that the inclusion of an analytical Jacobian can exhibit remarkable generalization properties while reaping the inherent fidelity benefits of a learning framework.

However, the performance of such methods remains limited for several reasons. First, the unfolded architectures do not strictly follow the image representation model of DicL and lose the desired physical meaning. Second, handcrafted priors are still used in most unfolding methods without effectively utilizing the learning capability of DNNs. Third, a universal dictionary is learned to represent all images, reducing the model representation flexibility. We propose a novel framework of deep convolutional dictionary learning (DCDicL), which follows the representation model of DicL strictly, learns the priors for both representation coefficients and the dictionaries, and can adaptively adjust the dictionary for each input image based on its content. The effectiveness of our DCDicL method is validated on the image denoising problem. DCDicL demonstrates leading denoising performance in terms of both quantitative metrics (e.g., PSNR, SSIM) and visual quality. In particular, it can reproduce the subtle image structures and textures, which are hard to recover by many existing denoising DNNs.

Most of existing methods model text instances in image spatial domain via masks or contour point sequences in the Cartesian or the polar coordinate system. However, the mask representation might lead to expensive post-processing, while the point sequence one may have limited capability to model texts with highly-curved shapes. To tackle these problems, we model text instances in the Fourier domain and propose one novel Fourier Contour Embedding (FCE) method to represent arbitrary shaped text contours as compact signatures. We further construct FCENet with a backbone, feature pyramid networks (FPN) and a simple post-processing with the Inverse Fourier Transformation (IFT) and Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS). Different from previous methods, FCENet first predicts compact Fourier signatures of text instances, and then reconstructs text contours via IFT and NMS during test. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FCE is accurate and robust to fit contours of scene texts even with highly-curved shapes, and also validate the effectiveness and the good generalization of FCENet for arbitrary-shaped text detection.

In contrast to the conventional vision-language pre-training that fails to capture scene text and its relationship with the visual and text modalities, TAP explicitly incorporates scene text (generated from OCR engines) in pre-training. With three pre-training tasks, including masked language modeling (MLM), image-text (contrastive) matching (ITM), and relative (spatial) position prediction (RPP), TAP effectively helps the model learn a better aligned representation among the three modalities: text word, visual object, and scene text. Due to this aligned representation learning, even pre-trained on the same downstream task dataset, TAP already boosts the absolute accuracy on the TextVQA dataset by +5.4%, compared with a non-TAP baseline. To further improve the performance, we build a large-scale dataset based on the Conceptual Caption dataset, named OCR-CC, which contains 1.4 million scene text-related image-text pairs. Pre-trained on this OCR-CC dataset, our approach outperforms the state of the art by large margins on multiple tasks, i.e., +8.3% accuracy on TextVQA, +8.6% accuracy on ST-VQA, and +10.2 CIDEr score on TextCaps",

VD is designed to represent consistent visual abstractions of similar semantics, and VD can be further updated on-the-fly during pre-training. We conduct experiments on four well-established vision-language tasks by following standard VLPT settings.

To mitigate the issue, we propose a new paradigm of training deep image recognition networks that produce clean-like features from any quality image via an invertible neural architecture. The proposed method consists of two stages. In the first stage, we train an invertible network with only clean images under the recognition objective. In the second stage, its inversion, i.e., the invertible decoder, is attached to a new recognition network and we train this encoder-decoder network using both clean and corrupted images by considering recognition and reconstruction objectives. Our two-stage scheme allows the network to produce clean-like and robust features from any quality images, by reconstructing their clean images via the invertible decoder.

    "abstract": "We address rotation averaging (RA) and its application to real-world 3D reconstruction. Local optimisation based approaches are the de facto choice, though they only guarantee a local optimum. Global optimisers ensure global optimality in low noise conditions, but they are inefficient and may easily deviate under the influence of outliers or elevated noise levels. We push the envelope of rotation averaging by leveraging the advantages of a global RA method and a local RA method. Combined with a fast view graph filtering as preprocessing, the proposed hybrid approach is robust to outliers. We further apply the proposed hybrid rotation averaging approach to incremental Structure from Motion (SfM), the accuracy and robustness of SfM are both improved by adding the resulting global rotations as regularisers to bundle adjustment. Overall, we demonstrate high practicality of the proposed method as bad camera poses are effectively corrected and drift is reduced",

    "abstract": "Point cloud semantic segmentation often requires largescale annotated training data, but clearly, point-wise labels are too tedious to prepare. While some recent methods propose to train a 3D network with small percentages of point labels, we take the approach to an extreme and propose \"One Thing One Click,\" meaning that the annotator only needs to label one point per object. To leverage these extremely sparse labels in network training, we design a novel self-training approach, in which we iteratively conduct the training and label propagation, facilitated by a graph propagation module. Also, we adopt a relation network to generate per-category prototype and explicitly model the similarity among graph nodes to generate pseudo labels to guide the iterative training. Experimental results on both ScanNet-v2 and S3DIS show that our self-training approach, with extremely-sparse annotations, outperforms all existing weakly supervised methods for 3D semantic segmentation by a large margin, and our results are also comparable to those of the fully supervised counterparts",

    "abstract": "The goal of out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is to handle the situations where the test samples are drawn from a different distribution than the training data. In this paper, we argue that OOD samples can be detected more easily if the training data is embedded into a low-dimensional space, such that the embedded training samples lie on a union of 1-dimensional subspaces. We show that such embedding of the in-distribution (ID) samples provides us with two main advantages. First, due to compact representation in the feature space, OOD samples are less likely to occupy the same region as the known classes. Second, the first singular vector of ID samples belonging to a 1-dimensional subspace can be used as their robust representative. Motivated by these observations, we train a deep neural network such that the ID samples are embedded onto a union of 1-dimensional subspaces. At the test time, employing sampling techniques used for approximate Bayesian inference in deep learning, input samples are detected as OOD if they occupy the region corresponding to the ID samples with probability 0. Spectral components of the ID samples are used as robust representative of this region. Our method does not have any hyperparameter to be tuned using extra information and it can be applied on different modalities with minimal change. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated on different benchmark datasets, both in the image and video classification domains",

Unfortunately, building HD maps has proven hard to scale due to their cost as well as the requirements they impose in the localization system that has to work everywhere with centimeter-level accuracy. Being able to drive without an HD map would be very beneficial to scale self-driving solutions as well as to increase the failure tolerance of existing ones (e.g., if localization fails or the map is not up-to-date). Towards this goal, we propose an end-to-end approach to mapless driving where the input is raw sensor data and a high-level command (e.g., turn left at the intersection). We then predict intermediate representations in the form of an online map and the current and future state of dynamic agents, and exploit them in a novel neural motion planner to make interpretable decisions taking into account uncertainty. We show that our approach is significantly safer, more comfortable, and can follow commands better than the baselines in challenging long-term closed-loop simulations, as well as when compared to an expert driver in a large-scale real-world dataset",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Learning to model and reconstruct humans in clothing is challenging due to articulation, non-rigid deformation, and varying clothing types and topologies. To enable learning, the choice of representation is the key. Recent work uses neural networks to parameterize local surface elements. This approach captures locally coherent geometry and non-planar details, can deal with varying topology, and does not require registered training data. However, naively using such methods to model 3D clothed humans fails to capture fine-grained local deformations and generalizes poorly. To address this, we present three key innovations: First, we deform surface elements based on a human body model such that large-scale deformations caused by articulation are explicitly separated from topological changes and local clothing deformations. Second, we address the limitations of existing neural surface elements by regressing local geometry from local features, significantly improving the expressiveness. Third, we learn a pose embedding on a 2D parameterization space that encodes posed body geometry, improving generalization to unseen poses by reducing non-local spurious correlations. We demonstrate the efficacy of our surface representation by learning models of complex clothing from point clouds. The clothing can change topology and deviate from the topology of the body. Once learned, we can animate previously unseen motions, producing high-quality point clouds, from which we generate realistic images with neural rendering. We assess the importance of each technical contribution and show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy and inference time.

    "abstract": "Contrastive learning relies on constructing a collection of negative examples that are sufficiently hard to discriminate against positive queries when their representations are self-trained. Existing contrastive learning methods either maintain a queue of negative samples over mini-batches while only a small portion of them are updated in an iteration or only use the other examples from the current minibatch as negatives. They could not closely track the change of the learned representation over iterations by updating the entire queue as a whole or discard the useful information from the past mini-batches. Alternatively, we present to directly learn a set of negative adversaries playing against the self-trained representation. Two players, the representation network and negative adversaries are alternately updated to obtain the most challenging negative examples against which the representation of positive queries will be trained to discriminate. We further show that the negative adversaries are updated towards a weighted combination of positive queries by maximizing the adversarial contrastive loss, thereby allowing them to closely track the change of representations over time. Experiment results demonstrate the proposed Adversarial Contrastive (AdCo) model not only achieves superior performances (a top-1 accuracy of 73.2% over 200 epochs and 75.7% over 800 epochs with linear evaluation on ImageNet), but also can be pre-trained more efficiently with much shorter GPU time and fewer epochs.

    "abstract": "Compressing large neural networks is an important step for their deployment in resource-constrained computational platforms. In this context, vector quantization is an appealing framework that expresses multiple parameters using a single code, and has recently achieved state-of-the-art network compression on a range of core vision and natural language processing tasks. Key to the success of vector quantization is deciding which parameter groups should be compressed together. Previous work has relied on heuristics that group the spatial dimension of individual convolutional filters, but a general solution remains unaddressed. This is desirable for pointwise convolutions (which dominate modern architectures), linear layers (which have no notion of spatial dimension), and convolutions (when more than one filter is compressed to the same codeword). In this paper we make the observation that the weights of two adjacent layers can be permuted while expressing the same function. We then establish a connection to rate-distortion theory and search for permutations that result in networks that are easier to compress. Finally, we rely on an annealed quantization algorithm to better compress the network and achieve higher final accuracy. We show results on image classification, object detection, and segmentation, reducing the gap with the uncompressed model by 40 to 70% w.r.t. the current state of the art.

It is even harder when the images are blurred, from the camera being in a car or a hand-held phone. Most existing efforts either focused on sharp images, with easy to label ground truth, or they have treated motion blur as one of many generic corruptions. Instead, we focus especially on the details of egomotion induced blur. We explore five classes of remedies, where each targets different potential causes for the performance gap between sharp and blurred images. For example, first deblurring an image changes its human interpretability, but at present, only partly improves object detection. The other four classes of remedies address multi-scale texture, out-of-distribution testing, label generation, and conditioning by blur-type. Surprisingly, we discover that custom label generation aimed at resolving spatial ambiguity, ahead of all others, markedly improves object detection. Also, in contrast to findings from classification, we see a noteworthy boost by conditioning our model on bespoke categories of motion blur. We validate and cross-breed the different remedies experimentally on blurred COCO images and real-world blur datasets, producing an easy and practical favorite model with superior detection rates",

Inter-class reasoning then performs spatial and semantic reasoning based on the dependency relations among different object categories.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Few-shot learning is a challenging task, which aims to learn a classifier for novel classes with few examples. Pre-training based meta-learning methods effectively tackle the problem by pre-training a feature extractor and then fine-tuning it through the nearest centroid based meta-learning. However, results show that the fine-tuning step makes very marginal improvements. In this paper, 1) we figure out the key reason, i.e., in the pre-trained feature space, the base classes already form compact clusters while novel classes spread as groups with large variances, which implies that fine-tuning the feature extractor is less meaningful; 2) instead of fine-tuning the feature extractor, we focus on estimating more representative prototypes during meta-learning. Consequently, we propose a novel prototype completion based meta-learning framework. This framework first introduces primitive knowledge (i.e., class-level part or attribute annotations) and extracts representative attribute features as priors. Then, we design a prototype completion network to learn to complete prototypes with these priors. To avoid the prototype completion error caused by primitive knowledge noises or class differences, we further develop a Gaussian based prototype fusion strategy that combines the mean-based and completed prototypes by exploiting the unlabeled samples. Extensive experiments show that our method: (i) can obtain more accurate prototypes; (ii) outperforms state-of-the-art techniques by 2% 9% in terms of classification accuracy.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Single-shot monocular birefractive stereo methods have been used for estimating sparse depth from double refraction over edges. They also obtain an ordinary-ray (o-ray) image concurrently or subsequently through additional post-processing of depth densification and deconvolution. However, when an extraordinary-ray (e-ray) image is restored to acquire stereo images, the existing methods suffer from very severe restoration artifacts in stereo images due to a low signal-to-noise ratio of input e-ray image or depth/deconvolution errors. In this work, we present a novel stereo image restoration network that can restore stereo images directly from a double-refraction image. First, we built a physically faithful birefractive stereo imaging dataset by simulating the double refraction phenomenon with existing RGB-D datasets. Second, we formulated a joint stereo restoration problem that accounts for not only geometric relation between o-/e-ray images but also joint optimization of restoring both stereo images. We trained our model with our birefractive image dataset in an end-to-end manner. Our model restores high-quality stereo images directly from double refraction in real-time, enabling high-quality stereo video using a monocular camera. Our method also allows us to estimate dense depth maps from stereo images using a conventional stereo method. We evaluate the performance of our method experimentally and synthetically with the ground truth. Results validate that our stereo image restoration network outperforms the existing methods with high accuracy. We demonstrate several image-editing applications using our high-quality stereo images and dense depth maps",

    "abstract": "We propose an unsupervised method for detecting and tracking moving objects in 3D, in unlabelled RGB-D videos. The method begins with classic handcrafted techniques for segmenting objects using motion cues: we estimate optical flow and camera motion, and conservatively segment regions that appear to be moving independently of the background. Treating these initial segments as pseudo-labels, we learn an ensemble of appearance-based 2D and 3D detectors, under heavy data augmentation. We use this ensemble to detect new instances of the \"moving\" type, even if they are not moving, and add these as new pseudo-labels. Our method is an expectation-maximization algorithm, where in the expectation step we fire all modules and look for agreement among them, and in the maximization step we re-train the modules to improve this agreement. The constraint of ensemble agreement helps combat contamination of the generated pseudo-labels (during the E step), and data augmentation helps the modules generalize to yet-unlabelled data (during the M step). We compare against existing unsupervised object discovery and tracking methods, using challenging videos from CATER and KITTI, and show strong improvements over the state-of-the-art",

Given a scene-graph input, our LT-Net uniquely encodes the semantic features for exploiting their co-occurrences and implicit relationships. This allows one to manipulate conceptually diverse yet plausible layout outputs. Moreover, the decoder of our LT-Net translates the encoded contextual features into bounding boxes with self-supervised relation consistency preserved. By fitting their distributions to Gaussian mixture models, spatially-diverse layouts can be additionally produced by LT-Net. We conduct extensive experiments on the datasets of MS-COCO and Visual Genome, and confirm the effectiveness and plausibility of our LT-Net over recent layout generation models",

To train our network, we build the first perspective portrait dataset with a large diversity in identities, scenes and camera modules. For the quantitative evaluation, we introduce two novel metrics, line consistency and face congruence.

Unfortunately, for many human activities (e.g. outdoor sports) such training data does not exist and is hard or even impossible to acquire with traditional motion capture systems. We propose a self-supervised approach that learns a single image 3D pose estimator from unlabeled multi-view data. To this end, we exploit multi-view consistency constraints to disentangle the observed 2D pose into the underlying 3D pose and camera rotation. In contrast to most existing methods, we do not require calibrated cameras and can therefore learn from moving cameras. Nevertheless, in the case of a static camera setup, we present an optional extension to include constant relative camera rotations over multiple views into our framework. Key to the success are new, unbiased reconstruction objectives that mix information across views and training samples.

    "abstract": "We have observed significant progress in visual navigation for embodied agents. A common assumption in studying visual navigation is that the environments are static; this is a limiting assumption. Intelligent navigation may involve interacting with the environment beyond just moving forward/backward and turning left/right. Sometimes, the best way to navigate is to push something out of the way. In this paper, we study the problem of interactive navigation where agents learn to change the environment to navigate more efficiently to their goals. To this end, we introduce the Neural Interaction Engine (NIE) to explicitly predict the change in the environment caused by the agent's actions. By modeling the changes while planning, we find that agents exhibit significant improvements in their navigational capabilities. More specifically, we consider two downstream tasks in the physics-enabled, visually rich, AI2-THOR environment: (1) reaching a target while the path to the target is blocked (2) moving an object to a target location by pushing it. For both tasks, agents equipped with an NIE significantly outperform agents without the understanding of the effect of the actions indicating the benefits of our approach.

A major challenge thus lies in the missing links between image regions and sentence phrases during training. To address this challenge, we leverage a generic object detector at training time, and propose a contrastive learning framework that accounts for both region-phrase and image-sentence matching. Our core innovation is the learning of a region-phrase score function, based on which an image-sentence score function is further constructed. Importantly, our region-phrase score function is learned by distilling from soft matching scores between the detected object names and candidate phrases within an image-sentence pair, while the image-sentence score function is supervised by ground-truth image-sentence pairs. The design of such score functions removes the need of object detection at test time, thereby significantly reducing the inference cost. Without bells and whistles, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on visual phrase grounding, surpassing previous methods that require expensive object detectors at test time",

    "abstract": "Event cameras sense per-pixel intensity changes and produce asynchronous event streams with high dynamic range and less motion blur, showing advantages over the conventional cameras. A hurdle of training event-based models is the lack of large qualitative labeled data. Prior works learning end-tasks mostly rely on labeled or pseudo-labeled datasets obtained from the active pixel sensor (APS) frames; however, such datasets' quality is far from rivaling those based on the canonical images. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, called EvDistill, to learn a student network on the unlabeled and unpaired event data (target modality) via knowledge distillation (KD) from a teacher network trained with large labeled image data (source modality). To enable KD across the unpaired modalities, we first propose a bidirectional modality reconstruction (BMR) module to bridge both modalities and simultaneously exploit them to distill knowledge via the crafted pairs, causing no extra computation in the test time. The BMR is improved by the end-task and KD losses in an end-to-end manner. Second, we leverage the structural similarities of both modalities and adapt the knowledge by matching their distributions. Moreover, as most prior feature KD methods are uni-modality and less applicable to our problem, we propose an affinity graph KD and other losses to boost the distillation. Our extensive experiments on semantic segmentation and object recognition demonstrate that EvDistill achieves significantly better results than the prior works and KD with only events and APS frames",

This is also more challenging in part due to the sparsity of radar, but also because automotive radar beams are much wider than a typical pixel combined with a large baseline between camera and radar, which results in poor association between radar pixels and color pixel. A consequence is that depth completion methods designed for LiDAR and video fare poorly for radar and video. Here we propose a radar-to-pixel association stage which learns a mapping from radar returns to pixels. This mapping also serves to densify radar returns. Using this as a first stage, followed by a more traditional depth completion method, we are able to achieve image-guided depth completion with radar and video.

    "abstract": "Image matting is a fundamental and challenging problem in computer vision and graphics. Most existing matting methods leverage a user-supplied trimap as an auxiliary input to produce good alpha matte. However, obtaining high-quality trimap itself is arduous, thus restricting the application of these methods. Recently, some trimap-free methods have emerged, however, the matting quality is still far behind the trimap-based methods. The main reason is that, without the trimap guidance in some cases, the target network is ambiguous about which is the foreground target. In fact, choosing the foreground is a subjective procedure and depends on the user's intention. To this end, this paper proposes an improved deep image matting framework which is trimap-free and only needs several user click interactions to eliminate the ambiguity. Moreover, we introduce a new uncertainty estimation module that can predict which parts need polishing and a following local refinement module. Based on the computation budget, users can choose how many local parts to improve with the uncertainty guidance. Quantitative and qualitative results show that our method performs better than existing trimap-free methods and comparably to state-of-the-art trimap-based methods with minimal user effort",

In this work, we address this question under realistic, click-based measurement of annotation costs. In particular, we revisit the use of superpixels and demonstrate that the inappropriate choice of cost measure (e.g., the percentage of labeled pixels), may cause the effectiveness of the superpixel-based approach to be under-estimated. We benchmark the superpixel-based approach against the traditional \"rectangle+polygon\"-based approach with annotation cost measured in clicks, and show that the former outperforms on both Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC. We further propose a class-balanced acquisition function to boost the performance of the superpixel-based approach and demonstrate its effectiveness on the evaluation datasets.

Unfortunately though, the use of meshes as the underlying representation for protein structure has multiple drawbacks including the need to pre-compute the input features and mesh connectivities. This becomes a bottleneck for many important tasks in protein science. In this paper, we present a new framework for deep learning on protein structures that addresses these limitations. Among the key advantages of our method are the computation and sampling of the molecular surface on-the-fly from the underlying atomic point cloud and a novel efficient geometric convolutional layer. As a result, we are able to process large collections of proteins in an end-to-end fashion, taking as the sole input the raw 3D coordinates and chemical types of their atoms, eliminating the need for any hand-crafted pre-computed features. To showcase the performance of our approach, we test it on two tasks in the field of protein structural bioinformatics: the identification of interaction sites and the prediction of protein-protein interactions. On both tasks, we achieve state-of-the-art performance with much faster run times and fewer parameters than previous models. These results will considerably ease the deployment of deep learning methods in protein science and open the door for end-to-end differentiable approaches in protein modeling tasks such as function prediction and design",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The problem of grounding VQA tasks has seen an increased attention in the research community recently, with most attempts usually focusing on solving this task by using pretrained object detectors. However, pre-trained object detectors require bounding box annotations for detecting relevant objects in the vocabulary, which may not always be feasible for real-life large-scale applications. In this paper, we focus on a more relaxed setting: the grounding of relevant visual entities in a weakly supervised manner by training on the VQA task alone. To address this problem, we propose a visual capsule module with a query-based selection mechanism of capsule features, that allows the model to focus on relevant regions based on the textual cues about visual information in the question. We show that integrating the proposed capsule module in existing VQA systems significantly improves their performance on the weakly supervised grounding task. Overall, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on two state-of-the-art VQA systems, stacked NMN and MAC, on the CLEVR-Answers benchmark, our new evaluation set based on CLEVR scenes with ground truth bounding boxes for objects that are relevant for the correct answer, as well as on GQA, a real world VQA dataset with compositional questions. We show that the systems with the proposed capsule module consistently outperform the respective baseline systems in terms of answer grounding, while achieving comparable performance on VQA task",

    "abstract": "Recently, some methods have focused on learning local relation among parts of pedestrian images for person re-identification (Re-ID), as it offers powerful representation capabilities. However, they only provide the intra-local relation among parts within single pedestrian image and ignore the inter-local relation among parts from different images, which results in incomplete local relation information. In this paper, we propose a novel deep graph model named Heterogeneous Local Graph Attention Networks (HLGAT) to model the inter-local relation and the intra-local relation in the completed local graph, simultaneously. Specifically, we first construct the completed local graph using local features, and we resort to the attention mechanism to aggregate the local features in the learning process of inter-local relation and intra-local relation so as to emphasize the importance of different local features. As for the inter-local relation, we propose the attention regularization loss to constrain the attention weights based on the identities of local features in order to describe the inter-local relation accurately. As for the intra-local relation, we propose to inject the contextual information into the attention weights to consider structure information. Extensive experiments on Market-1501, CUHK03, DukeMTMC-reID and MSMT17 demonstrate that the proposed HLGAT outperforms the state-of-the-art methods",

Our work addresses two key challenges in trajectory prediction, learning multimodal outputs, and better predictions by imposing constraints using driving knowledge.

But the impact of those methods in learning diverse hypotheses is under-studied as such objectives highly depend on their initialization for diversity. As our first contribution, we propose a novel Divide-And-Conquer (DAC) approach that acts as a better initialization technique to WTA objective, resulting in diverse outputs without any spurious modes. Our second contribution is a novel trajectory prediction framework called ALAN that uses existing lane centerlines as anchors to provide trajectories constrained to the input lanes. Our framework provides multi-agent trajectory outputs in a forward pass by capturing interactions through hypercolumn descriptors and incorporating scene information in the form of rasterized images and per-agent lane anchors. Experiments on synthetic and real data show that the proposed DAC captures the data distribution better compare to other WTA family of objectives. Further, we show that our ALAN approach provides on par or better performance with SOTA methods evaluated on Nuscenes urban driving benchmark",

Our solution to this task predicts distributions over SMPL body shape and pose parameters conditioned on the input images in the group. We probabilistically combine predicted body shape distributions from each image to obtain a final multi-image shape prediction. We show that the additional body shape information present in multi-image input groups improves 3D human shape estimation metrics compared to single-image inputs on the SSP-3D dataset and a private dataset of tape-measured humans. In addition, predicting distributions over 3D bodies allows us to quantify pose prediction uncertainty, which is useful when faced with challenging input images with significant occlusion.

In videos, motion and temporal consistency of predictions across frames provide complementary signals which can help segmentation. We are the first to explore the use of these video signals to tackle weakly supervised instance segmentation. We propose two ways to leverage this information in our model. First, we adapt inter-pixel relation network (IRN) to effectively incorporate motion information during training. Second, we introduce a new MaskConsist module, which addresses the problem of missing object instances by transferring stable predictions between neighboring frames during training.

Prior works however generally operate with the assumption that there is a limited number of styles, most of which have already been captured by existing datasets. In this paper, we take a completely different perspective -- we work on the assumption that there is always a new style that is drastically different, and that we will only have very limited data during testing to perform adaptation. This results in creates a commercially viable solution -- being exposed to the new style, the model has the best shot at adaptation, and the few-sample nature makes it practical to implement. We achieve this via a novel meta-learning framework which exploits additional new-writer data via a support set, and outputs a writer-adapted model via single gradient step update, all during inference. We discover and leverage on the important insight that there exists few key characters per writer that exhibit relatively larger style discrepancies. For that, we additionally propose to meta-learn instance specific weights for a character-wise cross-entropy loss, which is specifically designed to work with the sequential nature of text data. Our writer-adaptive MetaHTR framework can be easily implemented on the top of most state-of-the-art HTR models. Experiments show an average performance gain of 5-7% can be obtained by observing very few new style data",

However, these works either suffer from unrealistic artifacts, or cannot provide sufficiently high frame rate. In this paper, we present a convolutional recurrent neural network which takes a sequence of neighboring events to reconstruct high speed HDR videos, and temporal consistency is well considered to facilitate the training process.

Unlike convolutions which are inherently parallel, the de-facto standard for NMS, namely GreedyNMS, cannot be easily parallelized and thus could be the performance bottleneck in convolutional object detection pipelines. MaxpoolNMS is introduced as a parallelizable alternative to GreedyNMS, which in turn enables faster speed than GreedyNMS at comparable accuracy. However, MaxpoolNMS is only capable of replacing the GreedyNMS at the first stage of two-stage detectors like Faster-RCNN. There is a significant drop in accuracy when applying MaxpoolNMS at the final detection stage, due to the fact that MaxpoolNMS fails to approximate GreedyNMS precisely in terms of bounding box selection. In this paper, we propose a general, parallelizable and configurable approach PSRR-MaxpoolNMS, to completely replace GreedyNMS at all stages in all detectors. By introducing a simple Relationship Recovery module and a Pyramid Shifted MaxpoolNMS module, our PSRR-MaxpoolNMS is able to approximate GreedyNMS more precisely than MaxpoolNMS. Comprehensive experiments show that our approach outperforms MaxpoolNMS by a large margin, and it is proven faster than GreedyNMS with comparable accuracy.

Recent works have achieved surprisingly high retrieval accuracy on city-scale datasets. However, these results rely on the assumption that there exists a reference image exactly centered at the location of any query image, which is not applicable for practical scenarios. In this paper, we redefine this problem with a more realistic assumption that the query image can be arbitrary in the area of interest and the reference images are captured before the queries emerge. This assumption breaks the one-to-one retrieval setting of existing datasets as the queries and reference images are not perfectly aligned pairs, and there may be multiple reference images covering one query location. To bridge the gap between this realistic setting and existing datasets, we propose a new large-scale benchmark --VIGOR-- for cross-View Image Geo-localization beyond One-to-one Retrieval. We benchmark existing state-of-the-art methods and propose a novel end-to-end framework to localize the query in a coarse-to-fine manner. Apart from the image-level retrieval accuracy, we also evaluate the localization accuracy in terms of the actual distance (meters) using the raw GPS data.

Among these, stands out the Neural radiance fields (NeRF), which trains a deep network to map 5D input coordinates (representing spatial location and viewing direction) into a volume density and view-dependent emitted radiance. However, despite achieving an unprecedented level of photorealism on the generated images, NeRF is only applicable to static scenes, where the same spatial location can be queried from different images. In this paper we introduce D-NeRF, a method that extends neural radiance fields to a dynamic domain, allowing to reconstruct and render novel images of objects under rigid and non-rigid motions. For this purpose we consider time as an additional input to the system, and split the learning process in two main stages: one that encodes the scene into a canonical space and another that maps this canonical representation into the deformed scene at a particular time. Both mappings are learned using fully-connected networks. Once the networks are trained, D-NeRF can render novel images, controlling both the camera view and the time variable, and thus, the object movement. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on scenes with objects under rigid, articulated and non-rigid motions",

Our contributions are as follows: (1) we demonstrate the ability to leverage large quantities of continuous signing videos with weakly-aligned subtitles to localise signs in continuous sign language; (2) we employ the learned attention to automatically generate hundreds of thousands of annotations for a large sign vocabulary; (3) we collect a set of 37K manually verified sign instances across a vocabulary of 950 sign classes to support our study of sign language recognition; (4) by training on the newly annotated data from our method, we outperform the prior state of the art on the BSL-1K sign language recognition benchmark",

    "abstract": "Semantic segmentation models gain robustness against poor lighting conditions by virtue of complementary information from visible (RGB) and thermal images. Despite its importance, most existing RGB-T semantic segmentation models perform primitive fusion strategies, such as concatenation, element-wise summation and weighted summation, to fuse features from different modalities. These strategies, unfortunately, overlook the modality differences due to different imaging mechanisms, so that they suffer from the reduced discriminability of the fused features. To address such an issue, we propose, for the first time, the strategy of bridging-then-fusing, where the innovation lies in a novel Adaptive-weighted Bi-directional Modality Difference Reduction Network (ABMDRNet). Concretely, a Modality Difference Reduction and Fusion (MDRF) subnetwork is designed, which first employs a bi-directional image-to-image translation based method to reduce the modality differences between RGB features and thermal features, and then adaptively selects those discriminative multi-modality features for RGB-T semantic segmentation in a channel-wise weighted fusion way. Furthermore, considering the importance of contextual information in semantic segmentation, a Multi-Scale Spatial Context (MSC) module and a Multi-Scale Channel Context (MCC) module are proposed to exploit the interactions among multi-scale contextual information of cross-modality features together with their long-range dependencies along spatial and channel dimensions, respectively. Comprehensive experiments on MFNet dataset demonstrate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art results",

Traditionally the direct regression formulation is considered and the uncertainty is modeled by modifying the output space to a certain family of probabilistic distributions. On the other hand, classification based regression and ranking based solutions are more popular in practice while the direct regression methods suffer from the limited performance. How to model the uncertainty within the present-day technologies for regression remains an open issue. In this paper, we propose to learn probabilistic ordinal embeddings which represent each data as a multivariate Gaussian distribution rather than a deterministic point in the latent space. An ordinal distribution constraint is proposed to exploit the ordinal nature of regression. Our probabilistic ordinal embeddings can be integrated into popular regression approaches and empower them with the ability of uncertainty estimation.

We propose StyleMix and StyleCutMix as the first mixup method that separately manipulates the content and style information of input image pairs. By carefully mixing up the content and style of images, we can create more abundant and robust samples, which eventually enhance the generalization of the model training. We also develop an automatic scheme to decide the degree of style mixing according to the pair's class distance, to prevent messy mixed images from too differently styled pairs. Our experiments on CIFAR-100, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet datasets show that StyleMix achieves comparable performance to state of the art mixup methods and learns more robust classifiers to adversarial attacks",

We enhance the single-frame grounding accuracy by semantic attention learning and improve the cross-frame grounding consistency with co-grounding feature learning. Semantic attention learning explicitly parses referring cues in different attributes to reduce the ambiguity in the complex expression. Co-grounding feature learning boosts visual feature representations by integrating temporal correlation to reduce the ambiguity caused by scene dynamics.

As they generalize the operations of classical CNNs on grids to arbitrary topologies, GNNs also bring much of the implementation challenges of their Euclidean counterparts. Model size, memory footprint, and energy consumption are common concerns for many real-world applications. Network binarization allocates a single bit to parameters and activations, thus dramatically reducing the memory requirements (up to 32x compared to single-precision floating-point numbers) and maximizing the benefits of fast SIMD instructions on modern hardware for measurable speedups. However, in spite of the large body of work on binarization for classical CNNs, this area remains largely unexplored in geometric deep learning. In this paper, we present and evaluate different strategies for the binarization of graph neural networks. We show that through careful design of the models, and control of the training process, binary graph neural networks can be trained at only a moderate cost in accuracy on challenging benchmarks. In particular, we present the first dynamic graph neural network in Hamming space, able to leverage efficient k-NN search on binary vectors to speed-up the construction of the dynamic graph.

While the GFLOPs of a 3D CNN can be decreased by reducing the temporal feature resolution within the network, there is no setting that is optimal for all input clips. In this work, we therefore introduce a differentiable Similarity Guided Sampling (SGS) module, which can be plugged into any existing 3D CNN architecture. SGS empowers 3D CNNs by learning the similarity of temporal features and grouping similar features together. As a result, the temporal feature resolution is not anymore static but it varies for each input video clip. By integrating SGS as an additional layer within current 3D CNNs, we can convert them into much more efficient 3D CNNs with adaptive temporal feature resolutions (ATFR). Our evaluations show that the proposed module improves the state-of-the-art by reducing the computational cost (GFLOPs) by half while preserving or even improving the accuracy.

To overcome these limitations, we reformulate AutoAugment as a generalized automated dataset optimization (AutoDO) task that minimizes the distribution shift between test data and distorted train dataset.

    "abstract": "Forecasting Parapapillary atrophy (PPA), i.e., a symptom related to most irreversible eye diseases, provides an alarm for implementing an intervention to slow down the disease progression at early stage. A key question for this forecast is: how to fully utilize the historical data (e.g., retinal image) up to the current stage for future disease prediction? In this paper, we provide an answer with a novel framework, namely Disease Forecast via Progression Learning (DFPL), which exploits the irreversibility prior (i.e., cannot be reversed once diagnosed). Specifically, based on this prior, we decompose two factors that contribute to the prediction of the future disease: i) the current disease label given the data (retinal image, clinical attributes) at present and ii) the future disease label given the progression of the retinal images that from the current to the future. To model these two factors, we introduce the current and progression predictors in DFPL, respectively. In order to account for the degree of progression of the disease, we propose a temporal generative model to accurately generate the future image and compare it with the current one to get a residual image. The generative model is implemented by a recurrent neural network, in order to exploit the dependency of the historical data. To verify our approach, we apply it to a PPA in-house dataset and it yields a significant improvement (e.g., 4.48% of accuracy; 3.45% of AUC) over others. Besides, our generative model can accurately localize the disease-related regions",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The success of supervised learning crucially hinges on the assumption that training data matches test data, which rarely holds in practice due to potential distribution shift. In light of this, most existing methods for unsupervised domain adaptation focus on achieving domain-invariant representations and small source domain error. However, recent works have shown that this is not sufficient to guarantee good generalization on target domain and in fact is provably detrimental under label distribution shift. Furthermore, in many real-world applications it is often feasible to obtain a small amount of labeled data from the target domain and use them to facilitate model training with source data. Inspired by the above observations, in this paper we propose the first method that aims to simultaneously learn invariant representations and risks under the setting of semi-supervised domain adaptation (Semi-DA). To start with, we first give a finite sample bound for both classification and regression problems under Semi-DA. The bound suggests a principled way for target generalization by aligning both the marginal and conditional distributions across domains in feature space. Motivated by this, we then introduce our LIRR algorithm for jointly Learning Invariant Representations and Risks. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on both classification and regression tasks to demonstrate the effectiveness of LIRR. Compared with methods that only learn invariant representations or invariant risks, LIRR achieves significant improvements",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Various combinations of cameras enrich computational photography, among which reference-based superresolution (RefSR) plays a critical role in multiscale imaging systems. However, existing RefSR approaches fail to accomplish high-fidelity super-resolution under a large resolution gap, e.g., 8x upscaling, due to the lower consideration of the underlying scene structure. In this paper, we aim to solve the RefSR problem in actual multiscale camera systems inspired by multiplane image (MPI) representation. Specifically, we propose Cross-MPI, an end-to-end RefSR network composed of a novel plane-aware attention-based MPI mechanism, a multiscale guided upsampling module as well as a super-resolution (SR) synthesis and fusion module. Instead of using a direct and exhaustive matching between the cross-scale stereo, the proposed plane-aware attention mechanism fully utilizes the concealed scene structure for efficient attention-based correspondence searching. Further combined with a gentle coarse-to-fine guided upsampling strategy, the proposed Cross-MPI can achieve a robust and accurate detail transmission. Experimental results on both digitally synthesized and optical zoom cross-scale data show that the Cross-MPI framework can achieve superior performance against the existing RefSR methods and is a real fit for actual multiscale camera systems even with large-scale differences",

NCA learns to grow an image starting from a fixed single pixel. In this work, we show that the neural network (NN) architecture of the NCA can be encapsulated in a larger NN. This allows us to propose a new model that encodes a manifold of NCA, each of them capable of generating a distinct image. Therefore, we are effectively learning an embedding space of CA, which shows generalization capabilities. We accomplish this by introducing dynamic convolutions inside an Auto-Encoder architecture, for the first time used to join two different sources of information, the encoding and cell's environment information. In biological terms, our approach would play the role of the transcription factors, modulating the mapping of genes into specific proteins that drive cellular differentiation, which occurs right before the morphogenesis. We thoroughly evaluate our approach in a dataset of synthetic emojis and also in real images of CIFAR-10. Our model introduces a general-purpose network, which can be used in a broad range of problems beyond image generation",

However, previous works based on dense undirected interaction suffer from modeling superfluous interactions and neglect of trajectory motion tendency, and thus inevitably result in a considerable deviance from the reality. To cope with these issues, we present a Sparse Graph Convolution Network (SGCN) for pedestrian trajectory prediction. Specifically, the SGCN explicitly models the sparse directed interaction with a sparse directed spatial graph to capture adaptive interaction pedestrians. Meanwhile, we use a sparse directed temporal graph to model the motion tendency, thus to facilitate the prediction based on the observed direction. Finally, parameters of a bi-Gaussian distribution for trajectory prediction are estimated by fusing the above two sparse graphs. We evaluate our proposed method on the ETH and UCY datasets, and the experimental results show our method outperforms comparative state-of-the-art methods by 9% in Average Displacement Error (ADE) and 13% in Final Displacement Error (FDE). Notably, visualizations indicate that our method can capture adaptive interactions between pedestrians and their effective motion tendencies",

    "abstract": "The basic framework of depth completion is to predict a pixel-wise dense depth map using very sparse input data. In this paper, we try to solve this problem in a more effective way, by reformulating the regression-based depth estimation problem into a combination of depth plane classification and residual regression. Our proposed approach is to initially densify sparse depth information by figuring out which plane a pixel should lie among a number of discretized depth planes, and then calculate the final depth value by predicting the distance from the specified plane. This will help the network to lessen the burden of directly regressing the absolute depth information from none, and to effectively obtain more accurate depth prediction result with less computation power and inference time. To do so, we firstly introduce a novel way of interpreting depth information with the closest depth plane label p and a residual value r, as we call it, Plane-Residual (PR) representation. We also propose a depth completion network utilizing PR representation consisting of a shared encoder and two decoders, where one classifies the pixel's depth plane label, while the other one regresses the normalized distance from the classified depth plane. By interpreting depth information in PR representation and using our corresponding depth completion network, we were able to acquire improved depth completion performance with faster computation, compared to previous approaches",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "A general approach for handling hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising issue is to impose weights on different HSI pixels to suppress negative influence brought by noisy elements. Such weighting scheme, however, largely depends on the prior understanding or subjective distribution assumption on HSI noises, making them easily biased to complicated real noises, and hardly generalizable to diverse practical scenarios. Against this issue, this paper proposes a new scheme aiming to capture general weighting principle in a data-driven manner. Specifically, such weighting principle is delivered by an explicit function, called hyperweight-net (HWnet), mapping from an input noisy image to its properly imposed weights. A Bayesian framework, as well as a variational inference algorithm, for inferring HWnet parameters is elaborately designed, expecting to extract the latent weighting rule for general diverse and complicated noisy HSIs. Comprehensive experiments substantiate that the learned HWnet can be not only finely generalized to different noise types from those used in training, but also effectively transferred to other weighted models for the issue. Besides, as a sounder guidance, HWnet can help to more faithfully and robustly achieve deep hyperspectral prior(DHP). Specially, the extracted weights by HWnet are verified to be able to effectively capture complex noise knowledge underlying input HSI, revealing its working insight in experiments",

In parallel, primitive-based methods seek to represent objects as semantically consistent part arrangements.

We address the trade-off between reconstruction quality and number of parts with Neural Parts, a novel 3D primitive representation that defines primitives using an Invertible Neural Network (INN) which implements homeomorphic mappings between a sphere and the target object. The INN allows us to compute the inverse mapping of the homeomorphism, which in turn, enables the efficient computation of both the implicit surface function of a primitive and its mesh, without any additional post-processing. Our model learns to parse 3D objects into semantically consistent part arrangements without any part-level supervision.Evaluations on ShapeNet, D-FAUST and FreiHAND demonstrate that our primitives can capture complex geometries and thus simultaneously achieve geometrically accurate as well as interpretable reconstructions using an order of magnitude fewer primitives than state-of-the-art shape abstraction methods",

To tackle this problem, we present point-voxel correlation fields, which capture both local and long-range dependencies of point pairs. To capture point-based correlations, we adopt the K-Nearest Neighbors search that preserves fine-grained information in the local region. By voxelizing point clouds in a multi-scale manner, we construct pyramid correlation voxels to model long-range correspondences. Integrating these two types of correlations, our PV-RAFT makes use of all-pairs relations to handle both small and large displacements.

Analyzing contrastive SSL methods shows that they have poor visual grounding and receive poor supervisory signal when trained on scene images. We propose Contrast Attention-Supervised Tuning (CAST) to overcome these limitations. CAST uses unsupervised saliency maps to intelligently sample crops, and to provide grounding supervision via a Grad-CAM attention loss. Experiments on COCO show that CAST significantly improves the features learned by SSL methods on scene images, and further experiments show that CAST-trained models are more robust to changes in backgrounds.

It is paramount to develop a prediction model that can exploit the contextual information in both static and dynamic environments surrounding the target agent and generate diverse trajectory samples that are meaningful in a traffic context. We propose a novel prediction model, referred to as the lane-aware prediction (LaPred) network, which uses the instance-level lane entities extracted from a semantic map to predict the multimodal future trajectories. For each lane candidate found in the neighborhood of the target agent, LaPred extracts the joint features relating the lane and the trajectories of the neighboring agents. Then, the features for all lane candidates are fused with the attention weights learned through a self-supervised learning task that identifies the lane candidate likely to be followed by the target agent. Using the instance-level lane information, LaPred can produce the trajectories compliant with the surroundings better than 2D raster image-based methods and generate the diverse future trajectories given multiple lane candidates. The experiments conducted on the public nuScenes dataset and Argoverse dataset demonstrate that the proposed LaPred method significantly outperforms the existing prediction models, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the benchmarks",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We present a novel framework named NeuralRecon for real-time 3D scene reconstruction from a monocular video. Unlike previous methods that estimate single-view depth maps separately on each key-frame and fuse them later, we propose to directly reconstruct local surfaces represented as sparse TSDF volumes for each video fragment sequentially by a neural network. A learning-based TSDF fusion module based on gated recurrent units is used to guide the network to fuse features from previous fragments. This design allows the network to capture local smoothness prior and global shape prior of 3D surfaces when sequentially reconstructing the surfaces, resulting in accurate, coherent, and real-time surface reconstruction. The experiments on ScanNet and 7-Scenes datasets show that our system outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and speed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first learning-based system that is able to reconstruct dense coherent 3D geometry in real-time.

    "abstract": "While accurate lip synchronization has been achieved for arbitrary-subject audio-driven talking face generation, the problem of how to efficiently drive the head pose remains. Previous methods rely on pre-estimated structural information such as landmarks and 3D parameters, aiming to generate personalized rhythmic movements. However, the inaccuracy of such estimated information under extreme conditions would lead to degradation problems. In this paper, we propose a clean yet effective framework to generate pose-controllable talking faces. We operate on non-aligned raw face images, using only a single photo as an identity reference. The key is to modularize audio-visual representations by devising an implicit low-dimension pose code. Substantially, both speech content and head pose information lie in a joint non-identity embedding space. While speech content information can be defined by learning the intrinsic synchronization between audio-visual modalities, we identify that a pose code will be complementarily learned in a modulated convolution-based reconstruction framework. Extensive experiments show that our method generates accurately lip-synced talking faces whose poses are controllable by other videos. Moreover, our model has multiple advanced capabilities including extreme view robustness and talking face frontalization",

To effectively take the user's intent into account, a novel difference-aware module is proposed to learn how to properly fuse the masks before and after each interaction, which are aligned with the target frames by employing the space-time memory. We evaluate our method both qualitatively and quantitatively with different forms of user interactions (e.g., scribbles, clicks) on DAVIS to show that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art algorithms while requiring fewer frame interactions, with the additional advantage in generalizing to different types of user interactions.

    "abstract": "Establishing dense correspondences between a pair of images is an important and general problem. However, dense flow estimation is often inaccurate in the case of large displacements or homogeneous regions. For most applications and down-stream tasks, such as pose estimation, image manipulation, or 3D reconstruction, it is crucial to know when and where to trust the estimated matches. In this work, we aim to estimate a dense flow field relating two images, coupled with a robust pixel-wise confidence map indicating the reliability and accuracy of the prediction. We develop a flexible probabilistic approach that jointly learns the flow prediction and its uncertainty. In particular, we parametrize the predictive distribution as a constrained mixture model, ensuring better modelling of both accurate flow predictions and outliers. Moreover, we develop an architecture and training strategy tailored for robust and generalizable uncertainty prediction in the context of self-supervised training. Our approach obtains state-of-the-art results on multiple challenging geometric matching and optical flow datasets. We further validate the usefulness of our probabilistic confidence estimation for the task of pose estimation. Code and models are available at https://github.com/PruneTruong/PDCNet",

While previous work has focused on dialogue policy optimization and visual-linguistic information fusion, most work learns the vision-linguistic encoding for the three agents solely on the GuessWhat?! dataset without shared and prior knowledge of vision-linguistic representation. To bridge these gaps, this paper proposes new Oracle, Guesser and Questioner models that take advantage of a pretrained vision-linguistic model, VilBert. For Oracle model, we introduce a two-way background/target fusion mechanism to understand both intra and inter-object questions. For Guesser model, we introduce a state-estimator that best utilizes Vilbert's strength in single-turn referring expression comprehension. For the Questioner, we share the state-estimator from pretrained Guesser with Questioner to guide the question generator.

    "abstract": "A practical low-light enhancement solution must be computationally fast, memory-efficient, and achieve a visually appealing restoration. Most of the existing methods target restoration quality and thus compromise on speed and memory requirements, raising concerns about their real-world deployability. We propose a new deep learning architecture for extreme low-light single image restoration, which is exceptionally lightweight, remarkably fast, and produces a restoration that is perceptually at par with state-of-the-art computationally intense models. To achieve this, we do most of the processing in the higher scale-spaces, skipping the intermediate-scales wherever possible. Also unique to our model is the potential to process all the scale-spaces concurrently, offering an additional 30% speedup without compromising the restoration quality. Pre-amplification of the dark raw-image is an important step in extreme low-light image enhancement. Most of the existing state-of-the-art methods need GT exposure value to estimate the pre-amplification factor, which is not practically feasible. Thus, we propose an amplifier module that estimates the amplification factor using only the input raw image and can be used \"off-the-shelf\"\" with pre-trained models without any fine-tuning. We show that our model can restore an ultra-high-definition 4K resolution image in just 1sec on a CPU and at 32fps on a GPU and yet maintain a competitive restoration quality.

These summaries include contextual and semantic information describing the important high-level details (what, where, who and how) of the observed event and exclude background information that is deemed unimportant to the observer. With this in mind, the descriptions people generate for videos of different dynamic events can greatly improve our understanding of the key information of interest in each video. These descriptions can be captured in captions that provide expanded attributes for video labeling (e.g. actions/objects/scenes/sentiment/etc.) while allowing us to gain new insight into what people find important or necessary to summarize specific events. Existing caption datasets for video understanding are either small in scale or restricted to a specific domain. To address this, we present the Spoken Moments (S-MiT) dataset of 500k spoken captions each attributed to a unique short video depicting a broad range of different events. We collect our descriptions using audio recordings to ensure that they remain as natural and concise as possible while allowing us to scale the size of a large classification dataset. In order to utilize our proposed dataset, we present a novel Adaptive Mean Margin (AMM) approach to contrastive learning and evaluate our models on video/caption retrieval on multiple datasets.

In this paper, we propose a new Unbiased Mean Teacher (UMT) model for cross-domain object detection. We reveal that there often exists a considerable model bias for the simple mean teacher (MT) model in cross-domain scenarios, and eliminate the model bias with several simple yet highly effective strategies. In particular, for the teacher model, we propose a cross-domain distillation for MT to maximally exploit the expertise of the teacher model. Second, for the student model, we also alleviate its bias by augmenting training samples with pixel-level adaptation. Finally, for the teaching process, we employ an out-of-distribution estimation strategy to select samples that most fit the current model to further enhance the cross-domain distillation process.

    "abstract": "Perhaps surprisingly sewerage infrastructure is one of the most costly infrastructures in modern society. Sewer pipes are manually inspected to determine whether the pipes are defective. However, this process is limited by the number of qualified inspectors and the time it takes to inspect a pipe. Automatization of this process is therefore of high interest. So far, the success of computer vision approaches for sewer defect classification has been limited when compared to the success in other fields mainly due to the lack of public datasets. To this end, in this work we present a large novel and publicly available multi-label classification dataset for image-based sewer defect classification called Sewer-ML. The Sewer-ML dataset consists of 1.3 million images annotated by professional sewer inspectors from three different utility companies across nine years. Together with the dataset, we also present a benchmark algorithm and a novel metric for assessing performance. The benchmark algorithm is a result of evaluating 12 state-of-the-art algorithms, six from the sewer defect classification domain and six from the multi-label classification domain, and combining the best performing algorithms. The novel metric is a class-importance weighted F2 score, F2-CIW, reflecting the economic impact of each class, used together with the normal pipe F1 score, F1-Normal. The benchmark algorithm achieves an F2-CIW score of 55.11% and F1-Normal score of 90.94%, leaving ample room for improvement on the Sewer-ML dataset.

    "abstract": "We propose Joint-DetNAS, a unified NAS framework for object detection, which integrates 3 key components: Neural Architecture Search, pruning, and Knowledge Distillation. Instead of naively pipelining these techniques, our Joint-DetNAS optimizes them jointly. The algorithm consists of two core processes: student morphism optimizes the student's architecture and removes the redundant parameters, while dynamic distillation aims to find the optimal matching teacher. For student morphism, weight inheritance strategy is adopted, allowing the student to flexibly update its architecture while fully utilize the predecessor's weights, which considerably accelerates the search; To facilitate dynamic distillation, an elastic teacher pool is trained via integrated progressive shrinking strategy, from which teacher detectors can be sampled without additional cost in subsequent searches. Given a base detector as the input, our algorithm directly outputs the derived student detector with high performance without additional training. Experiments demonstrate that our Joint-DetNAS outperforms the naive pipelining approach by a great margin. Given a classic R101-FPN as the base detector, Joint-DetNAS is able to boost its mAP from 41.4 to 43.9 on MS COCO and reduce the latency by 47%, which is on par with the SOTA EfficientDet while requiring less search cost.

    "abstract": "3D object detection in point clouds is a challenging vision task that benefits various applications for understanding the 3D visual world. Lots of recent research focuses on how to exploit end-to-end trainable Hough voting for generating object proposals. However, the current voting strategy can only receive partial votes from the surfaces of potential objects together with severe outlier votes from the cluttered backgrounds, which hampers full utilization of the information from the input point clouds. Inspired by the back-tracing strategy in the conventional Hough voting methods, in this work, we introduce a new 3D object detection method, named as Back-tracing Representative Points Network (BRNet), which generatively back-traces the representative points from the vote centers and also revisits complementary seed points around these generated points, so as to better capture the fine local structural features surrounding the potential objects from the raw point clouds. Therefore, this bottom-up and then top-down strategy in our BRNet enforces mutual consistency between the predicted vote centers and the raw surface points and thus achieves more reliable and flexible object localization and class prediction results. Our BRNet is simple but effective, which significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on two large-scale point cloud datasets, ScanNet V2 (+7.5% in terms of mAP@0.50) and SUN RGB-D (+4.7% in terms of mAP@0.50), while it is still lightweight and efficient",

In this paper, we focus on speeding-up the high-resolution photorealistic I2IT tasks based on closed-form Laplacian pyramid decomposition and reconstruction. Specifically, we reveal that the attribute transformations, such as illumination and color manipulation, relate more to the low-frequency component, while the content details can be adaptively refined on high-frequency components. We consequently propose a Laplacian Pyramid Translation Network (LPTN) to simultaneously perform these two tasks, where we design a lightweight network for translating the low-frequency component with reduced resolution and a progressive masking strategy to efficiently refine the high-frequency ones. Our model avoids most of the heavy computation consumed by processing high-resolution feature maps and faithfully preserves the image details.

Recent methods typically develop sophisticated pipelines to tackle this task. Here, we propose a new video instance segmentation framework built upon Transformers, termed VisTR, which views the VIS task as a direct end-to-end parallel sequence decoding/prediction problem. Given a video clip consisting of multiple image frames as input, VisTR outputs the sequence of masks for each instance in the video in order directly. At the core is a new, effective instance sequence matching and segmentation strategy, which supervises and segments instances at the sequence level as a whole. VisTR frames the instance segmentation and tracking in the same perspective of similarity learning, thus considerably simplifying the overall pipeline and is significantly different from existing approaches. Without bells and whistles, VisTR achieves the highest speed among all existing VIS models, and achieves the best result among methods using single model on the YouTube-VIS dataset. For the first time, we demonstrate a much simpler and faster video instance segmentation framework achieving competitive accuracy. We hope that VisTR can motivate future research for more video understanding tasks. Code is available at: https://git.io/VisTR",

Then, in the entropy coding stage, we propose a voxel context based deep entropy model to compress the symbols of non-leaf nodes in a lossless way. Furthermore, for dynamic point cloud compression, we additionally introduce the local voxel representations from the temporal neighbouring point clouds to exploit temporal dependency. More importantly, to alleviate the distortion from the octree construction procedure, we propose a voxel context based 3D coordinate refinement method to produce more accurate reconstructed point cloud at the decoder side, which is applicable to both static and dynamic point cloud compression.

    "abstract": "The presence of label noise often misleads the training of deep neural networks. Departing from the recent literature which largely assumes the label noise rate is only determined by the true label class, the errors in human-annotated labels are more likely to be dependent on the difficulty levels of tasks, resulting in settings with instance-dependent label noise. We first provide evidences that the heterogeneous instance-dependent label noise is effectively down-weighting the examples with higher noise rates in a non-uniform way and thus causes imbalances, rendering the strategy of directly applying methods for class-dependent label noise questionable. Built on a recent work peer loss [24], we then propose and study the potentials of a second-order approach that leverages the estimation of several covariance terms defined between the instance-dependent noise rates and the Bayes optimal label. We show that this set of second-order statistics successfully captures the induced imbalances. We further proceed to show that with the help of the estimated second-order statistics, we identify a new loss function whose expected risk of a classifier under instance-dependent label noise is equivalent to a new problem with only class-dependent label noise. This fact allows us to apply existing solutions to handle this better-studied setting. We provide an efficient procedure to estimate these second-order statistics without accessing either ground truth labels or prior knowledge of the noise rates. Experiments on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 with synthetic instance-dependent label noise and Clothing1M with real-world human label noise verify our approach.

It has been studied widely by domain randomization that transfers source images to different styles in spatial space for learning domain-agnostic features. However, most existing randomization methods use GANs that often lack of controls and even alter semantic structures of images undesirably. Inspired by the idea of JPEG that converts spatial images into multiple frequency components (FCs), we propose Frequency Space Domain Randomization (FSDR) that randomizes images in frequency space by keeping domain-invariant FCs (DIFs) and randomizing domain-variant FCs (DVFs) only. FSDR has two unique features: 1) it decomposes images into DIFs and DVFs which allows explicit access and manipulation of them and more controllable randomization; 2) it has minimal effects on semantic structures of images and domain-invariant features. We examined domain variance and invariance property of FCs statistically and designed a network that can identify and fuse DIFs and DVFs dynamically through iterative learning. Extensive experiments over multiple domain generalizable segmentation tasks show that FSDR achieves superior segmentation and its performance is even on par with domain adaptation methods that access target data in training",

This framework is similar to the two-stage object detector Faster RCNN, and can solve the MOT problem in a data-driven way. For proposal generation, we propose an iterative graph clustering method to reduce the computational cost while maintaining the quality of the generated proposals. For proposal scoring, we deploy a trainable graph-convolutional-network (GCN) to learn the structural patterns of the generated proposals and rank them according to the estimated quality scores. For trajectory inference, a simple deoverlapping strategy is adopted to generate tracking output while complying with the constraints that no detection can be assigned to more than one track.

Recently, how to detect such forgery contents has become a hot research topic and many deepfake detection methods have been proposed. Most of them model deepfake detection as a vanilla binary classification problem, i.e, first use a backbone network to extract a global feature and then feed it into a binary classifier (real/fake). But since the difference between the real and fake images in this task is often subtle and local, we argue this vanilla solution is not optimal. In this paper, we instead formulate deepfake detection as a fine-grained classification problem and propose a new multi-attentional deepfake detection network. Specifically, it consists of three key components: 1) multiple spatial attention heads to make the network attend to different local parts; 2) textural feature enhancement block to zoom in the subtle artifacts in shallow features; 3) aggregate the low-level textural feature and high-level semantic features guided by the attention maps. Moreover, to address the learning difficulty of this network, we further introduce a new regional independence loss and an attention guided data augmentation strategy.

To address this problem, we propose two simultaneous cycle transformations between the latent spaces of complete shapes and incomplete ones. Specifically, the first cycle transforms shapes from incomplete domain to complete domain, and then projects them back to the incomplete domain. This process learns the geometric characteristic of complete shapes, and maintains the shape consistency between the complete prediction and the incomplete input. Similarly, the inverse cycle transformation starts from complete domain to incomplete domain, and goes back to complete domain to learn the characteristic of incomplete shapes.

This issue is further aggravated in CSS where, at each step, old classes from previous iterations are collapsed into the background. In this paper, we propose Local POD, a multi-scale pooling distillation scheme that preserves long- and short-range spatial relationships at feature level. Furthermore, we design an entropy-based pseudo-labelling of the background w.r.t. classes predicted by the old model to deal with background shift and avoid catastrophic forgetting of the old classes.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "For unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), to alleviate the effect of domain shift, many approaches align the source and target domains in the feature space by adversarial learning or by explicitly aligning their statistics. However, the optimization objective of such domain alignment is generally not coordinated with that of the object classification task itself such that their descent directions for optimization may be inconsistent. This will reduce the effectiveness of domain alignment in improving the performance of UDA. In this paper, we aim to study and alleviate the optimization inconsistency problem between the domain alignment and classification tasks. We address this by proposing an effective meta-optimization based strategy dubbed MetaAlign, where we treat the domain alignment objective and the classification objective as the meta-train and meta-test tasks in a meta-learning scheme. MetaAlign encourages both tasks to be optimized in a coordinated way, which maximizes the inner product of the gradients of the two tasks during training. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method on top of various alignment-based baseline approaches, for tasks of object classification and object detection. MetaAlign helps achieve the state-of-the-art performance",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Prototype-based methods use interpretable representations to address the black-box nature of deep learning models, in contrast to post-hoc explanation methods that only approximate such models. We propose the Neural Prototype Tree (ProtoTree), an intrinsically interpretable deep learning method for fine-grained image recognition. ProtoTree combines prototype learning with decision trees, and thus results in a globally interpretable model by design. Additionally, ProtoTree can locally explain a single prediction by outlining a decision path through the tree. Each node in our binary tree contains a trainable prototypical part. The presence or absence of this learned prototype in an image determines the routing through a node. Decision making is therefore similar to human reasoning: Does the bird have a red throat? And an elongated beak? Then it's a hummingbird! We tune the accuracy-interpretability trade-off using ensemble methods, pruning and binarizing. We apply pruning without sacrificing accuracy, resulting in a small tree with only 8 learned prototypes along a path to classify a bird from 200 species. An ensemble of 5 ProtoTrees achieves competitive accuracy on the CUB-200- 2011 and Stanford Cars data sets. Code is available at https://github.com/M-Nauta/ProtoTree",

    "abstract": "Transductive zero-shot learning (T-ZSL) which could alleviate the domain shift problem in existing ZSL works, has received much attention recently. However, an open problem in T-ZSL: how to effectively make use of unseen-class samples for training, still remains. Addressing this problem, we first empirically analyze the roles of unseen-class samples with different degrees of hardness in the training process based on the uneven prediction phenomenon found in many ZSL methods, resulting in three observations. Then, we propose two hardness sampling approaches for selecting a subset of diverse and hard samples from a given unseen-class dataset according to these observations. The first one identifies the samples based on the class-level frequency of the model predictions while the second enhances the former by normalizing the class frequency via an approximate class prior estimated by an explored prior estimation algorithm. Finally, we design a new Self-Training framework with Hardness Sampling for T-ZSL, called STHS, where an arbitrary inductive ZSL method could be seamlessly embedded and it is iteratively trained with unseen-class samples selected by the hardness sampling approach. We introduce two typical ZSL methods into the STHS framework and extensive experiments demonstrate that the derived T-ZSL methods outperform many state-of-the-art methods on three public benchmarks. Besides, we note that the unseen-class dataset is separately used for training in some existing transductive generalized ZSL (T-GZSL) methods, which is not strict for a GZSL task. Hence, we suggest a more strict T-GZSL data setting and establish a competitive baseline on this setting by introducing the proposed STHS framework to T-GZSL",

In this paper, we extend Sinkhorn divergence in Euclidean space to the reproducing kernel Hilbert space, which we term \"Hilbert Sinkhorn divergence\" (HSD).In particular, we can use kernel matrices to derive a closed form expression of HSD that is proved to be a tractable convex optimization problem. We also prove several attractive statistical properties of the proposed HSD, i.e., strong consistency, asymptotic behavior and sample complexity.

To help address this deficit and develop novel computer vision methods for time series data, we present the Multi-Temporal Urban Development SpaceNet (MUDS, also known as SpaceNet 7) dataset. This open source dataset consists of medium resolution (4.0m) satellite imagery mosaics, which includes 24 images (one per month) covering >100 unique geographies, and comprises >40,000 km2 of imagery and exhaustive polygon labels of building footprints therein, totaling over 11M individual annotations. Each building is assigned a unique identifier (i.e. address), which permits tracking of individual objects over time. Label fidelity exceeds image resolution; this \"omniscient labeling\" is a unique feature of the dataset, and enables surprisingly precise algorithmic models to be crafted. We demonstrate methods to track building footprint construction (or demolition) over time, thereby directly assessing urbanization. Performance is measured with the newly developed SpaceNet Change and Object Tracking (SCOT) metric, which quantifies both object tracking as well as change detection. We demonstrate that despite the moderate resolution of the data, we are able to track individual building identifiers over time",

To address this, we present Neural Architecture-Recipe Search (NARS) to search both (a) architectures and (b) their corresponding training recipes, simultaneously. NARS utilizes an accuracy predictor that scores architecture and training recipes jointly, guiding both sample selection and ranking. Furthermore, to compensate for the enlarged search space, we leverage \"free\" architecture statistics (e.g., FLOP count) to pretrain the predictor, significantly improving its sample efficiency and prediction reliability. After training the predictor via constrained iterative optimization, we run fast evolutionary searches in just CPU minutes to generate architecture-recipe pairs for a variety of resource constraints, called FBNetV3. FBNetV3 makes up a family of state-of-the-art compact neural networks that outperform both automatically and manually-designed competitors. For example, FBNetV3 matches both EfficientNet and ResNeSt accuracy on ImageNet with up to 2.0x and 7.1x fewer FLOPs, respectively.

Our method is based on an autoencoder that disentangles composite image into reflectance and illumination for further separate harmonization. Specifically, we harmonize reflectance through material-consistency penalty, while harmonize illumination by learning and transferring light from background to foreground, moreover, we model patch relations between foreground and background of composite images in an inharmony-free learning way, to adaptively guide our intrinsic image harmonization.

    "abstract": "A deep facial attribute editing model strives to meet two requirements: (1) attribute correctness -- the target attribute should correctly appear on the edited face image; (2) irrelevance preservation -- any irrelevant information (e.g., identity) should not be changed after editing. Meeting both requirements challenges the state-of-the-art works which resort to either spatial attention or latent space factorization. Specifically, the former assume that each attribute has well-defined local support regions; they are often more effective for editing a local attribute than a global one. The latter factorize the latent space of a fixed pretrained GAN into different attribute-relevant parts, but they cannot be trained end-to-end with the GAN, leading to sub-optimal solutions. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel latent space factorization model, called L2M-GAN, which is learned end-to-end and effective for editing both local and global attributes. The key novel components are: (1) A latent space vector of the GAN is factorized into an attribute-relevant and irrelevant codes with an orthogonality constraint imposed to ensure disentanglement. (2) An attribute-relevant code transformer is learned to manipulate the attribute value; crucially, the transformed code are subject to the same orthogonality constraint. By forcing both the original attribute-relevant latent code and the edited code to be disentangled from any attribute-irrelevant code, our model strikes the perfect balance between attribute correctness and irrelevance preservation. Extensive experiments on CelebA-HQ show that our L2M-GAN achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-arts",

    "abstract": "We introduce the 'Incremental Implicitly-Refined Classification (IIRC)' setup, an extension to the class incremental learning setup where the incoming batches of classes have two granularity levels. i.e., each sample could have a high-level (coarse) label like 'bear' and a low-level (fine) label like 'polar bear'. Only one label is provided at a time, and the model has to figure out the other label if it has already learned it. This setup is more aligned with real-life scenarios, where a learner usually interacts with the same family of entities multiple times, discovers more granularity about them, while still trying not to forget previous knowledge. Moreover, this setup enables evaluating models for some important lifelong learning challenges that cannot be easily addressed under the existing setups. These challenges can be motivated by the example \"if a model was trained on the class 'bear' in one task and on 'polar bear' in another task, will it forget the concept of 'bear', will it rightfully infer that a 'polar bear' is still a 'bear'? and will it wrongfully associate the label of 'polar bear' to other breeds of 'bear'?\". We develop a standardized benchmark that enables evaluating models on the IIRC setup. We evaluate several state-of-the-art lifelong learning algorithms and highlight their strengths and limitations. For example, distillation-based methods perform relatively well but are prone to incorrectly predicting too many labels per image. We hope that the proposed setup, along with the benchmark, would provide a meaningful problem setting to the practitioners",

    "abstract": "Recently, Siamese-based trackers have achieved promising performance in visual tracking. Most recent Siamese-based trackers typically employ a depth-wise cross-correlation (DW-XCorr) to obtain multi-channel correlation information from the two feature maps (target and search region). However, DW-XCorr has several limitations within Siamese-based tracking: it can easily be fooled by distractors, has fewer activated channels, and provides weak discrimination of object boundaries. Further, DW-XCorr is a handcrafted parameter-free module and cannot fully benefit from offline learning on large-scale data. We propose a learnable module, called the asymmetric convolution (ACM), which learns to better capture the semantic correlation information in offline training on large-scale data. Different from DW-XCorr and its predecessor(XCorr), which regard a single feature map as the convolution kernel, our ACM decomposes the convolution operation on a concatenated feature map into two mathematically equivalent operations, thereby avoiding the need for the feature maps to be of the same size (width and height)during concatenation. Our ACM can incorporate useful prior information, such as bounding-box size, with standard visual features. Furthermore, ACM can easily be integrated into existing Siamese trackers based on DW-XCorror XCorr. To demonstrate its generalization ability, we integrate ACM into three representative trackers: SiamFC, SiamRPN++, and SiamBAN. Our experiments reveal the benefits of the proposed ACM, which outperforms existing methods on six tracking benchmarks. On the LaSOT test set, our ACM-based tracker obtains a significant improvement of 5.8% in terms of success (AUC), over the baseline",

    "abstract": "Perceptual organization remains one of the very few established theories on the human visual system. It underpinned many pre-deep seminal works on segmentation and detection, yet research has seen a rapid decline since the preferential shift to learning deep models. Of the limited attempts, most aimed at interpreting complex visual scenes using perceptual organizational rules. This has however been proven to be sub-optimal, since models were unable to effectively capture the visual complexity in real-world imagery. In this paper, we rejuvenate the study of perceptual organization, by advocating two positional changes: (i) we examine purposefully generated synthetic data, instead of complex real imagery, and (ii) we ask machines to synthesize novel perceptually-valid patterns, instead of explaining existing data. Our overall answer lies with the introduction of a novel visual challenge -- the challenge of perceptual question answering (PQA). Upon observing example perceptual question-answer pairs, the goal for PQA is to solve similar questions by generating answers entirely from scratch (see Figure 1). Our first contribution is therefore the first dataset of perceptual question-answer pairs, each generated specifically for a particular Gestalt principle. We then borrow insights from human psychology to design an agent that casts perceptual organization as a self-attention problem, where a proposed grid-to-grid mapping network directly generates answer patterns from scratch. Experiments show our agent to outperform a selection of naive and strong baselines. A human study however indicates that ours uses astronomically more data to learn when compared to an average human, necessitating future research (with or without our dataset)",

However, these methods are sensitive to outliers, which lead to more incorrect correspondences. In this paper, we propose a novel deep graph matching-based framework for point cloud registration. Specifically, we first transform point clouds into graphs and extract deep features for each point. Then, we develop a module based on deep graph matching to calculate a soft correspondence matrix. By using graph matching, not only the local geometry of each point but also its structure and topology in a larger range are considered in establishing correspondences, so that more correct correspondences are found. We train the network with a loss directly defined on the correspondences, and in the test stage the soft correspondences are transformed into hard one-to-one correspondences so that registration can be performed by singular value decomposition. Furthermore, we introduce a transformer-based method to generate edges for graph construction, which further improves the quality of the correspondences. Extensive experiments on registering clean, noisy, partial-to-partial and unseen category point clouds show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

    "abstract": "To date, most existing self-supervised learning methods are designed and optimized for image classification. These pre-trained models can be sub-optimal for dense prediction tasks due to the discrepancy between image-level prediction and pixel-level prediction. To fill this gap, we aim to design an effective, dense self-supervised learning method that directly works at the level of pixels (or local features) by taking into account the correspondence between local features. We present dense contrastive learning, which implements self-supervised learning by optimizing a pairwise contrastive (dis)similarity loss at the pixel level between two views of input images. Compared to the baseline method MoCo-v2, our method introduces negligible computation overhead (only <1% slower), but demonstrates consistently superior performance when transferring to downstream dense prediction tasks including object detection, semantic segmentation and instance segmentation; and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. Specifically, over the strong MoCo-v2 baseline, our method achieves significant improvements of 2.0% AP on PASCAL VOC object detection, 1.1% AP on COCO object detection, 0.9% AP on COCO instance segmentation, 3.0% mIoU on PASCAL VOC semantic segmentation and 1.8% mIoU on Cityscapes semantic segmentation.

We present a method to capture new species using an articulated template and images of that species. In this work, we focus mainly on birds. Although birds represent almost twice the number of species as mammals, no accurate shape model is available. To capture a novel species, we first fit the articulated template to each training sample. By disentangling pose and shape, we learn a shape space that captures variation both among species and within each species from image evidence. We learn models of multiple species from the CUB dataset, and contribute new species-specific and multi-species shape models that are useful for downstream reconstruction tasks. Using a low-dimensional embedding, we show that our learned 3D shape space better reflects the phylogenetic relationships among birds than learned perceptual features",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Single image low light enhancement is an important task and it has many practical applications. Most existing methods adopt a single image approach. Although their performance is satisfying on a static single image, we found, however, they suffer serious temporal instability when handling low light videos. We notice the problem is because existing data-driven methods are trained from single image pairs where no temporal information is available. Unfortunately, training from real temporally consistent data is also problematic because it is impossible to collect pixel-wisely paired low and normal light videos under controlled environments in large scale and diversities with noise of identical statistics. In this paper, we propose a novel method to enforce the temporal stability in low light video enhancement with only static images. The key idea is to learn and infer motion field (optical flow) from a single image and synthesize short range video sequences. Our strategy is general and can extend to large scale datasets directly. Based on this idea, we propose our method which can infer motion prior for single image low light video enhancement and enforce temporal consistency. Rigorous experiments and user study demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our proposed method. Our code and model will be publicly available at https://github.com/zkawfanx/StableLLVE",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in neuroscience have highlighted the effectiveness of multi-modal medical data for investigating certain pathologies and understanding human cognition. However, obtaining full sets of different modalities is limited by various factors, such as long acquisition times, high examination costs and artifact suppression. In addition, the complexity, high dimensionality and heterogeneity of neuroimaging data remains another key challenge in leveraging existing randomized scans effectively, as data of the same modality is often measured differently by different machines. There is a clear need to go beyond the traditional imaging-dependent process and synthesize anatomically specific target-modality data from a source input. In this paper, we propose to learn dedicated features that cross both intre- and intra-modal variations using a novel CSCl_4Net. Through an initial unification of intra-modal data in the feature maps and multivariate canonical adaptation, CSCl_4Net facilitates feature-level mutual transformation. The positive definite Riemannian manifold-penalized data fidelity term further enables CSCl_4Net to reconstruct missing measurements according to transformed features. Finally, the maximization l_4-norm boils down to a computationally efficient optimization problem. Extensive experiments validate the ability and robustness of our CSCl_4Net compared to the state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets",

A key innovation is to represent the dynamics of the cloth geometry using a dynamical system that is controlled by the body states (shape and pose). This allows us to express the cloth motion as a resultant of external (skin friction and gravity) and internal (elasticity) forces. Inspired by the theory of optimal control, we optimize the body states such that the simulated cloth motion is matched to the point cloud measurements, and the analytic gradient of the simulator is back-propagated to update the body states. We propose a cloth relaxation scheme to initialize the cloth state, which ensures the physical validity. Our method produces physically plausible and temporally smooth cloth and body movements that are faithful to the measurements, and shows superior performance compared to the existing methods. As a byproduct, the stress and strain that are applied to the body and clothes can be recovered",

The existing deep learning-based tracking algorithms use regular CNNs that are inherently translation equivariant, but not designed to tackle rotations. In this paper, we first demonstrate that in the presence of rotation instances in videos, the performance of existing trackers is severely affected. To circumvent the adverse effect of rotations, we present rotation-equivariant Siamese networks (RE-SiamNets), built through the use of group-equivariant convolutional layers comprising steerable filters. SiamNets allow estimating the change in orientation of the object in an unsupervised manner, thereby facilitating its use in relative 2D pose estimation as well. We further show that this change in orientation can be used to impose an additional motion constraint in Siamese tracking through imposing restriction on the change in orientation between two consecutive frames. For benchmarking, we present Rotation Tracking Benchmark (RTB), a dataset comprising a set of videos with rotation instances. Through experiments on two popular Siamese architectures, we show that RE-SiamNets handle the problem of rotation very well and outperform their regular counterparts. Further, RE-SiamNets can accurately estimate the relative change in pose of the target in an unsupervised fashion, namely the in-plane rotation the target has sustained with respect to the reference frame",

Many prior works learn domain agnostic feature representations for this purpose using a global distribution alignment objective which does not take into account the finer class specific structure in the source and target domains. We address this issue in our work and propose an instance affinity based criterion for source to target transfer during adaptation, called ILA-DA. We first propose a reliable and efficient method to extract similar and dissimilar samples across source and target, and utilize a multi-sample contrastive loss to drive the domain alignment process. ILA-DA simultaneously accounts for intra-class clustering as well as inter-class separation among the categories, resulting in less noisy classifier boundaries, improved transferability and increased accuracy. We verify the effectiveness of ILA-DA by observing consistent improvements in accuracy over popular domain adaptation approaches on a variety of benchmark datasets and provide insights into the proposed alignment approach.

In this paper, we propose Hierarchical Style Disentanglement (HiSD) to address this issue. Specifically, we organize the labels into a hierarchical tree structure, in which independent tags, exclusive attributes, and disentangled styles are allocated from top to bottom. Correspondingly, a new translation process is designed to adapt the above structure, in which the styles are identified for controllable translations. Both qualitative and quantitative results on the CelebA-HQ dataset verify the ability of the proposed HiSD. We hope our method will serve as a solid baseline and provide fresh insights with the hierarchically organized annotations for future research in image-to-image translation.

    "abstract": "A common strategy for improving model robustness is through data augmentations. Data augmentations encourage models to learn desired invariances, such as invariance to horizontal flipping or small changes in color. Recent work has shown that arbitrary style transfer can be used as a form of data augmentation to encourage invariance to textures by creating painting-like images from photographs. However, a stylized photograph is not quite the same as an artist-created painting. Artists depict perceptually meaningful cues in paintings so that humans can recognize salient components in scenes, an emphasis which is not enforced in style transfer. Therefore, we study how style transfer and paintings differ in their impact on model robustness. First, we investigate the role of paintings as style images for stylization-based data augmentation. We find that style transfer functions well even without paintings as style images. Second, we show that learning from paintings as a form of perceptual data augmentation can improve model robustness. Finally, we investigate the invariances learned from stylization and from paintings, and show that models learn different invariances from these differing forms of data. Our results provide insights into how stylization improves model robustness, and provide evidence that artist-created paintings can be a valuable source of data for model robustness",

We demonstrate how combining the effectiveness of the inductive bias of CNNs with the expressivity of transformers enables them to model and thereby synthesize high-resolution images. We show how to (i) use CNNs to learn a context-rich vocabulary of image constituents, and in turn (ii) utilize transformers to efficiently model their composition within high-resolution images. Our approach is readily applied to conditional synthesis tasks, where both non-spatial information, such as object classes, and spatial information, such as segmentations, can control the generated image.

    "abstract": "Few-shot object detection has made encouraging progress by reconstructing novel class objects using the feature representation learned upon a set of base classes. However, an implicit contradiction about reconstruction and classification is unfortunately ignored. On the one hand, to precisely reconstruct novel classes, the distributions of base classes should be close to those of novel classes (min-margin). On the other hand, to perform accurate classification, the distributions of either two classes must be far away from each other (max-margin). In this paper, we propose a class margin equilibrium (CME) approach, with the aim to optimize both feature space partition and novel class reconstruction in a systematic way. CME first converts the few-shot detection problem to the few-shot classification problem by using a fully connection layer to decouple localization features. CME then reserves adequate margin space for novel classes by introducing simple-yet-effective class margin loss during feature learning. Finally, CME pursues margin equilibrium by disturbing the features of novel class instances in an adversarial min-max fashion. Experiments on Pascal VOC and MS-COCO datasets show that CME improves two baseline detectors (up to 5% in average), achieving new state-of-the-art performance",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Demographic bias is a significant challenge in practical face recognition systems. Several methods have been proposed to reduce the bias, which rely on accurate demographic annotations. However, such annotations are usually not available in real scenarios. Moreover, these methods are explicitly designed for a specific demographic group divided by a predefined attribute, which is typically not general across different demographic groups divided by various attributes, such as race, gender, and age. In this paper, we propose a false positive rate penalty loss, which mitigates face recognition bias by increasing the consistency of instance false positive rate (FPR). Specifically, we first define the instance FPR as the ratio between the number of the non-target similarities above a unified threshold and the total number of the non-target similarities. The unified threshold is estimated for a given total FPR. Then, we introduce an additional false positive penalty term into the softmaxbased losses to promote the consistency of instance FPRs. Compared with the previous debiasing methods, our method requires no demographic annotations and can mitigate the bias across demographic groups divided by various kinds of attribute which are no need to be predefined in training. Extensive experimental results on popular benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the art competitors",

    "abstract": "Current state-of-the-art approaches for Semi-supervised Video Object Segmentation (Semi-VOS) propagates information from previous frames to generate segmentation mask for the current frame. This results in high-quality segmentation across challenging scenarios such as changes in appearance and occlusion. But it also leads to unnecessary computations for stationary or slow-moving objects where the change across frames is minimal. In this work, we exploit this observation by using temporal information to quickly identify frames with minimal change and skip the heavyweight mask generation step. To realize this efficiency, we propose a novel dynamic network that estimates change across frames and decides which path -- computing a full network or reusing previous frame's feature -- to choose depending on the expected similarity. Experimental results show that our approach significantly improves inference speed without much accuracy degradation on challenging Semi-VOS datasets -- DAVIS 16, DAVIS 17, and YouTube-VOS. Furthermore, our approach can be applied to multiple Semi-VOS methods demonstrating its generality. The code is available in https://github.com/HYOJINPARK/Reuse VOS",

Especially, the memory becomes a bottleneck as the systems put a hard limit on the size of on-chip memory. Because peak memory explosion in the lower layers is critical even in tiny models, the size of an input image should be reduced with sacrifice in accuracy. To overcome this drawback, we propose a novel Raster-Scanning Network, named RaScaNet, inspired by raster-scanning in image sensors. RaScaNet reads only a few rows of pixels at a time using a convolutional neural network and then sequentially learns the representation of the whole image using a recurrent neural network. The proposed method operates on an ultra-low power system without input size reduction; it requires 15.9-24.3x smaller peak memory and 5.3-12.9x smaller weight memory than the state-of-the-art tiny models. Moreover, RaScaNet fully exploits on-chip SRAM and cache memory of the system as the sum of the peak memory and the weight memory does not exceed 60 KB, improving the power efficiency of the system. In our experiments, we demonstrate the binary classification performance of RaScaNet on Visual Wake Words and Pascal VOC datasets",

When developing computer vision models that can reason about compositional spatio-temporal events, we need benchmarks that can analyze progress and uncover shortcomings.

We present Action Genome Question Answering (AGQA), a new benchmark for compositional spatio-temporal reasoning. AGQA contains 192M unbalanced question answer pairs for 9.6K videos. We also provide a balanced subset of 3.9M question answer pairs, 3 orders of magnitude larger than existing benchmarks, that minimizes bias by balancing the answer distributions and types of question structures. Although human evaluators marked 86.02% of our question-answer pairs as correct, the best model achieves only 47.74% accuracy. In addition, AGQA introduces multiple training/test splits to test for various reasoning abilities, including generalization to novel compositions, to indirect references, and to more compositional steps. Using AGQA, we evaluate modern visual reasoning systems, demonstrating that the best models barely perform better than non-visual baselines exploiting linguistic biases and that none of the existing models generalize to novel compositions unseen during training",

This approach features a deep model that transforms perceived intensities to IGRs, which are mapped to a 3D representation encoding object orientation in the camera coordinate system. Core problems are what IGRs to use and how to learn them more effectively. We answer the former question by designing IGRs based on an interpolated cuboid that derives from primitive 3D annotation readily. The latter question motivates us to incorporate geometry knowledge with a new loss function based on a projective invariant. This loss function allows unlabeled data to be used in the training stage to improve representation learning. Without additional labels, our system outperforms previous monocular RGB-based methods for joint vehicle detection and pose estimation on the KITTI benchmark, achieving performance even comparable to stereo methods.

Class activation maps (CAMs) are the commonly used features to achieve WSOL. However, previous CAM-based methods did not take full advantage of the shallow features, despite their importance for WSOL. Because shallow features are easily buried in background noise through conventional fusion. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective Shallow feature-aware Pseudo supervised Object Localization (SPOL) model for accurate WSOL, which makes the utmost of low-level features embedded in shallow layers. In practice, our SPOL model first generates the CAMs through a novel element-wise multiplication of shallow and deep feature maps, which filters the background noise and generates sharper boundaries robustly. Besides, we further propose a general class-agnostic segmentation model to achieve the accurate object mask, by only using the initial CAMs as the pseudo label without any extra annotation. Eventually, a bounding box extractor is applied to the object mask to locate the target. Experiments verify that our SPOL outperforms the state-of-the-art on both CUB-200 and ImageNet-1K benchmarks, achieving 93.44% and 67.15% (i.e., 3.93% and 2.13% improvement) Top-5 localization accuracy, respectively",

Enabling an all-encompassing view of street-scenes, omnidirectional cameras present themselves as a perfect fit in such systems. Most segmentation models for parsing urban environments operate on common, narrow Field of View (FoV) images. Transferring these models from the domain they were designed for to 360-degree perception, their performance drops dramatically, e.g., by an absolute 30.0% (mIoU) on established test-beds. To bridge the gap in terms of FoV and structural distribution between the imaging domains, we introduce Efficient Concurrent Attention Networks (ECANets), directly capturing the inherent long-range dependencies in omnidirectional imagery. In addition to the learned attention-based contextual priors that can stretch across 360-degree images, we upgrade model training by leveraging multi-source and omni-supervised learning, taking advantage of both: Densely labeled and unlabeled data originating from multiple datasets. To foster progress in panoramic image segmentation, we put forward and extensively evaluate models on Wild PAnoramic Semantic Segmentation (WildPASS), a dataset designed to capture diverse scenes from all around the globe.

However, some of the current methods tend to cheat from the background, i.e., the prediction is highly dependent on the video background instead of the motion, making the model vulnerable to background changes. To mitigate the model reliance towards the background, we propose to remove the background impact by adding the background. That is, given a video, we randomly select a static frame and add it to every other frames to construct a distracting video sample. Then we force the model to pull the feature of the distracting video and the feature of the original video closer, so that the model is explicitly restricted to resist the background influence, focusing more on the motion changes. We term our method as Background Erasing (BE). It is worth noting that the implementation of our method is so simple and neat and can be added to most of the SOTA methods without much efforts.

In this paper, we show that effective feature-level collaboration of the networks for the three respective tasks could achieve much greater performance improvement for all three tasks than only loss-level joint optimization. Specifically, we propose a single network to combine and improve the three tasks. The network extracts the features of two consecutive stereo images, and simultaneously estimates optical flow, stereo depth and camera motion. The whole network mainly contains four parts: (I) a feature-sharing encoder to extract features of input images, which can enhance features' representation ability; (II) a pooled decoder to estimate both optical flow and stereo depth; (III) a camera pose estimation module which fuses optical flow and stereo depth information; (IV) a cost volume complement module to improve the performance of optical flow in static and occluded regions.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Existing learning-based approaches to 3D shape segmentation usually formulate it as a semantic labeling problem, assuming that all parts of training shapes are annotated with a given set of labels. This assumption, however, is unrealistic for training fine-grained segmentation on large datasets since the annotation of fine-grained parts is extremely tedious. In this paper, we approach the problem with deep clustering, where the key idea is to learn part priors from a dataset with fine-grained segmentation but no part annotations. Given point sampled 3D shapes, we model the clustering priors of points with a similarity matrix and achieve part-based segmentation through minimizing a novel low rank loss. Further, since fine-grained parts can be very tiny, a 3D shape has to be densely sampled to ensure the tiny parts are well captured and segmented. To handle densely sampled point sets, we adopt a divide-and-conquer scheme. We first partition the large point set into a number of blocks.

    "abstract": "Recently, person re-identification (Re-ID) has achieved great progress. However, current methods largely depend on color appearance, which is not reliable when a person changes the clothes. Cloth-changing Re-ID is challenging since pedestrian images with clothes change exhibit large intra-class variation and small inter-class variation. Some significant features for identification are embedded in unobvious body shape differences across pedestrians. To explore such body shape cues for cloth-changing Re-ID, we propose a Fine-grained Shape-Appearance Mutual learning framework (FSAM), a two-stream framework that learns fine-grained discriminative body shape knowledge in a shape stream and transfers it to an appearance stream to complement the cloth-unrelated knowledge in the appearance features. Specifically, in the shape stream, FSAM learns fine-grained discriminative mask with the guidance of identities and extracts fine-grained body shape features by a pose-specific multi-branch network. To complement cloth-unrelated shape knowledge in the appearance stream, dense interactive mutual learning is performed across low-level and high-level features to transfer knowledge from shape stream to appearance stream, which enables the appearance stream to be deployed independently without extra computation for mask estimation. We evaluated our method on benchmark cloth-changing Re-ID datasets and achieved the start-of-the-art performance",

    "abstract": "Training of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with data with noisy labels is known to be a challenge. Based on the fact that directly providing the label to the data (Positive Learning; PL) has a risk of allowing CNNs to memorize the contaminated labels for the case of noisy data, the indirect learning approach that uses complementary labels (Negative Learning for Noisy Labels; NLNL) has proven to be highly effective in preventing overfitting to noisy data as it reduces the risk of providing faulty target. NLNL further employs a three-stage pipeline to improve convergence. As a result, filtering noisy data through the NLNL pipeline is cumbersome, increasing the training cost. In this study, we propose a novel improvement of NLNL, named Joint Negative and Positive Learning (JNPL), that unifies the filtering pipeline into a single stage. JNPL trains CNN via two losses, NL+ and PL+, which are improved upon NL and PL loss functions, respectively. We analyze the fundamental issue of NL loss function and develop new NL+ loss function producing gradient that enhances the convergence of noisy data. Furthermore, PL+ loss function is designed to enable faster convergence to expected-to-be-clean data. We show that the NL+ and PL+ train CNN simultaneously, significantly simplifying the pipeline, allowing greater ease of practical use compared to NLNL.

However, few of them gain satisfying performance under the cross-database scenario where training and testing forgeries are synthesized by different algorithms. In this paper, we find that current CNN-based detectors tend to overfit to method-specific color textures and thus fail to generalize. Observing that image noises remove color textures and expose discrepancies between authentic and tampered regions, we propose to utilize the high-frequency noises for face forgery detection. We carefully devise three functional modules to take full advantage of the high-frequency features. The first is the multi-scale high-frequency feature extraction module that extracts high-frequency noises at multiple scales and composes a novel modality. The second is the residual-guided spatial attention module that guides the low-level RGB feature extractor to concentrate more on forgery traces from a new perspective. The last is the cross-modality attention module that leverages the correlation between the two complementary modalities to promote feature learning for each other.

Instead of focusing on the design of the overall architecture, we investigate a design space that is usually overlooked, i.e. adjusting the channel configurations of predefined networks. We find that this adjustment can be achieved by shrinking widened baseline networks and leads to superior performance. Based on that, we articulate the \"heterogeneity hypothesis\": with the same training protocol, there exists a layer-wise differentiated network architecture (LW-DNA) that can outperform the original network with regular channel configurations but with a lower level of model complexity. The LW-DNA models are identified without extra computational cost or training time compared with the original network. This constraint leads to controlled experiments which direct the focus to the importance of layer-wise specific channel configurations. LW-DNA models come with advantages related to overfitting, i.e. the relative relationship between model complexity and dataset size. Experiments are conducted on various networks and datasets for image classification, visual tracking and image restoration. The resultant LW-DNA models consistently outperform the baseline models.

Such a mapping is estimated with either a convolution neural network or a decision tree using only the static input image sequence, which makes these approaches vulnerable to dynamic indoor environments that are quite common yet challenging in the real world. To address the aforementioned issues, in this paper, we propose a novel outlier-aware neural tree which bridges the two worlds, deep learning and decision tree approaches. It builds on three important blocks: (a) a hierarchical space partition over the indoor scene to construct the decision tree; (b) a neural routing function, implemented as a deep classification network, employed for better 3D scene understanding; and (c) an outlier rejection module used to filter out dynamic points during the hierarchical routing process. Our proposed algorithm is evaluated on the RIO-10 benchmark developed for camera relocalization in dynamic indoor environments. It achieves robust neural routing through space partitions and outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches by around 30% on camera pose accuracy, while running comparably fast for evaluation",

Our key observation is that the aliasing induced by downsampling bitonal screentones can be utilized as informative clues to infer the original resolution and screentones. First, we predict the target resolution from the degraded manga via the Scale Estimation Network (SE-Net) with spatial voting scheme. Then, at the target resolution, we restore the region-wise bitonal screentones via the Manga Restoration Network (MR-Net) discriminatively, depending on the degradation degree.

We propose a learning framework (YETI) building on an auto-encoder structure between 2D and 3D image time-series, which incorporates the advection-diffusion model. To help with identifiability, we develop an advection-diffusion simulator which allows pre-training of our model by supervised learning using the velocity and diffusion tensor fields. Instead of directly learning these velocity and diffusion tensor fields, we introduce representations that assure incompressible flow and symmetric positive semi-definite diffusion fields and demonstrate the additional benefits of these representations on improving estimation accuracy.

During training, this relative order prediction network and the feature embedding network are tightly coupled, providing mutual constraints to each other to improve overall metric learning performance in a cooperative manner. During testing, the predicted relative orders are used as constraints to optimize the generated features and refine their feature distance-based image retrieval results using a constrained optimization procedure.

We investigate this important and under-explored problem, Automatic model Evaluation (AutoEval).

Using the feature statistics to represent the distribution of a sample dataset, we can train regression models (e.g., a regression neural network) to predict model performance.

To well distinguish the actions, especially those with complicated spatio-temporal interactions, correctly locating the prominent motion areas is of crucial importance. However, most motion information in existing videos are difficult to label and training a model with good motion representations with supervision will thus require a large amount of human labour for annotation. In this paper, we address this problem by self-supervised learning. Specifically, we propose to learn Motion from Static Images (MoSI). The model learns to encode motion information by classifying pseudo motions generated by MoSI. We furthermore introduce a static mask in pseudo motions to create local motion patterns, which forces the model to additionally locate notable motion areas for the correct classification.We demonstrate that MoSI can discover regions with large motion even without fine-tuning on the downstream datasets. As a result, the learned motion representations boost the performance of tasks requiring understanding of complex scenes and motions, i.e., action recognition. Extensive experiments show the consistent and transferable improvements achieved by MoSI. Codes will be soon released",

Recently, two-stage NAS, e.g. BigNAS, decouples the model training and searching process and achieves remarkable search efficiency and accuracy. Two-stage NAS requires sampling from the search space during training, which directly impacts the accuracy of the final searched models. While uniform sampling has been widely used for its simplicity, it is agnostic of the model performance Pareto front, which is the main focus in the search process, and thus, misses opportunities to further improve the model accuracy. In this work, we propose AttentiveNAS that focuses on improving the sampling strategy to achieve better performance Pareto. We also propose algorithms to efficiently and effectively identify the networks on the Pareto during training. Without extra re-training or post-processing, we can simultaneously obtain a large number of networks across a wide range of FLOPs. Our discovered model family, AttentiveNAS models, achieves top-1 accuracy from 77.3% to 80.7% on ImageNet, and outperforms SOTA models, including BigNAS, Once-for-All networks and FBNetV3. We also achieve ImageNet accuracy of 80.1% with only 491 MFLOPs. Our training code and pretrained models are available at https://github. com/facebookresearch/AttentiveNAS",

According to the theory of geometric stability analysis, a minimal set of three planar/cylindrical patches are geometrically stable and determine the full 6DoFs of the object pose. We train a deep neural network to regress 6D object pose based on geometrically stable patch groups via learning both intra-patch geometric features and inter-patch contextual features. A subnetwork is jointly trained to predict per-patch poses. This auxiliary task is a relaxation of the group pose prediction: A single patch cannot determine the full 6DoFs but is able to improve pose accuracy in its corresponding DoFs. Working with patch groups makes our method generalize well for random occlusion and unseen instances. The method is easily amenable to resolve symmetry ambiguities. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art results on public benchmarks compared not only to depth-only but also to RGBD methods. It also performs well in category-level pose estimation",

    "abstract": "Recent works have shown that interval bound propagation (IBP) can be used to train verifiably robust neural networks. Reseachers observe an intriguing phenomenon on these IBP trained networks: CROWN, a bounding method based on tight linear relaxation, often gives very loose bounds on these networks. We also observe that most neurons become dead during the IBP training process, which could hurt the representation capability of the network. In this paper, we study the relationship between IBP and CROWN, and prove that CROWN is always tighter than IBP when choosing appropriate bounding lines. We further propose a relaxed version of CROWN, linear bound propagation (LBP), that can be used to verify large networks to obtain lower verified errors than IBP. We also design a new activation function, parameterized ramp function (ParamRamp), which has more diversity of neuron status than ReLU. We conduct extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and Tiny-ImageNet with ParamRamp activation and achieve state-of-the-art verified robustness.

In this work, we aim to address these issues by introducing a teacher network that provides a search space in which efficient network architectures can be found, in addition to performing knowledge distillation. First, we revisit the search space of generative models, introducing an inception-based residual block into generators. Second, to achieve target computation cost, we propose a one-step pruning algorithm that searches a student architecture from the teacher model and substantially reduces searching cost. It requires no L1 sparsity regularization and its associated hyper-parameters, simplifying the training procedure. Finally, we propose to distill knowledge through maximizing feature similarity between teacher and student via an index named Global Centered Kernel Alignment (GCKA).

    "abstract": "Reference-based Super-Resolution (Ref-SR) has recently emerged as a promising paradigm to enhance a low-resolution (LR) input image by introducing an additional high-resolution (HR) reference image. Existing Ref-SR methods mostly rely on implicit correspondence matching to borrow HR textures from reference images to compensate for the information loss in input images. However, performing local transfer is difficult because of two gaps between input and reference images: the transformation gap (e.g. scale and rotation) and the resolution gap (e.g. HR and LR). To tackle these challenges, we propose C^ 2 -Matching in this work, which produces explicit robust matching crossing transformation and resolution. 1) For the transformation gap, we propose a contrastive correspondence network, which learns transformation-robust correspondences using augmented views of the input image. 2) For the resolution gap, we adopt a teacher-student correlation distillation, which distills knowledge from the easier HR-HR matching to guide the more ambiguous LR-HR matching. 3) Finally, we design a dynamic aggregation module to address the potential misalignment issue. In addition, to faithfully evaluate the performance of Ref-SR under a realistic setting, we contribute the Webly-Referenced SR (WR-SR) dataset, mimicking the practical usage scenario. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed C^ 2 -Matching significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods by over 1dB on the standard CUFED5 benchmark.

Previous methods overcome this barrier by computing pixel-wise correspondences between two images, which is inaccurate and computational-expensive. In this paper, we take a different perspective to break down the makeup transfer problem into a two-step extraction-assignment process. To this end, we propose a Style-based Controllable GAN model that consists of three components, each of which corresponds to target style-code encoding, face identity features extraction, and makeup fusion, respectively. In particular, a Part-specific Style Encoder encodes the component-wise makeup style of the reference image into a style-code in an intermediate latent space W. The style-code discards spatial information and therefore is invariant to spatial misalignment. On the other hand, the style-code embeds component-wise information, enabling flexible partial makeup editing from multiple references. This style-code, together with source identity features, are integrated to a Makeup Fusion Decoder equipped with multiple AdaIN layers to generate the final result. Our proposed method demonstrates great flexibility on makeup transfer by supporting makeup removal, shade-controllable makeup transfer, and part-specific makeup transfer, even with large spatial misalignment.

The main difficulty lies in the situation that the class label of the query patch and its respective examples are not available in the training data.

Specifically, we emulate the language translation process to adaptively translate the feature of each object proposal to better correlate the given query feature for discriminating the class-similarity among the proposal-query pairs. To this end, we propose the Adaptive Image Transformer (AIT) module that deploys an attention-based encoder-decoder architecture to simultaneously explore intra-coder and inter-coder (i.e., each proposal-query pair) attention. The adaptive nature of our design turns out to be flexible and effective in addressing the one-shot learning scenario.

We then train a neural network that emulates the ordinary differential equations of the character dynamics, predicting new vertex positions from the current accelerations, velocities and positions. Being a local method, our network is independent of the mesh topology and generalizes to arbitrarily shaped 3D character meshes at test time. We further represent per-vertex constraints and material properties such as stiffness, enabling us to easily adjust the dynamics in different parts of the mesh. We evaluate our method on various character meshes and complex motion sequences. Our method can be over 30 times more efficient than ground-truth physically based simulation, and outperforms alternative solutions that provide fast approximations",

    "abstract": "Hidden features in neural network usually fail to learn informative representation for 3D segmentation as supervisions are only given on output prediction, while this can be solved by omni-scale supervision on intermediate layers. In this paper, we bring the first omni-scale supervision method to point cloud segmentation via the proposed gradual Receptive Field Component Reasoning (RFCR), where target Receptive Field Component Codes (RFCCs) are designed to record categories within receptive fields for hidden units in the encoder. Then, target RFCCs will supervise the decoder to gradually infer the RFCCs in a coarse-to-fine categories reasoning manner, and finally obtain the semantic labels. Because many hidden features are inactive with tiny magnitude and make minor contributions to RFCC prediction, we propose a Feature Densification with a centrifugal potential to obtain more unambiguous features, and it is in effect equivalent to entropy regularization over features. More active features can further unleash the potential of our omni-supervision method. We embed our method into four prevailing backbones and test on three challenging benchmarks. Our method can significantly improve the backbones in all three datasets. Specifically, our method brings new state-of-the-art performances for S3DIS as well as Semantic3D and ranks the 1st in the ScanNet benchmark among all the point-based methods.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Pseudo-labeling is a key component in semi-supervised learning (SSL). It relies on iteratively using the model to generate artificial labels for the unlabeled data to train against. A common property among its various methods is that they only rely on the model's prediction to make labeling decisions without considering any prior knowledge about the visual similarity among the classes. In this paper, we demonstrate that this degrades the quality of pseudo-labeling as it poorly represents visually similar classes in the pool of pseudo-labeled data. We propose SemCo, a method which leverages label semantics and co-training to address this problem. We train two classifiers with two different views of the class labels: one classifier uses the one-hot view of the labels and disregards any potential similarity among the classes, while the other uses a distributed view of the labels and groups potentially similar classes together. We then co-train the two classifiers to learn based on their disagreements. We show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across various SSL tasks including 5.6% accuracy improvement on Mini-ImageNet dataset with 1000 labeled examples. We also show that our method requires smaller batch size and fewer training iterations to reach its best performance. We make our code available at https://github.com/islam-nassar/semco",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The task of point cloud completion aims to predict the missing part for an incomplete 3D shape. A widely used strategy is to generate a complete point cloud from the incomplete one. However, the unordered nature of point clouds will degrade the generation of high-quality 3D shapes, as the detailed topology and structure of discrete points are hard to be captured by the generative process only using a latent code. In this paper, we address the above problem by reconsidering the completion task from a new perspective, where we formulate the prediction as a point cloud deformation process. Specifically, we design a novel neural network, named PMP-Net, to mimic the behavior of an earth mover. It moves move each point of the incomplete input to complete the point cloud, where the total distance of point moving paths (PMP) should be shortest. Therefore, PMP-Net predicts a unique point moving path for each point according to the constraint of total point moving distances. As a result, the network learns a strict and unique correspondence on point-level, and thus improves the quality of the predicted complete shape. We conduct comprehensive experiments on Completion3D and PCN datasets, which demonstrate our advantages over the state-of-the-art point cloud completion methods.

A new formulation is proposed under the assumption of an optimal student, where optimality is defined in the usual machine learning sense of empirical risk minimization. This is a sensible assumption for machine learning students and for human students in crowdsourcing platforms, who tend to perform at least as well as machine learning systems. It is shown that, if allowed unbounded effort, the optimal student always learns the optimal predictor for a classification task. Hence, the role of the optimal teacher is to select the teaching set that minimizes student effort. This is formulated as a problem of functional optimization where, at each teaching iteration, the teacher seeks to align the steepest descent directions of the risk of (1) the teaching set and (2) entire example population. The optimal teacher, denoted MaxGrad, is then shown to maximize the gradient of the risk on the set of new examples selected per iteration. MaxGrad teaching algorithms are finally provided for both binary and multiclass tasks, and shown to have some similarities with boosting algorithms. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of MaxGrad, which outperforms previous algorithms on the classification task, for both machine learning and human students from MTurk, by a substantial margin",

However, these networks are usually trained for specific small-scale masks and often have high demands of training time and GPU memory, which are hence not flexible to i) a new mask with the same size and ii) a larger-scale mask. We address these challenges by developing a Meta Modulated Convolutional Network for SCI reconstruction, dubbed MetaSCI. MetaSCI is composed of a shared backbone for different masks, and light-weight meta-modulation parameters to evolve to different modulation parameters for each mask, thus having the properties of fast adaptation to new masks (or systems) and ready to scale to large data.

Besides, the lack of real-world deraining datasets comprising different types of rain and their corresponding rain-free ground-truth also impedes deraining algorithm development. In this paper, we aim to address real-world deraining problems from two aspects. First, we propose a complementary cascaded network architecture, namely CCN, to remove rain streaks and raindrops in a unified framework. Specifically, our CCN removes raindrops and rain streaks in a complementary fashion, i.e., raindrop removal followed by rain streak removal and vice versa, and then fuses the results via an attention based fusion module. Considering significant shape and structure differences between rain streaks and raindrops, it is difficult to manually design a sophisticated network to remove them effectively. Thus, we employ neural architecture search to adaptively find optimal architectures within our specified deraining search space. Second, we present a new real-world rain dataset, namely RainDS, to prosper the development of deraining algorithms in practical scenarios. RainDS consists of rain images in different types and their corresponding rain-free ground-truth, including rain streak only, raindrop only, and both of them. Extensive experimental results on both existing benchmarks and RainDS demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art",

In the proposed AUMN, two attention modules are designed to update the memory bank adaptively and learn action units specific classifiers. Furthermore, three effective mechanisms (diversity, homogeneity and sparsity) are designed to guide the updating of the memory network. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explicitly model the action units with a memory network. Extensive experimental results on two standard benchmarks (THUMOS14 and ActivityNet) demonstrate that our AUMN performs favorably against stateof-the-art methods.

In this work, we present the first neural rendering method that represents multi-object dynamic scenes as scene graphs. We propose a learned scene graph representation, which encodes object transformations and radiance, allowing us to efficiently render novel arrangements and views of the scene. To this end, we learn implicitly encoded scenes, combined with a jointly learned latent representation to describe similar objects with a single implicit function.

In the absence of additional information, first-order approximations, i.e. optical flow, must be used, but this choice restricts the types of motions that can be modeled, leading to errors in highly dynamic scenarios. Event cameras are novel sensors that address this limitation by providing auxiliary visual information in the blind-time between frames. They asynchronously measure per-pixel brightness changes and do this with high temporal resolution and low latency. Event-based frame interpolation methods typically adopt a synthesis-based approach, where predicted frame residuals are directly applied to the key-frames. However, while these approaches can capture non-linear motions they suffer from ghosting and perform poorly in low-texture regions with few events. Thus, synthesis-based and flow-based approaches are complementary. In this work, we introduce Time Lens, a novel method that leverages the advantages of both. We extensively evaluate our method on three synthetic and two real benchmarks where we show an up to 5.21 dB improvement in terms of PSNR over state-of-the-art frame-based and event-based methods.

Then, we train a 3D convolutional neural network to produce discriminative anomaly-specific information by jointly learning multiple proxy tasks: three self-supervised and one based on knowledge distillation. The self-supervised tasks are: (i) discrimination of forward/backward moving objects (arrow of time), (ii) discrimination of objects in consecutive/intermittent frames (motion irregularity) and (iii) reconstruction of object-specific appearance information. The knowledge distillation task takes into account both classification and detection information, generating large prediction discrepancies between teacher and student models when anomalies occur. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to approach anomalous event detection in video as a multi-task learning problem, integrating multiple self-supervised and knowledge distillation proxy tasks in a single architecture.

Firstly, the sample size is not often large enough to learn a rich generalizable representation through conventional techniques. Secondly, while only normal samples are available at training, the learned features should be discriminative of normal and anomalous samples. Here, we propose to use the \"distillation\" of features at various layers of an expert network, which is pre-trained on ImageNet, into a simpler cloner network to tackle both issues. We detect and localize anomalies using the discrepancy between the expert and cloner networks' intermediate activation values given an input sample. We show that considering multiple intermediate hints in distillation leads to better exploitation of the expert's knowledge and a more distinctive discrepancy between the two networks, compared to utilizing only the last layer activation values. Notably, previous methods either fail in precise anomaly localization or need expensive region-based training. In contrast, with no need for any special or intensive training procedure, we incorporate interpretability algorithms in our novel framework to localize anomalous regions. Despite the striking difference between some test datasets and ImageNet, we achieve competitive or significantly superior results compared to SOTA on MNIST, F-MNIST, CIFAR-10, MVTecAD, Retinal-OCT, and two other medical datasets on both anomaly detection and localization",

This enables our network to learn a deformation-aware embedding space, so that retrieved models are more amenable to match the target after an appropriate deformation. In fact, we use the embedding space to guide the shape pairs used to train the deformation module, so that it invests its capacity in learning deformations between meaningful shape pairs. Furthermore, our novel part-aware deformation module can work with inconsistent and diverse part-structures on the source shapes. We demonstrate the benefits of our joint training not only on our novel framework, but also on other state-of-the-art neural deformation modules proposed in recent years. Lastly, we also show that our jointly-trained method outperforms various non-joint baselines",

Considering the indispensable roles and interplay of both data and regularization terms, we propose a simple and effective approach to jointly learn these two terms, embedding deep neural networks within the constraints of the MAP framework, trained in an end-to-end manner. The neural networks not only yield suitable image-adaptive features for both terms, but actually predict per-pixel spatially-variant features instead of the commonly used spatially-uniform ones. The resulting spatially-variant data and regularization terms particularly improve the restoration of fine-scale structures and detail. Quantitative and qualitative results underline the effectiveness of our approach, substantially outperforming the current state of the art",

    "abstract": "We propose a fully convolutional multi-person pose estimation framework using dynamic instance-aware convolutions, termed FCPose. Different from existing methods, which often require ROI (Region of Interest) operations and/or grouping post-processing, FCPose eliminates the ROIs and grouping post-processing with dynamic instance-aware keypoint estimation heads. The dynamic keypoint heads are conditioned on each instance (person), and can encode the instance concept in the dynamically-generated weights of their filters. Moreover, with the strong representation capacity of dynamic convolutions, the keypoint heads in FCPose are designed to be very compact, resulting in fast inference and makes FCPose have almost constant inference time regardless of the number of persons in the image. For example, on the COCO dataset, a real-time version of FCPose using the DLA-34 backbone infers about 4.5 times faster than Mask R-CNN (ResNet-101) (41.67 FPS vs. 9.26 FPS) while achieving improved performance (64.8% AP vs. 64.3% AP). FCPose also offers better speed/accuracy trade-off than other state-of-the-art methods. Our experiment results show that FCPose is a simple yet effective multi-person pose estimation framework.

    "abstract": "We present a high-performance method that can achieve mask-level instance segmentation with only bounding-box annotations for training. While this setting has been studied in the literature, here we show significantly stronger performance with a simple design (e.g., dramatically improving previous best reported mask AP of 21.1% to 31.6% on the COCO dataset). Our core idea is to redesign the loss of learning masks in instance segmentation, with no modification to the segmentation network itself. The new loss functions can supervise the mask training without relying on mask annotations. This is made possible with two loss terms, namely, 1) a surrogate term that minimizes the discrepancy between the projections of the ground-truth box and the predicted mask; 2) a pairwise loss that can exploit the prior that proximal pixels with similar colors are very likely to have the same category label. Experiments demonstrate that the redesigned mask loss can yield surprisingly high-quality instance masks with only box annotations. For example, without using any mask annotations, with a ResNet-101 backbone and 3x training schedule, we achieve 33.2% mask AP on COCO test-dev split (vs. 39.1% of the fully supervised counterpart). Our excellent experiment results on COCO and Pascal VOC indicate that our method dramatically narrows the performance gap between weakly and fully supervised instance segmentation.

We define these distinct relationships as action dependencies. We propose to improve action localization performance by modeling these action dependencies in a novel attention based Multi-Label Action Dependency (MLAD) layer. The MLAD layer consists of two branches: a Co-occurrence Dependency Branch and a Temporal Dependency Branch to model co-occurrence action dependencies and temporal action dependencies, respectively. We observe that existing metrics used for multi-label classification do not explicitly measure how well action dependencies are modeled, therefore, we propose novel metrics which consider both co-occurrence and temporal dependencies between action classes.

To address the issue, we propose to introduce the motion consistency to force the smoothness among neighboring points. In addition, constraints on the rigidity of the local transformation are also added by sharing unique rigid motion parameters for all points within each local region. To this end, a high-order CRFs based relation module (Con-HCRFs) is deployed to explore both point-wise smoothness and region-wise rigidity. To empower the CRFs to have a discriminative unary term, we also introduce a position-aware flow estimation module to be incorporated into the Con-HCRFs.

We start by simply applying the efficient shuffle block in ShuffleNet to HRNet (high-resolution network), yielding stronger performance over popular lightweight networks, such as MobileNet, ShuffleNet, and Small HRNet. We find that the heavily-used pointwise (1x1) convolutions in shuffle blocks become the computational bottleneck. We introduce a lightweight unit, conditional channel weighting, to replace costly pointwise (1x1) convolutions in shuffle blocks. The complexity of channel weighting is linear w.r.t the number of channels and lower than the quadratic time complexity for pointwise convolutions. Our solution learns the weights from all the channels and over multiple resolutions that are readily available in the parallel branches in HRNet. It uses the weights as the bridge to exchange information across channels and resolutions, compensating the role played by the pointwise (1x1) convolution. Lite-HRNet demonstrates superior results on human pose estimation over popular lightweight networks. Moreover, Lite-HRNet can be easily applied to semantic segmentation task in the same lightweight manner. The code and models have been publicly available at https://github.com/HRNet/Lite-HRNet",

    "abstract": "A key challenge in self-supervised video representation learning is how to effectively capture motion information besides context bias. While most existing works implicitly achieve this with video-specific pretext tasks (e.g., predicting clip orders, time arrows, and paces), we develop a method that explicitly decouples motion supervision from context bias through a carefully designed pretext task. Specifically, we take the key frames and motion vectors in compressed videos (e.g., in H.264 format) as the supervision sources for context and motion, respectively, which can be efficiently extracted at over 500 fps on CPU. Then we design two pretext tasks that are jointly optimized: a context matching task where a pairwise contrastive loss is cast between video clip and key frame features; and a motion prediction task where clip features, passed through an encoder-decoder network, are used to estimate motion features in a near future. These two tasks use a shared video backbone and separate MLP heads. Experiments show that our approach improves the quality of the learned video representation over previous works, where we obtain absolute gains of 16.0% and 11.1% in video retrieval recall on UCF101 and HMDB51, respectively. Moreover, we find the motion prediction to be a strong regularization for video networks, where using it as an auxiliary task improves the accuracy of action recognition with a margin of 7.4% 13.8%",

To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel Uncertainty Guided Collaborative Training (UGCT) strategy, which mainly includes two key designs: (1) The first design is an online pseudo label generation module, in which the RGB and FLOW streams work collaboratively to learn from each other.

We introduce a transductive inference for a given query image, leveraging the statistics of its unlabeled pixels, by optimizing a new loss containing three complementary terms: i) the cross-entropy on the labeled support pixels; ii) the Shannon entropy of the posteriors on the unlabeled query image pixels; and iii) a global KL-divergence regularizer based on the proportion of the predicted foreground. As our inference uses a simple linear classifier of the extracted features, its computational load is comparable to inductive inference and can be used on top of any base training. Foregoing episodic training and using only standard cross-entropy training on the base classes, our inference yields competitive performances on standard benchmarks in the 1-shot scenarios. As the number of available shots increases, the gap in performances widens: on PASCAL-5i, our method brings about 5% and 6% improvements over the state-of-the-art, in the 5- and 10-shot scenarios, respectively.

Existing live vision pipelines tackle this fundamental challenge by relying on high dynamic range (HDR) sensors that try to recover HDR images from multiple captures with different exposures. While HDR sensors substantially increase the dynamic range, they are not without disadvantages, including severe artifacts for dynamic scenes, reduced fill-factor, lower resolution, and high sensor cost. At the same time, traditional auto-exposure methods for low-dynamic range sensors have advanced as proprietary methods relying on image statistics separated from downstream vision algorithms. In this work, we revisit auto-exposure control as an alternative to HDR sensors. We propose a neural network for exposure selection that is trained jointly, end-to-end with an object detector and an image signal processing (ISP) pipeline. To this end, we use an HDR dataset for automotive object detection and an HDR training procedure.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Most recent semantic segmentation methods adopt a fully-convolutional network (FCN) with an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder progressively reduces the spatial resolution and learns more abstract/semantic visual concepts with larger receptive fields. Since context modeling is critical for segmentation, the latest efforts have been focused on increasing the receptive field, through either dilated/atrous convolutions or inserting attention modules. However, the encoder-decoder based FCN architecture remains unchanged. In this paper, we aim to provide an alternative perspective by treating semantic segmentation as a sequence-to-sequence prediction task. Specifically, we deploy a pure transformer (i.e., without convolution and resolution reduction) to encode an image as a sequence of patches. With the global context modeled in every layer of the transformer, this encoder can be combined with a simple decoder to provide a powerful segmentation model, termed SEgmentation TRansformer (SETR). Extensive experiments show that SETR achieves new state of the art on ADE20K (50.28% mIoU), Pascal Context (55.83% mIoU) and competitive results on Cityscapes. Particularly, we achieve the first position in the highly competitive ADE20K test server leaderboard on the day of submission",

However, it is acknowledged that deep learning and deep neural networks are difficult to interpret. SR networks inherit this mysterious nature and little works make attempt to understand them. In this paper, we perform attribution analysis of SR networks, which aims at finding the input pixels that strongly influence the SR results. We propose a novel attribution approach called local attribution map (LAM), which inherits the integral gradient method yet with two unique features. One is to use the blurred image as the baseline input, and the other is to adopt the progressive blurring function as the path function. Based on LAM, we show that: (1) SR networks with a wider range of involved input pixels could achieve better performance. (2) Attention networks and non-local networks extract features from a wider range of input pixels. (3) Comparing with the range that actually contributes, the receptive field is large enough for most deep networks. (4) For SR networks, textures with regular stripes or grids are more likely to be noticed, while complex semantics are difficult to utilize. Our work opens new directions for designing SR networks and interpreting low-level vision deep models",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recently unsupervised domain adaptation for the semantic segmentation task has become more and more popular due to the high-cost of pixel-level annotation on real-world images. However, most domain adaptation methods are only restricted to single-source-single-target pair, and can not be directly extended to multiple target domains. In this work, we propose a collaborative learning framework to achieve unsupervised multi-target domain adaptation. An unsupervised domain adaptation expert model is first trained for each source-target pair and is further encouraged to collaborate with each other through a bridge built between different target domains. These expert models are further improved by adding the regularization of making the consistent pixel-wise prediction for each sample with the same structured context. To obtain a single model that works across multiple target domains, we propose to simultaneously learn a student model which is trained to not only imitate the output of each expert on the corresponding target domain but also to pull different expert close to each other with regularization on their weights. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively exploit rich structured information contained in both labeled source domain and multiple unlabeled target domains. Not only does it perform well across multiple target domains but also performs favorably against state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation methods specially trained on a single source-target pair",

Inspired by recent findings that difficult samples of deep models may be exposed through network pruning, we construct a set of \"self-competitors,\" as random ensembles of pruned versions of the target model to be improved. Diverse failures can then be efficiently identified via self-gMAD competition. Next, we fine-tune both the target and its pruned variants on the human-rated gMAD set. This allows all models to learn from their respective failures, preparing themselves for the next round of self-gMAD competition.

To this end, we introduce a conditional framework with novel architecture designs and learning objectives, which effectively accommodates class proportions to guide the scene generation process. The proposed architecture also allows partial layout editing with interesting applications. Thanks to the semantic control, we can produce layouts close to the real distribution, helping enhance the whole scene generation process.

In recent years, deep neural networks based methods emerge and show promising performance for phase retrieval. However, their interpretability and generalization still remain a major challenge. In this paper, we propose to combine the advantages of both model-based alternative projection method and deep neural network for phase retrieval, so as to achieve network interpretability and inference effectiveness simultaneously. Specifically, we unfold the iterative process of the alternative projection phase retrieval into a feed-forward neural network, whose layers mimic the processing flow. The physical model of the imaging process is then naturally embedded into the neural network structure. Moreover, a complex-valued U-Net is proposed for defining image priori for forward and backward projection in dual planes. Finally, we designate physics-based formulation as an untrained deep neural network, whose weights are enforced to fit to the given intensity measurements. In summary, our scheme for phase retrieval is effective, interpretable, physics-based and unsupervised.

This effect causes harmful bias that misleads the attention module to focus on the spurious correlations in training data, damaging the model generalization. As the confounder is unobserved in general, we use the front-door adjustment to realize the causal intervention, which does not require any knowledge on the confounder. Specifically, CATT is implemented as a combination of 1) In-Sample Attention (IS-ATT) and 2) Cross-Sample Attention (CS-ATT), where the latter forcibly brings other samples into every IS-ATT, mimicking the causal intervention. CATT abides by the Q-K-V convention and hence can replace any attention module such as top-down attention and self-attention in Transformers. CATT improves various popular attention-based vision-language models by considerable margins. In particular, we show that CATT has great potential in large-scale pre-training, e.g., it can promote the lighter LXMERT [??], which uses fewer data and less computational power, comparable to the heavier UNITER [??].

    "abstract": "Image super-resolution, which is often regarded as a preprocessing procedure of scene text recognition, aims to recover the realistic features from a low-resolution text image. It has always been challenging due to large variations in text shapes, fonts, backgrounds, etc. However, most existing methods employ generic super-resolution frameworks to handle scene text images while ignoring text-specific properties such as text-level layouts and character-level details. In this paper, we establish a text-focused super-resolution framework, called Scene Text Telescope (STT). In terms of text-level layouts, we propose a Transformer-Based Super-Resolution Network (TBSRN) containing a Self-Attention Module to extract sequential information, which is robust to tackle the texts in arbitrary orientations. In terms of character-level details, we propose a Position-Aware Module and a Content-Aware Module to highlight the position and the content of each character. By observing that some characters look indistinguishable in low-resolution conditions, we use a weighted cross-entropy loss to tackle this problem. We conduct extensive experiments, including text recognition with pre-trained recognizers and image quality evaluation, on TextZoom and several scene text recognition benchmarks to assess the super-resolution images. The experimental results show that our STT can indeed generate text-focused super-resolution images and outperform the existing methods in terms of recognition accuracy",

We constrain this texture mapping network using an additional 2D-to-3D inverse mapping network and a novel cycle consistency loss to make 3D surface points map to 2D texture points that map back to the original 3D points. We demonstrate that this representation can be reconstructed using only multi-view image supervision and generates high-quality rendering results.

Second-order features are commonly used in dense prediction to build adjacent relations with a learnable module after upsampling such as non-local blocks. Since upsampling is essential, learning affinity in upsampling can avoid additional propagation layers, offering the potential for building compact models. By looking at existing upsampling operators from a unified mathematical perspective, we generalize them into a second-order form and introduce Affinity-Aware Upsampling (A2U) where upsampling kernels are generated using a light-weight low-rank bilinear model and are conditioned on second-order features. Our upsampling operator can also be extended to downsampling. We discuss alternative implementations of A2U and verify their effectiveness on two detail-sensitive tasks: image reconstruction on a toy dataset; and a large-scale image matting task where affinity-based ideas constitute mainstream matting approaches. In particular, results on the Composition-1k matting dataset show that A2U achieves a 14% relative improvement in the SAD metric against a strong baseline with negligible increase of parameters (< 0.5%).

Since those detections can have substantial overlaps with nearby targets - especially in crowded scenarios - the extracted features are insufficient for a reliable re-identification. In contrast, we propose a novel occlusion handling strategy that explicitly models the relation between occluding and occluded tracks outperforming the feature-based approach, while not depending on a separate re-identification network. Furthermore, we improve the track management of a regression-based method in order to bypass missing detections and to deal with tracks leaving the scene at the border of the image.

This paper proposes a comprehensive geodesic factor regression model that addresses all these challenges. Instead of using shapes as extracted from pre-registered data, it takes a more fundamental approach, incorporating alignment step within the proposed regression model and learns them using both pre-shape and covariate data. Additionally, it specifies spatial correlation structures using low-dimensional representations, including latent factors on the tangent space and isotropic error terms.

    "abstract": "Learning pose invariant representation is a fundamental problem in shape analysis. Most existing deep learning algorithms for 3D shape analysis are not robust to rotations and are often trained on synthetic datasets consisting of pre-aligned shapes, yielding poor generalization to unseen poses. This observation motivates a growing interest in rotation invariant and equivariant methods. The field of rotation equivariant deep learning is developing in recent years thanks to a well established theory of Lie group representations and convolutions. A fundamental problem in equivariant deep learning is to design activation functions which are both informative and preserve equivariance. The recently introduced Tensor Field Network (TFN) framework provides a rotation equivariant network design for point cloud analysis. TFN features undergo a rotation in feature space given a rotation of the input pointcloud. TFN and similar designs consider nonlinearities which operate only over rotation invariant features such as the norm of equivariant features to preserve equivariance, making them unable to capture the directional information. In a recent work entitled \"Gauge Equivariant Mesh CNNs: Anisotropic Convolutions on Geometric Graphs\" Hann et al. interpret 2D rotation equivariant features as Fourier coefficients of functions on the circle. In this work we transpose the idea of Hann et al. to 3D by interpreting TFN features as spherical harmonics coefficients of functions on the sphere. We introduce a new equivariant nonlinearity and pooling for TFN. We show improvments over the original TFN design and other equivariant nonlinearities in classification and segmentation tasks.

    "abstract": "Mammographic mass detection is an integral part of a computer-aided diagnosis system. Annotating a large number of mammograms at pixel-level in order to train a mass detection model in a fully supervised fashion is costly and time-consuming. This paper presents a novel self-training framework for semi-supervised mass detection with soft image-level labels generated from diagnosis reports by Mammo-RoBERTa, a RoBERTa-based natural language processing model fine-tuned on the fully labeled data and associated mammography reports. Starting with a fully supervised model trained on the data with pixel-level masks, the proposed framework iteratively refines the model itself using the entire weakly labeled data (image-level soft label) in a self-training fashion. A novel sample selection strategy is proposed to identify those most informative samples for each iteration, based on the current model output and the soft labels of the weakly labeled data. A soft cross-entropy loss and a soft focal loss are also designed to serve as the image-level and pixel-level classification loss respectively. Our experiment results show that the proposed semi-supervised framework can improve the mass detection accuracy on top of the supervised baseline, and outperforms the previous state-of-the-art semi-supervised approaches with weakly labeled data, in some cases by a large margin",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In this work we analyze strategies for convolutional neural network scaling; that is, the process of scaling a base convolutional network to endow it with greater computational complexity and consequently representational power. Example scaling strategies may include increasing model width, depth, resolution, etc. While various scaling strategies exist, their tradeoffs are not fully understood. Existing analysis typically focuses on the interplay of accuracy and flops (floating point operations). Yet, as we demonstrate, various scaling strategies affect model parameters, activations, and consequently actual runtime quite differently. In our experiments we show the surprising result that numerous scaling strategies yield networks with similar accuracy but with widely varying properties. This leads us to propose a simple fast compound scaling strategy that encourages primarily scaling model width, while scaling depth and resolution to a lesser extent. Unlike currently popular scaling strategies, which result in about O(s) increase in model activation w.r.t. scaling flops by a factor of s, the proposed fast compound scaling results in close to O(sqrt s ) increase in activations, while achieving excellent accuracy. Fewer activations leads to speedups on modern memory-bandwidth limited hardware (e.g., GPUs). More generally, we hope this work provides a framework for analyzing scaling strategies under various computational constraints",

The traditional scan-line stereo algorithms based on epipolar geometry are directly inapplicable to this non-pinhole camera setup due to optical characteristics of fisheye lenses; hence, existing complete 360-deg. RGB-D imaging systems have rarely achieved real-time performance yet. In this paper, we introduce an efficient sphere-sweeping stereo that can run directly on multiview fisheye images without requiring additional spherical rectification. Our main contributions are: First, we introduce an adaptive spherical matching method that accounts for each input fisheye camera's resolving power concerning spherical distortion. Second, we propose a fast inter-scale bilateral cost volume filtering method that refines distance in noisy and textureless regions with the optimal complexity of O(n). It enables real-time dense distance estimation while preserving edges. Lastly, the fisheye color and distance images are seamlessly combined into a complete 360-deg. RGB-D image via fast inpainting of the dense distance map. We demonstrate an embedded 360-deg. RGB-D imaging prototype composed of a mobile GPU and four fisheye cameras. Our prototype is capable of capturing complete 360-deg. RGB-D videos with a resolution of two megapixels at 29 fps.

Extensive experiments on both MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC datasets substantiate the superiority of our framework.

A promising solution is to learn cross-domain invariant representations by expanding the coverage of the training domain. These methods have limited generalization performance gains in practical applications due to the lack of appropriate safety and effectiveness constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel learning framework called progressive domain expansion network (PDEN) for single domain generalization. The domain expansion subnetwork and representation learning subnetwork in PDEN mutually benefit from each other by joint learning. For the domain expansion subnetwork, multiple domains are progressively generated in order to simulate various photometric and geometric transforms in unseen domains. A series of strategies are introduced to guarantee the safety and effectiveness of the expanded domains. For the domain invariant representation learning subnetwork, contrastive learning is introduced to learn the domain invariant representation in which each class is well clustered so that a better decision boundary can be learned to improve it's generalization. Extensive experiments on classification and segmentation have shown that PDEN can achieve up to 15.28% improvement compared with the state-of-the-art single-domain generalization methods",

These gates can either be implemented as an efficient network trained jointly with convolution kernels, or can simply skip the residuals based on their magnitude. Gating functions can also incorporate block-wise sparsity structures, as required for efficient implementation on hardware platforms. By replacing all convolutions with Skip-Convolutions in two state-of-the-art architectures, namely EfficientDet and HRNet, we reduce their computational cost consistently by a factor of 3 4x for two different tasks, without any accuracy drop.

To overcome the frame discontinuity problem between two modalities due to transmission delay mismatch or jitter, we propose a cross-modal affinity network (CaffNet) that learns global correspondence as well as locally-varying affinities between audio and visual streams. Given that the global term provides stability over a temporal sequence at the utterance-level, this resolves the label permutation problem characterized by inconsistent assignments. By extending the proposed cross-modal affinity on the complex network, we further improve the separation performance in the complex spectral domain.

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is a popular distributed learning framework that can reduce privacy risks by not explicitly sharing private data. However, recent works have demonstrated that sharing model updates makes FL vulnerable to inference attack. In this work, we show our key observation that the data representation leakage from gradients is the essential cause of privacy leakage in FL. We also provide an analysis of this observation to explain how the data presentation is leaked. Based on this observation, we propose a defense called Soteria against model inversion attack in FL. The key idea of our defense is learning to perturb data representation such that the quality of the reconstructed data is severely degraded, while FL performance is maintained. In addition, we derive a certified robustness guarantee to FL and a convergence guarantee to FedAvg, after applying our defense. To evaluate our defense, we conduct experiments on MNIST and CIFAR10 for defending against the DLG attack and GS attack. Without sacrificing accuracy, the results demonstrate that our proposed defense can increase the mean squared error between the reconstructed data and the raw data by as much as 160x for both DLG attack and GS attack, compared with baseline defense methods. Therefore, the privacy of the FL system is significantly improved. Our code can be found at https://github.com/jeremy313/Soteria",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a detection-aware pre-training (DAP) approach, which leverages only weakly-labeled classification-style datasets (e.g., ImageNet) for pre-training, but is specifically tailored to benefit object detection tasks. In contrast to the widely used image classification-based pre-training (e.g., on ImageNet), which does not include any location-related training tasks, we transform a classification dataset into a detection dataset through a weakly supervised object localization method based on Class Activation Maps to directly pre-train a detector, making the pre-trained model location-aware and capable of predicting bounding boxes. We show that DAP can outperform the traditional classification pre-training in terms of both sample efficiency and convergence speed in downstream detection tasks including VOC and COCO. In particular, DAP boosts the detection accuracy by a large margin when the number of examples in the downstream task is small",

    "abstract": "It has been long recognized that deep neural networks are sensitive to changes in spatial configurations or scene structures. Image augmentations, such as random translation, cropping, and resizing, can be used to improve the robustness of deep neural networks under spatial transforms. However, changes in object part configurations, spatial layout of object, and scene structures of the images may still result in major changes in the their feature representations generated by the network, creating significant challenges for various visual learning tasks, including representation or metric learning, image classification and retrieval. In this work, we introduce a new learnable module, called spatial assembly network (SAN), to address this important issue. This SAN module examines the input image and performs a learned re-organization and assembly of feature points from different spatial locations conditioned by feature maps from previous network layers so as to maximize the discriminative power of the final feature representation. This differentiable module can be flexibly incorporated into existing network architectures, improving their capabilities in handling spatial variations and structural changes of the image scene. We demonstrate that the proposed SAN module is able to significantly improve the performance of various metric / representation learning, image retrieval and classification tasks, in both supervised and unsupervised learning scenarios",

In this work, we explore how linguistic structures in captions can benefit scene graph generation. Our method captures the information provided in captions about relations between individual triplets, and context for subjects and objects (e.g. visual properties are mentioned). Captions are a weaker type of supervision than triplets since the alignment between the exhaustive list of human-annotated subjects and objects in triplets, and the nouns in captions, is weak. However, given the large and diverse sources of multimodal data on the web (e.g. blog posts with images and captions), linguistic supervision is more scalable than crowdsourced triplets. We show extensive experimental comparisons against prior methods which leverage instance- and image-level supervision, and ablate our method to show the impact of leveraging phrasal and sequential context, and techniques to improve localization of subjects and objects",

In this paper, we present a computationally efficient approximation for natural gradient descent, named Swift Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (SKFAC), which combines Kronecker factorization and a fast low-rank matrix inversion technique. Our research aims at both fully connected and convolutional layers. For the fully connected layers, by utilizing the low-rank property of Kronecker factors of Fisher information matrix, our method only requires inverting a small matrix to approximate the curvature with desirable accuracy. For convolutional layers, we propose a way with two strategies to save computational efforts without affecting the empirical performance by reducing across the spatial dimension or receptive fields of feature maps. Specifically, we propose two effective dimension reduction methods for this purpose: Spatial Subsampling and Reduce Sum. Experimental results of training several deep neural networks on Cifar-10 and ImageNet-1k datasets demonstrate that SKFAC can capture the main curvature and yield comparative performance to K-FAC. The proposed method bridges the wall-clock time gap between the 1st and 2nd order algorithms",

To answer this question, we propose to find better receptive field combinations through a global-to-local search scheme. Our search scheme exploits both global search to find the coarse combinations and local search to get the refined receptive field combination patterns further. The global search finds possible coarse combinations other than human-designed patterns. On top of the global search, we propose an expectation guided iterative local search scheme to refine combinations effectively.

Hierarchical neural architectures have proved effective in multi-scale feature extraction which signifies the need for fast mesh decimation. However, existing methods rely on CPU-based implementations to obtain multi-resolution meshes. We design GPU-accelerated mesh decimation to facilitate network resolution reduction efficiently on-the-fly. Pooling and unpooling modules are defined on the vertex clusters gathered during decimation. For feature learning over meshes, Picasso contains three types of novel convolutions namely, facet2vertex, vertex2facet, and facet2facet convolution. Hence, it treats a mesh as a geometric structure comprising vertices and facets, rather than a spacial graph with edges as previous methods do. Picasso also incorporates a fuzzy mechanism in its filters for robustness to mesh sampling (vertex density). It exploits Gaussian mixtures to define fuzzy coefficients for the facet2vertex convolution, and barycentric interpolation to define the coefficients for the remaining two convolutions. In this release, we demonstrate the effectivenss of the proposed modules with competitive segmentation results on S3DIS. The library will be made public through github",

However, there is a lack of theoretical insights into why and when this method of transferring knowledge can be successful between such heterogeneous tasks. We analyze this method theoretically using deep linear networks, and experimentally using nonlinear networks.

In this paper, we propose AdvSim, an adversarial framework to generate safety-critical scenarios for any LiDAR-based autonomy system. Given an initial traffic scenario, AdvSim modifies the actors' trajectories in a physically plausible manner and updates the LiDAR sensor data to match the perturbed world. Importantly, by simulating directly from sensor data, we obtain adversarial scenarios that are safety-critical for the full autonomy stack. Our experiments show that our approach is general and can identify thousands of semantically meaningful safety-critical scenarios for a wide range of modern self-driving systems. Furthermore, we show that the robustness and safety of these systems can be further improved by training them with scenarios generated by AdvSim",

We propose a three-step approach to improve computational efficiency while substantially reducing the peak memory usage of 3D CNNs. First, we design a video network search space and employ neural architecture search to generate efficient and diverse 3D CNN architectures. Second, we introduce the Stream Buffer technique that decouples memory from video clip duration, allowing 3D CNNs to embed arbitrary-length streaming video sequences for both training and inference with a small constant memory footprint. Third, we propose a simple ensembling technique to improve accuracy further without sacrificing efficiency. These three progressive techniques allow MoViNets to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy and efficiency on the Kinetics, Moments in Time, and Charades video action recognition datasets. For instance, MoViNet-A5-Stream achieves the same accuracy as X3D-XL on Kinetics 600 while requiring 80% fewer FLOPs and 65% less memory.

    "abstract": "Though machine learning algorithms are able to achieve pattern recognition from the correlation between data and labels, the presence of spurious features in the data decreases the robustness of these learned relationships with respect to varied testing environments. This is known as out-of-distribution (OoD) generalization problem. Recently, invariant risk minimization (IRM) attempts to tackle this issue by penalizing predictions based on the unstable spurious features in the data collected from different environments. However, similar to domain adaptation or domain generalization, a prevalent non-trivial limitation in these works is that the environment information is assigned by human specialists i.e. a priori or determined heuristically. However, an inappropriate group partitioning can dramatically deteriorate the OoD generalization and the process is expensive and time-consuming. To deal with this issue, we propose a novel theoretically principled min-max framework to iteratively construct a worst-case splitting, i.e. creating the most challenging environment splittings for the backbone learning paradigm (e.g. IRM) to learn the robust feature representation. We also design a differentiable training strategy to facilitate the feasible gradient-based computation. Numerical experiments show that our algorithmic framework has achieved superior and stable performance in various datasets, such as Colored MNIST and Punctuated Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST). Furthermore, we also find our algorithm to be robust even to a strong data poisoning attack. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first to adopt differentiable environment splitting method to enable stable predictions across environments without environment index information, which achieves the state-of-the-art performance on datasets with strong spurious correlation, such as Colored MNIST",

We observe that the commonly used contrastive objective is not satisfying on BNNs for competitive accuracy, since the backbone network contains relatively limited capacity and representation ability. Hence instead of directly applying existing self-supervised methods, which cause a severe decline in performance, we present a novel guided learning paradigm from real-valued to distill binary networks on the final prediction distribution, to minimize the loss and obtain desirable accuracy. Our proposed method can boost the simple contrastive learning baseline by an absolute gain of 5.5 15% on BNNs. We further reveal that it is difficult for BNNs to recover the similar predictive distributions as real-valued models when training without labels. Thus, how to calibrate them is key to address the degradation in performance. Extensive experiments are conducted on the large-scale ImageNet and downstream datasets. Our method achieves substantial improvement over the simple contrastive learning baseline, and is even comparable to many mainstream supervised BNN methods.

Then, we virtually move the camera in the reconstructed environment with known motion vectors and rotation angles, allowing us to synthesize both a novel view and the corresponding optical flow field connecting each pixel in the input image to the one in the new frame.

    "abstract": "Shadow removal is a computer-vision task that aims to restore the image content in shadow regions. While almost all recent shadow-removal methods require shadow-free images for training, in ECCV 2020 Le and Samaras introduces an innovative approach without this requirement by cropping patches with and without shadows from shadow images as training samples. However, it is still laborious and time-consuming to construct a large amount of such unpaired patches. In this paper, we propose a new G2R-ShadowNet which leverages shadow generation for weakly-supervised shadow removal by only using a set of shadow images and their corresponding shadow masks for training. The proposed G2R-ShadowNet consists of three sub-networks for shadow generation, shadow removal and refinement, respectively and they are jointly trained in an end-to-end fashion. In particular, the shadow generation sub-net stylises non-shadow regions to be shadow ones, leading to paired data for training the shadow-removal sub-net. Extensive experiments on the ISTD dataset and the Video Shadow Removal dataset show that the proposed G2R-ShadowNet achieves competitive performances against the current state of the arts and outperforms Le and Samaras' patch-based shadow-removal method",

    "abstract": "Detecting digital face manipulation has attracted extensive attention due to the potential harms of fake media to the public. However, recent advances have been able to reduce the forgery signals to a low magnitude. Decomposition, which reversibly decomposes the image into several constituent elements, is a promising way to highlight the hidden forgery details. In this paper, we consider a face image as the production of the intervention of the underlying 3D geometry and the lighting environment, and decompose it in a computer graphics view. Specifically, by disentangling the face image into 3D shape, common texture, identity texture, ambient light, and direct light, we find the devil lies in the direct light and the identity texture. Based on this observation, we propose to utilize facial detail, which is the combination of direct light and identity texture, as the clue to detect the subtle forgery patterns. Besides, we highlight the manipulated region with a supervised attention mechanism and introduce a two-stream structure to exploit both face image and facial detail together as a multi-modality task. Extensive experiments indicate the effectiveness of the extra features extracted from the facial detail, and our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance",

    "abstract": "Most 3D shape completion approaches rely heavily on partial-complete shape pairs and learn in a fully supervised manner. Despite their impressive performances on in-domain data, when generalizing to partial shapes in other forms or real-world partial scans, they often obtain unsatisfactory results due to domain gaps. In contrast to previous fully supervised approaches, in this paper we present ShapeInversion, which introduces Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) inversion to shape completion for the first time. ShapeInversion uses a GAN pre-trained on complete shapes by searching for a latent code that gives a complete shape that best reconstructs the given partial input. In this way, ShapeInversion no longer needs paired training data, and is capable of incorporating the rich prior captured in a well-trained generative model. On the ShapeNet benchmark, the proposed ShapeInversion outperforms the SOTA unsupervised method, and is comparable with supervised methods that are learned using paired data. It also demonstrates remarkable generalization ability, giving robust results for real-world scans and partial inputs of various forms and incompleteness levels. Importantly, ShapeInversion naturally enables a series of additional abilities thanks to the involvement of a pre-trained GAN, such as producing multiple valid complete shapes for an ambiguous partial input, as well as shape manipulation and interpolation",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The extraction of auto-correlation in images has shown great potential in deep learning networks, such as the self-attention mechanism in the channel domain and the self-similarity mechanism in the spatial domain. However, the realization of the above mechanisms mostly requires complicated module stacking and a large number of convolution calculations, which inevitably increases model complexity and memory cost. Therefore, we propose a pseudo 3D auto-correlation network (P3AN) to explore a more efficient way of capturing contextual information in image denoising. On the one hand, P3AN uses fast 1D convolution instead of dense connections to realize criss-cross interaction, which requires less computational resources. On the other hand, the operation does not change the feature size and makes it easy to expand. It means that only a simple adaptive fusion is needed to obtain contextual information that includes both the channel domain and the spatial domain. Our method built a pseudo 3D auto-correlation attention block through 1D convolutions and a lightweight 2D structure for more discriminative features. Extensive experiments have been conducted on three synthetic and four real noisy datasets. According to quantitative metrics and visual quality evaluation, the P3AN shows great superiority and surpasses state-of-the-art image denoising methods",

The idea is to generate a set of augmented data with some random perturbations or transforms, and minimize the maximum, or worst case loss over the augmented data. By doing so, we implicitly introduce a smoothness or robustness regularization against the random perturbations, and hence improve the generation performance. For example, in the case of Gaussian perturbation, MaxUp is asymptotically equivalent to using the gradient norm of the loss as a penalty to encourage smoothness. We test MaxUp on a range of tasks, including image classification, language modeling, and adversarial certification, on which MaxUp consistently outperforms the existing best baseline methods, without introducing substantial computational overhead. In particular, we improve ImageNet classification from the accuracy 85.5% without extra data to 85.8%",

AdvCAM is an attribution map of an image that is manipulated to increase the classification score produced by a classifier. This manipulation is realized in an anti-adversarial manner, which perturbs the original images along pixel gradients in the opposite direction from those used in an adversarial attack. It forces regions initially considered not to be discriminative to become involved in subsequent classifications, and produces attribution maps that successively identify more regions of the target object. In addition, we introduce a new regularization procedure that inhibits both the incorrect attribution of regions unrelated to the target object and excessive concentration of attributions on a small region of that object. Our method is a post-hoc analysis of a trained classifier, which does not need to be altered or retrained.

    "abstract": "Convolutional network compression methods require training data for achieving acceptable results, but training data is routinely unavailable due to some privacy and transmission limitations. Therefore, recent works focus on learning efficient networks without original training data, i.e., data-free model compression. Wherein, most of existing algorithms are developed for image recognition or segmentation tasks. In this paper, we study the data-free compression approach for single image super-resolution (SISR) task which is widely used in mobile phones and smart cameras. Specifically, we analyze the relationship between the outputs and inputs from the pre-trained network and explore a generator with a series of loss functions for maximally capturing useful information. The generator is then trained for synthesizing training samples which have similar distribution to that of the original data. To further alleviate the training difficulty of the student network using only the synthetic data, we introduce a progressive distillation scheme. Experiments on various datasets and architectures demonstrate that the proposed method is able to be utilized for effectively learning portable student networks without the original data, e.g., with 0.16dB PSNR drop on Set5 for x2 super resolution.
