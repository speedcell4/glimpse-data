    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "A natural way of estimating heteroscedastic label noise in regression is to model the observed (potentially noisy) target as a sample from a normal distribution, whose parameters can be learned by minimizing the negative log-likelihood. This formulation has desirable loss attenuation properties, as it reduces the contribution of high-error examples. Intuitively, this behavior can improve robustness against label noise by reducing overfitting. We propose an extension of this simple and probabilistic approach to classification that has the same desirable loss attenuation properties. Furthermore, we discuss and address some practical challenges of this extension. We evaluate the effectiveness of the method by measuring its robustness against label noise in classification. We perform enlightening experiments exploring the inner workings of the method, including sensitivity to hyperparameters, ablation studies, and other insightful analyses",

    "abstract": "We present RECLIP (Resource-efficient CLIP), a simple method that minimizes computational resource footprint for CLIP (Contrastive Language Image Pretraining). Inspired by the notion of coarse-to-fine in computer vision, we leverage small images to learn from large-scale language supervision efficiently, and finetune the model with high-resolution data in the end. Since the complexity of the vision transformer heavily depends on input image size, our approach significantly reduces the training resource requirements both in theory and in practice. Using the same batch size and training epoch, RECLIP achieves highly competitive zero-shot classification and image-text retrieval accuracy with 6 to 8× less computational resources and 7 to 9× fewer FLOPs than the base- line. Compared to the state-of-the-art contrastive learning methods, RECLIP demonstrates 5 to 59× training resource savings while maintaining highly competitive zero-shot classification and retrieval performance. Finally, RECLIP matches the state of the art in transfer learning to open-vocabulary detection tasks, achieving 32 APr on LVIS. We hope this work will pave the path for the broader research community to explore language supervised pretraining in resource-friendly settings",

    "abstract": "We investigate an infinite-horizon average reward Markov Decision Process (MDP) with delayed, composite, and partially anonymous reward feedback. The delay and compositeness of rewards mean that rewards generated as a result of taking an action at a given state are fragmented into different components, and they are sequentially realized at delayed time instances. The partial anonymity attribute implies that a learner, for each state, only observes the aggregate of past reward components generated as a result of different actions taken at that state, but realized at the observation instance. We propose an algorithm named $\\mathrm{DUCRL2}$ to obtain a near-optimal policy for this setting and show that it achieves a regret bound of $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left(DS\\sqrt{AT} + d (SA)^3\\right)$ where $S$ and $A$ are the sizes of the state and action spaces, respectively, $D$ is the diameter of the MDP, $d$ is a parameter upper bounded by the maximum reward delay, and $T$ denotes the time horizon.

    "abstract": "Partial differential equations (PDEs) are central to describing complex physical system simulations. Their expensive solution techniques have led to an increased interest in deep neural network based surrogates. However, the practical utility of training such surrogates is contingent on their ability to model complex multi-scale spatio-temporal phenomena. {In recent years}, various neural network architectures have been proposed to target such phenomena, most notably Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs), which give a natural handle over local \\& global spatial information via parameterization of different Fourier modes, and U-Nets which treat local and global information via downsampling and upsampling paths. However, large-scale comparisons between these convolution-based approaches are notoriously sparse. In this work, we make such comprehensive comparisons regarding performance, runtime complexity, memory requirements, and generalization capabilities. Concretely, we stress-test various FNO, (Dilated) ResNet, and U-Net like approaches to fluid mechanics problems in both vorticity-stream and velocity function form. For U-Nets, we transfer recent architectural improvements from computer vision, most notably from object segmentation and generative modeling. Next, we use our insights on design considerations, and introduce U-FNets, i.e., modern U-Nets that are augmented with FNO downsampling layers. Those architectures further improve performance without major degradation of computational cost. Finally, we ablate and discuss various choices for parameter conditioning}, and show promising results on generalization to different PDE parameters and time-scales with a single surrogate model.

    "abstract": "Distributional reinforcement learning has gained significant attention in recent years due to its ability to handle uncertainty and variability in the returns an agent will receive for each action it takes. A key challenge in distributional reinforcement learning is finding a measure of the difference between two distributions that is well-suited for use with the distributional Bellman operator, a function that takes in a value distribution and produces a modified distribution based on the agent's current state and action. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing the multiquadric kernel to moment-matching distributional reinforcement learning. We show that this kernel is both theoretically sound and empirically effective. Our contribution is mainly of a theoretical nature, presenting the first formally sound kernel for moment-matching distributional reinforcement learning with good practical performance. We also provide insights into why the RBF kernel has been shown to provide good practical results despite its theoretical problems. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our kernel on a number of standard benchmarks, obtaining results comparable to the state-of-the-art",

    "abstract": "The resilience of complex networks refers to their ability to maintain functionality in the face of structural attacks. This ability can be improved by performing minimal modifications to the network structure via degree-preserving edge rewiring-based methods. Existing learning-free edge rewiring methods, although effective, are limited in their ability to generalize to different graphs. Such a limitation cannot be trivially addressed by existing graph neural networks (GNNs)-based learning approaches since there is no rich initial node features for GNNs to learn meaningful representations. In this work, inspired by persistent homology, we specifically design a variant of GNN called FireGNN to learn meaningful node representations solely from graph structures. We then develop an end-to-end inductive method called ResiNet, which aims to discover resilient network topologies while balancing network utility. ResiNet reformulates the optimization of network resilience as a Markov decision process equipped with edge rewiring action space. It learns to sequentially select the appropriate edges to rewire for maximizing resilience. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ResiNet outperforms existing approaches and achieves near-optimal resilience gains on various graphs while balancing network utility",

Learning-based force fields have made significant progress in accelerating ab-initio MD simulation but are not fast enough for many real-world applications due to slow inference for large systems and small time steps (femtosecond-level). We aim to address these challenges by learning a multi-scale graph neural network that directly simulates coarse-grained MD with a very large time step (nanosecond-level) and a novel refinement module based on diffusion models to mitigate simulation instability. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated in two complex systems: single-chain coarse-grained polymers and multi-component Li-ion polymer electrolytes. For evaluation, we simulate trajectories much longer than the training trajectories for systems with different chemical compositions that the model is not trained on. Structural and dynamical properties can be accurately recovered at several orders of magnitude higher speed than classical force fields by getting out of the femtosecond regime",

We propose a novel framework with two contributions: introducing a new differentiable surrogate for expected calibration error (DECE) that allows calibration quality to be directly optimised, and a meta-learning framework that uses DECE to optimise for validation set calibration with respect to model hyper-parameters.

    "title": "Understanding convolution on graphs via energies",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) typically operate by message-passing, where the state of a node is updated based on the information received from its neighbours. Most message-passing models act as graph convolutions, where features are mixed by a shared, linear transformation before being propagated over the edges. On node-classification tasks, graph convolutions have been shown to suffer from two limitations: poor performance on heterophilic graphs, and over-smoothing. It is common belief that both phenomena occur because such models behave as low-pass filters, meaning that the Dirichlet energy of the features decreases along the layers incurring a smoothing effect that ultimately makes features no longer distinguishable. In this work, we rigorously prove that simple graph-convolutional models can actually enhance high frequencies and even lead to an asymptotic behaviour we refer to as over-sharpening, opposite to over-smoothing. We do so by showing that linear graph convolutions with symmetric weights minimize a multi-particle energy that generalizes the Dirichlet energy; in this setting, the weight matrices induce edge-wise attraction (repulsion) through their positive (negative) eigenvalues, thereby controlling whether the features are being smoothed or sharpened. We also extend the analysis to non-linear GNNs, and demonstrate that some existing time-continuous GNNs are instead always dominated by the low frequencies. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings through ablations and real-world experiments",

The set of DistrRL algorithms has led to improved empirical performance. Nevertheless, the theory of DistrRL is still not fully understood, especially in the control case. In this paper, we present the simpler one-step distributional reinforcement learning (OS-DistrRL) framework encompassing only the randomness induced by the one-step dynamics of the environment. Contrary to DistrRL, we show that our approach comes with a unified theory for both policy evaluation and control. Indeed, we propose two OS-DistrRL algorithms for which we provide an almost sure convergence analysis. The proposed approach compares favorably with categorical DistrRL on various environments",

Out-of-distribution samples drawn from distributions differing from that of in-distribution samples could be assigned with unexpected high-confidence predictions because they could obtain minimum strongly label-related information. To distinguish in- and out-of-distribution samples, Dual Representation Learning (DRL) makes out-of-distribution samples harder to have high-confidence predictions by exploring both strongly and weakly label-related information from in-distribution samples. For a pretrained network exploring strongly label-related information to learn label-discriminative representations, DRL trains its auxiliary network exploring the remaining weakly label-related information to learn distribution-discriminative representations. Specifically, for a label-discriminative representation, DRL constructs its complementary distribution-discriminative representation by integrating diverse representations less similar to the label-discriminative representation. Accordingly, DRL combines label- and distribution-discriminative representations to detect out-of-distribution samples. Experiments show that DRL outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for out-of-distribution detection",

While existing approaches such as curiosity-driven exploration find novelty, they sometimes do not systematically explore the whole state space, akin to depth-first-search vs breadth-first-search. In this paper, we propose a new intrinsic reward that is cyclophobic, i.e., it does not reward novelty, but punishes redundancy by avoiding cycles. Augmenting the cyclophobic intrinsic reward with a sequence of hierarchical representations based on the agent's cropped observations we are able to achieve excellent results in the MiniGrid and MiniHack environments. Both are particularly hard, as they require complex interactions with different objects in order to be solved. Detailed comparisons with previous approaches and thorough ablation studies show that our newly proposed cyclophobic reinforcement learning is more sample efficient than other state of the art methods in a variety of tasks",

    "abstract": "Rotational invariance is a popular inductive bias used by many fields in machine learning, such as computer vision and machine learning for quantum chemistry. Rotation-invariant machine learning methods set the state of the art for many tasks, including molecular property prediction and 3D shape classification. These methods generally either rely on task-specific rotation-invariant features, or they use general-purpose deep neural networks which are complicated to design and train. However, it is unclear whether the success of these methods is primarily due to the rotation invariance or the deep neural networks. To address this question, we suggest a simple and general-purpose method for learning rotation-invariant functions of three-dimensional point cloud data using a random features approach. Specifically, we extend the random features method of Rahimi & Recht (2007) by deriving a version that is invariant to three-dimensional rotations and showing that it is fast to evaluate on point cloud data. We show through experiments that our method matches or outperforms the performance of general-purpose rotation-invariant neural networks on standard molecular property prediction benchmark datasets QM7 and QM9. We also show that our method is general-purpose and provides a rotation-invariant baseline on the ModelNet40 shape classification task.

One main challenge of this new problem is to discover imbalanced novel classes with the help of long-tailed known classes. To tackle this problem, we propose an adaptive self-labeling strategy based on an equiangular prototype representation of classes.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are well-known to act as \\textbf{over-parameterized} deep image priors (DIP) that regularize various image inverse problems. Meanwhile, researchers also proposed extremely compact, \\textbf{under-parameterized} image priors (e.g., deep decoder) that are strikingly competent for image restoration too, despite a loss of accuracy. These two extremes push us to think whether there exists a better solution in the middle: \\textit{between over- and under-parameterized image priors, can one identify ``intermediate\" parameterized image priors that achieve better trade-offs between performance, efficiency, and even preserving strong transferability?} Drawing inspirations from the lottery ticket hypothesis (LTH), we conjecture and study a novel ``lottery image prior\" (\\textbf{LIP}) by exploiting DNN inherent sparsity, stated as: \\textit{given an over-parameterized DNN-based image prior, it will contain a sparse subnetwork that can be trained in isolation, to match the original DNN's performance when being applied as a prior to various image inverse problems}. Our results validate the superiority of LIPs: we can successfully locate the LIP subnetworks from over-parameterized DIPs at substantial sparsity ranges. Those LIP subnetworks significantly outperform deep decoders under comparably compact model sizes (by often fully preserving the effectiveness of their over-parameterized counterparts), and they also possess high transferability across different images as well as restoration task types. Besides, we also extend LIP to compressive sensing image reconstruction, where a \\textit{pre-trained} GAN generator is used as the prior (in contrast to \\textit{untrained} DIP or deep decoder), and confirm its validity in this setting too. To our best knowledge, this is the first time that LTH is demonstrated to be relevant in the context of inverse problems or image priors.

Such a challenge is practical in domain-specific applications and admits another layer of complexity in applications of medical decision-making and web marketing, where high- dimensional decision contexts are sensitive but important to inform decision-making. Exist- ing (low dimensional) federated bandits suffer super-linear theoretical regret upper bound in high-dimensional scenarios and are at risk of client information leakage due to their in- ability to separate exploration from exploitation. This paper proposes a class of bandit policy design, termed Fedego Lasso, to complete the task of federated high-dimensional online decision-making with sub-linear theoretical regret and local client privacy argument. Fedego Lasso relies on a novel multi-client teamwork-selfish bandit policy design to per- form decentralized collaborative exploration and federated egocentric exploration with log- arithmic communication costs.

In this work, we propose a safe method to exploit confounded offline data in model-based RL, which improves the sample-efficiency of an interactive agent that also collects online, unconfounded data. First, we import ideas from the well-established framework of $do$-calculus to express model-based RL as a causal inference problem, thus bridging the gap between the fields of RL and causality. Then, we propose a generic method for learning a causal transition model from offline and online data, which captures and corrects the confounding effect using a hidden latent variable. We prove that our method is correct and efficient, in the sense that it attains better generalization guarantees thanks to the confounded offline data (in the asymptotic case), regardless of the confounding effect (the offline expert's behaviour). We showcase our method on a series of synthetic experiments, which demonstrate that a) using confounded offline data naively degrades the sample-efficiency of an RL agent; b) using confounded offline data correctly improves sample-efficiency",

    "title": "Optimizing Learning Rate Schedules for Iterative Pruning of Deep Neural Networks",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The importance of learning rate (LR) schedules on network pruning has been observed in a few recent works. As an example, Frankle and Carbin (2019) highlighted that winning tickets (i.e., accuracy preserving subnetworks) can not be found without applying a LR warmup schedule. Renda, Frankle and Carbin (2020) also demonstrated that rewinding the LR to its initial state at the end of each pruning cycle can improve pruning performance. In this paper, we go one step further by first providing a theoretical justification for the surprising effect of LR schedules. Next, we propose a LR schedule for network pruning called SILO, which stands for S-shaped Improved Learning rate Optimization. The advantages of SILO over existing LR schedules are two-fold: (i) SILO has a strong theoretical motivation and dynamically adjusts the LR during pruning to improve generalization. Specifically, SILO increases the LR upper bound (max_lr) in an S-shape. This leads to an improvement of 2% - 4% in extensive experiments with various types of networks (e.g., Vision Transformers, ResNet) on popular datasets such as ImageNet, CIFAR-10/100. (ii) In addition to the strong theoretical motivation, SILO is empirically optimal in the sense of matching an Oracle, which exhaustively searches for the optimal value of max_lr via grid search. We find that SILO is able to precisely adjust the value of max_lr to be within the Oracle optimized interval, resulting in performance competitive with the Oracle with significantly lower complexity",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have greatly impacted numerous fields over the past decade. Yet despite exhibiting superb performance over many problems, their black-box nature still poses a significant challenge with respect to explainability. Indeed, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is crucial in several fields, wherein the answer alone---sans a reasoning of how said answer was derived---is of little value. This paper uncovers a troubling property of explanation methods for image-based DNNs: by making small visual changes to the input image---hardly influencing the network's output---we demonstrate how explanations may be arbitrarily manipulated through the use of evolution strategies. Our novel algorithm, AttaXAI, a model-and-data XAI-agnostic, adversarial attack on XAI algorithms, only requires access to the output logits of a classifier and to the explanation map; these weak assumptions render our approach highly useful where real-world models and data are concerned. We compare our method's performance on two benchmark datasets---CIFAR100 and ImageNet---using four different pretrained deep-learning models: VGG16-CIFAR100, VGG16-ImageNet, MobileNet-CIFAR100, and Inception-v3-ImageNet. We find that the XAI methods can be manipulated without the use of gradients or other model internals. Our novel algorithm is successfully able to manipulate an image in a manner imperceptible to the human eye, such that the XAI method outputs a specific explanation map. To our knowledge, this is the first such method in a black-box setting, and we believe it has significant value where explainability is desired, required, or legally mandatory",

In this work, we study NTKs through the lens of scaling laws, and demonstrate that they fall short of explaining important aspects of neural network generalization. In particular, we demonstrate realistic settings where finite-width neural networks have significantly better data scaling exponents as compared to their corresponding empirical and infinite NTKs at initialization. This reveals a more fundamental difference between the real networks and NTKs, beyond just a few percentage points of test accuracy. Further, we show that even if the empirical NTK is allowed to be pre-trained on a constant number of samples, the kernel scaling does not catch up to the neural network scaling. Finally, we show that the empirical NTK continues to evolve throughout most of the training, in contrast with prior work which suggests that it stabilizes after a few epochs of training. Altogether, our work establishes concrete limitations of the NTK approach in understanding scaling laws of real networks on natural datasets",

Recent work studies the ``forward'' KL $D_{KL}(p||q)$, which unlike reverse KL does not lead to variational approximations that underestimate uncertainty. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods were used to evaluate the expectation in computing the forward KL. This paper introduces Transport Score Climbing (TSC), a method that optimizes $D_{KL}(p||q)$ by using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) but running the HMC chain on a transformed, or warped, space. A function called the transport map performs the transformation by acting as a change-of-variable from the latent variable space. TSC uses HMC samples to dynamically train the transport map while optimizing $D_{KL}(p||q)$. TSC leverages synergies, where better transport maps lead to better HMC sampling, which then leads to better transport maps. We demonstrate TSC on synthetic and real data, including using TSC to train variational auto-encoders. We find that TSC achieves competitive performance on the experiments",

There has been substantial research on conceptual abstraction in AI, particularly using idealized domains such as Raven's Progressive Matrices and Bongard problems, but even when AI systems succeed on such problems, the systems are rarely evaluated in depth to see if they have actually grasped the concepts they are meant to capture. In this paper we describe an in-depth evaluation benchmark for the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), a collection of few-shot abstraction and analogy problems developed by Chollet (2019). In particular, we describe ConceptARC, a new, publicly available bench- mark in the ARC domain that systematically assesses abstraction and generalization abilities on a number of basic spatial and semantic concepts. ConceptARC differs from the original ARC dataset in that it is specifically organized around \"concept groups\"—sets of problems that focus on specific concepts and that are vary in complexity and level of abstraction. We report results on testing humans on this benchmark as well as three machine solvers: the top two programs from a 2021 ARC competition and OpenAI's GPT-4. Our results show that humans substantially outperform the machine solvers on this benchmark, showing abilities to abstract and generalize concepts that are not yet captured by AI systems. We believe that this benchmark will spur improvements in the development of AI systems for conceptual abstraction and in the effective evaluation of such systems",

(2022) , which includes error feedback (EF21), lazily aggregated gradient (LAG), and their combination as special cases, and offers the current state-of-the-art rates for these methods under weak assumptions. While the above mechanisms offer a fixed compression level or adapt between two extreme compression levels, we propose a much finer adaptation. In particular, we allow users to choose between selected contractive compression mechanisms, such as Top-$K$ sparsification with a user-defined selection of sparsification levels $K$, or quantization with a user-defined selection of quantization levels, or their combination. AdaCGD chooses the appropriate compressor and compression level adaptively during the optimization process. Besides i) proposing a theoretically-grounded multi-adaptive communication compression mechanism, we further ii) extend the 3PC framework to bidirectional compression, i.e., allow the server to compress as well, and iii) provide sharp convergence bounds in the strongly convex, convex, and nonconvex settings. The convex regime results are new even for several key special cases of our general mechanism, including 3PC and EF21.

In an online learning setting, Nature selects features and associates a true label with these features. A learner uses features to predict a label, which is compared to the true label, and a loss is incurred. The total loss over $T$ rounds, when compared to a loss incurred by a set of experts, is known as a regret. We introduce the notion of *expected worst case minimax regret* that generalizes and encompasses prior known minimax regrets. For such minimax regrets, we establish tight upper bounds via a novel concept of *stochastic global sequential covering*. We show that for a hypothesis class of VC-dimension $\\mathsf{VC}$ and $i.i.d.$ generated features over $T$ rounds, the cardinality of stochastic global sequential covering can be upper bounded with high probability (w.h.p.) by $e^{O(\\mathsf{VC} \\cdot \\log^2 T)}$. We then improve this bound by introducing a new complexity measure called the *Star-Littlestone* dimension, and show that classes with Star-Littlestone dimension $\\mathsf{SL}$ admit a stochastic global sequential covering of order $e^{O(\\mathsf{SL} \\cdot \\log T)}$. We further establish upper bounds for real valued classes with finite fat-shattering numbers. Finally, by applying information-theoretic tools for the fixed design minimax regrets, we provide lower bounds for expected worst case minimax regret.

In addition, many clinical imaging and disease modeling applications rely heavily on regression of continuous quantities. However, the applicability of self-supervised learning for these medical-imaging regression tasks has not been extensively studied. In this study, we develop a cross-domain self-supervised learning approach for disease prognostic modeling as a regression problem using medical images as input. We demonstrate that self-supervised pretraining can improve the prediction of Alzheimer's Disease progression from brain MRI.

This work investigates a new low-rank tensor model, called Low Separation Rank (LSR), in Generalized Linear Model (GLM) problems. The LSR model – which generalizes the well-known Tucker and CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) models, and is a special case of the Block Tensor Decomposition (BTD) model – is imposed onto the coefficient tensor in the GLM model. This work proposes a block coordinate descent algorithm for parameter estimation in LSR-structured tensor GLMs. Most importantly, it derives a minimax lower bound on the error threshold on estimating the coefficient tensor in LSR tensor GLM problems. The minimax bound is proportional to the intrinsic degrees of freedom in the LSR tensor GLM problem, suggesting that its sample complexity may be significantly lower than that of vectorized GLMs. This result can also be specialised to lower bound the estimation error in CP and Tucker-structured GLMs. The derived bounds are comparable to tight bounds in the literature for Tucker linear regression, and the tightness of the minimax lower bound is further assessed numerically. Finally, numerical experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed LSR tensor model for three regression types (linear, logistic and Poisson). Experiments on a collection of medical imaging datasets demonstrate the usefulness of the LSR model over other tensor models (Tucker and CP) on real, imbalanced data with limited available samples",

Shadow learning trains two models in parallel: a backbone model and a shadow model. The backbone is trained without any defense mechanism to obtain good performance on the main task.

In this paper, we propose mL-BFGS, a lightweight momentum-based L-BFGS algorithm that paves the way for quasi-Newton (QN) methods in large-scale distributed deep neural network (DNN) optimization. mL-BFGS introduces a nearly cost-free momentum scheme into L-BFGS update and greatly reduces stochastic noise in the Hessian, therefore stabilizing convergence during stochastic optimization. For model training at a large scale, mL-BFGS approximates a block-wise Hessian, thus enabling distributing compute and memory costs across all computing nodes. We provide a supporting convergence analysis for mL-BFGS in stochastic settings. To investigate mL-BFGS's potential in large-scale DNN training, we train benchmark neural models using mL-BFGS and compare performance with baselines (SGD, Adam, and other quasi-Newton methods). Results show that mL-BFGS achieves both noticeable iteration-wise and wall-clock speedup",

    "abstract": "While machine learning systems can be highly accurate in their training environments, their performance in real-world deployments can suffer significantly due to distribution shifts. Real-world distribution shifts involve various input distortions due to noise, weather, device and other variations. Many real-world distribution shifts are not represented in standard domain adaptation datasets and prior empirical work has shown that domain adaptation methods developed using these standard datasets may not generalize well to real-world distribution shifts. Furthermore, motivated by observations of the sensitivity of deep neural networks (DNN) to the spectral statistics of data, which can vary in real-world scenarios, we propose Fourier Moment Matching (FMM), a model-agnostic input transformation that matches the Fourier-amplitude statistics of source to target data using unlabeled samples. We demonstrate through extensive empirical evaluations across time-series, image classification and semantic segmentation tasks that FMM is effective both individually and when combined with a variety of existing methods to overcome real-world distribution shifts",

The algorithm features two main ingredients to achieve a near-optimal sample complexity while allowing for communication compression. First, the algorithm tracks both the averaged iterate and stochastic gradient using compressed gossiping consensus. Second, a momentum step is incorporated for adaptive variance reduction with the local gradient estimates. We show that DoCoM finds a near-stationary solution at all participating agents satisfying $\\mathbb{E}[ \\| \\nabla f( \\theta ) \\|^2 ] = {\\cal O}( 1 / T^{2/3} )$ in $T$ iterations, where $f(\\theta)$ is a smooth (possibly non-convex) objective function. Notice that the proof is achieved via analytically designing a new potential function that tightly tracks the one-iteration progress of DoCoM. As a corollary, our analysis also established the linear convergence of DoCoM to a global optimal solution for objective functions with the Polyak-Łojasiewicz condition.

In this paper, we study RS for attributed graphs, and focus on finding representative nodes that optimize the accuracy of a model trained on the selected representatives. Theoretically, we establish a new hardness result for RS (in the absence of a graph structure) by proving that a particular, highly practical variant of it (RS for Learning) is hard to approximate in polynomial time within any reasonable factor, which implies a significant potential gap between the optimum solution of widely-used surrogate functions and the actual accuracy of the model. We then study the setting where a (homophilous) graph structure is available, or can be constructed, between the data points. We show that with an appropriate modeling approach, the presence of such a structure can turn a hard RS (for learning) problem into one that can be effectively solved. To this end, we develop RS-GNN, a representation learning-based RS model based on Graph Neural Networks. Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of RS-GNN on problems with predefined graph structures as well as problems with graphs induced from node feature similarities, by showing that RS-GNN achieves significant improvements over established baselines on a suite of eight benchmarks",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Deep neural networks trained by minimizing the average risk can achieve strong average performance. Still, their performance for a subgroup may degrade if the subgroup is underrepresented in the overall data population. Group distributionally robust optimization (Sagawa et al., 2020a), or group DRO in short, is a widely used baseline for learning models with strong worst-group performance. We note that this method requires group labels for every example at training time and can overfit to small groups, requiring strong regularization. Given a limited amount of group labels at training time, Just Train Twice (Liu et al., 2021), or JTT in short, is a two-stage method that infers a pseudo group label for every unlabeled example first, then applies group DRO based on the inferred group labels. The inference process is also sensitive to overfitting, sometimes involving additional hyperparameters. This paper designs a simple method based on the idea of classifier retraining on independent splits of the training data. We find that using a novel sample-splitting procedure achieves robust worst-group performance in the fine-tuning step. When evaluated on benchmark image and text classification tasks, our approach consistently performs favorably to group DRO, JTT, and other strong baselines when either group labels are available during training or are only given in validation sets. Importantly, our method only relies on a single hyperparameter, which adjusts the fraction of labels used for training feature extractors vs. training classification layers. We justify the rationale of our splitting scheme with a generalization-bound analysis of the worst-group loss",

However, current approaches mainly rely on supervised fine-tuning objectives borrowed from text generation, neglecting unique sequence-level characteristics of code, including but not limited to compilability as well as syntactic and functional correctness. To address this limitation, we propose PPOCoder, a new framework for code generation that synergistically combines pre-trained PL models with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) which is a widely used deep reinforcement learning technique. By utilizing non-differentiable feedback from code execution and structure alignment, PPOCoder seamlessly integrates external code-specific knowledge into the model optimization process. It's important to note that PPOCoder is a task-agnostic and model-agnostic framework that can be used across different code generation tasks and PLs. Extensive experiments on three code generation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach compared to SOTA methods, achieving significant improvements in compilation success rates and functional correctness across different PLs",

Research in this area, however, has been mainly focused on image and graph-structured data, leaving high-stakes tasks whose data is tabular out of reach of existing methods. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing the first definition of what a high-level concept may entail in tabular data. We use this definition to propose Tabular Concept Bottleneck Models (TabCBMs), a family of interpretable self-explaining neural architectures capable of learning high-level concept explanations for tabular tasks. As our method produces concept-based explanations both when partial concept supervision or no concept supervision is available at training time, it is adaptable to settings where concept annotations are missing. We evaluate our method in both synthetic and real-world tabular tasks and show that TabCBM outperforms or performs competitively compared to state-of-the-art methods, while providing a high level of interpretability as measured by its ability to discover known high-level concepts. Finally, we show that TabCBM can discover important high-level concepts in synthetic datasets inspired by critical tabular tasks (e.g., single-cell RNAseq) and allows for human-in-the-loop concept interventions in which an expert can identify and correct mispredicted concepts to boost the model's performance",

In regimes where data is limited or assumptions about the statistical structure of the data are not met, we demonstrate that the spectral estimate provides a good initialization for Laplace-EM fitting.

In this paper, we use a random graph generator to systematically investigate how the graph size and structural properties affect the predictive performance of GNNs. We present specific evidence that the average node degree is a key feature in determining whether GNNs can generalize to unseen graphs, and that the use of multiple node update functions can improve the generalization performance of GNNs when dealing with graphs of multimodal degree distributions. Accordingly, we propose a multi-module GNN framework that allows the network to adapt flexibly to new graphs by generalizing a single canonical nonlinear transformation over aggregated inputs.

In this paper, we devise a proxy matching task that allows us to evaluate which kinds of assistive information improve decision makers' performance (in terms of accuracy and time). Through a crowdsourced (N = 271 participants) study, we find that providing black-box model explanations reduces users' accuracy on the matching task, contrary to the commonly-held belief that they can be helpful by allowing better understanding of the model. On the other hand, custom methods that are designed to closely attend to some task-specific desiderata are found to be effective in improving user performance. Surprisingly, we also find that the users' perceived utility of assistive information is misaligned with their objective utility (measured through their task performance)",

By leveraging large amounts of unlabeled image data, recent CL methods have achieved promising results when pretrained on large-scale datasets, such as ImageNet. However, most of them consider the augmented views from the same instance are positive pairs, while views from other instances are negative ones. Such binary partition insufficiently considers the relation between samples and tends to yield worse performance when generalized on images in the wild. In this paper, to further improve the performance of CL and enhance its robustness on various datasets, we propose a doubly CL strategy that contrasts positive samples and negative ones within themselves separately. We realize this strategy with contrastive attraction and contrastive repulsion (CACR), which makes the query not only exert a greater force to attract more distant positive samples but also do so to repel closer negative samples. Theoretical analysis reveals that CACR generalizes CL's behavior by positive attraction and negative repulsion. It further considers the intra-contrastive relation within the positive and negative pairs to narrow the gap between the sampled and true distribution, which is important when datasets are less curated. Extensive large-scale experiments on standard vision tasks show that CACR not only consistently outperforms existing CL methods on benchmark datasets, but also shows better robustness when generalized on imbalanced image datasets",

Firstly, our architecture defines a restricted but expressive continuous relaxation of the space of first-order logic programs by assigning weights to predicates instead of rules, in contrast to most previous neural-logic approaches. Secondly, with this differentiable architecture, we propose several (supervised and RL) training procedures, based on gradient descent, which can recover a fully-interpretable solution (i.e., logic formula). Thirdly, to accelerate RL training, we also design a novel critic architecture that enables actor-critic algorithms. Fourthly, to solve hard problems, we propose an incremental training procedure that can learn a logic program progressively. Compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) differentiable ILP methods, DLM successfully solves all the considered ILP problems with a higher percentage of successful seeds (up to 3.5x). On RL problems, without requiring an interpretable solution, DLM outperforms other non-interpretable neural-logic RL approaches in terms of rewards (up to 3.9%). When enforcing interpretability, DLM can solve harder RL problems (e.g., Sorting, Path) than other interpretable RL methods. Moreover, we show that deep logic programs can be learned via incremental supervised training. In addition to this excellent performance, DLM can scale well in terms of memory and computational time, especially during the testing phase where it can deal with much more constants (>2x) than SOTA",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Adversarial Training (AT) has been found to substantially improve the robustness of deep learning classifiers against adversarial attacks. AT involves obtaining robustness by including adversarial examples in training a classifier. Most variants of AT algorithms treat every training example equally. However, recent works have shown that better performance is achievable by treating them unequally. In addition, it has been observed that AT exerts an uneven influence on different classes in a training set and unfairly hurts examples corresponding to classes that are inherently harder to classify. Consequently, various reweighting schemes have been proposed that assign unequal weights to robust losses of individual examples in a training set. In this work, we propose a novel instance-wise reweighting scheme. It considers the vulnerability of each natural example and the resulting information loss on its adversarial counterpart occasioned by adversarial attacks. Through extensive experiments, we show that our proposed method significantly improves over existing reweighting schemes, especially against strong white and black-box attacks",

    "abstract": "Lifelong learning aims to create AI systems that continuously and incrementally learn during a lifetime, similar to biological learning. Attempts so far have met problems, including catastrophic forgetting, interference among tasks, and the inability to exploit previous knowledge. While considerable research has focused on learning multiple supervised classification tasks that involve changes in the input distribution, lifelong reinforcement learning (LRL) must deal with variations in the state and transition distributions, and in the reward functions. Modulating masks with a fixed backbone network, recently developed for classification, are particularly suitable to deal with such a large spectrum of task variations. In this paper, we adapted modulating masks to work with deep LRL, specifically PPO and IMPALA agents. The comparison with LRL baselines in both discrete and continuous RL tasks shows superior performance. We further investigated the use of a linear combination of previously learned masks to exploit previous knowledge when learning new tasks: not only is learning faster, the algorithm solves tasks that we could not otherwise solve from scratch due to extremely sparse rewards. The results suggest that RL with modulating masks is a promising approach to lifelong learning, to the composition of knowledge to learn increasingly complex tasks, and to knowledge reuse for efficient and faster learning",

    "abstract": "The lack of out-of-domain generalization is a critical weakness of deep networks for semantic segmentation. Previous studies relied on the assumption of a static model, i. e., once the training process is complete, model parameters remain fixed at test time. In this work, we challenge this premise with a self-adaptive approach for semantic segmentation that adjusts the inference process to each input sample. Self-adaptation operates on two levels. First, it fine-tunes the parameters of convolutional layers to the input image using consistency regularization. Second, in Batch Normalization layers, self-adaptation interpolates between the training and the reference distribution derived from a single test sample. Despite both techniques being well known in the literature, their combination sets new state-of-the-art accuracy on synthetic-to-real generalization benchmarks. Our empirical study suggests that self-adaptation may complement the established practice of model regularization at training time for improving deep network generalization to out-of-domain data.

    "abstract": "Ensuring fairness in machine learning models is a difficult problem from both a formulation and implementation perspective. One sensible criterion for achieving fairness is Equalised Odds, which requires that subjects in protected and unprotected groups have equal true and false positive rates. However, practical implementation is challenging. This work proposes two ways to address this issue through the conditional independence operator. First, given the output values, it is used as a fairness measure of independence between model predictions and sensitive variables. Second, it is used as a regularisation term in the problem formulation, which seeks optimal models that balance performance and fairness concerning the sensitive variables. To illustrate the potential of our approach, we consider different scenarios. First, we use the Gaussian model to provide new insights into the problem formulation and numerical results on its convergence. Second, we present the formulation using the conditional cross-covariance operator. We anticipate that a closed-form solution is possible in the general problem formulation, including in the case of a kernel formulation setting. Third, we introduce a normalised criterion of the conditional independence operator. All formulations are posed under the risk minimisation principle, which leads to theoretical results on the performance. Additionally, insights are provided into using these operators under a Gaussian Process setting. Our methods are compared to state-of-the-art methods in terms of performance and fairness metrics on a representative set of real problems. The results obtained with our proposed methodology show promising performance-fairness curves. Furthermore, we discuss the usefulness of linear weights in the fair model to describe the behaviour of the features when enforcing fairness over a particular set of input features",

Recent work (e.g. score-matching networks, diffusion models) has approached the IGM problem from the perspective of pushing synthetic source data toward the target distribution via dynamical perturbations or flows in the ambient space. In this direction, we present the score difference (SD) between arbitrary target and source distributions as a flow that optimally reduces the Kullback-Leibler divergence between them while also solving the Schrödinger bridge problem. We apply the SD flow to convenient proxy distributions, which are aligned if and only if the original distributions are aligned. We demonstrate the formal equivalence of this formulation to denoising diffusion models under certain conditions. We also show that the training of generative adversarial networks includes a hidden data-optimization sub-problem, which induces the SD flow under certain choices of loss function when the discriminator is optimal. As a result, the SD flow provides a theoretical link between model classes that individually address the three challenges of the \"generative modeling trilemma\"—high sample quality, mode coverage, and fast sampling—thereby setting the stage for a unified approach",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Variational inference with Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) enables learning of highly tractable yet multi-modal approximations of intractable target distributions with up to a few hundred dimensions. The two currently most effective methods for GMM-based variational inference, VIPS and iBayes-GMM, both employ independent natural gradient updates for the individual components and their weights. We show for the first time, that their derived updates are equivalent, although their practical implementations and theoretical guarantees differ. We identify several design choices that distinguish both approaches, namely with respect to sample selection, natural gradient estimation, stepsize adaptation, and whether trust regions are enforced or the number of components adapted. We argue that for both approaches, the quality of the learned approximations can heavily suffer from the respective design choices: By updating the individual components using samples from the mixture model, iBayes-GMM often fails to produce meaningful updates to low-weight components, and by using a zero-order method for estimating the natural gradient, VIPS scales badly to higher-dimensional problems. Furthermore, we show that information-geometric trust-regions (used by VIPS) are effective even when using first-order natural gradient estimates, and often outperform the improved Bayesian learning rule (iBLR) update used by iBayes-GMM. We systematically evaluate the effects of design choices and show that a hybrid approach significantly outperforms both prior works. Along with this work, we publish our highly modular and efficient implementation for natural gradient variational inference with Gaussian mixture models, which supports $432$ different combinations of design choices, facilitates the reproduction of all our experiments, and may prove valuable for the practitioner",

In both cases the gradient formula involves a solution of the semi-dual formulation of the optimal transport cost. Our study makes a connection between the gradient of the WGAN loss function and the Laguerre diagrams associated to semi-discrete transport maps. The learning problem is addressed with an alternating algorithm, which is in general not convergent.

The study is mainly motivated by that random views, used in contrastive learning, and random masked (visible) patches, used in masked image modeling, are often about object parts. We explain that contrastive learning is a part-to-whole task: the projection layer hallucinates the whole object representation from the object part representation learned from the encoder, and that masked image modeling is a part-to-part task: the masked patches of the object are hallucinated from the visible patches. The explanation suggests that the self-supervised pretrained encoder leans toward understanding the object part. We empirically compare the off-the-shelf encoders pretrained with several representative methods on object-level recognition and part-level recognition. The results show that the fully-supervised model outperforms self-supervised models for object-level recognition, and most self-supervised contrastive learning and masked image modeling methods outperform the fully-supervised method for part-level recognition.

    "abstract": "Running Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on large graphs suffers from notoriously inefficiency. This is attributed to the sparse graph-based operations, which is hard to be accelerated by community hardware, e.g., GPUs and CPUs. One potential solution is to ``sketch'' the original graph by removing unimportant edges, then both the training and inference process are executed on the sparsified graph with improved efficiency. Traditional graph sparsification work calculates the edge importance score, i.e., effective resistance, from graph topology with theoretical guarantee. However, estimating effective resistance is even more expensive than training GNNs itself. Later, learning-based sparsification methods propose to learn the edge importance from data, but with significant overhead due to the extra learning process. Thus, both of them introduce significant ahead-of-training overhead. In this paper, we experimentally and theoretically prove that effective resistance can be approximated using only the node degree information and achieve similar node presentations on graph with/without sparsification. Based on this finding, we propose DSpar, to sparsify the graph once before training based on only the node degree information with negligible ahead-of-training overhead. In practice, for the training phase, DSpar achieves up to $5.9\\times$ faster than baseline with almost no accuracy drop. For the inference phase, DSpar reduces up to $90\\%$ latency",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Prevailing supervised deep graph learning models often suffer from the issue of label scarcity, leading to performance degradation in the face of limited annotated data. Although numerous graph few-shot learning (GFL) methods have been developed to mitigate this problem, they tend to rely excessively on labeled data. This over-reliance on labeled data can result in impaired generalization ability in the test phase due to the existence of a distribution gap. Moreover, existing GFL methods lack a general purpose as their designs are coupled with task or data-specific characteristics. To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel Self-Distilled Graph Few-shot Learning framework (SDGFL) that is both general and effective. SDGFL leverages a self-distilled contrastive learning procedure to boost GFL. Specifically, our model first pre-trains a graph encoder with contrastive learning using unlabeled data. Later, the trained encoder is frozen as a teacher model to distill a student model with a contrastive loss. The distilled model is then fed to GFL. By learning data representation in a self-supervised manner, SDGFL effectively mitigates the distribution gap and enhances generalization ability. Furthermore, our proposed framework is task and data-independent, making it a versatile tool for general graph mining purposes. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, we introduce an information-based measurement that quantifies its capability. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that SDGFL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on various graph mining tasks across multiple datasets in the few-shot scenario.

    "abstract": "Collaborative filtering is the de facto standard for analyzing users' activities and building recommendation systems for items. In this work we develop Sliced Anti-symmetric Decomposition (SAD), a new model for collaborative filtering based on implicit feedback. In contrast to traditional techniques where a latent representation of users (user vectors) and items (item vectors) are estimated, SAD introduces one additional latent vector to each item, using a novel three-way tensor view of user-item interactions. This new vector extends user-item preferences calculated by standard dot products to general inner products, producing interactions between items when evaluating their relative preferences. SAD reduces to state-of-the-art (SOTA) collaborative filtering models when the vector collapses to 1, while in this paper we allow its value to be estimated from data. Allowing the values of the new item vector to be different from 1 has profound implications. It suggests users may have nonlinear mental models when evaluating items, allowing the existence of cycles in pairwise comparisons. We demonstrate the efficiency of SAD in both simulated and real world datasets containing over 1M user-item interactions. By comparing with seven SOTA collaborative filtering models with implicit feedbacks, SAD produces the most consistent personalized preferences, in the meanwhile maintaining top-level of accuracy in personalized recommendations.

Instead of restricting the policy to a parametric distribution class, we directly optimize the policy distribution and derive their close-form policy updates based on the Lagrangian duality. Theoretically, we show that WPO guarantees a monotonic performance improvement, and SPO provably converges to WPO as the entropic regularizer diminishes. Moreover, we prove that with a decaying Lagrangian multiplier to the trust region constraint, both methods converge to global optimality.

As in other fields of deep learning, tools have been devised to extract features such as sequence motifs that can explain the predictions made by a trained network. Here we intend to go beyond explainable machine learning and introduce SEISM, a selective inference procedure to test the association between these extracted features and the predicted phenotype. In particular, we discuss how training a one-layer convolutional network is formally equivalent to selecting motifs maximizing some association score. We adapt existing sampling-based selective inference procedures by quantizing this selection over an infinite set to a large but finite grid. Finally,we show that sampling under a specific choice of parameters is sufficient to characterize the composite null hypothesis typically used for selective inference - a result that goes well beyond our particular framework. We illustrate the behavior of our method in terms of calibration, power and speed and discuss its power/speed trade-off with a simpler data-split strategy.

    "abstract": "We consider Imitation Learning with dynamics variation between the expert demonstration (source domain) and the environment (target domain). Based on the popular framework of Adversarial Imitation Learning, we propose a novel algorithm – Dynamics Adapted Imitation Learning (DYNAIL), which incorporates the dynamics variation into the state-action occupancy measure matching as a regularization term. The dynamics variation is modeled by a pair of classifiers to distinguish between source dynamics and target dynamics. Theoretically, we provide an upper bound on the divergence between the learned policy and expert demonstrations in the source domain. Our error bound only depends on the expectation of the discrepancy between the source and target dynamics for the optimal policy in the target domain. The experiment evaluation validates that our method achieves superior results on high dimensional continuous control tasks, compared to existing imitation learning methods",

    "title": "The Meta-Evaluation Problem in Explainable AI: Identifying Reliable Estimators with MetaQuantus",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "One of the unsolved challenges in the field of Explainable AI (XAI) is determining how to most reliably estimate the quality of an explanation method in the absence of ground truth explanation labels. Resolving this issue is of utmost importance as the evaluation outcomes generated by competing evaluation methods (or ``quality estimators''), which aim at measuring the same property of an explanation method, frequently present conflicting rankings. Such disagreements can be challenging for practitioners to interpret, thereby complicating their ability to select the best-performing explanation method. We address this problem through a meta-evaluation of different quality estimators in XAI, which we define as ``the process of evaluating the evaluation method''. Our novel framework, MetaQuantus, analyses two complementary performance characteristics of a quality estimator: its resilience to noise and reactivity to randomness, thus circumventing the need for ground truth labels. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through a series of experiments, targeting various open questions in XAI such as the selection and hyperparameter optimisation of quality estimators. Our work is released under an open-source license (https://github.com/annahedstroem/MetaQuantus) to serve as a development tool for XAI- and Machine Learning (ML) practitioners to verify and benchmark newly constructed quality estimators in a given explainability context. With this work, we provide the community with clear and theoretically-grounded guidance for identifying reliable evaluation methods, thus facilitating reproducibility in the field",

To assess the discrepancy between the prediction and the ground-truth in the downstream tasks for these contrastive pairs, we adapt expected calibration error (ECE) to graph contrastive learning. The analysis of ECE motivates us to propose a novel regularization method, Contrast-Reg, to ensure that decreasing the contrastive loss leads to better performance in the downstream tasks. As a plug-in regularizer, Contrast-Reg effectively improves the performance of existing graph contrastive learning algorithms. We provide both theoretical and empirical results to demonstrate the effectiveness of Contrast-Reg in enhancing the generalizability of the Graph Neural Network (GNN) model and improving the performance of graph contrastive algorithms with different similarity definitions and encoder backbones across various downstream tasks",

Central to our framework is the proposed Extreme-Activation (EA) distance measure, which assesses similarities between representations by analyzing their activation patterns on data points that cause the highest level of activation. As spurious correlations often manifest in features of data that are anomalous to the desired task, such as watermarks or artifacts, we demonstrate that internal representations capable of detecting such artifactual concepts can be found by analyzing relationships within neural representations. We validate the EA metric quantitatively, demonstrating its effectiveness both in controlled scenarios and real-world applications.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Diversity is an important criterion for many areas of machine learning (ML), including generative modeling and dataset curation. However, existing metrics for measuring diversity are often domain-specific and limited in flexibility. In this paper we address the diversity evaluation problem by proposing the Vendi Score, which connects and extends ideas from ecology and quantum statistical mechanics to ml. The Vendi Score is defined as the exponential of the Shannon entropy of the eigenvalues of a similarity matrix. This matrix is induced by a user-defined similarity function applied to the sample to be evaluated for diversity. In taking a similarity function as input, the Vendi Score enables its user to specify any desired form of diversity. Importantly, unlike many existing metrics in ML, the Vendi Score does not require a reference dataset or distribution over samples or labels, it is therefore general and applicable to any generative model, decoding algorithm, and dataset from any domain where similarity can be defined. We showcase the Vendi Score on molecular generative modeling where we found it addresses shortcomings of the current diversity metric of choice in that domain. We also applied the Vendi Score to generative models of images and decoding algorithms of text where we found it confirms known results about diversity in those domains. Furthermore, we used the Vendi Score to measure mode collapse, a known shortcoming of generative adversarial networks (GANs). In particular, the Vendi Score revealed that even GANs that capture all the modes of a labelled dataset can be less diverse than the original dataset. Finally, the interpretability of the Vendi Score allowed us to diagnose several benchmark ML datasets for diversity, opening the door for diversity-informed data augmentation",

To formulate such problems, we consider a combinatorial contextual bandit setting with groups and changing action sets, where similar base arms arrive in groups and a set of base arms, called a super arm, must be chosen in each round to maximize super arm reward while satisfying the constraints of the rewards of groups from which base arms were chosen. To allow for greater flexibility, we let each base arm have two outcomes, modeled as the output of a two-output Gaussian process (GP), where one outcome is used to compute super arm reward and the other for group reward. We then propose a novel double-UCB GP-bandit algorithm, called Thresholded Combinatorial Gaussian Process Upper Confidence Bounds (TCGP-UCB), which balances between maximizing cumulative super arm reward and satisfying group reward constraints and can be tuned to prefer one over the other. We also define a new notion of regret that combines super arm regret with group reward constraint satisfaction and prove that TCGP-UCB incurs $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{KT\\overline{\\gamma}_{T}} )$ regret with high probability, where $\\overline{\\gamma}_{T}$ is the maximum information gain associated with the set of base arm contexts that appeared in the first $T$ rounds and $K$ is the maximum super arm cardinality over all rounds.

In many real-world scenarios, input features are not readily available at test time and must instead be acquired at significant cost. With A2MT, we aim to learn agents that actively select which modalities of an input to acquire, trading off acquisition cost and predictive performance. A2MT extends a previous task called active feature acquisition to temporal decision making about high-dimensional inputs. We propose a method based on the Perceiver IO architecture to address A2MT in practice. Our agents are able to solve a novel synthetic scenario requiring practically relevant cross-modal reasoning skills. On two large-scale, real-world datasets, Kinetics-700 and AudioSet, our agents successfully learn cost-reactive acquisition behavior. However, an ablation reveals they are unable to learn adaptive acquisition strategies, emphasizing the difficulty of the task even for state-of-the-art models.

In this work, we take initial steps towards rule-based systems that can reason with natural language but without manually constructing rules. We propose MetaQNL, a \"Quasi-Natural Language\" that can express both formal logic and natural language sentences, and MetaInduce, a learning algorithm that induces MetaQNL rules from training data consisting of questions and answers, with or without intermediate reasoning steps. In addition, we introduce soft matching—a flexible mechanism for applying rules without rigid matching, overcoming a typical source of brittleness in symbolic reasoning. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracies on multiple reasoning benchmarks; it learns compact models with much less data and produces not only answers but also checkable proofs.

This causes unfairness w.r.t the achievable accuracies of constrained devices, especially in cases with a skewed distribution of class labels across devices. We present a novel FL technique, CoCoFL, which maintains the full NN structure on all devices. To adapt to the devices' heterogeneous resources, CoCoFL freezes and quantizes selected layers, reducing communication, computation, and memory requirements, whereas other layers are still trained in full precision, enabling to reach a high accuracy. Thereby, CoCoFL efficiently utilizes the available resources on devices and allows constrained devices to make a significant contribution to the FL system, preserving fairness among participants (accuracy parity) and significantly improving final accuracy",

In this paper, we make the first effort and investigate online nonconvex-strongly-concave min-max optimization in the nonstationary environment.

We further generalize our study to the setting with stochastic first-order feedback, and show that a variation of TSODA can also achieve the same optimal regret in expectation.

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) models are costly to train as they can require a significant amount of data, computational resources and technical expertise. Thus, they constitute valuable intellectual property that needs protection from adversaries wanting to steal them. Ownership verification techniques allow the victims of model stealing attacks to demonstrate that a suspect model was in fact stolen from theirs. Although a number of ownership verification techniques based on watermarking or fingerprinting have been proposed, most of them fall short either in terms of security guarantees (well-equipped adversaries can evade verification) or computational cost. A fingerprinting technique, Dataset Inference (DI) has been shown to offer better robustness and efficiency than prior methods. The authors of DI provided a correctness proof for linear (suspect) models. However, in a subspace of the same setting, we prove that DI suffers from high false positives (FPs) -- it can incorrectly identify an independent model trained with non-overlapping data from the same distribution as stolen. We further prove that DI also triggers FPs in realistic, non-linear suspect models. We then confirm empirically that DI in the black-box setting leads to FPs, with high confidence. Second, we show that DI also suffers from false negatives (FNs) -- an adversary can fool DI by regularising a stolen model's decision boundaries using adversarial training, thereby leading to an FN. To this end, we demonstrate that black-box DI fails to identify a model adversarially trained from a stolen dataset -- the setting where DI is the hardest to evade. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings, the viability of fingerprinting-based ownership verification in general, and suggest directions for future work",

With analysis of the convergence rate of DP-SGD in a non-convex setting, we identify that randomly sparsifying gradients before clipping and noisification adjusts a trade-off between internal components of the convergence bound and leads to a smaller upper bound when the noise is dominant. Additionally, our theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations show that the trade-off is not trivial but possibly a unique property of DP-SGD, as either canceling noisification or gradient clipping eliminates the trade-off in the bound. This observation is indicative, as it implies DP-SGD has special inherent room for (even simply random) gradient compression. To verify the observation an utilize it, we propose an efficient and lightweight extension using random sparsification (RS) to strengthen DP-SGD. Experiments with various DP-SGD frameworks show that RS can improve performance. Additionally, the produced sparse gradients of RS exhibit advantages in reducing communication cost and strengthening privacy against reconstruction attacks, which are also key problems in private machine learning",

    "abstract": "Complex Query Answering (CQA) is an important and fundamental task for knowledge graph (KG) reasoning. Query encoding (QE) is proposed as a fast and robust solution to CQA. In the encoding process, most existing QE methods first parse the logical query into an executable computational direct-acyclic graph (DAG), then use neural networks to parameterize the operators, and finally, recursively execute these neuralized operators. However, the parameterization-and-execution paradigm may be potentially over-complicated, as it can be structurally simplified by a single neural network encoder. Meanwhile, sequence encoders, like LSTM and Transformer, proved to be effective for encoding semantic graphs in related tasks. Motivated by this, we propose sequential query encoding (SQE) as an alternative to encode queries for CQA. Instead of parameterizing and executing the computational graph, SQE first uses a search-based algorithm to linearize the computational graph to a sequence of tokens and then uses a sequence encoder to compute its vector representation. Then this vector representation is used as a query embedding to retrieve answers from the embedding space according to similarity scores. Despite its simplicity, SQE demonstrates state-of-the-art neural query encoding performance on FB15k, FB15k-237, and NELL on an extended benchmark including twenty-nine types of in-distribution queries. Further experiment shows that SQE also demonstrates comparable knowledge inference capability on out-of-distribution queries, whose query types are not observed during the training process",

By integrating the embedding representation of a language model, we generate fluent adversarial examples in the source language that maintain a high level of semantic similarity with the clean samples. Experimental results demonstrate that, for different translation tasks and NMT architectures, our white-box attack can severely degrade the translation quality while the semantic similarity between the original and the adversarial sentences stays high. Moreover, we show that TransFool is transferable to unknown target models. Finally, based on automatic and human evaluations, TransFool leads to improvement in terms of success rate, semantic similarity, and fluency compared to the existing attacks both in white-box and black-box settings.

In turn, we are able to provide a clean asymptotic convergence rate, where the burn-in time is guaranteed to be finite. Our proof is based on observing a similarity between FR gradient flows and simulated annealing with linear scaling, and facts about cumulant generating functions. We conclude with simple synthetic experiments that demonstrate our theoretical findings are indeed tight. Based on our numerical findings, we conjecture that the asymptotic rates of convergence for Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao gradient flows are possibly related to this expansion in some cases",

    "abstract": "When training deep neural networks, keeping all tensors in high precision (e.g., 32-bit or even 16-bit floats) is often wasteful. However, keeping all tensors in low precision (e.g., 8-bit floats) can lead to unacceptable accuracy loss. Hence, it is important to use a precision assignment—a mapping from all tensors (arising in training) to precision levels (high or low)—that keeps most of the tensors in low precision and leads to sufficiently accurate models. We provide a technique that explores this memory-accuracy tradeoff by generating precision assignments for convolutional neural networks that (i) use less memory and (ii) lead to more accurate convolutional networks at the same time, compared to the precision assignments considered by prior work in low-precision floating-point training. We evaluate our technique on image classiﬁcation tasks by training convolutional networks on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. Our method typically provides > 2× memory reduction over a baseline precision assignment while preserving training accuracy, and gives further reductions by trading off accuracy. Compared to other baselines which sometimes cause training to diverge, our method provides similar or better memory reduction while avoiding divergence",

    "abstract": "Quantum computers are known to provide speedups over classical state-of-the-art machine learning methods in some specialized settings. For example, quantum kernel methods have been shown to provide an exponential speedup on a learning version of the discrete logarithm problem. Understanding the generalization of quantum models is essential to realizing similar speedups on problems of practical interest. Recent results demonstrate that generalization is hindered by the exponential size of the quantum feature space. Although these results suggest that quantum models cannot generalize when the number of qubits is large, in this paper we show that these results rely on overly restrictive assumptions. We consider a wider class of models by varying a hyperparameter that we call quantum kernel bandwidth. We analyze the large-qubit limit and provide explicit formulas for the generalization of a quantum model that can be solved in closed form. Specifically, we show that changing the value of the bandwidth can take a model from provably not being able to generalize to any target function to good generalization for well-aligned targets. Our analysis shows how the bandwidth controls the spectrum of the kernel integral operator and thereby the inductive bias of the model. We demonstrate empirically that our theory correctly predicts how varying the bandwidth affects generalization of quantum models on challenging datasets, including those far outside our theoretical assumptions. We discuss the implications of our results for quantum advantage in machine learning",

We propose and motivate a new notion of privacy: \\emph{$\\alpha$-Level Marginal Distribution Privacy} ($\\alpha$-LMDP), which provides a statistical guarantee that the sensitive generative marginal distributions are different from the observed real data. We then propose \\emph{Privacy-Preserving Energy Models (PPEMs)}, a novel energy-based generative model formulation where the representations for these attributes are isolated from other attributes. This structured formulation motivates a learning procedure where a penalty based on a statistical goodness of fit test, the \\emph{Kernel Stein Discrepancy}, can be applied to only the attributes requiring privacy so that $\\alpha$-LMDP may be satisfied without affecting the other attributes. We evaluate this approach using financial and healthcare datasets and demonstrate that the resulting learnt generative models produce high fidelity synthetic data while preserving privacy.

However, existing AL sampling schemes may not perform well in out-of-distribution (OOD) data scenarios, where the unlabeled data pool contains samples that do not belong to the pre-defined categories of the target task. Achieving strong AL performance under OOD data scenarios presents a challenge due to the inherent conflict between AL sampling strategies and OOD data detection. For instance, both more informative in-distribution (ID) data and OOD data in an unlabeled data pool would be assigned high informativeness scores (e.g., high entropy) during AL processes. To address this dilemma, we propose a Monte-Carlo Pareto Optimization for Active Learning (POAL) sampling scheme, which selects optimal subsets of unlabeled samples with fixed batch size from the unlabeled data pool. We formulate the AL sampling task as a multi-objective optimization problem and employ Pareto optimization based on two conflicting objectives: (1) the conventional AL sampling scheme (e.g., maximum entropy) and (2) the confidence of excluding OOD data samples. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our POAL approach on classical Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) tasks",

Although recent work has proposed a variety of methods that can directly predict or theoretically bound the generalization capacity of a model, they rely on strong assumptions such as matching train/test distributions and access to model gradients. In order to characterize generalization when these assumptions are not satisfied, we propose neighborhood invariance, a measure of a classifier's output invariance in a local transformation neighborhood. Specifically, we sample a set of transformations and given an input test point, calculate the invariance as the largest fraction of transformed points classified into the same class. Crucially, our measure is simple to calculate, does not depend on the test point's true label, makes no assumptions about the data distribution or model, and can be applied even in out-of-domain (OOD) settings where existing methods cannot, requiring only selecting a set of appropriate data transformations. In experiments on robustness benchmarks in image classification, sentiment analysis, and natural language inference, we demonstrate a strong and robust correlation between our neighborhood invariance measure and actual OOD generalization on over 4,600 models evaluated on over 100 train/test domain pairs",

In this study, we examine the performance of popular first-order optimizers for different classes of distributional shift under empirical risk minimization and invariant risk minimization. We address this question for image and text classification using DomainBed, WILDS, and Backgrounds Challenge as testbeds for studying different types of shifts---namely correlation and diversity shift. We search over a wide range of hyperparameters and examine classification accuracy (in-distribution and out-of-distribution) for over 20,000 models. We arrive at the following findings, which we expect to be helpful for practitioners: i) adaptive optimizers (e.g., Adam) perform worse than non-adaptive optimizers (e.g., SGD, momentum SGD) on out-of-distribution performance. In particular, even though there is no significant difference in in-distribution performance, we show a measurable difference in out-of-distribution performance. ii) in-distribution performance and out-of-distribution performance exhibit three types of behavior depending on the dataset---linear returns, increasing returns, and diminishing returns. For example, in the training of natural language data using Adam, fine-tuning the performance of in-distribution performance does not significantly contribute to the out-of-distribution generalization performance",

However, in most research, the joint error is ignored because of its intractability. In this research, we argue that joint errors are essential for domain adaptation problems, particularly when the domain gap is large. To address this problem, we propose a novel objective related to the upper bound of the joint error. Moreover, we adopt a source/pseudo-target label-induced hypothesis space that can reduce the search space to further tighten this bound. To measure the dissimilarity between hypotheses, we define a novel cross-margin discrepancy to alleviate instability during adversarial learning.

This is rather surprising, since undersampling algorithms discard excess majority group data. To understand this phenomenon, we ask if learning is fundamentally constrained by a lack of minority group samples. We prove that this is indeed the case in the setting of nonparametric binary classification. Our results show that in the worst case, an algorithm cannot outperform undersampling unless there is a high degree of overlap between the train and test distributions (which is unlikely to be the case in real-world datasets), or if the algorithm leverages additional structure about the distribution shift. In particular, in the case of label shift we show that there is always an undersampling algorithm that is minimax optimal. In the case of group-covariate shift we show that there is an undersampling algorithm that is minimax optimal when the overlap between the group distributions is small. We also perform an experimental case study on a label shift dataset and find that in line with our theory, the test accuracy of robust neural network classifiers is constrained by the number of minority samples",

Interestingly, we show that the noise addition only affects the privacy risk but not the convergence or calibration, whereas the per-sample gradient clipping (under both flat and layerwise clipping styles) only affects the convergence and calibration. Furthermore, we observe that while DP models trained with small clipping norm usually achieve the best accurate, but are poorly calibrated and thus unreliable.

Depending on whether the scaling factor is positive or negative, ABSGD is guaranteed to converge to a stationary point of an information-regularized min-max or min-min DRO problem, respectively. Compared with existing class-level weighting schemes, our method can capture the diversity between individual examples within each class. Compared with existing individual-level weighting methods using meta-learning that require three backward propagations for computing mini-batch stochastic gradients, our method is more efficient with only one backward propagation at each iteration as in standard deep learning methods.

Trustworthiness is then predicted via a proxy incompetence score that is tightly linked to the performance of a classifier. We present a comprehensive experimental evaluation of existing proxy scores as incompetence scores for classification and highlight the resulting trade-offs between rejection rate and accuracy gain.

Although pairwise training methods have demonstrated promise in supervised metric learning and unsupervised contrastive learning, they remain less studied on noisy graphs, where the structural pairwise interactions (PI) between nodes are abundant and thus might benefit label noise learning rather than the pointwise methods. This paper bridges the gap by proposing a pairwise framework for noisy node classification on graphs, which relies on the PI as a primary learning proxy in addition to the pointwise learning from the noisy node class labels. Our proposed framework PI-GNN contributes two novel components: (1) a confidence-aware PI estimation model that adaptively estimates the PI labels, which are defined as whether the two nodes share the same node labels, and (2) a decoupled training approach that leverages the estimated PI labels to regularize a node classification model for robust node classification. Extensive experiments on different datasets and GNN architectures demonstrate the effectiveness of PI-GNN, yielding a promising improvement over the state-of-the-art methods.

We find that (1) near-deduplicating the data significantly boosts performance across all experiments, and (2) it is possible to match previously reported HumanEval and MBPP performance using only permissively licensed data. We make the dataset available at https://hf.co/BigCode, provide a tool called \"Am I in The Stack\" for developers to search The Stack for copies of their code (https://hf.co/spaces/bigcode/in-the-stack), and provide a process for code to be removed from the dataset",

    "abstract": "Multiplication layers are a key component in various influential neural network modules, including self-attention and hypernetwork layers. In this paper, we investigate the approximation capabilities of deep neural networks with intermediate neurons connected by simple multiplication operations. We consider two classes of target functions: generalized bandlimited functions, which are frequently used to model real-world signals with finite bandwidth, and Sobolev-Type balls, which are embedded in the Sobolev Space $\\mathcal{W}^{r,2}$. Our results demonstrate that multiplicative neural networks can approximate these functions with significantly fewer layers and neurons compared to standard ReLU neural networks, with respect to both input dimension and approximation error. These findings suggest that multiplicative gates can outperform standard feed-forward layers and have potential for improving neural network design",

    "title": "Assuming Locally Equal Calibration Errors for Non-Parametric Multiclass Calibration",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "A probabilistic classifier is considered calibrated if it outputs probabilities equal to the expected class distribution given the classifier's output. Calibration is essential in safety-critical tasks where small deviations between the predicted probabilities and the actually observed class proportions can incur high costs. A common approach to improve the calibration of a classifier is to use a hold-out data set and a post-hoc calibration method to learn a correcting transformation for the classifier's output. This work explores the field of post-hoc calibration methods for multi-class classifiers and formulates two assumptions about the probability simplex which have been used by many existing non-parametric calibration methods, but despite this, have never been explicitly stated: assuming locally equal label distributions or assuming locally equal calibration errors. Based on the latter assumption, an intuitive non-parametric post-hoc calibration method is proposed, which is shown to offer improvements to the state-of-the-art according to the expected calibration error metric on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 data sets",

    "abstract": "Machine learning frameworks such as graph neural networks typically rely on a given, fixed graph to exploit relational inductive biases and thus effectively learn from network data. However, when said graphs are (partially) unobserved, noisy, or dynamic, the problem of inferring graph structure from data becomes relevant. In this paper, we postulate a graph convolutional relationship between the observed and latent graphs, and formulate the graph structure learning task as a network inverse (deconvolution) problem. In lieu of eigendecomposition-based spectral methods or iterative optimization solutions, we unroll and truncate proximal gradient iterations to arrive at a parameterized neural network architecture that we call a Graph Deconvolution Network (GDN). GDNs can learn a distribution of graphs in a supervised fashion, perform link prediction or edge-weight regression tasks by adapting the loss function, and they are inherently inductive as well as node permutation equivariant. We corroborate GDN's superior graph learning performance and its generalization to larger graphs using synthetic data in supervised settings. Moreover, we demonstrate the robustness and representation power of GDNs on real world neuroimaging and social network datasets",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Photorealistic object appearance modeling from 2D images is a constant topic in vision and graphics. While neural implicit methods (such as Neural Radiance Fields) have shown high-fidelity view synthesis results, they cannot relight the captured objects. More recent neural inverse rendering approaches have enabled object relighting, but they represent surface properties as simple BRDFs, and therefore cannot handle translucent objects. We propose Object-Centric Neural Scattering Functions (OSFs) for learning to reconstruct object appearance from only images. OSFs not only support free-viewpoint object relighting, but also can model both opaque and translucent objects. While accurately modeling subsurface light transport for translucent objects can be highly complex and even intractable for neural methods, OSFs learn to approximate the radiance transfer from a distant light to an outgoing direction at any spatial location. This approximation avoids explicitly modeling complex subsurface scattering, making learning a neural implicit model tractable. Experiments on real and synthetic data show that OSFs accurately reconstruct appearances for both opaque and translucent objects, allowing faithful free-viewpoint relighting as well as scene composition. In our supplementary material, we include a video for an overview. Project website with video results: https://kovenyu.com/OSF/",

Contextual Reinforcement Learning (cRL) provides a framework to model such changes in a principled manner, thereby enabling flexible, precise and interpretable task specification and generation. Our goal is to show how the framework of cRL contributes to improving zero-shot generalization in RL through meaningful benchmarks and structured reasoning about generalization tasks. We confirm the insight that optimal behavior in cRL requires context information, as in other related areas of partial observability. To empirically validate this in the cRL framework, we provide various context-extended versions of common RL environments. They are part of the first benchmark library, CARL, designed for generalization based on cRL extensions of popular benchmarks, which we propose as a testbed to further study general agents. We show that in the contextual setting, even simple RL environments become challenging - and that naive solutions are not enough to generalize across complex context spaces",

    "abstract": "The completeness axiom renders the explanation of a post-hoc eXplainable AI (XAI) method only locally faithful to the model, i.e. for a single decision. For the trustworthy application of XAI, in particular for high-stake decisions, a more global model understanding is required. To this end, concept-based methods have been proposed, which are however not guaranteed to be bound to the actual model reasoning. To circumvent this problem, we propose Multi-dimensional Concept Discovery (MCD) as an extension of previous approaches that fulfills a completeness relation on the level of concepts. Our method starts from general linear subspaces as concepts and does neither require reinforcing concept interpretability nor re-training of model parts. We propose sparse subspace clustering to discover improved concepts and fully leverage the potential of multi-dimensional subspaces. MCD offers two complementary analysis tools for concepts in input space: (1) concept activation maps, that show where a concept is expressed within a sample, allowing for concept characterization through prototypical samples, and (2) concept relevance heatmaps, that decompose the model decision into concept contributions. Both tools together enable a detailed global understanding of the model reasoning, which is guaranteed to relate to the model via a completeness relation. Thus, MCD paves the way towards more trustworthy concept-based XAI. We empirically demonstrate the superiority of MCD against more constrained concept definitions",

    "abstract": "Fair visual recognition has become critical for preventing demographic disparity. A major cause of model unfairness is the imbalanced representation of different groups in training data. Recently, several works aim to alleviate this issue using generated data. However, these approaches often use generated data to obtain similar amounts of data across groups, which is not optimal for achieving high fairness due to different learning difficulties and generated data qualities across groups. To address this issue, we propose a novel adaptive sampling approach that leverages both real and generated data for fairness. We design a bilevel optimization that finds the optimal data sampling ratios among groups and between real and generated data while training a model. The ratios are dynamically adjusted considering both the model's accuracy as well as its fairness. To efficiently solve our non-convex bilevel optimization, we propose a simple approximation to the solution given by the implicit function theorem. Extensive experiments show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art fairness and accuracy on the CelebA and ImageNet People Subtree datasets. We also observe that our method adaptively relies less on the generated data when it has poor quality.

In this work, we carry out user studies (1,330 responses from 190 participants) to systematically assess how people with differing levels of expertise respond to different types of predictive uncertainty (i.e., posterior predictive distributions with different shapes and variances) in the context of ML assisted decision making for predicting apartment rental prices. We found that showing posterior predictive distributions led to smaller disagreements with the ML model's predictions, regardless of the shapes and variances of the posterior predictive distributions we considered, and that these effects may be sensitive to expertise in both ML and the domain. This suggests that posterior predictive distributions can potentially serve as useful decision aids which should be used with caution and take into account the type of distribution and the expertise of the human",

While previous generations of vision models were shown to lack robustness to factors such as pose, the extent to which this next generation of models are more robust remains unclear. To study this question, we develop a dataset of more than 7 million images with controlled changes in pose, position background, lighting color, and size. We study not only how robust recent state-of- the-art models are, but also the extent to which models can generalize to variation in each of these factors. We consider a catalog of recent vision models, including vision transformers (ViT), self-supervised models such as masked autoencoders (MAE), and models trained on larger datasets such as CLIP. We find that even today's best models are not robust to common changes in pose, size, and background. When some samples varied during training, we found models required a significant portion of instances seen varying to generalize—though eventually robustness did improve. When variability is only witnessed for some classes however, we found that models did not generalize to other classes unless the classes were very similar to those seen varying during training. We hope our work will shed further light on the blind spots of SoTA models and spur the development of more robust vision models",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In real-world multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) applications, agents may not have perfect state information (e.g., due to inaccurate measurement or malicious attacks), which challenges the robustness of agents' policies. Though robustness is getting important in MARL deployment, little prior work has studied state uncertainties in MARL, neither in problem formulation nor algorithm design. Motivated by this robustness issue and the lack of corresponding studies, we study the problem of MARL with state uncertainty in this work. We provide the first attempt to the theoretical and empirical analysis of this challenging problem. We first model the problem as a Markov Game with state perturbation adversaries (MG-SPA) by introducing a set of state perturbation adversaries into a Markov Game. We then introduce robust equilibrium (RE) as the solution concept of an MG-SPA. We conduct a fundamental analysis regarding MG-SPA such as giving conditions under which such a robust equilibrium exists. Then we propose a robust multi-agent Q-learning (RMAQ) algorithm to find such an equilibrium, with convergence guarantees. To handle high-dimensional state-action space, we design a robust multi-agent actor-critic (RMAAC) algorithm based on an analytical expression of the policy gradient derived in the paper. Our experiments show that the proposed RMAQ algorithm converges to the optimal value function; our RMAAC algorithm outperforms several MARL and robust MARL methods in multiple multi-agent environments when state uncertainty is present.

    "abstract": "Optimization problems with group sparse regularization are ubiquitous in various popular downstream applications, such as feature selection and compression for Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Nonetheless, the existing methods in the literature do not perform particularly well when such regularization is used in combination with a stochastic loss function. In particular, it is challenging to design a computationally efficient algorithm with a convergence guarantee and can compute group-sparse solutions. Recently, a half-space stochastic projected gradient (HSPG) method was proposed that partly addressed these challenges. This paper presents a substantially enhanced version of HSPG that we call AdaHSPG+ that makes two noticeable advances. First, AdaHSPG+ is shown to have a stronger convergence result under significantly looser assumptions than those required by HSPG. This improvement in convergence is achieved by integrating variance reduction techniques with a new adaptive strategy for iteratively predicting the support of a solution. Second, AdaHSPG+ requires significantly less parameter tuning compared to HSPG, thus making it more practical and user-friendly. This advance is achieved by designing automatic and adaptive strategies for choosing the type of step employed at each iteration and for updating key hyperparameters. The numerical effectiveness of our proposed AdaHSPG+ algorithm is demonstrated on both convex and non-convex benchmark problems. The source code is available at https://github.com/tianyic/adahspg",

    "abstract": "PAC-Bayes is a well-established framework for analyzing generalization performance in machine learning models. This framework provides a bound on the expected population error by considering the sum of training error and the divergence between posterior and prior distributions. In addition to being a successful generalization bound analysis tool, the PAC-Bayesian bound can also be incorporated into an objective function for training probabilistic neural networks, which we refer to simply as {\\it Deep PAC-Bayesian Learning}. Deep PAC-Bayesian learning has been shown to achieve competitive expected test set error and provide a tight generalization bound in practice at the same time through gradient descent training. Despite its empirical success, theoretical analysis of deep PAC-Bayesian learning for neural networks is rarely explored. To this end, this paper proposes a theoretical convergence and generalization analysis for Deep PAC-Bayesian learning. For a deep and wide probabilistic neural network, our analysis shows that PAC-Bayesian learning corresponds to solving a kernel ridge regression when the probabilistic neural tangent kernel (PNTK) is used as the kernel. We utilize this outcome in conjunction with the PAC-Bayes $\\mathcal{C}$-bound, enabling us to derive an analytical and guaranteed PAC-Bayesian generalization bound for the first time. Finally, drawing insight from our theoretical results, we propose a proxy measure for efficient hyperparameter selection, which is proven to be time-saving on various benchmarks.

    "abstract": "Many real-world problems are inherently multimodal, from the communicative modalities humans use to express social and emotional states such as spoken language, gestures, and paralinguistics to the force, proprioception, and visual sensors ubiquitous on robots. While there has been an explosion of interest in multimodal representation learning, these methods are still largely focused on a small set of modalities, primarily in the language, vision, and audio space. In order to accelerate generalization towards diverse and understudied modalities, this paper studies efficient representation learning for high-modality scenarios involving a large set of diverse modalities. Since adding new models for every new modality or task becomes prohibitively expensive, a critical technical challenge is heterogeneity quantification: how can we measure which modalities encode similar information and interactions in order to permit parameter sharing with previous modalities? This paper proposes two new information theoretic metrics for heterogeneity quantification: (1) modality heterogeneity studies how similar $2$ modalities $\\{X_1,X_2\\}$ are by measuring how much information can be transferred from $X_1$ to $X_2$, while (2) interaction heterogeneity studies how similarly pairs of modalities $\\{X_1,X_2\\}, \\{X_3,X_4\\}$ interact by measuring how much interaction information can be transferred from $\\{X_1,X_2\\}$ to $\\{X_3,X_4\\}$. We show the importance of these $2$ proposed metrics in high-modality scenarios as a way to automatically prioritize the fusion of modalities that contain unique information or unique interactions. The result is a single model, HighMMT, that scales up to $10$ modalities (text, image, audio, video, sensors, proprioception, speech, time-series, sets, and tables) and $15$ tasks from $5$ different research areas. Not only does HighMMT outperform prior methods on the tradeoff between performance and efficiency, it also demonstrates a crucial scaling behavior: performance continues to improve with each modality added, and it transfers to entirely new modalities and tasks during fine-tuning.

To this end, we propose two new fairness metrics, Area Between Probability density function Curves (ABPC) and Area Between Cumulative density function Curves (ABCC), to precisely measure the violation of demographic parity at the distribution level.

    "abstract": "Deep learning models, even the-state-of-the-art ones, are highly vulnerable to adversarial examples. Adversarial training is one of the most efficient methods to improve the model's robustness. The key factor for the success of adversarial training is the capability to generate qualified and divergent adversarial examples which satisfy some objectives/goals (e.g., finding adversarial examples that maximize the model losses for simultaneously attacking multiple models). Therefore, multi-objective optimization (MOO) is a natural tool for adversarial example generation to achieve multiple objectives/goals simultaneously. However, we observe that a naive application of MOO tends to maximize all objectives/goals equally, without caring if an objective/goal has been achieved yet. This leads to useless effort to further improve the goal-achieved tasks, while putting less focus on the goal-unachieved tasks. In this paper, we propose \\emph{Task Oriented MOO} to address this issue, in the context where we can explicitly define the goal achievement for a task. Our principle is to only maintain the goal-achieved tasks, while letting the optimizer spend more effort on improving the goal-unachieved tasks. We conduct comprehensive experiments for our Task Oriented MOO on various adversarial example generation schemes. The experimental results firmly demonstrate the merit of our proposed approach",

    "abstract": "The robust PCA of covariance matrices plays an essential role when isolating key explanatory features. The currently available methods for performing such a low-rank plus sparse decomposition are matrix specific, meaning, those algorithms must re-run for every new matrix. Since these algorithms are computationally expensive, it is preferable to learn and store a function that nearly instantaneously performs this decomposition when evaluated. Therefore, we introduce Denise, a deep learning-based algorithm for robust PCA of covariance matrices, or more generally, of symmetric positive semidefinite matrices, which learns precisely such a function. Theoretical guarantees for Denise are provided. These include a novel universal approximation theorem adapted to our geometric deep learning problem and convergence to an optimal solution to the learning problem. Our experiments show that Denise matches state-of-the-art performance in terms of decomposition quality, while being approximately $2000\\times$ faster than the state-of-the-art, principal component pursuit (PCP), and $200 \\times$ faster than the current speed-optimized method, fast PCP",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Mean Field Control (MFC) is a powerful approximation tool to solve large-scale Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) problems. However, the success of MFC relies on the presumption that given the local states and actions of all the agents, the next (local) states of the agents evolve conditionally independent of each other. Here we demonstrate that even in a MARL setting where agents share a common global state in addition to their local states evolving conditionally independently (thus introducing a correlation between the state transition processes of individual agents), the MFC can still be applied as a good approximation tool. The global state is assumed to be non-decomposable i.e., it cannot be expressed as a collection of local states of the agents. We compute the approximation error as $\\mathcal{O}(e)$ where $e=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}\\left[\\sqrt{|\\mathcal{X}|} +\\sqrt{|\\mathcal{U}|}\\right]$. The size of the agent population is denoted by the term $N$, and $|\\mathcal{X}|, |\\mathcal{U}|$ respectively indicate the sizes of (local) state and action spaces of individual agents. The approximation error is found to be independent of the size of the shared global state space. We further demonstrate that in a special case if the reward and state transition functions are independent of the action distribution of the population, then the error can be improved to $e=\\frac{\\sqrt{|\\mathcal{X}|}}{\\sqrt{N}}$. Finally, we devise a Natural Policy Gradient based algorithm that solves the MFC problem with $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-3})$ sample complexity and obtains a policy that is within $\\mathcal{O}(\\max\\{e,\\epsilon\\})$ error of the optimal MARL policy for any $\\epsilon>0$",

    "abstract": "The need for reliable model explanations is prominent for many machine learning applications, particularly for tabular and time-series data as their use cases often involve high-stakes decision making. Towards this goal, we introduce a novel interpretable modeling framework, Interpretable Mixture of Experts (IME), that yields high accuracy, comparable to `black-box' Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in many cases, along with useful interpretability capabilities. IME consists of an assignment module and a mixture of experts, with each sample being assigned to a single expert for prediction. We introduce multiple options for IME based on the assignment and experts being interpretable. When the experts are chosen to be interpretable such as linear models, IME yields an inherently-interpretable architecture where the explanations produced by IME are the exact descriptions of how the prediction is computed. In addition to constituting a standalone inherently-interpretable architecture, IME has the premise of being integrated with existing DNNs to offer interpretability to a subset of samples while maintaining the accuracy of the DNNs. Through extensive experiments on 15 tabular and time-series datasets, IME is demonstrated to be more accurate than single interpretable models and perform comparably with existing state-of-the-art DNNs in accuracy. On most datasets, IME even outperforms DNNs, while providing faithful explanations. Lastly, IME's explanations are compared to commonly-used post-hoc explanations methods through a user study -- participants are able to better predict the model behavior when given IME explanations, while finding IME's explanations more faithful and trustworthy",

A recent line of work indicates that a hybrid of classical numerical techniques and machine learning can offer significant improvements over either approach alone. In this work, we show that the choice of the numerical scheme is crucial when incorporating physics-based priors. We build upon Fourier-based spectral methods, which are known to be more efficient than other numerical schemes for simulating PDEs with smooth and periodic solutions. Specifically, we develop ML-augmented spectral solvers for three common PDEs of fluid dynamics. Our models are more accurate (2-4x) than standard spectral solvers at the same resolution but have longer overall runtimes (~2x), due to the additional runtime cost of the neural network component.

    "abstract": "Ad hoc teamwork (AHT) is the challenge of designing a robust learner agent that effectively collaborates with unknown teammates without prior coordination mechanisms. Early approaches address the AHT challenge by training the learner with a diverse set of handcrafted teammate policies, usually designed based on an expert's domain knowledge about the policies the learner may encounter. However, implementing teammate policies for training based on domain knowledge is not always feasible. In such cases, recent approaches attempted to improve the robustness of the learner by training it with teammate policies generated by optimising information-theoretic diversity metrics. The problem with optimising existing information-theoretic diversity metrics for teammate policy generation is the emergence of superficially different teammates. When used for AHT training, superficially different teammate behaviours may not improve a learner's robustness during collaboration with unknown teammates. In this paper, we present an automated teammate policy generation method optimising the Best-Response Diversity (BRDiv) metric, which measures diversity based on the compatibility of teammate policies in terms of returns. We evaluate our approach in environments with multiple valid coordination strategies, comparing against methods optimising information-theoretic diversity metrics and an ablation not optimising any diversity metric. Our experiments indicate that optimising BRDiv yields a diverse set of training teammate policies that improve the learner's performance relative to previous teammate generation approaches when collaborating with near-optimal previously unseen teammate policies",

    "abstract": "One unexpected technique that emerged in recent years consists in training a Deep Network (DN) with a Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) method, and using this network on downstream tasks but with its last few layers entirely removed. This usually skimmed-over trick of throwing away the entire projector is actually critical for SSL methods to display competitive performances. For example, on ImageNet classification, more than 30 points of percentage can be gained that way. This is a little vexing, as one would hope that the network layer at which invariance is explicitly enforced by the SSL criterion during training (the last layer) should be the one to use for best generalization performance downstream. But it seems not to be, and this study sheds some light on why. This trick, which we name Guillotine Regularization (GR), is in fact a generically applicable method that has been used to improve generalization performance in transfer learning scenarios. In this work, we identify the underlying reasons behind its success and challenge the preconceived idea that we should through away the entire projector in SSL. In fact, the optimal layer to use might change significantly depending on the training setup, the data or the downstream task. Lastly, we give some insights on how to reduce the need for a projector in SSL by aligning the pretext SSL task and the downstream task",

Successor Representations (SR) and their extension Successor Features (SF) are prominent transfer mechanisms in domains where reward functions change between tasks. They reevaluate the expected return of previously learned policies in a new target task to transfer their knowledge. The SF framework extended SR by linearly decomposing rewards into successor features and a reward weight vector allowing their application in high-dimensional tasks. But this came with the cost of having a linear relationship between reward functions and successor features, limiting its application to tasks where such a linear relationship exists. We propose a novel formulation of SR based on learning the cumulative discounted probability of successor features, called Successor Feature Representations (SFR). Crucially, SFR allows to reevaluate the expected return of policies for general reward functions. We introduce different SFR variations, prove its convergence, and provide a guarantee on its transfer performance. Experimental evaluations based on SFR with function approximation demonstrate its advantage over SF not only for general reward functions, but also in the case of linearly decomposable reward functions",

    "abstract": "In Lifelong Learning (LL), agents continually learn as they encounter new conditions and tasks. Most current LL is limited to a single agent that learns tasks sequentially. Dedicated LL machinery is then deployed to mitigate the forgetting of old tasks as new tasks are learned. This is inherently slow. We propose a new Shared Knowledge Lifelong Learning (SKILL) challenge, which deploys a decentralized population of LL agents that each sequentially learn different tasks, with all agents operating independently and in parallel. After learning their respective tasks, agents share and consolidate their knowledge over a decentralized communication network, so that, in the end, all agents can master all tasks. We present one solution to SKILL which uses Lightweight Lifelong Learning (LLL) agents, where the goal is to facilitate efficient sharing by minimizing the fraction of the agent that is specialized for any given task. Each LLL agent thus consists of a common task-agnostic immutable part, where most parameters are, and individual task-specific modules that contain fewer parameters but are adapted to each task. Agents share their task-specific modules, plus summary information (\"task anchors\") representing their tasks in the common task-agnostic latent space of all agents. Receiving agents register each received task-specific module using the corresponding anchor. Thus, every agent improves its ability to solve new tasks each time new task-specific modules and anchors are received. If all agents can communicate with all others, eventually all agents become identical and can solve all tasks. On a new, very challenging SKILL-102 dataset with 102 image classification tasks (5,033 classes in total, 2,041,225 training, 243,464 validation, and 243,464 test images), we achieve much higher (and SOTA) accuracy over 8 LL baselines, while also achieving near perfect parallelization.

Most deep clustering algorithms are very effective when given the number of clusters K.

This paper proposes a plug-and-play clustering module to automatically adjust the number of clusters, which can be easily embedded into existing deep parametric clustering methods. By analyzing the goal of clustering, a split-and-merge framework is introduced to reduce the intra-class diversity and increase the inter-class difference, which leverages the entropy between different clusters. Specifically, given an initial clustering number, clusters can be split into sub-clusters or merged into super-clusters and converge to a stable number of K clusters at the end of training. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve comparable performance with the state-of-the-art works without requiring the number of clusters",

    "abstract": "Federated Learning has become a widely-used framework which allows learning a global model on decentralized local datasets under the condition of protecting local data privacy. However, federated learning faces severe optimization difficulty when training samples are not independently and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.). In this paper, we point out that the client sampling practice plays a decisive role in the aforementioned optimization difficulty. We find that the negative client sampling will cause the merged data distribution of currently sampled clients heavily inconsistent with that of all available clients, and further make the aggregated gradient unreliable. To address this issue, we propose a novel learning rate adaptation mechanism to adaptively adjust the server learning rate for the aggregated gradient in each round, according to the consistency between the merged data distribution of currently sampled clients and that of all available clients. Specifically, we make theoretical deductions to find a meaningful and robust indicator that is positively related to the optimal server learning rate, which is supposed to minimize the Euclidean distance between the aggregated gradient given currently sampled clients and that if all clients could participate in the current round. We show that our proposed indicator can effectively reflect the merged data distribution of sampled clients, thus we utilize it for the server learning rate adaptation.

We show how Partial Information Decomposition (PID), a recent extension of information theory, can disentangle these different contributions. From this, we introduce the measure of ``Representational Complexity'', which quantifies the difficulty of accessing information spread across multiple neurons. We show how this complexity is directly computable for smaller layers. For larger layers, we propose subsampling and coarse-graining procedures and prove corresponding bounds on the latter. Empirically, for quantized deep neural networks solving the MNIST and CIFAR10 tasks, we observe that representational complexity decreases both through successive hidden layers and over training, and compare the results to related measures.

    "abstract": "Contrastive self-supervised learning (SSL) methods, such as MoCo and SimCLR, have achieved great success in unsupervised visual representation learning. They rely on a large number of negative pairs and thus require either large memory banks or large batches. Some recent non-contrastive SSL methods, such as BYOL and SimSiam, attempt to discard negative pairs and have also shown remarkable performance. To avoid collapsed solutions caused by not using negative pairs, these methods require non-trivial asymmetry designs. However, in small data regimes, we can not obtain a sufficient number of negative pairs or effectively avoid the over-fitting problem when negatives are not used at all. To address this situation, we argue that negative pairs are still important but one is generally sufficient for each positive pair. We show that a simple Triplet-based loss (Trip) can achieve surprisingly good performance without requiring large batches or asymmetry designs. Moreover, to alleviate the over-fitting problem in small data regimes and further enhance the effect of Trip, we propose a simple plug-and-play RandOm MApping (ROMA) strategy by randomly mapping samples into other spaces and requiring these randomly projected samples to satisfy the same relationship indicated by the triplets. Integrating the triplet-based loss with random mapping, we obtain the proposed method Trip-ROMA. Extensive experiments, including unsupervised representation learning and unsupervised few-shot learning, have been conducted on ImageNet-1K and seven small datasets.

    "abstract": "In many, if not every realistic sequential decision-making task, the decision-making agent is not able to model the full complexity of the world. The environment is often much larger and more complex than the agent, a setting also known as partial observability. In such settings, the agent must leverage more than just the current sensory inputs; it must construct an agent state that summarizes previous interactions with the world. Currently, a popular approach for tackling this problem is to learn the agent-state function via a recurrent network from the agent's sensory stream as input. Many impressive reinforcement learning applications have instead relied on environment-specific functions to aid the agent's inputs for history summarization. These augmentations are done in multiple ways, from simple approaches like concatenating observations to more complex ones such as uncertainty estimates. Although ubiquitous in the field, these additional inputs, which we term auxiliary inputs, are rarely emphasized, and it is not clear what their role or impact is. In this work we explore this idea further, and relate these auxiliary inputs to prior classic approaches to state construction. We present a series of examples illustrating the different ways of using auxiliary inputs for reinforcement learning. We show that these auxiliary inputs can be used to discriminate between observations that would otherwise be aliased, leading to more expressive features that smoothly interpolate between different states. Finally, we show that this approach is complementary to state-of-the-art methods such as recurrent neural networks and truncated back-propagation through time, and acts as a heuristic that facilitates longer temporal credit assignment, leading to better performance",

The BGP model was introduced as a method to model bifurcations in single-cell gene expression data and order genes by inferring their branching time parameter. A limitation of the current BGP model is that the assignment of observations to latent functions is inferred independently for each output dimension (gene). This leads to inconsistent assignments across outputs and reduces the accuracy of branching time inference. Here, we propose a multivariate branching Gaussian process (MBGP) model to perform joint branch assignment inference across multiple output dimensions. This ensures that branch assignments are consistent and leverages more data for branching time inference. Model inference is more challenging than for the original BGP or OMGP models because assignment labels can switch from trunk to branch lineages as branching times change during inference. To scale up inference to large datasets we use sparse variational Bayesian inference.

Due to their close proximity to fully connected architectures, these models mainly suffer from high memory usage and are generally limited to shallow deep learning models. In this paper, we propose U-shaped Neural Operator (U-NO), a U-shaped memory enhanced architecture that allows for deeper neural operators. U-NOs exploit the problem structures in function predictions and demonstrate fast training, data efficiency, and robustness with respect to hyperparameters choices. We study the performance of U-NO on PDE benchmarks, namely, Darcy's flow law and the Navier-Stokes equations. We show that U-NO results in an average of 26% and 44% prediction improvement on Darcy's flow and turbulent Navier-Stokes equations, respectively, over the state of the art. On Navier-Stokes 3D spatiotemporal operator learning task, we show U-NO provides 37% improvement over the state of art methods",

    "abstract": "Language models demonstrate both quantitative improvement and new qualitative capabilities with increasing scale. Despite their potentially transformative impact, these new capabilities are as yet poorly characterized. In order to inform future research, prepare for disruptive new model capabilities, and ameliorate socially harmful effects, it is vital that we understand the present and near-future capabilities and limitations of language models. To address this challenge, we introduce the Beyond the Imitation Game benchmark (BIG- bench). BIG-bench currently consists of 204 tasks, contributed by 450 authors across 132 institutions. Task topics are diverse, drawing problems from linguistics, childhood develop- ment, math, common-sense reasoning, biology, physics, social bias, software development, and beyond. BIG-bench focuses on tasks that are believed to be beyond the capabilities of current language models. We evaluate the behavior of OpenAI's GPT models, Google- internal dense transformer architectures, and Switch-style sparse transformers on BIG-bench, across model sizes spanning millions to hundreds of billions of parameters. In addition, a team of human expert raters performed all tasks in order to provide a strong baseline. Findings include: model performance and calibration both improve with scale, but are poor in absolute terms (and when compared with rater performance); performance is remarkably similar across model classes, though with benefits from sparsity; tasks that improve gradually and predictably commonly involve a large knowledge or memorization component, whereas tasks that exhibit \"breakthrough\" behavior at a critical scale often involve multiple steps or components, or brittle metrics; social bias typically increases with scale in settings with ambiguous context, but this can be improved with prompting",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been demonstrated to achieve state-of-the-art performance for a number of graph-based learning tasks, which leads to a rise in their employment in various domains. However, it has been shown that GNNs may inherit and even amplify bias within training data, which leads to unfair results towards certain sensitive groups. Meanwhile, training of GNNs introduces additional challenges, such as slow convergence and possible instability. Faced with these limitations, this work proposes FairNorm, a unified normalization-based framework that reduces the bias in GNN-based learning while also providing provably faster convergence. Specifically, FairNorm presents individual normalization operators over different sensitive groups and introduces fairness regularizers on the learnable parameters of normalization layers to reduce the bias in GNNs. The design of the proposed regularizers is built upon analyses that illuminate the sources of bias in graph-based learning. Experiments on node classification over real-world networks demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme in improving fairness in terms of statistical parity and equal opportunity compared to fairness-aware baselines. In addition, it is empirically shown that the proposed framework leads to faster convergence compared to the naive baseline where no normalization is employed",

Recent empirical evidence (see, e.g., ~\\cite{tseng2020fourier,aghazadeh2021epistatic,ha2021adaptive}) suggests that regularizing the spectral representation of such models improves their generalization power when labeled data is scarce. However, despite these empirical studies, the theoretical underpinning of when and how spectral regularization enables improved generalization is poorly understood. In this paper, we focus on learning pseudo-Boolean functions and demonstrate that regularizing the empirical mean squared error by the $L_1$ norm of the spectral transform of the learned function reshapes the loss landscape and allows for data-frugal learning under a restricted secant condition on the learner's empirical error measured against the ground truth function. Under a weaker quadratic growth condition, we show that stationary points, which also approximately interpolate the training data points achieve statistically optimal generalization performance. Complementing our theory, we empirically demonstrate that running gradient descent on the regularized loss results in a better generalization performance compared to baseline algorithms in several data-scarce real-world problems",

    "abstract": "Gradient descent-ascent (GDA) is a widely used algorithm for minimax optimization. However, GDA has been proved to converge to stationary points for nonconvex minimax optimization, which are suboptimal compared with local minimax points. In this work, we develop cubic regularization (CR) type algorithms that globally converge to local minimax points in nonconvex-strongly-concave minimax optimization. We first show that local minimax points are equivalent to second-order stationary points of a certain envelope function. Then, inspired by the classic cubic regularization algorithm, we propose an algorithm named Cubic-LocalMinimax for finding local minimax points, and provide a comprehensive convergence analysis by leveraging its intrinsic potential function. Specifically, we establish the global convergence of Cubic-LocalMinimax to a local minimax point at a sublinear convergence rate and characterize its iteration complexity. Also, we propose a GDA-based solver for solving the cubic subproblem involved in Cubic-LocalMinimax up to certain pre-defined accuracy, and analyze the overall gradient and Hessian-vector product computation complexities of such an inexact Cubic-LocalMinimax algorithm. Moreover, we propose a stochastic variant of Cubic-LocalMinimax for large-scale minimax optimization, and characterize its sample complexity under stochastic sub-sampling. Experimental results demonstrate faster or comparable convergence speed of our stochastic Cubic-LocalMinimax than the state-of-the-art algorithms such as GDA and Minimax Cubic-Newton. In particular, our stochastic Cubic-LocalMinimax was also faster as compared to several other algorithms for minimax optimization on a particular adversarial loss for training a convolutional neural network on MNIST",

In assisted learning, an organizational learner purchases assistance service from an external service provider and aims to enhance its model performance within only a few assistance rounds. We develop effective stochastic training algorithms for both assisted deep learning and assisted reinforcement learning.

The attention mechanism, on the other hand, provides a flexible way to implicitly exploit the patterns within inputs, and furthermore, relationship between arbitrary query locations and inputs. In this work, we present an attention-based framework for data-driven operator learning, which we term Operator Transformer (OFormer). Our framework is built upon self-attention, cross-attention, and a set of point-wise multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), and thus it makes few assumptions on the sampling pattern of the input function or query locations.

    "abstract": "Learning in multi-agent systems is highly challenging due to several factors including the non-stationarity introduced by agents' interactions and the combinatorial nature of their state and action spaces. In particular, we consider the Mean-Field Control (MFC) problem which assumes an asymptotically infinite population of identical agents that aim to collaboratively maximize the collective reward. In many cases, solutions of an MFC problem are good approximations for large systems, hence, efficient learning for MFC is valuable for the analogous discrete agent setting with many agents. Specifically, we focus on the case of unknown system dynamics where the goal is to simultaneously optimize for the rewards and learn from experience. We propose an efficient model-based reinforcement learning algorithm, $\\text{M}^3$--UCRL, that runs in episodes, balances between exploration and exploitation during policy learning, and provably solves this problem. Our main theoretical contributions are the first general regret bounds for model-based reinforcement learning for MFC, obtained via a novel mean-field type analysis. To learn the system's dynamics, $\\text{M}^3$--UCRL can be instantiated with various statistical models, e.g., neural networks or Gaussian Processes. Moreover, we provide a practical parametrization of the core optimization problem that facilitates gradient-based optimization techniques when combined with differentiable dynamics approximation methods such as neural networks",

However, empirical studies have found mixed and even negative results. An open question, therefore, is under what conditions explanations can improve human understanding and in what way. To address this question, we first identify three core concepts that cover most existing quantitative measures of understanding: task decision boundary, model decision boundary, and model error. Using adapted causal diagrams, we provide a formal characterization of the relationship between these concepts and human approximations (i.e., understanding) of them. The relationship varies by the level of human intuition in different task types, such as emulation and discovery, which are often ignored when building or evaluating explanation methods. Our key result is that human intuitions are necessary for generating and evaluating machine explanations in human-AI decision making: without assumptions about human intuitions, explanations may improve human understanding of model decision boundary, but cannot improve human understanding of task decision boundary or model error. To validate our theoretical claims, we conduct human subject studies to show the importance of human intuitions. Together with our theoretical contributions, we provide a new paradigm for designing behavioral studies towards a rigorous view of the role of machine explanations across different tasks of human-AI decision making",

The agent thus moves the camera to points of view that are most predictive for a chosen sensor, which we select using a conditioning input to the agent.

Motivated by the fact that training a GP via ML is equivalent (on average) to minimising the KL-divergence between the true and learnt model, we set to explore different metrics/divergences among GPs that are computationally inexpensive and provide hyperparameter values that are close to those found via ML. In practice, we identify the GP hyperparameters by projecting the empirical covariance or (Fourier) power spectrum onto a parametric family, thus proposing and studying various measures of discrepancy operating on the temporal and frequency domains. Our contribution extends the variogram method developed by the geostatistics literature and, accordingly, it is referred to as the generalised variogram method (GVM).

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Prior work has observed that the test error of state-of-the-art deep neural networks often continues to decrease with increasing over-parameterization, a phenomenon referred to as double descent. This allows deep learning engineers to instantiate large models without having to worry about over-fitting. Despite its benefits, however, prior work has shown that over-parameterization can exacerbate bias against minority subgroups. Several fairness-constrained DNN training methods have been proposed to address this concern. Here, we critically examine MinDiff, a fairness-constrained training procedure implemented within TensorFlow's Responsible AI Toolkit, that aims to achieve Equality of Opportunity. We show that although MinDiff improves fairness for under-parameterized models, it is likely to be ineffective in the over-parameterized regime. This is because an overfit model with zero training loss is trivially group-wise fair on training data, creating an \"illusion of fairness,\" thus turning off the MinDiff optimization (this will apply to any disparity-based measures which care about errors or accuracy; while it won't apply to demographic parity). We find that within specified fairness constraints, under-parameterized MinDiff models can even have lower error compared to their over-parameterized counterparts (despite baseline over-parameterized models having lower error compared to their under-parameterized counterparts). We further show that MinDiff optimization is very sensitive to choice of batch size in the under-parameterized regime. Thus, fair model training using MinDiff requires time-consuming hyper-parameter searches. Finally, we suggest using previously proposed regularization techniques, viz. L2, early stopping and flooding in conjunction with MinDiff to train fair over-parameterized models. In our results, over-parameterized models trained using MinDiff+regularization with standard batch sizes are fairer than their under-parameterized counterparts, suggesting that at the very least, regularizers should be integrated into fair deep learning flows, like MinDiff",

Long-range traffic forecasting, however, remains a challenging task due to the intricate and extensive spatio-temporal correlations observed in traffic networks. Current works primarily rely on road networks with graph structures and learn representations using graph neural networks (GNNs), but this approach suffers from over-smoothing problem in deep architectures. To tackle this problem, recent methods introduced the combination of GNNs with residual connections or neural ordinary differential equations (ODE). However, current graph ODE models face two key limitations in feature extraction: (1) they lean towards global temporal patterns, overlooking local patterns that are important for unexpected events; and (2) they lack dynamic semantic edges in their architectural design. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture called Graph-based Multi-ODE Neural Networks (GRAM-ODE) which is designed with multiple connective ODE-GNN modules to learn better representations by capturing different views of complex local and global dynamic spatio-temporal dependencies. We also add some techniques like shared weights and divergence constraints into the intermediate layers of distinct ODE-GNN modules to further improve their communication towards the forecasting task.

    "abstract": "Camera images are ubiquitous in machine learning research. They also play a central role in the delivery of important public services spanning medicine or environmental surveying. However, the application of machine learning models in these domains has been limited because of robustness concerns. A primary failure mode are performance drops due to differences between the training and deployment data. While there are methods to prospectively validate the robustness of machine learning models to such dataset drifts, existing approaches do not account for explicit models of machine learning's primary object of interest: the data. This limits our ability to study and understand the relationship between data generation and downstream machine learning model performance in a physically accurate manner. In this study, we demonstrate how to overcome this limitation by pairing traditional machine learning with physical optics to obtain explicit and differentiable data models. We demonstrate how such data models can be constructed for image data and used to control downstream machine learning model performance related to dataset drift. The findings are distilled into three applications. First, drift synthesis enables the controlled generation of physically faithful drift test cases to power model selection and targeted generalization. Second, the gradient connection between machine learning task model and data model allows advanced, precise tolerancing of task model sensitivity to changes in the data generation. These drift forensics can be used to precisely specify the acceptable data environments in which a task model may be run. Third, drift optimization opens up the possibility to create drifts that can help the task model learn better faster, effectively optimizing the data generating process itself to support the downstream machine vision task. This is an interesting upgrade to existing imaging pipelines which traditionally have been optimized to be consumed by human users but not machine learning models.

    "abstract": "Vision-language (VL) pretrained models have achieved impressive performance on multimodal reasoning and zero-shot recognition tasks. Many of these VL models are pretrained on unlabeled image and caption pairs from the internet. In this paper, we study whether representations of primitive concepts–such as colors, shapes, or the attributes of object parts–emerge automatically within these pretrained VL models. We propose a two-step framework, Compositional Concept Mapping (CompMap), to investigate this. CompMap first asks a VL model to generate concept activations with text prompts from a predefined list of primitive concepts, and then learns to construct an explicit composition model that maps the primitive concept activations (e.g. the likelihood of black tail or red wing) to com- posite concepts (e.g. a red-winged blackbird). We demonstrate that a composition model can be designed as a set operation, and show that a composition model is straightforward for machines to learn from ground truth primitive concepts (as a linear classifier). We thus hypothesize that if primitive concepts indeed emerge in a VL pretrained model, its primitive concept activations can be used to learn a composition model similar to the one designed by experts. We propose a quantitative metric to measure the degree of similarity, and refer to the metric as the interpretability of the VL models' learned primitive concept representations. We also measure the classification accuracy when using the primitive concept activations and the learned composition model to predict the composite concepts, and refer to it as the usefulness metric. Our study reveals that state-of-the-art VL pretrained models learn primitive concepts that are highly useful for fine-grained visual recognition on the CUB dataset, and compositional generalization tasks on the MIT-States dataset. However, we observe that the learned composition models have low interpretability in our qualitative analyses.

    "title": "A Simulation Environment and Reinforcement Learning Method for Waste Reduction",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In retail (e.g., grocery stores, apparel shops, online retailers), inventory managers have to balance short-term risk (no items to sell) with long-term-risk (over ordering leading to product waste). This balancing task is made especially hard due to the lack of information about future customer purchases. In this paper, we study the problem of restocking a grocery store's inventory with perishable items over time, from a distributional point of view. The objective is to maximize sales while minimizing waste, with uncertainty about the actual consumption by costumers. This problem is of a high relevance today, given the growing demand for food and the impact of food waste on the environment, the economy, and purchasing power. We frame inventory restocking as a new reinforcement learning task that exhibits stochastic behavior conditioned on the agent's actions, making the environment partially observable. We make two main contributions. First, we introduce a new reinforcement learning environment, RetaiL, based on real grocery store data and expert knowledge. This environment is highly stochastic, and presents a unique challenge for reinforcement learning practitioners. We show that uncertainty about the future behavior of the environment is not handled well by classical supply chain algorithms, and that distributional approaches are a good way to account for the uncertainty. Second, we introduce GTDQN, a distributional reinforcement learning algorithm that learns a generalized lambda distribution over the reward space. GTDQN provides a strong baseline for our environment. It outperforms other distributional reinforcement learning approaches in this partially observable setting, in both overall reward and generated waste",

We focus on the group notions of fairness, according to which agents belonging to different groups should have similar performance based on some given measure. We consider the setting of maximizing return in an unknown environment (unknown transition and reward function) and show that it is possible to have RL algorithms that learn the best fair policies without violating the fairness requirements at any point in time during the learning process. In the tabular finite-horizon episodic setting, we provide an algorithm that combines the principle of optimism and pessimism under uncertainty to achieve zero fairness violation with arbitrarily high probability while also maintaining sub-linear regret guarantees. For the high-dimensional Deep-RL setting, we present algorithms based on the performance-difference style approximate policy improvement update step and we report encouraging empirical results on various traditional RL-inspired benchmarks showing that our algorithms display the desired behavior of learning the optimal policy while performing a fair learning process",

    "abstract": "The challenge of producing accurate statistics while respecting the privacy of the individuals in a sample is an important area of research. We study minimax lower bounds for classes of differentially private estimators. In particular, we show how to characterize the power of a statistical test under differential privacy in a plug-and-play fashion by solving an appropriate transport problem. With specific coupling constructions, this observation allows us to derive Le Cam-type and Fano-type inequalities not only for regular definitions of differential privacy but also for those based on Renyi divergence. We then proceed to illustrate our results on three simple, fully worked out examples. In particular, we show that the problem class has a huge importance on the provable degradation of utility due to privacy. In certain scenarios, we show that maintaining privacy results in a noticeable reduction in performance only when the level of privacy protection is very high. Conversely, for other problems, even a modest level of privacy protection can lead to a significant decrease in performance. Finally, we demonstrate that the DP-SGLD algorithm, a private convex solver, can be employed for maximum likelihood estimation with a high degree of confidence, as it provides near-optimal results with respect to both the size of the sample and the level of privacy protection. This algorithm is applicable to a broad range of parametric estimation procedures, including exponential families",

    "abstract": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are recognized as the candidate for the next-generation neural networks due to their bio-plausibility and energy efficiency. Recently, researchers have demonstrated that SNNs are able to achieve nearly state-of-the-art performance in image recognition tasks using surrogate gradient training. However, some essential questions exist pertaining to SNNs that are little studied: Do SNNs trained with surrogate gradient learn different representations from traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)? Does the time dimension in SNNs provide unique representation power? In this paper, we aim to answer these questions by conducting a representation similarity analysis between SNNs and ANNs using Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA). We start by analyzing the spatial dimension of the networks, including both the width and the depth. Furthermore, our analysis of residual connections shows that SNNs learn a periodic pattern, which rectifies the representations in SNNs to be ANN-like. We additionally investigate the effect of the time dimension on SNN representation, finding that deeper layers encourage more dynamics along the time dimension. We also investigate the impact of input data such as event-stream data and adversarial attacks. Our work uncovers a host of new findings of representations in SNNs. We hope this work will inspire future research to fully comprehend the representation power of SNNs. Code is released at https://github.com/Intelligent-Computing-Lab-Yale/SNNCKA",

    "title": "Generalization as Dynamical Robustness--The Role of Riemannian Contraction in Supervised Learning",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "A key property of successful learning algorithms is generalization. In classical supervised learning, generalization can be achieved by ensuring that the empirical error converges to the expected error as the number of training samples goes to infinity. Within this classical setting, we analyze the generalization properties of iterative optimizers such as stochastic gradient descent and natural gradient flow through the lens of dynamical systems and control theory. Specifically, we use contraction analysis to show that generalization and dynamical robustness are intimately related through the notion of algorithmic stability. In particular, we prove that Riemannian contraction in a supervised learning setting implies generalization. We show that if a learning algorithm is contracting in some Riemannian metric with rate $\\lambda > 0$, it is uniformly algorithmically stable with rate $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\lambda n)$, where $n$ is the number of examples in the training set. The results hold for stochastic and deterministic optimization, in both continuous and discrete-time, for convex and non-convex loss surfaces. The associated generalization bounds reduce to well-known results in the particular case of gradient descent over convex or strongly convex loss surfaces. They can be shown to be optimal in certain linear settings, such as kernel ridge regression under gradient flow. Finally, we demonstrate that the well-known Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition is intimately related to the contraction of a model's outputs as they evolve under gradient descent. This correspondence allows us to derive uniform algorithmic stability bounds for nonlinear function classes such as wide neural networks",

Although agents initialized with such a prior policy can achieve a significantly higher reward with fewer samples when finetuned on the downstream task, it is still an open question how an optimal pretrained prior policy can be achieved in practice. In this work, we present POLTER (Policy Trajectory Ensemble Regularization) – a general method to regularize the pretraining that can be applied to any URL algorithm and is especially useful on data- and knowledge-based URL algorithms. It utilizes an ensemble of policies that are discovered during pretraining and moves the policy of the URL algorithm closer to its optimal prior. Our method is based on a theoretical framework, and we analyze its practical effects on a white-box benchmark, allowing us to study POLTER with full control. In our main experiments, we evaluate POLTER on the Unsupervised Reinforcement Learning Benchmark (URLB), which consists of 12 tasks in 3 domains. We demonstrate the generality of our approach by improving the performance of a diverse set of data- and knowledge-based URL algorithms by 19% on average and up to 40% in the best case.

    "abstract": "Training even moderately-sized generative models with differentially-private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) is difficult: the required level of noise for reasonable levels of privacy is simply too large. We advocate instead building off a good, relevant representation on an informative public dataset, then learning to model the private data with that representation. In particular, we minimize the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) between private target data and a generator's distribution, using a kernel based on perceptual features learned from a public dataset. With the MMD, we can simply privatize the data-dependent term once and for all, rather than introducing noise at each step of optimization as in DP-SGD. Our algorithm allows us to generate CIFAR10-level images with $\\epsilon \\approx 2$ which capture distinctive features in the distribution, far surpassing the current state of the art, which mostly focuses on datasets such as MNIST and FashionMNIST at a large $\\epsilon \\approx 10$.

Our models correspond to the choice of the model graph, whose vertices correspond to classes and edges represent which pairwise SVMs are trained. We conduct experiments to uncover metrical and topological properties that impact the accuracy of a multi-class SVM model. Based on their results we propose a way to construct intermediate multi-class SVM models. The key insight is that for model graphs of diameter two, we can estimate missing pairwise probabilities from the known ones thus transforming the computation of posteriors to the usual complete (maximal) case. Our proposed algorithm allows one to reduce computational effort by 50-80% while keeping accuracy near, or even above that of a softmax classifier.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Few-shot learning with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is an important challenge in expanding the remarkable success that GNNs have achieved. In the transductive node classification scenario, conventional supervised training methods for GNNs fail when only few labeled nodes are available. Self-training, wherein the GNN is trained in stages by augmenting the training data with a subset of the unlabeled data and the predictions of the GNN on this data (pseudolabels), has emerged as a promising approach to few-shot transductive learning. However, multi-stage self-training significantly increases the computational demands of GNN training. In addition, while the training set evolves considerably across the stages of self-training, the GNN architecture, graph topology and training hyperparameters are kept constant, adversely affecting the accuracy of the resulting model as well as the computational efficiency of training. To address this challenge, we propose FASTRAIN-GNN, a framework for efficient and accurate self-training of GNNs with few labeled nodes. FASTRAIN-GNN performs four main optimizations in each stage of self-training: (1) Sampling-based Pseudolabel Filtering removes nodes whose pseudolabels are likely to be incorrect from the enlarged training set. (2,3) Dynamic Sizing and Dynamic Regularization find the optimal network architecture and amount of training regularization in each stage of self-training, respectively, and (4) Progressive Graph Pruning removes selected edges between nodes in the training set to reduce the impact of over-smoothing. On few-shot node classification tasks using different GNN architectures, FASTRAIN-GNN produces models that are consistently more accurate (by up to 4.4%), while also substantially reducing the self-training time (by up to 2.1X) over the current state-of-the-art methods.

The online convex optimization is then formulated over the parameters of the policy on its past disturbance and reference values to optimize general convex costs.

    "abstract": "To train image-caption retrieval (ICR) methods, contrastive loss functions are a common choice for optimization functions. Unfortunately, contrastive ICR methods are vulnerable to predictive feature suppression. Predictive features are features that correctly indicate the similarity between a query and a candidate item. However, in the presence of multiple predictive features during training, encoder models tend to suppress redundant predictive features, since these features are not needed to learn to discriminate between positive and negative pairs. We introduce an approach to reduce predictive feature suppression for resource-constrained ICR methods: latent target decoding (LTD). We add an additional decoder to the contrastive ICR framework, to reconstruct the input caption in a latent space of a general-purpose sentence encoder, which prevents the image and caption encoder from suppressing predictive features. We implement the LTD objective as an optimization constraint, to ensure that the reconstruction loss is below a bound value while primarily optimizing for the contrastive loss. Importantly, LTD does not depend on additional training data or expensive (hard) negative mining strategies. Our experiments show that, unlike reconstructing the input caption in the input space, LTD reduces predictive feature suppression, measured by obtaining higher recall@k, r-precision, and nDCG scores than a contrastive ICR baseline. Moreover, we show that LTD should be implemented as an optimization constraint instead of a dual optimization objective. Finally, we show that LTD can be used with different contrastive learning losses and a wide variety of resource-constrained ICR methods",

Common intuition from polynomial regression suggests that overparameterized networks are able to sharply interpolate noisy data, without considerably deviating from the ground-truth signal, thus preserving generalization ability. At present, a precise characterization of the relationship between interpolation and generalization for deep networks is missing. In this work, we quantify sharpness of fit of the training data interpolated by neural network functions, by studying the loss landscape w.r.t. to the input variable locally to each training point, over volumes around cleanly- and noisily-labelled training samples, as we systematically increase the number of model parameters and training epochs. Our findings show that loss sharpness in the input space follows both model- and epoch-wise double descent, with worse peaks observed around noisy labels. While small interpolating models sharply fit both clean and noisy data, large interpolating models express a smooth loss landscape, where noisy targets are predicted over large volumes around training data points, in contrast to existing intuition",

As with any other fully Bayesian approach, this treatment introduces prohibitively expensive computational overhead; unsurprisingly, the BTG posterior predictive distribution, itself estimated through high-dimensional integration, must be inverted in order to perform model prediction. To address these challenges, we introduce principled numerical techniques for computing with BTG efficiently using a combination of doubly sparse quadrature rules, tight quantile bounds, and rank-one matrix algebra to enable both fast model prediction and model selection. These efficient methods allow us to compute with higher-dimensional datasets and apply BTG with layered transformations that greatly improve its expressibility.

In this work we introduce a variational objective for training GFNs, which is a convex combination of the reverse- and forward KL divergences, and compare it to the trajectory balance objective when sampling from the forward- and backward model, respectively. We show that, in certain settings, variational inference for GFNs is equivalent to minimizing the trajectory balance objective, in the sense that both methods compute the same score-function gradient.

    "abstract": "Humans innately measure distance between instances in an unlabeled dataset using an unknown similarity function. Distance metrics can only serve as proxy for similarity in information retrieval of similar instances. Learning a good similarity function from human annotations improves the quality of retrievals. This work uses deep metric learning to learn these user-defined similarity functions from few annotations for a large football trajectory dataset. We adapt an entropy-based active learning method with recent work from triplet mining to collect easy-to-answer but still informative annotations from human participants and use them to train a deep convolutional network that generalizes to unseen samples. Our user study shows that our approach improves the quality of the information retrieval compared to a previous deep metric learning approach that relies on a Siamese network. Specifically, we shed light on the strengths and weaknesses of passive sampling heuristics and active learners alike by analyzing the participants' response efficacy. To this end, we collect accuracy, algorithmic time complexity, the participants' fatigue and time-to-response, qualitative self-assessment and statements, as well as the effects of mixed-expertise annotators and their consistency on model performance and transfer-learning",

    "title": "Differentially private partitioned variational inference",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Learning a privacy-preserving model from sensitive data which are distributed across multiple devices is an increasingly important problem. The problem is often formulated in the federated learning context, with the aim of learning a single global model while keeping the data distributed. Moreover, Bayesian learning is a popular approach for modelling, since it naturally supports reliable uncertainty estimates. However, Bayesian learning is generally intractable even with centralised non-private data and so approximation techniques such as variational inference are a necessity. Variational inference has recently been extended to the non-private federated learning setting via the partitioned variational inference algorithm. For privacy protection, the current gold standard is called differential privacy. Differential privacy guarantees privacy in a strong, mathematically clearly defined sense. In this paper, we present differentially private partitioned variational inference, the first general framework for learning a variational approximation to a Bayesian posterior distribution in the federated learning setting while minimising the number of communication rounds and providing differential privacy guarantees for data subjects. We propose three alternative implementations in the general framework, one based on perturbing local optimisation runs done by individual parties, and two based on perturbing updates to the global model (one using a version of federated averaging, the second one adding virtual parties to the protocol), and compare their properties both theoretically and empirically. We show that perturbing the local optimisation works well with simple and complex models as long as each party has enough local data. However, the privacy is always guaranteed independently by each party. In contrast, perturbing the global updates works best with relatively simple models. Given access to suitable secure primitives, such as secure aggregation or secure shuffling, the performance can be improved by all parties guaranteeing privacy jointly",

Here, we investigate deep reinforcement learning agents in an ecological patch foraging task. For the first time, we show that machine learning agents can learn to patch forage adaptively in patterns similar to biological foragers, and approach optimal patch foraging behavior when accounting for temporal discounting. Finally, we show emergent internal dynamics in these agents that resemble single-cell recordings from foraging non-human primates, which complements experimental and theoretical work on the neural mechanisms of biological foraging. This work suggests that agents interacting in complex environments with ecologically valid pressures arrive at common solutions, suggesting the emergence of foundational computations behind adaptive, intelligent behavior in both biological and artificial agents",

We then propose an algorithm for mean-regularized MTL, an objective commonly used for applications in personalized federated learning, subject to BP.

    "abstract": "Deep Boltzmann machines (DBMs), one of the first ``deep'' learning methods ever studied, are multi-layered probabilistic models governed by a pairwise energy function that describes the likelihood of all variables/nodes in the network. In practice, DBMs are often constrained, i.e., via the \\emph{restricted} Boltzmann machine (RBM) architecture (which does not permit intra-layer connections), in order to allow for more efficient inference. In this work, we revisit the generic DBM approach, and ask the question: are there other possible restrictions to their design that would enable efficient (approximate) inference? In particular, we develop a new class of restricted model, the monotone DBM, which allows for arbitrary self-connection in each layer, but restricts the \\emph{weights} in a manner that guarantees the existence and global uniqueness of a mean-field fixed point. To do this, we leverage tools from the recently-proposed monotone Deep Equilibrium model and show that a particular choice of activation results in a fixed-point iteration that gives a variational mean-field solution. While this approach is still largely conceptual, it is the first architecture that allows for efficient approximate inference in fully-general weight structures for DBMs. We apply this approach to simple deep convolutional Boltzmann architectures and demonstrate that it allows for tasks such as the joint completion and classification of images, within a single deep probabilistic setting, while avoiding the pitfalls of mean-field inference in traditional RBMs",

Our visual novelty detection benchmark finds that methods that rank best on popular area-under-the-curve metrics may be outperformed by simpler alternatives when controlling false positives matters most.

Unlike probabilistic graphical models, they typically do not incorporate specific domain knowledge. As such, this work explores incorporating arbitrary dependency structures, as specified by Bayesian networks, into variational autoencoders (VAEs). This is achieved by developing a new type of graphical normalizing flow, which extends residual flows by encoding conditional independence through masking of the flow's residual block weight matrices, and using these to extend both the prior and inference network of the VAE. We show that the proposed graphical VAE provides a more interpretable model that generalizes better in data-sparse settings, when practitioners know or can hypothesize about certain latent factors in their domain. Furthermore, we show that graphical residual flows provide not only density estimation and inference performance competitive with existing graphical flows, but also more stable and accurate inversion in practice as a byproduct of the flow's Lipschitz bounds",

While these works have been shown to work well in specific domains respectively, there is a lack of a unifying method that is more generally applicable without requiring significant changes to the neural network architectures. In this work, we aim to address this issue by providing a simple method that could be applied to not just energy-conserving systems, but also dissipative systems, by including a different inductive bias in different cases in the form of a regularisation term in the loss function.

We formalize the question of how many training data points should be used by looking at the generalization error for denoising noisy test data. Prior work on computing the generalization error focuses on adding noise to target outputs. However, adding noise to the input is more in line with current pre-training practices. In the linear (in the inputs) regime, we provide an asymptotically exact formula for the generalization error for rank 1 data and an approximation for the generalization error for rank $r$ data. From this, we derive a formula for the amount of noise that needs to be added to the training data to minimize the denoising error. This results in the emergence of a shrinkage phenomenon for improving the performance of denoising DNNs by making the training SNR smaller than the test SNR. Further, we see that the amount of shrinkage (ratio of the train to test SNR) also follows a double descent curve",

Developers often train machine learning models on carefully curated datasets using only high-quality data; however, this reduces the utility of such models in production environments. We propose a novel neural network modification to mitigate the impacts of low-quality and missing data which involves replacing the fixed weights of a fully-connected layer with a function of additional input. This is inspired by neuromodulation in biological neural networks where the cortex can up- and down-regulate inputs based on their reliability and the presence of other data. In testing, with reliability scores as a modulating signal, models with modulating layers were found to be more robust against data quality degradation, including additional missingness. These models are superior to imputation as they save on training time by entirely skipping the imputation process and further allow the introduction of other data quality measures that imputation cannot handle.

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of deep learning, the sizes of deep neural networks are getting larger beyond the affordability of hardware platforms. Given the fact that neural networks are often over-parameterized, one effective way to reduce such computational overhead is neural network pruning, by removing redundant parameters from trained neural networks. It has been recently observed that pruning can not only reduce computational overhead but also can improve empirical robustness of deep neural networks (NNs), potentially owing to removing spurious correlations while preserving the predictive accuracies. This paper for the first time demonstrates that pruning can generally improve $L_\\infty$ certified robustness for ReLU-based NNs under the \\textit{complete verification} setting. Using the popular Branch-and-Bound (BaB) framework, we find that pruning can enhance the estimated bound tightness of certified robustness verification, by alleviating linear relaxation and sub-domain split problems. We empirically verify our findings with off-the-shelf pruning methods and further present a new stability-based pruning method tailored for reducing neuron instability, that outperforms existing pruning methods in enhancing certified robustness. Our experiments show that by appropriately pruning an NN, its certified accuracy can be boosted up to \\textbf{8.2\\%} under standard training, and up to \\textbf{24.5\\%} under adversarial training on the CIFAR10 dataset. We additionally observe the possible existence of {\\it certified lottery tickets} in our experiments that can match both standard and certified robust accuracies of the original dense models across different datasets.

First, we generate and release an improved version of the Agriculture-Vision dataset (Chiu et al., 2020b) to include raw, full-field imagery for greater experimental flexibility. Second, we extend this dataset with the release of 3600 large, high-resolution (10cm/pixel), full-field, red-green-blue and near-infrared images for pre-training.

    "title": "Estimating the Density Ratio between Distributions with High Discrepancy using Multinomial Logistic Regression",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Functions of the ratio of the densities $p/q$ are widely used in machine learning to quantify the discrepancy between the two distributions $p$ and $q$. For high-dimensional distributions, binary classification-based density ratio estimators have shown great promise. However, when densities are well-separated, estimating the density ratio with a binary classifier is challenging. In this work, we show that the state-of-the-art density ratio estimators do perform poorly on well-separated cases and demonstrate that this is due to distribution shifts between training and evaluation time. We present an alternative method that leverages multi-class classification for density ratio estimation and does not suffer from distribution shift issues. The method uses a set of auxiliary densities $\\{m_k\\}_{k=1}^K$ and trains a multi-class logistic regression to classify the samples from $p, q$ and $\\{m_k\\}_{k=1}^K$ into $K+2$ classes. We show that if these auxiliary densities are constructed such that they overlap with $p$ and $q$, then a multi-class logistic regression allows for estimating $\\log p/q$ on the domain of any of the $K+2$ distributions and resolves the distribution shift problems of the current state-of-the-art methods. We compare our method to state-of-the-art density ratio estimators on both synthetic and real datasets and demonstrate its superior performance on the tasks of density ratio estimation, mutual information estimation, and representation learning",

    "title": "A Revenue Function for Comparison-Based Hierarchical Clustering",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Comparison-based learning addresses the problem of learning when, instead of explicit features or pairwise similarities, one only has access to comparisons of the form: \\emph{Object $A$ is more similar to $B$ than to $C$.} Recently, it has been shown that, in Hierarchical Clustering, single and complete linkage can be directly implemented using only such comparisons while several algorithms have been proposed to emulate the behaviour of average linkage. Hence, finding hierarchies (or dendrograms) using only comparisons is a well understood problem. However, evaluating their meaningfulness when no ground-truth nor explicit similarities are available remains an open question. In this paper, we bridge this gap by proposing a new revenue function that allows one to measure the goodness of dendrograms using only comparisons. We show that this function is closely related to Dasgupta's cost for hierarchical clustering that uses pairwise similarities. On the theoretical side, we use the proposed revenue function to resolve the open problem of whether one can approximately recover a latent hierarchy using few triplet comparisons. On the practical side, we present principled algorithms for comparison-based hierarchical clustering based on the maximisation of the revenue and we empirically compare them with existing methods",

    "abstract": "The applications of causal inference may be life-critical, including the evaluation of vaccinations, medicine, and social policy. However, when undertaking estimation for causal inference, practitioners rarely have access to what might be called `ground-truth' in a supervised learning setting, meaning the chosen estimation methods cannot be evaluated and must be assumed to be reliable. It is therefore crucial that we have a good understanding of the performance consistency of typical methods available to practitioners. In this work we provide a comprehensive evaluation of recent semiparametric methods (including neural network approaches) for average treatment effect estimation. Such methods have been proposed as a means to derive unbiased causal effect estimates and statistically valid confidence intervals, even when using otherwise non-parametric, data-adaptive machine learning techniques. We also propose a new estimator `MultiNet', and a variation on the semiparametric update step `MultiStep', which we evaluate alongside existing approaches. The performance of both semiparametric and `regular' methods are found to be dataset dependent, indicating an interaction between the methods used, the sample size, and nature of the data generating process. Our experiments highlight the need for practitioners to check the consistency of their findings, potentially by undertaking multiple analyses with different combinations of estimators",

It combines a surrogate Bayesian regression model with an acquisition function to decide where to evaluate the objective. Typical regression models are given by Gaussian processes with stationary covariance functions.

The ubiquity of stationary models has led to the common practice of exploiting prior information via informative mean functions. In this paper, we highlight that these models can perform poorly, especially in high dimensions. We propose novel informative covariance functions for optimization, leveraging nonstationarity to encode preferences for certain regions of the search space and adaptively promote local exploration during optimization.

A now well established research avenue leverages optimal transport (OT) and looks for Monge maps, i.e. models with minimal effort between the source and target distributions. This paper introduces a method based on Brenier's polar factorization theorem to transform any trained NF into a more OT-efficient version without changing the final density. We do so by learning a rearrangement of the source (Gaussian) distribution that minimizes the OT cost between the source and the final density. The Gaussian preserving transformation is implemented with the construction of high dimensional divergence free functions and the path leading to the estimated Monge map is further constrained to lie on a geodesic in the space of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms thanks to Euler's equations. The proposed method leads to smooth flows with reduced OT costs for several existing models without affecting the model performance",

    "abstract": "Many machine learning techniques incorporate identity-preserving transformations into their models to generalize their performance to previously unseen data. These transformations are typically selected from a set of functions that are known to maintain the identity of an input when applied (e.g., rotation, translation, flipping, and scaling). However, there are many natural variations that cannot be labeled for supervision or defined through examination of the data. As suggested by the manifold hypothesis, many of these natural variations live on or near a low-dimensional, nonlinear manifold. Several techniques represent manifold variations through a set of learned Lie group operators that define directions of motion on the manifold. However, these approaches are limited because they require transformation labels when training their models and they lack a method for determining which regions of the manifold are appropriate for applying each specific operator. We address these limitations by introducing a learning strategy that does not require transformation labels and developing a method that learns the local regions where each operator is likely to be used while preserving the identity of inputs. Experiments on MNIST and Fashion MNIST highlight our model's ability to learn identity-preserving transformations on multi-class datasets. Additionally, we train on CelebA to showcase our model's ability to learn semantically meaningful transformations on complex datasets in an unsupervised manner",

Detecting these attacks is thus crucial to build reliable algorithms and has received increasing attention in the last few years. In this paper, we introduce the HalfspAce Mass dePth dEtectoR (HAMPER), a new method to detect adversarial examples by leveraging the concept of data depths, a statistical notion that provides center-outward ordering of points with respect to (w.r.t.) a probability distribution. In particular, the halfspace-mass (HM) depth exhibits attractive properties such as computational efficiency, which makes it a natural candidate for adversarial attack detection in high-dimensional spaces. Additionally, HM is non differentiable making it harder for attackers to directly attack HAMPER via gradient based-methods. We evaluate HAMPER in the context of supervised adversarial attacks detection across four benchmark datasets. Overall, we empirically show that HAMPER consistently outperforms SOTA methods. In particular, the gains are 13.1% (29.0%) in terms of AUROC (resp. FPR) on SVHN, 14.6% (25.7%) on CIFAR10 and 22.6% (49.0%) on CIFAR100 compared to the best performing method",

In this work, we point out several shortcomings of these methods and discuss their potential negative consequences. Subsequently, we formulate the desiderata for reusable options and use these to frame the problem of learning options as a gradient-based meta-learning problem. This allows us to formulate an objective that explicitly incentivizes options which allow a higher-level decision maker to adjust in few steps to different tasks. Experimentally, we show that our method is able to learn transferable components which accelerate learning and performs better than existing prior methods developed for this setting.

The temporal and spatial evolution of the process (along with containment through isolation) render such detection as fundamentally different from active search detection strategies. In this work, through an active learning approach, we design testing and isolation strategies to contain the spread and minimize the cumulative infections under a given test budget. We prove that the objective can be optimized, with performance guarantees, by greedily selecting the nodes to test. We further design reward-based methodologies that effectively minimize an upper bound on the cumulative infections and are computationally more tractable in large networks. These policies, however, need knowledge about the nodes' infection probabilities which are dynamically changing and have to be learned by sequential testing. We develop a message-passing framework for this purpose and, building on that, show novel tradeoffs between exploitation of knowledge through reward-based heuristics and exploration of the unknown through a carefully designed probabilistic testing. The tradeoffs are fundamentally distinct from the classical counterparts under active search or multi-armed bandit problems (MABs). We provably show the necessity of exploration in a stylized network and show through simulations that exploration can outperform exploitation in various synthetic and real-data networks depending on the parameters of the network and the spread",

In this work, we propose a novel method BVCR that better utilizes the supervised information by three schemes, i.e., modeling, exploration, and interaction. In the modeling scheme, BVCR models the source supervision and target supervision separately to avoid target supervised information being overwhelmed by source supervised information and better utilize the target supervision. Besides, as both supervised information naturally offer distinct views for the target domain, the exploration scheme performs intra-domain consistency regularization to better explore target information with bidirectional views. Moreover, as both views are complementary to each other, the interaction scheme introduces inter-domain consistency regularization to activate information interaction bidirectionally. Thus, the proposed method is elegantly symmetrical by design and easy to implement. Extensive experiments are conducted, and the results show the effectiveness of the proposed method",

The sub-fields of few-shot, continual, transfer, and representation learning have made substantial strides in learning under adverse conditions, each affording distinct advantages through methods and insights. These methods address different challenges such as data arriving sequentially or scarce training examples, however often the difficult conditions an ML system will face over its lifetime cannot be anticipated prior to deployment. Therefore, general ML systems which can handle the many challenges of learning in practical settings are needed. To foster research towards the goal of general ML methods, we introduce a new unified evaluation framework – FLUID (Flexible Sequential Data). FLUID integrates the objectives of few-shot, continual, transfer, and representation learning while enabling comparison and integration of techniques across these subfields. In FLUID, a learner faces a stream of data and must make sequential predictions while choosing how to update itself, adapt quickly to novel classes, and deal with changing data distributions; while accounting for the total amount of compute.

We conjecture that this bias exists because the volume of functions that maps to low effective rank embedding increases with depth. We show empirically that our claim holds true on finite width linear and non-linear models on practical learning paradigms and show that on natural data, these are often the solutions that generalize well. We then show that the simplicity bias exists at both initialization and after training and is resilient to hyper-parameters and learning methods.

We first develop quantum policy evaluation (QPE) which is quadratically more efficient compared to an analogous classi- cal Monte Carlo estimation and is based on a quantum mechanical realization of a finite Markov decision process (MDP). Building on QPE, we derive a quantum policy iteration that repeatedly improves an initial policy using Grover search until the optimum is reached. Finally, we present an implementation of our algorithm for a two-armed bandit MDP which we then simulate",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) are a recent family of generative models that achieve state-of-the-art results. In order to obtain class-conditional generation, it was suggested to guide the diffusion process by gradients from a time-dependent classifier. While the idea is theoretically sound, deep learning-based classifiers are infamously susceptible to gradient-based adversarial attacks. Therefore, while traditional classifiers may achieve good accuracy scores, their gradients are possibly unreliable and might hinder the improvement of the generation results. Recent work discovered that adversarially robust classifiers exhibit gradients that are aligned with human perception, and these could better guide a generative process towards semantically meaningful images. We utilize this observation by defining and training a time-dependent adversarially robust classifier and use it as guidance for a generative diffusion model. In experiments on the highly challenging and diverse ImageNet dataset, our scheme introduces significantly more intelligible intermediate gradients, better alignment with theoretical findings, as well as improved generation results under several evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we conduct an opinion survey whose findings indicate that human raters prefer our method's results",

To solve this problem, we propose a novel fairness learning method termed CUrvature MAtching (CUMA), which can achieve robust fairness generalizable to unseen domains with unknown distributional shifts. Specifically, CUMA enforces the model to have similar generalization ability on the majority and minority groups, by matching the loss curvature distributions of the two groups.

Our model, named ExtreMA, follows the plain BYOL approach where the instance representation from the unmasked subset is trained to predict that from the intact input. Instead of encouraging invariance across inputs, learning requires the model to capture informative variations in an image. The paper makes three contributions: 1) It presents random masking as a strong and computationally efficient data augmentation for siamese representation learning. 2) With multiple sampling per instance, extreme masking greatly speeds up learning and improves performance with more data. 3) ExtreMA obtains stronger linear probing performance than masked modeling methods, and better transfer performance than prior contrastive models",

    "abstract": "The softmax function combined with a cross-entropy loss is a principled approach to modeling probability distributions that has become ubiquitous in deep learning. The softmax function is defined by a lone hyperparameter, the temperature, that is commonly set to one or regarded as a way to tune model confidence after training; however, less is known about how the temperature impacts training dynamics or generalization performance. In this work we develop a theory of early learning for models trained with softmax-cross-entropy loss and show that the learning dynamics depend crucially on the inverse-temperature $\\beta$ as well as the magnitude of the logits at initialization, $||\\beta\\textbf{z}||_{2}$. We follow up these analytic results with a large-scale empirical study of a variety of model architectures trained on CIFAR10, ImageNet, and IMDB sentiment analysis. We find that generalization performance depends strongly on the temperature, but only weakly on the initial logit magnitude. We provide evidence that the dependence of generalization on $\\beta$ is not due to changes in model confidence, but is a dynamical phenomenon. It follows that the addition of $\\beta$ as a tunable hyperparameter is key to maximizing model performance. Although we find the optimal $\\beta$ to be sensitive to the architecture, experimental results suggest that tuning $\\beta$ over the range $10^{-2}$ to $10^1$ improves performance over all architectures studied. We find that smaller $\\beta$ may lead to better peak performance at the cost of sensitivity to the random seed",

    "abstract": "Personalized federated learning, as a variant of federated learning, trains customized models for clients using their heterogeneously distributed data. However, it is still inconclusive about how to design personalized models with better representation of shared global knowledge and personalized pattern. To bridge the gap, we in this paper explore personalized models with low-rank and sparse decomposition. Specifically, we employ proper regularization to extract a low-rank global knowledge representation (GKR), so as to distill global knowledge into a compact representation. Subsequently, we employ a sparse component over the obtained GKR to fuse the personalized pattern into the global knowledge. As a solution, we propose a two-stage proximal-based algorithm named \\textbf{Fed}erated learning with mixed \\textbf{S}parse and \\textbf{L}ow-\\textbf{R}ank representation (FedSLR) to efficiently search for the mixed models. Theoretically, under proper assumptions, we show that the GKR trained by FedSLR can at least sub-linearly converge to a stationary point of the regularized problem, and that the sparse component being fused can converge to its stationary point under proper settings. Extensive experiments also demonstrate the superior empirical performance of FedSLR. Moreover, FedSLR reduces the number of parameters, and lowers the down-link communication complexity, which are all desirable for federated learning algorithms.

As a threat model, we consider cost-effective targeted attacks---these attacks minimally alter rewards to make the attacker's target policy uniquely optimal under the poisoned rewards, with the optimality gap specified by an attack parameter. Our goal is to design agents that are robust against such attacks in terms of the worst-case utility w.r.t. the true, unpoisoned, rewards while computing their policies under the poisoned rewards. We propose an optimization framework for deriving optimal defense policies, both when the attack parameter is known and unknown. For this optimization framework, we first provide characterization results for generic attack cost functions. These results show that the functional form of the attack cost function and the agent's knowledge about it are critical for establishing lower bounds on the agent's performance, as well as for the computational tractability of the defense problem. We then focus on a cost function based on $\\ell_2$ norm, for which we show that the defense problem can be efficiently solved and yields defense policies whose expected returns under the true rewards are lower bounded by their expected returns under the poison rewards. Using simulation-based experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our defense approach",

To address this issue, memory-based continual learning has been actively studied and stands out as one of the best-performing methods. We examine memory-based continual learning and identify that large variation in the representation space is crucial for avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Motivated by this, we propose to diversify representations by using two types of perturbations: model-agnostic variation (i.e., the variation is generated without the knowledge of the learned neural network) and model-based variation (i.e., the variation is conditioned on the learned neural network). We demonstrate that enlarging representational variation serves as a general principle to improve continual learning. Finally, we perform empirical studies which demonstrate that our method, as a simple plug-and-play component, can consistently improve a number of memory-based continual learning methods by a large margin",

    "title": "Costs and Benefits of Fair Regression",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Real-world applications of machine learning tools in high-stakes domains are often regulated to be fair, in the sense that the predicted target should satisfy some quantitative notion of parity with respect to a protected attribute. However, the exact tradeoff between fairness and accuracy with a real-valued target is not entirely clear. In this paper, we characterize the inherent tradeoff between statistical parity and accuracy in the regression setting by providing a lower bound on the error of any attribute-blind fair regressor. Our lower bound is sharp, algorithm-independent, and admits a simple interpretation: when the moments of the target differ between groups, any fair algorithm has to make an error on at least one of the groups. We further extend this result to give a lower bound on the joint error of any (approximately) fair algorithm, using the Wasserstein distance to measure the quality of the approximation. With our novel lower bound, we also show that the price paid by a fair regressor that does not take the protected attribute as input is less than that of a fair regressor with explicit access to the protected attribute. On the upside, we establish the first connection between individual fairness, accuracy parity, and the Wasserstein distance by showing that if a regressor is individually fair, it also approximately verifies the accuracy parity, where the gap is again given by the Wasserstein distance between the two groups. Inspired by our theoretical results, we develop a practical algorithm for fair regression through the lens of representation learning, and conduct experiments on a real-world dataset to corroborate our findings",

For example, fluctuations in temperature at a weather station can be predicted using both temperatures and barometric readings. However, a challenge when modelling such data is that it is easy for a neural network to rely on the greatest joint correlations within the target stream, which may ignore a crucial but small information transfer from the source to the target stream. As well, there are often situations where the target stream may have previously been modelled independently and it would be useful to use that model to inform a new joint model. Here, we develop an information bottleneck approach for conditional learning on two dependent streams of data. Our method, which we call Transfer Entropy Bottleneck (TEB), allows one to learn a model that bottlenecks the directed information transferred from the source variable to the target variable, while quantifying this information transfer within the model. As such, TEB provides a useful new information bottleneck approach for modelling two statistically dependent streams of data in order to make predictions about one of them",

In this paper, we establish a Black-box Discrete Prompt Learning (\\textbf{BDPL}) to resonate with pragmatic interactions between the cloud infrastructure and edge devices. Particularly, instead of fine-tuning the model in the cloud, we adapt PLMs by prompt learning, which efficiently optimizes only a few parameters of the discrete prompts. Moreover, we consider the scenario that we do not have access to the parameters and gradients of the pre-trained models, except for its outputs given inputs. This black-box setting secures the cloud infrastructure from potential attack and misuse to cause a single-point failure, which is preferable to the white-box counterpart by current infrastructures. Under this black-box constraint, we apply a variance-reduced policy gradient algorithm to estimate the gradients of parameters in the categorical distribution of each discrete prompt. In light of our method, the user devices can efficiently tune their tasks by querying the PLMs bounded by a range of API calls. Our experiments on RoBERTa and GPT-3 demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves significant improvement on eight benchmarks in a cloud-device collaboration manner.

This contrasts from recent advances in image generation and representation learning, where Vector Quantization is more commonly employed. In this work, we attempt to bring these lines of research closer by revisiting vector quantization for image compression. We build upon the VQ-VAE framework and introduce several modifications. First, we replace the vanilla vector quantizer by a product quantizer. This intermediate solution between vector and scalar quantization allows for a much wider set of rate-distortion points: It implicitly defines high-quality quantizers that would otherwise require intractably large codebooks. Second, inspired by the success of Masked Image Modeling (MIM) in the context of self-supervised learning and generative image models, we propose a novel conditional entropy model which improves entropy coding by modelling the co-dependencies of the quantized latent codes. The resulting PQ-MIM model is surprisingly effective: its compression performance on par with recent hyperprior methods. It also outperforms HiFiC in terms of FID and KID metrics when optimized with perceptual losses (e.g. adversarial). Finally, since PQ-MIM is compatible with image generation frameworks, we show qualitatively that it can operate under a hybrid mode between compression and generation, with no further training or finetuning. As a result, we explore the extreme compression regime where an image is compressed into 200 bytes, i.e., less than a tweet",

This implies dependencis for observations within one cluster, leading to violations of i.i.d. assumptions, biased estimates, and false inference. A typical approach to address this issue is to include random effects instead of fixed effects. We introduce the general mixedML framework, which includes random effects in supervised regression machine learning models, and present different estimation procedures. A segmentation of the problem allows to include random effects as an additional correction to the standard machine learning regression problem. Thus, the framework can be applied on top of the machine learning task, without the need to change the model or architecture, which distinguishes mixedML from other models in this field. With a simulation study and empirical data sets, we show that the framework produces comparable estimates to typical mixed effects frameworks in the linear case and increases the prediction quality and the gained information of the standard machine learning models in both the linear and non-linear case. Furthermore, the presented estimation procedures significantly decrease estimation time.

We find that robust networks have consistently higher NCG accuracy than natural training, even when the OOD data is much farther away than the robustness radius. This implies that the local regularization of robust training has a significant impact on the network's decision regions.

While there has been much progress made for deterministic interacting systems, modeling is much more challenging for stochastic systems in which one is interested in obtaining a predictive distribution over future trajectories. Existing methods are either computationally slow since they rely on Monte Carlo sampling or make simplifying assumptions such that the predictive distribution is unimodal. In this work, we present a deep state-space model which employs graph neural networks in order to model the underlying interacting dynamical system. The predictive distribution is multimodal and has the form of a Gaussian mixture model, where the moments of the Gaussian components can be computed via deterministic moment matching rules. Our moment matching scheme can be exploited for sample-free inference leading to more efficient and stable training compared to Monte Carlo alternatives. Furthermore, we propose structured approximations to the covariance matrices of the Gaussian components in order to scale up to systems with many agents. We benchmark our novel framework on two challenging autonomous driving datasets. Both confirm the benefits of our method compared to state-of-the-art methods. We further demonstrate the usefulness of our individual contributions in a carefully designed ablation study and provide a detailed empirical runtime analysis of our proposed covariance approximations",

This observation inspires us to study a special type of OT problem and propose {\\it a modified Hungarian algorithm} to solve it {\\it exactly}. For the OT problem involving two marginals with $m$ and $n$ atoms ($m\\geq n$), respectively, the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is $\\mathcal{O}(m^2n)$. Computing the empirical Wasserstein distance in the independence test requires solving this special type of OT problem, where $m=n^2$. The associated computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is $\\mathcal{O}(n^5)$, while the order of applying the classic Hungarian algorithm is $\\mathcal{O}(n^6)$. In addition to the aforementioned special type of OT problem, it is shown that the modified Hungarian algorithm could be adopted to solve a wider range of OT problems. Broader applications of the proposed algorithm are discussed---solving the one-to-many assignment problem and the many-to-many assignment problem. We conduct numerical experiments to validate our theoretical results.

This enabled the exploration of a number of attractive new applications both in clinical and laboratory settings. However, no standardized datasets generated with different types of experimental set-up and associated processing methods are available to facilitate advances in broader applications of OA in clinical settings. This complicates an objective comparison between new and established data processing methods, often leading to qualitative results and arbitrary interpretations of the data. In this paper, we provide both experimental and synthetic OA raw signals and reconstructed image domain datasets rendered with different experimental parameters and tomographic acquisition geometries. We further provide trained neural networks to tackle three important challenges related to OA image processing, namely accurate reconstruction under limited view tomographic conditions, removal of spatial undersampling artifacts and anatomical segmentation for improved image reconstruction.

    "abstract": "Repeated applications of the same neural block primarily based on self-attention characterize the current state-of-the-art in neural architectures for machine translation. In such architectures the decoder adopts a masked version of the same encoding block. Although simple this strategy doesn't encode the various inductive biases such as locality that arise from alternative architectures and that are central to the modelling of translation. We propose Lasagna, an encoder-decoder model that aims to combine the inductive benefits of different architectures by layering multiple instances of different blocks. Lasagna's encoder first grows the representation from local to mid-sized using convolutional blocks and only then applies a pair of final self-attention blocks. Lasagna's decoder uses only convolutional blocks that attend to the encoder representation. On a large suit of machine translation tasks, we find that Lasagna not only matches or outperforms the Transformer baseline, but it does so more efficiently thanks to widespread use of the efficient convolutional blocks. These findings suggest that the widespread use of uniform architectures may be suboptimal in certain scenarios and exploiting the diversity of inductive architectural biases can lead to substantial gains",

    "abstract": "Generating text with autoregressive language models (LMs) is of great importance to many natural language processing (NLP) applications. Previous solutions for this task often produce text that contains degenerative expressions (Welleck et al., 2020) or lacks semantic consistency (Basu et al., 2021). Recently, Su et al. (2022b) introduced a new decoding method, contrastive search, based on the isotropic representation space of the language model and obtained new state of the art on various benchmarks. Additionally, Su et al. (2022b) argued that the representations of autoregressive LMs (e.g. GPT-2) are intrinsically anisotropic which is also shared by previous studies (Ethayarajh, 2019). Therefore, to ensure the language model follows an isotropic distribution, Su et al. (2022b) proposed a contrastive learning scheme, SimCTG, which calibrates the language model's representations through additional training. In this study, we first answer the question: \"Are autoregressive LMs really anisotropic?\". To this end, we extensively evaluate the isotropy of LMs across 16 major languages. Surprisingly, we find that the anisotropic problem only exists in the two specific English GPT-2-small/medium models. On the other hand, all other evaluated LMs are naturally isotropic which is in contrast to the conclusion drawn by previous studies (Ethayarajh, 2019; Su et al., 2022b). Based on our findings, we further assess the contrastive search decoding method using off-the-shelf LMs on four generation tasks across 16 languages. Our experimental results demonstrate that contrastive search significantly outperforms previous decoding methods without any additional training. More notably, on 12 out of the 16 evaluated languages, contrastive search performs comparably with human-level performances as judged by human evaluations",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Mobile vision transformers (MobileViT) can achieve state-of-the-art performance across several mobile vision tasks, including classification and detection. Though these models have fewer parameters, they have high latency as compared to convolutional neural network-based models. The main efficiency bottleneck in MobileViT is the multi-headed self-attention (MHA) in transformers, which requires $O(k^2)$ time complexity with respect to the number of tokens (or patches) $k$. Moreover, MHA requires costly operations (e.g., batch-wise matrix multiplication) for computing self-attention, impacting latency on resource-constrained devices. This paper introduces a separable self-attention method with linear complexity, i.e. $O(k)$. A simple yet effective characteristic of the proposed method is that it uses element-wise operations for computing self-attention, making it a good choice for resource-constrained devices. The improved model, MobileViTv2, is state-of-the-art on several mobile vision tasks, including ImageNet object classification and MS-COCO object detection. With about three million parameters, MobileViTv2 achieves a top-1 accuracy of 75.6% on the ImageNet dataset, outperforming MobileViT by about 1% while running $3.2\\times$ faster on a mobile device.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we empirically analyze a simple, non-learnable, and nonparametric Nadaraya-Watson (NW) prediction head that can be used with any neural network architecture. In the NW head, the prediction is a weighted average of labels from a support set. The weights are computed from distances between the query feature and support features. This is in contrast to the dominant approach of using a learnable classification head (e.g., a fully-connected layer) on the features, which can be challenging to interpret and can yield poorly calibrated predictions. Our empirical results on an array of computer vision tasks demonstrate that the NW head can yield better calibration with comparable accuracy compared to its parametric counterpart, particularly in data-limited settings. To further increase inference-time efficiency, we propose a simple approach that involves a clustering step run on the training set to create a relatively small distilled support set. Furthermore, we explore two means of interpretability/explainability that fall naturally from the NW head. The first is the label weights, and the second is our novel concept of the ``support influence function,'' which is an easy-to-compute metric that quantifies the influence of a support element on the prediction for a given query. As we demonstrate in our experiments, the influence function can allow the user to debug a trained model. We believe that the NW head is a flexible, interpretable, and highly useful building block that can be used in a range of applications",

One challenge of using them is overcoming representation error, the fundamental limitation of the network in representing any particular signal. Recently, multiple proposed inversion algorithms reduce representation error by optimizing over intermediate layer representations. These methods are typically applied to generative models that were trained agnostic of the downstream inversion algorithm. In our work, we introduce a principle that if a generative model is intended for inversion using an algorithm based on optimization of intermediate layers, it should be trained in a way that regularizes those intermediate layers. We instantiate this principle for two notable recent inversion algorithms: Intermediate Layer Optimization and the Multi-Code GAN prior. For both of these inversion algorithms, we introduce a new regularized GAN training algorithm and demonstrate that the learned generative model results in lower reconstruction errors across a wide range of under sampling ratios when solving compressed sensing, inpainting, and super-resolution problems",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are often trained on the premise that the complete training data set is provided ahead of time. However, in real-world scenarios, data often arrive in chunks over time. This leads to important considerations about the optimal strategy for training DNNs, such as whether to fine-tune them with each chunk of incoming data (warm-start) or to retrain them from scratch with the entire corpus of data whenever a new chunk is available. While employing the latter for training can be resource-intensive, recent work has pointed out the lack of generalization in warm-start models. Therefore, to strike a balance between efficiency and generalization, we introduce \"Learn, Unlearn, and Relearn (LURE)\" an online learning paradigm for DNNs. LURE interchanges between the unlearning phase, which selectively forgets the undesirable information in the model through weight reinitialization in a data-dependent manner, and the relearning phase, which emphasizes learning on generalizable features. We show that our training paradigm provides consistent performance gains across datasets in both classification and few-shot settings.

Hence, in this paper, we consider a new, more realistic, and more challenging problem setting where the pixel-level classifier has to be trained with labeled images and unlabeled open-world images—we name it open world semantic segmentation (OSS). In OSS, the trained classifier is expected to identify unknown-class pixels and classify known-class pixels well. To solve OSS, we first investigate which distribution that unknown-class pixels obey. Then, motivated by the goodness-of-fit test, we use statistical measurements to show how a pixel fits the distribution of an unknown class and select highly-fitted pixels to form the unknown region in each test image. Eventually, we propose an end-to-end learning framework, known-region-aware domain alignment (KRADA), to distinguish unknown classes while aligning the distributions of known classes in labeled and unlabeled open-world images.

Is it possible to turn the agent's firehose of sensory information into a minimal latent state that is both necessary and sufficient for an agent to successfully act in the world? We formulate this question concretely, and propose the Agent Control-Endogenous State Discovery algorithm (AC-State), which has theoretical guarantees and is practically demonstrated to discover the minimal control-endogenous latent state which contains all of the information necessary for controlling the agent, while fully discarding all irrelevant information. This algorithm consists of a multi-step inverse model (predicting actions from distant observations) with an information bottleneck. AC-State enables localization, exploration, and navigation without reward or demonstrations.

Several works have recently been proposed around exploring the token attributions along the intrinsic decision process. However, the ambiguity of the expression formulation can lead to an accumulation of error, which makes the interpretation less trustworthy and less applicable to different variants. In this work, we propose a novel method to approximate token contributions inside Transformers. We start from the partial derivative to each token, divide the interpretation process into attention perception and reasoning feedback with the chain rule and explore each part individually with explicit mathematical derivations. In attention perception, we propose the head-wise and token-wise approximations in order to learn how the tokens interact to form the pooled vector. As for reasoning feedback, we adopt a noise-decreasing strategy by applying the integrated gradients to the last attention map. Our method is further validated qualitatively and quantitatively through the faithfulness evaluations across different settings: single modality (BERT and ViT) and bi-modality (CLIP), different model sizes (ViT-L) and different pooling strategies (ViT-MAE) to demonstrate the broad applicability and clear improvements over existing methods",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Compiling together spatial and temporal modules via a unified framework, Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) have been popularly used in the multivariate spatio-temporal forecasting task, e.g. traffic prediction. After the numerous propositions of manually designed architectures, researchers show interest in the Neural Architecture Search (NAS) of STGNNs. Existing methods suffer from two issues: (1) hyperparameters like learning rate, channel size cannot be integrated into the NAS framework, which makes the model evaluation less accurate, potentially misleading the architecture search (2) the current search space, which basically mimics Darts-like methods, is too large for the search algorithm to find a sufficiently good candidate. In this work, we deal with both issues at the same time. We first re-examine the importance and transferability of the training hyperparameters to ensure a fair and fast comparison. Next, we set up a framework that disentangles architecture design into three disjoint angles according to how spatio-temporal representations flow and transform in architectures, which allows us to understand the behavior of architectures from a distributional perspective. This way, we can obtain good guidelines to reduce the STGNN search space and find state-of-the-art architectures by simple random search. As an illustrative example, we combine these principles with random search which already significantly outperforms both state-of-the-art hand-designed models and recently automatically searched ones",

    "abstract": "Decentralized Actor-Critic (AC) algorithms have been widely utilized for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and have achieved remarkable success. Apart from its empirical success, the theoretical convergence property of decentralized AC algorithms is largely unexplored. Most of the existing finite-time convergence results are derived based on either double-loop update or two-timescale step sizes rule, and this is the case even for centralized AC algorithm under a single-agent setting. In practice, the *single-timescale* update is widely utilized, where actor and critic are updated in an alternating manner with step sizes being of the same order. In this work, we study a decentralized *single-timescale* AC algorithm. Theoretically, using linear approximation for value and reward estimation, we show that the algorithm has sample complexity of $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\varepsilon^{-2})$ under Markovian sampling, which matches the optimal complexity with a double-loop implementation (here, $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}$ hides a logarithmic term). When we reduce to the single-agent setting, our result yields new sample complexity for centralized AC using a single-timescale update scheme. The central to establishing our complexity results is *the hidden smoothness of the optimal critic variable* we revealed. We also provide a local action privacy-preserving version of our algorithm and its analysis. Finally, we conduct experiments to show the superiority of our algorithm over the existing decentralized AC algorithms",

In this paper, inspired by evolution processes, we propose a novel resource-efficient supervised feature selection method using sparse neural networks, named \"NeuroFS\". By gradually pruning the uninformative features from the input layer of a sparse neural network trained from scratch, NeuroFS derives an informative subset of features efficiently. By performing several experiments on $11$ low and high-dimensional real-world benchmarks of different types, we demonstrate that NeuroFS achieves the highest ranking-based score among the considered state-of-the-art supervised feature selection models.

In Geometric Statistics, the sample Fréchet mean represents one of the most fundamental statistical summaries, as it generalizes the sample mean for data belonging to nonlinear manifolds. In that spirit, the only geometric statistical query for which a differential privacy mechanism has been developed, so far, is for the release of the sample Fréchet mean: the \\emph{Riemannian Laplace mechanism} was recently proposed to privatize the Fréchet mean on complete Riemannian manifolds. In many fields, the manifold of Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices is used to model data spaces, including in medical imaging where privacy requirements are key. We propose a novel, simple and fast mechanism - the \\emph{tangent Gaussian mechanism} - to compute a differentially private Fréchet mean on the SPD manifold endowed with the log-Euclidean Riemannian metric.

This means that the risk inherent in a loss distribution is summarized using a single number - its average. In this paper, we propose a general approach to construct risk measures which exhibit a desired tail sensitivity and may replace the expectation operator in ERM. Our method relies on the specification of a reference distribution with a desired tail behaviour, which is in a one-to-one correspondence to a coherent upper probability. Any risk measure, which is compatible with this upper probability, displays a tail sensitivity which is finely tuned to the reference distribution. As a concrete example, we focus on divergence risk measures based on f-divergence ambiguity sets, which are a widespread tool used to foster distributional robustness of machine learning systems. For instance, we show how ambiguity sets based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence are intricately tied to the class of subexponential random variables.

    "abstract": "The modelling framework of neural algorithmic reasoning (Veličković & Blundell, 2021) postulates that a continuous neural network may learn to emulate the discrete reasoning steps of a symbolic algorithm. We investigate the underlying hypothesis in the most simple conceivable scenario – the addition of real numbers. Our results show that two layer neural networks fail to learn the structure of the task, despite containing multiple solutions of the true function within their hypothesis class. Growing the network's width leads to highly complex error regions in the input space. Moreover, we find that the network fails to generalise with increasing severity i) in the training domain, ii) outside of the training domain but within its convex hull, and iii) outside the training domain's convex hull. This behaviour can be emulated with Gaussian process regressors that use radial basis function kernels of decreasing length scale. Classical results establish an equivalence between Gaussian processes and infinitely wide neural networks. We demonstrate a tight linkage between the scaling of a network weights' standard deviation and its effective length scale on a sinusoidal regression problem, suggesting simple modifications to control the length scale of the function learned by a neural network and, thus, its smoothness. This has important applications for the different generalisation scenarios suggested above, but it also suggests a partial remedy to the brittleness of neural network predictions as exposed by adversarial examples. We demonstrate the gains in adversarial robustness that our modification achieves on a standard classification problem of handwritten digit recognition. In conclusion, this work shows inherent problems of neural networks even for the simplest algorithmic tasks which, however, may be partially remedied through links to Gaussian processes",

Revisiting the insights of LeCun (1985) and Lee et al (2015), we present a simple version of TP based on regularized inversions of layers of recurrent neural networks.

    "abstract": "The causal bandit problem setting is a sequential decision-making framework where actions of interest correspond to interventions on variables in a system assumed to be governed by a causal model. The underlying causality may be exploited when investigating actions in the interest of optimizing the yield of the reward variable. Most existing approaches assume prior knowledge of the underlying causal graph, which is in practice restrictive and often unrealistic. In this paper, we develop a novel Bayesian framework for tackling causal bandit problems that does not rely on possession of the causal graph, but rather simultaneously learns the causal graph while exploiting causal inferences to optimize the reward. Our methods efficiently utilize joint inferences from interventional and observational data in a unified Bayesian model constructed with intervention calculus and causal graph learning. For the implementation of our proposed methodology in the discrete distributional setting, we derive an approximation of the sampling variance of the backdoor adjustment estimator. In the Gaussian setting, we characterize the interventional variance with intervention calculus and propose a simple graphical criterion to share information between arms. We validate our proposed methodology in an extensive empirical study, demonstrating compelling cumulative regret performance against state-of-the-art standard algorithms as well as optimistic implementations of their causal variants that assume strong prior knowledge of the causal structure",

    "abstract": "Quality-Diversity (QD) optimization algorithms are a well-known approach to generate large collections of diverse and high-quality solutions. However, derived from evolutionary computation, QD algorithms are population-based methods which are known to be data-inefficient and requires large amounts of computational resources. This makes QD algorithms slow when used in applications where solution evaluations are computationally costly. A common approach to speed up QD algorithms is to evaluate solutions in parallel, for instance by using physical simulators in robotics. Yet, this approach is limited to several dozen of parallel evaluations as most physics simulators can only be parallelized more with a greater number of CPUs. With recent advances in simulators that run on accelerators, thousands of evaluations can now be performed in parallel on single GPU/TPU. In this paper, we present QDax, an accelerated implementation of MAP-Elites which leverages massive parallelism on accelerators to make QD algorithms more accessible. We show that QD algorithms are ideal candidates to take advantage of progress in hardware acceleration. We demonstrate that QD algorithms can scale with massive parallelism to be run at interactive timescales without any significant effect on the performance. Results across standard optimization functions and four neuroevolution benchmark environments shows that experiment runtimes are reduced by two factors of magnitudes, turning days of computation into minutes. More surprising, we observe that reducing the number of generations by two orders of magnitude, and thus having significantly shorter lineage does not impact the performance of QD algorithms. These results show that QD can now benefit from hardware acceleration, which contributed significantly to the bloom of deep learning",

These situations are typically rife with uncertainty due to unknown or stochastic characteristics of the environment as well as limited offline training data. As a result, the value of a decision at any time point should be based on the distribution of its anticipated effects. We propose a framework to identify worst-case decision points, by explicitly estimating distributions of the expected return of a decision. These estimates enable earlier indication of dead-ends in a manner that is tunable based on the risk tolerance of the designed task. We demonstrate the utility of Distributional Dead-end Discovery (DistDeD) in a toy domain as well as when assessing the risk of severely ill patients in the intensive care unit reaching a point where death is unavoidable. We find that DistDeD significantly improves over prior discovery approaches, providing indications of the risk 10 hours earlier on average as well as increasing detection by 20%",

In this work, we propose a general model-agnostic technique for improving the image quality and the distribution fidelity of generated images obtained by any generative model. Our method, termed BIGRoC (Boosting Image Generation via a Robust Classifier), is based on a post-processing procedure via the guidance of a given robust classifier and without a need for additional training of the generative model. Given a synthesized image, we propose to update it through projected gradient steps over the robust classifier to refine its recognition. We demonstrate this post-processing algorithm on various image synthesis methods and show a significant quantitative and qualitative improvement on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. Surprisingly, although BIGRoC is the first model agnostic among refinement approaches and requires much less information, it outperforms competitive methods. Specifically, BIGRoC improves the image synthesis best performing diffusion model on ImageNet $128\\times128$ by 14.81%, attaining an FID score of 2.53 and on $256\\times256$ by 7.87%, achieving an FID of 3.63.

Backpropagation of error (BP) is an example of such an approach and has proven to be a highly successful application of stochastic gradient descent to deep neural networks. We propose constrained parameter inference (COPI) as a new principle for learning. The COPI approach assumes that learning can be set up in a manner where parameters infer their own values based upon observations of their local neuron activities. We find that this estimation of network parameters is possible under the constraints of decorrelated neural inputs and top-down perturbations of neural states for credit assignment. We show that the decorrelation required for COPI allows learning at extremely high learning rates, competitive with that of adaptive optimizers, as used by BP. We further demonstrate that COPI affords a new approach to feature analysis and network compression. Finally, we argue that COPI may shed new light on learning in biological networks given the evidence for decorrelation in the brain",

Performing mixup for transfer learning with pre-trained models however is not that simple, a high capacity pre-trained model with a large fully-connected (FC) layer could easily overfit to the target dataset even with samples-to-labels mixed up. In this work, we propose SMILE — Sample-to-feature Mixup for Efficient Transfer Learning. With mixed images as inputs, SMILE regularizes the outputs of CNN feature extractors to learn from the mixed feature vectors of inputs, in addition to the mixed labels. SMILE incorporates a mean teacher to provide the surrogate \"ground truth\" for mixed feature vectors. The sample-to-feature mixup regularizer is imposed both on deep features for the target domain and classifier outputs for the source domain, bounding the linearity in-between samples for target tasks. Extensive experiments have been done to verify the performance improvement made by SMILE, in comparisons with a wide spectrum of transfer learning algorithms, including fine-tuning, L$^2$-SP, DELTA, BSS, RIFLE, Co-Tuning and RegSL, even with mixup strategies combined. Ablation studies show that the vanilla sample-to-label mixup strategies could marginally increase the linearity in-between training samples but lack of generalizability, while SMILE significantly improves the mixup effects in both label and feature spaces with both training and testing datasets.

For each task, a scheduling probability is decided based on four different metrics: (i) task depth, (ii) number of ground-truth samples per task, (iii) amount of training completed, and (iv) task stagnancy. Based on the scheduling probability, specific tasks get joint computation cycles while others are \"dropped\".

The model parameters are often learned using cross-validation or maximum-likelihood techniques. But when training data arrives in a streaming fashion, the implementation of such techniques can only be done in an approximate manner. Even if this limitation could be overcome, there appears to be no clear-cut results on the statistical properties of the resulting predictor. Here we consider a covariance-fitting method to learn the model parameters, which was initially developed for spectral estimation. We first show that the use of this approach results in a computationally efficient online learning method in which the resulting predictor can be updated sequentially. We then prove that, with high probability, its out-of-sample error approaches the optimal level at a root-$n$ rate, where $n$ is the number of data samples. This is so even if the nominal covariance model is misspecified. Moreover, we show that the resulting predictor enjoys two robustness properties. First, it corresponds to a predictor that minimizes the out-of-sample error with respect to the least favourable distribution within a given Wasserstein distance from the empirical distribution. Second, it is robust against errors in the covariate training data. We illustrate the performance of the proposed method in a numerical experiment",

To add to the theoretical tools available to study gradient descent we propose the principal flow (PF), a continuous time flow that approximates gradient descent dynamics. To our knowledge, the PF is the only continuous flow that captures the divergent and oscillatory behaviors of gradient descent, including escaping local minima and saddle points. Through its dependence on the eigendecomposition of the Hessian the PF sheds light on the recently observed edge of stability phenomena in deep learning. Using our new understanding of instability we propose a learning rate adaptation method which enables us to control the trade-off between training stability and test set evaluation performance",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Many of the recent advances in the field of artificial intelligence have been fueled by the highly successful backpropagation of error (BP) algorithm, which efficiently solves the credit assignment problem in artificial neural networks. However, it is unlikely that BP is implemented in its usual form within biological neural networks, because of its reliance on non-local information in propagating error gradients. Since biological neural networks are capable of highly efficient learning and responses from BP trained models can be related to neural responses, it seems reasonable that a biologically viable approximation of BP underlies synaptic plasticity in the brain. Gradient-adjusted incremental target propagation (GAIT-prop or GP for short) has recently been derived directly from BP and has been shown to successfully train networks in a more biologically plausible manner. However, so far, GP has only been shown to work on relatively low-dimensional problems, such as handwritten-digit recognition. This work addresses some of the scaling issues in GP and shows it to perform effective multi-layer credit assignment in deeper networks and on the much more challenging ImageNet dataset",

Our contributions are: (i) we derive a rotation-equivariant attention mechanism which eliminates the need for the heavy feature preprocessing required by the original Vector Neurons models; (ii) we extend the VN framework to support non-spatial attributes, expanding the applicability of these models to real-world datasets; (iii) we derive a rotation-equivariant mechanism for multi-scale reduction of point-cloud resolution, greatly speeding up inference and training; (iv) we show that small tradeoffs in equivariance ($\\epsilon$-approximate equivariance) can be used to obtain large improvements in numerical stability and training robustness on accelerated hardware, and we bound the propagation of equivariance violations in our models.

    "abstract": "For an ordinal regression task, a classification task for ordinal data, one-dimensional transformation (1DT)-based methods are often employed since they are considered to capture the ordinal relation of ordinal data well. They learn a 1DT of the observation of the explanatory variables so that an observation with a larger class label tends to have a larger value of the 1DT, and classify the observation by labeling that learned 1DT. In this paper, we study the labeling procedure for 1DT-based methods, which have not been sufficiently discussed in existing studies. While regression-based methods and classical threshold methods conventionally use threshold labelings, which label a learned 1DT according to the rank of the interval to which the 1DT belongs among intervals on the real line separated by threshold parameters, we prove that likelihood-based labeling used in popular statistical 1DT-based methods is also a threshold labeling in typical usages. Moreover, we show that these threshold labelings can be sub-optimal ones depending on the learning result of the 1DT and the task under consideration. On the basis of these findings, we propose to apply empirical optimal threshold labeling, which is a threshold labeling that uses threshold parameters minimizing the empirical task risk for a learned 1DT, to those methods. In experiments with real-world datasets, changing the labeling procedure of existing 1DT-based methods to the proposed one improved the classification performance in many tried cases",

    "abstract": "We propose a new framework for imitation learning---treating imitation as a two-player ranking-based game between a policy and a reward. In this game, the reward agent learns to satisfy pairwise performance rankings between behaviors, while the policy agent learns to maximize this reward. In imitation learning, near-optimal expert data can be difficult to obtain, and even in the limit of infinite data cannot imply a total ordering over trajectories as preferences can. On the other hand, learning from preferences alone is challenging as a large number of preferences are required to infer a high-dimensional reward function, though preference data is typically much easier to collect than expert demonstrations. The classical inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) formulation learns from expert demonstrations but provides no mechanism to incorporate learning from offline preferences and vice versa. We instantiate the proposed ranking-game framework with a novel ranking loss giving an algorithm that can simultaneously learn from expert demonstrations and preferences, gaining the advantages of both modalities. Our experiments show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art sample efficiency and can solve previously unsolvable tasks in the Learning from Observation (LfO) setting",

    "abstract": "An important issue in competitive multiagent scenarios is the distribution mismatch between training and testing caused by variations in other agents' policies. As a result, policies optimized during training are typically sub-optimal (possibly very poor) in testing. Ensemble training is an effective approach for learning robust policies that avoid significant performance degradation when competing against previously unseen opponents. A large ensemble can improve diversity during the training, which leads to more robust learning. However, the computation and memory requirements increase linearly with respect to the ensemble size, which is not scalable as the ensemble size required for learning robust policy can be quite large. This paper proposes a novel parameterization of a policy ensemble based on a deep latent variable model with a multi-task network architecture, which represents an ensemble of policies implicitly within a single network. Our implicit ensemble training (IET) approach strikes a better trade-off between ensemble diversity and scalability compared to standard ensemble training. We demonstrate in several competitive multiagent scenarios in the board game and robotic domains that our new approach improves robustness against unseen adversarial opponents while achieving higher sample-efficiency and less computation",

A different approach was proposed by V. Pestov, who links the intrinsic dimension axiomatically to the mathematical concentration of measure phenomenon. First methods to compute this and related notions for ID were computationally intractable for large-scale real-world datasets. In the present work, we derive a computationally feasible method for determining said axiomatic ID functions.

Such an RL setting is called low-switching-cost RL, i.e., achieving the highest reward while reducing the number of policy switches during training. It has been a recent trend in theoretical RL research to develop provably efficient RL algorithms with low switching cost. The core idea in these theoretical works is to measure the information gain and switch the policy when the information gain is doubled. Despite of the theoretical advances, none of existing approaches have been validated empirically. We conduct the first empirical evaluation of different policy switching criteria on popular RL testbeds, including a medical treatment environment, the Atari games, and robotic control tasks. Surprisingly, although information-gain-based methods do recover the optimal rewards, they often lead to a substantially higher switching cost. By contrast, we find that a feature-based criterion, which has been largely ignored in the theoretical research, consistently produces the best performances over all the domains.

The predicted probability of possible outcomes can inform high-stakes decision making, particularly when assessing the expected value of alternative decisions or the risk of bad outcomes. These decisions require well-calibrated probabilities, not just the correct prediction of the most likely class. Black-box classifier calibration methods can improve the reliability of a classifier's output without requiring retraining. However, these methods are unable to detect subpopulations where calibration could also improve prediction accuracy. Such subpopulations are said to exhibit \"hidden heterogeneity\" (HH), because the original classifier did not detect them. The paper proposes a quantitative measure for HH. It also introduces two similarity-weighted calibration methods that can address HH by adapting locally to each test item: SWC weights the calibration set by similarity to the test item, and SWC-HH explicitly incorporates hidden heterogeneity to filter the calibration set. Experiments show that the improvements in calibration achieved by similarity-based calibration methods correlate with the amount of HH present and, given sufficient calibration data, generally exceed calibration achieved by global methods. HH can therefore serve as a useful diagnostic tool for identifying when local calibration methods would be beneficial",

    "abstract": "Learning representations for pixel-based control has garnered significant attention recently in reinforcement learning. A wide range of methods have been proposed to enable efficient learning, leading to sample complexities similar to those in the full state setting. However, moving beyond carefully curated pixel data sets (centered crop, appropriate lighting, clear background, etc.) remains challenging. In this paper, we adopt a more difficult setting, incorporating background distractors, as a first step towards addressing this challenge. We start by exploring a simple baseline approach that does not use metric-based learning, data augmentations, world-model learning, or contrastive learning. We then analyze when and why previously proposed methods are likely to fail or reduce to the same performance as the baseline in this harder setting and why we should think carefully about extending such methods beyond the well curated environments. Our results show that finer categorization of benchmarks on the basis of characteristics like density of reward, planning horizon of the problem, presence of task-irrelevant components, etc., is crucial in evaluating algorithms. Based on these observations, we propose different metrics to consider when evaluating an algorithm on benchmark tasks.

    "title": "FedDAG: Federated DAG Structure Learning",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "To date, most directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) structure learning approaches require data to be stored in a central server. However, due to the consideration of privacy protection, data owners gradually refuse to share their personalized raw data to avoid private information leakage, making this task more troublesome by cutting off the first step. Thus, a puzzle arises: how do we discover the underlying DAG structure from decentralized data? In this paper, focusing on the additive noise models (ANMs) assumption of data generation, we take the first step in developing a gradient-based learning framework named FedDAG, which can learn the DAG structure without directly touching the local data and also can naturally handle the data heterogeneity. Our method benefits from a two-level structure of each local model. The first level structure learns the edges and directions of the graph and communicates with the server to get the model information from other clients during the learning procedure, while the second level structure approximates the mechanisms among variables and personally updates on its own data to accommodate the data heterogeneity. Moreover, FedDAG formulates the overall learning task as a continuous optimization problem by taking advantage of an equality acyclicity constraint, which can be solved by gradient descent methods to boost the searching efficiency. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets verify the efficacy of the proposed method",

In the case of heterogeneous data distributions at the network nodes, collaboration can yield predictors with unsatisfactory performance for a subset of the devices. For this reason, in this work, we consider the formulation of a distributionally robust decentralized learning task and we propose a decentralized single loop gradient descent/ascent algorithm (AD-GDA) to directly solve the underlying minimax optimization problem. We render our algorithm communication-efficient by employing a compressed consensus scheme and we provide convergence guarantees for smooth convex and non-convex loss functions.

    "abstract": "Advances in computer vision are pushing the limits of image manipulation, with generative models sampling highly-realistic detailed images on various tasks. However, a specialized model is often developed and trained for each specific task, even though many image edition tasks share similarities. In denoising, inpainting, or image compositing, one always aims at generating a realistic image from a low-quality one. In this paper, we aim at making a step towards a unified approach for image editing. To do so, we propose EdiBERT, a bidirectional transformer that re-samples image patches conditionally to a given image. Using one generic objective, we show that the model resulting from a single training matches state-of-the-art GANs inversion on several tasks: image denoising, image completion, and image composition. We also provide several insights on the latent space of vector-quantized auto-encoders, such as locality and reconstruction capacities.

    "abstract": "The nuclear norm and Schatten-$p$ quasi-norm are popular rank proxies in low-rank matrix recovery. However, computing the nuclear norm or Schatten-$p$ quasi-norm of a tensor is hard in both theory and practice, hindering their application to low-rank tensor completion (LRTC) and tensor robust principal component analysis (TRPCA). In this paper, we propose a new class of tensor rank regularizers based on the Euclidean norms of the CP component vectors of a tensor and show that these regularizers are monotonic transformations of tensor Schatten-$p$ quasi-norm. This connection enables us to minimize the Schatten-$p$ quasi-norm in LRTC and TRPCA implicitly via the component vectors. The method scales to big tensors and provides an arbitrarily sharper rank proxy for low-rank tensor recovery compared to the nuclear norm. On the other hand, we study the generalization abilities of LRTC with the Schatten-$p$ quasi-norm regularizer and LRTC with the proposed regularizers. The theorems show that a relatively sharper regularizer leads to a tighter error bound, which is consistent with our numerical results. Particularly, we prove that for LRTC with Schatten-$p$ quasi-norm regularizer on $d$-order tensors, $p=1/d$ is always better than any $p>1/d$ in terms of the generalization ability. We also provide a recovery error bound to verify the usefulness of small $p$ in the Schatten-$p$ quasi-norm for TRPCA.

    "abstract": "Learning a reward function from human preferences is challenging as it typically requires having a high-fidelity simulator or using expensive and potentially unsafe actual physical rollouts in the environment. However, in many tasks the agent might have access to offline data from related tasks in the same target environment. While offline data is increasingly being used to aid policy optimization via offline RL, our observation is that it can be a surprisingly rich source of information for preference learning as well. We propose an approach that uses an offline dataset to craft preference queries via pool-based active learning, learns a distribution over reward functions, and optimizes a corresponding policy via offline RL. Crucially, our proposed approach does not require actual physical rollouts or an accurate simulator for either the reward learning or policy optimization steps. To test our approach, we first evaluate existing offline RL benchmarks for their suitability for offline reward learning. Surprisingly, for many offline RL domains, we find that simply using a trivial reward function results good policy performance, making these domains ill-suited for evaluating learned rewards. To address this, we identify a subset of existing offline RL benchmarks that are well suited for offline reward learning and also propose new offline apprenticeship learning benchmarks which allow for more open-ended behaviors. When evaluated on this curated set of domains, our empirical results suggest that combining offline RL with learned human preferences can enable an agent to learn to perform novel tasks that were not explicitly shown in the offline data",

    "abstract": "Robustness to distribution shift and fairness have independently emerged as two important desiderata required of modern machine learning models. While these two desiderata seem related, the connection between them is often unclear in practice. Here, we discuss these connections through a causal lens, focusing on anti-causal prediction tasks, where the input to a classifier (e.g., an image) is assumed to be generated as a function of the target label and the protected attribute. By taking this perspective, we draw explicit connections between a common fairness criterion - separation - and a common notion of robustness - risk invariance. These connections provide new motivation for applying the separation criterion in anticausal settings, and inform old discussions regarding fairness-performance tradeoffs. In addition, our findings suggest that robustness-motivated approaches can be used to enforce separation, and that they often work better in practice than methods designed to directly enforce separation. Using a medical dataset, we empirically validate our findings on the task of detecting pneumonia from X-rays, in a setting where differences in prevalence across sex groups motivates a fairness mitigation. Our findings highlight the importance of considering causal structure when choosing and enforcing fairness criteria",

We present Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM) to improve the transparency of language models. First, we taxonomize the vast space of potential scenarios (i.e. use cases) and metrics (i.e. desiderata) that are of interest for LMs. Then we select a broad subset based on coverage and feasibility, noting what's missing or underrepresented (e.g. question answering for neglected English dialects, metrics for trustworthiness). Second, we adopt a multi-metric approach: We measure 7 metrics (accuracy, calibration, robustness, fairness, bias, toxicity, and efficiency) for each of 16 core scenarios to the extent possible (87.5% of the time), ensuring that metrics beyond accuracy don't fall to the wayside, and that trade-offs across models and metrics are clearly exposed. We also perform 7 targeted evaluations, based on 26 targeted scenarios, to more deeply analyze specific aspects (e.g. knowledge, reasoning, memorization/copyright, disinformation). Third, we conduct a large-scale evaluation of 30 prominent language models (spanning open, limited-access, and closed models) on all 42 scenarios, including 21 scenarios that were not previously used in mainstream LM evaluation. Prior to HELM, models on average were evaluated on just 17.9% of the core HELM scenarios, with some prominent models not sharing a single scenario in common. We improve this to 96.0%: now all 30 models have been densely benchmarked on a set of core scenarios and metrics under standardized conditions. Our evaluation surfaces 25 top-level findings concerning the interplay between different scenarios, metrics, and models. For full transparency, we release all raw model prompts and completions publicly for further analysis, as well as a general modular toolkit for easily adding new scenarios, models, metrics, and prompting strategies.

    "abstract": "Mathematical models of infectious diseases have long been used for studying the mechanisms by which diseases spread, for predicting the spread of epidemics, and also for controlling their outbreaks. These models are based on some assumptions and different assumptions give rise to different models. Models on social networks of individuals which capture contact patterns are usually more realistic and can more accurately model contagion dynamics. Unfortunately, computing the output of realistic models is often hard. Thus, modeling the evolution of contagion dynamics over large complex networks constitutes a challenging task. In this paper, we present a computational approach to model the contagion dynamics underlying infectious diseases. Specifically, we focus on the susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) epidemic model on networks. Given that this model can be expressed by an intractable system of ordinary differential equations, we devise a simpler system that approximates the output of the model. Then, we capitalize on recent advances in neural ordinary differential equations and propose a neural architecture that can effectively predict the course of an epidemic on the network. We apply the proposed architecture on several network datasets and compare it against state-of-the-art methods under different experimental settings. Our results indicate that the proposed method improves predictions in various spreading scenarios, paving the way for the extensive application of interpretable neural networks in the field of epidemic spreading. At the same time, the proposed model is highly efficient even when trained on very large networks where traditional algorithms become significantly slower",

    "abstract": "Inversion by Direct Iteration (InDI) is a new formulation for supervised image restoration that avoids the so-called ``regression to the mean'' effect and produces more realistic and detailed images than existing regression-based methods. It does this by gradually improving image quality in small steps, similar to generative denoising diffusion models. Image restoration is an ill-posed problem where multiple high-quality images are plausible reconstructions of a given low-quality input. Therefore, the outcome of a single step regression model is typically an aggregate of all possible explanations, therefore lacking details and realism. The main advantage of InDI is that it does not try to predict the clean target image in a single step but instead gradually improves the image in small steps, resulting in better perceptual quality. While generative denoising diffusion models also work in small steps, our formulation is distinct in that it does not require knowledge of any analytic form of the degradation process. Instead, we directly learn an iterative restoration process from low-quality and high-quality paired examples. InDI can be applied to virtually any image degradation, given paired training data. In conditional denoising diffusion image restoration the denoising network generates the restored image by repeatedly denoising an initial image of pure noise, conditioned on the degraded input. Contrary to conditional denoising formulations, InDI directly proceeds by iteratively restoring the input low-quality image, producing high-quality results on a variety of image restoration tasks, including motion and out-of-focus deblurring, super-resolution, compression artifact removal, and denoising",

    "volume": "featured",
    "abstract": "Multitask learning is widely used in practice to train a low-resource target task by augmenting it with multiple related source tasks. Yet, naively combining all the source tasks with a target task does not always improve the prediction performance for the target task due to negative transfers. Thus, a critical problem in multitask learning is identifying subsets of source tasks that would benefit the target task. This problem is computationally challenging since the number of subsets grows exponentially with the number of source tasks; efficient heuristics for subset selection does not always capture the relationship between task subsets and multitask learning performances. In this paper, we introduce an efficient procedure to address this problem via surrogate modeling. In surrogate modeling, we sample (random) subsets of source tasks and precompute their multitask learning performances; Then, we approximate the precomputed performances with a linear regression model that can also be used to predict the multitask performance of unseen task subsets. We show theoretically and empirically that fitting this model only requires sampling linearly many subsets in the number of source tasks. The fitted model provides a relevance score between each source task and the target task; We use the relevance scores to perform subset selection for multitask learning by thresholding. Through extensive experiments, we show that our approach predicts negative transfers from multiple source tasks to target tasks much more accurately than existing task affinity measures. Additionally, we demonstrate that for five weak supervision datasets, our approach consistently improves upon existing optimization methods for multi-task learning",

    "abstract": "Although convolutional neural networks have been the dominant architecture for computer vision for many years, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have recently shown promise as an alternative. Subsequently, many new models have been proposed which replace the self-attention layer within the ViT architecture with novel operations (such as MLPs), all of which have also been relatively performant. We note that these architectures all share a common component--the patch embedding layer--which enables the use of a simple isotropic template with alternating steps of channel- and spatial-dimension mixing. This raises a question: is the success of ViT-style models due to novel, highly-expressive operations like self-attention, or is it at least in part due to using patches? In this paper, we present some evidence for the latter: specifically, we propose the ConvMixer, an extremely simple and parameter-efficient fully-convolutional model in which we replace the self-attention and MLP layers within the ViT with less-expressive depthwise and pointwise convolutional layers, respectively. Despite its unusual simplicity, ConvMixer outperforms the ViT, MLP-Mixer, and their variants for similar data set sizes and parameter counts, in addition to outperforming classical vision models like ResNet. We argue that this contributes to the evidence that patches are sufficient for designing simple and effective vision models. Our code is available at https://github.com/locuslab/convmixer",

It has been shown that the additional randomisation provided by the shuffler improves privacy bounds compared to the purely local mechanisms. Accounting tight bounds, however, is complicated by the complexity brought by the shuffler. The recently proposed numerical techniques for evaluating $(\\varepsilon,\\delta)$-differential privacy guarantees have been shown to give tighter bounds than commonly used methods for compositions of various complex mechanisms. In this paper, we show how to utilise these numerical accountants for adaptive compositions of general $\\varepsilon$-LDP shufflers and for shufflers of $k$-randomised response mechanisms, including their subsampled variants. This is enabled by an approximation that speeds up the evaluation of the corresponding privacy loss distribution from $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(n)$, where $n$ is the number of users, without noticeable change in the resulting $\\delta(\\varepsilon)$-upper bounds. We also demonstrate looseness of the existing bounds and methods found in the literature, improving previous composition results for shufflers significantly",

    "volume": "featured",
    "abstract": "Text-based dialogues are now widely used to solve real-world problems. In cases where solution strategies are already known, they can sometimes be codified into workflows and used to guide humans or artificial agents through the task of helping clients. We introduce a new problem formulation that we call Workflow Discovery (WD) in which we are interested in the situation where a formal workflow may not yet exist. Still, we wish to discover the set of actions that have been taken to resolve a particular problem. We also examine a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) approach for this novel task. We present experiments where we extract workflows from dialogues in the Action-Based Conversations Dataset (ABCD). Since the ABCD dialogues follow known workflows to guide agents, we can evaluate our ability to extract such workflows using ground truth sequences of actions. We propose and evaluate an approach that conditions models on the set of possible actions, and we show that using this strategy, we can improve WD performance. Our conditioning approach also improves zero-shot and few-shot WD performance when transferring learned models to unseen domains within and across datasets. Further, on ABCD a modified variant of our Seq2Seq method achieves state-of-the-art performance on related but different problems of Action State Tracking (AST) and Cascading Dialogue Success (CDS) across many evaluation metrics",

    "title": "SPADE: Semi-supervised Anomaly Detection under Distribution Mismatch",
    "volume": "featured",
    "abstract": "Semi-supervised anomaly detection is a common problem, as often the datasets containing anomalies are partially labeled. We propose a canonical framework: Semi-supervised Pseudo-labeler Anomaly Detection with Ensembling (SPADE) that isn't limited by the assumption that labeled and unlabeled data come from the same distribution. Indeed, the assumption is often violated in many applications -- for example, the labeled data may contain only anomalies unlike unlabeled data, or unlabeled data may contain different types of anomalies, or labeled data may contain only `easy-to-label' samples. SPADE utilizes an ensemble of one class classifiers as the pseudo-labeler to improve the robustness of pseudo-labeling with distribution mismatch. Partial matching is proposed to automatically select the critical hyper-parameters for pseudo-labeling without validation data, which is crucial with limited labeled data. SPADE shows state-of-the-art semi-supervised anomaly detection performance across a wide range of scenarios with distribution mismatch in both tabular and image domains. In some common real-world settings such as model facing new types of unlabeled anomalies, SPADE outperforms the state-of-the-art alternatives by 5% AUC in average",

    "abstract": "The Boundary representation (B-rep) format is the de-facto shape representation in computer-aided design (CAD) to model solid and sheet objects. Recent approaches to generating CAD models have focused on learning sketch-and-extrude modeling sequences that are executed by a solid modeling kernel in postprocess to recover a B-rep. In this paper we present a new approach that enables learning from and synthesizing B-reps without the need for supervision through CAD modeling sequence data. Our method SolidGen, is an autoregressive neural network that models the B-rep directly by predicting the vertices, edges, and faces using Transformer-based and pointer neural networks. Key to achieving this is our Indexed Boundary Representation that references B-rep vertices, edges and faces in a well-defined hierarchy to capture the geometric and topological relations suitable for use with machine learning. SolidGen can be easily conditioned on contexts e.g., class labels, images, and voxels thanks to its probabilistic modeling of the B-rep distribution. We demonstrate qualitatively, quantitatively, and through perceptual evaluation by human subjects that SolidGen can produce high quality, realistic CAD models",

Current imputation methods seek to minimize the error between the unobserved ground truth and the imputed values.

To tackle this problem, we introduce the $k$NN$\\times$KDE algorithm: a data imputation method combining nearest neighbor estimation ($k$NN) and density estimation with Gaussian kernels (KDE). We compare our method with previous data imputation methods using artificial and real-world data with different data missing scenarios and various data missing rates, and show that our method can cope with complex original data structure, yields lower data imputation errors, and provides probabilistic estimates with higher likelihood than current methods.

    "title": "Aux-Drop: Handling Haphazard Inputs in Online Learning Using Auxiliary Dropouts",
    "volume": "reproducibility",
    "abstract": "Many real-world applications based on online learning produce streaming data that is haphazard in nature, i.e., contains missing features, features becoming obsolete in time, the appearance of new features at later points in time and a lack of clarity on the total number of input features. These challenges make it hard to build a learnable system for such applications, and almost no work exists in deep learning that addresses this issue. In this paper, we present Aux-Drop, an auxiliary dropout regularization strategy for online learning that handles the haphazard input features in an effective manner. Aux-Drop adapts the conventional dropout regularization scheme for the haphazard input feature space ensuring that the final output is minimally impacted by the chaotic appearance of such features. It helps to prevent the co-adaptation of especially the auxiliary and base features, as well as reduces the strong dependence of the output on any of the auxiliary inputs of the model. This helps in better learning for scenarios where certain features disappear in time or when new features are to be modeled. The efficacy of Aux-Drop has been demonstrated through extensive numerical experiments on SOTA benchmarking datasets that include Italy Power Demand, HIGGS, SUSY and multiple UCI datasets.

    "title": "A Stochastic Proximal Polyak Step Size",
    "volume": "reproducibility",
    "abstract": "Recently, the stochastic Polyak step size (SPS) has emerged as a competitive adaptive step size scheme for stochastic gradient descent. Here we develop ProxSPS, a proximal variant of SPS that can handle regularization terms. Developing a proximal variant of SPS is particularly important, since SPS requires a lower bound of the objective function to work well. When the objective function is the sum of a loss and a regularizer, available estimates of a lower bound of the sum can be loose. In contrast, ProxSPS only requires a lower bound for the loss which is often readily available. As a consequence, we show that ProxSPS is easier to tune and more stable in the presence of regularization. Furthermore for image classification tasks, ProxSPS performs as well as AdamW with little to no tuning, and results in a network with smaller weight parameters. We also provide an extensive convergence analysis for ProxSPS that includes the non-smooth, smooth, weakly convex and strongly convex setting",

    "abstract": "Explainability methods have been widely used to provide insight into the decisions made by statistical models, thus facilitating their adoption in various domains within the industry. Counterfactual explanation methods aim to improve our understanding of a model by perturbing samples in a way that would alter its response in an unexpected manner. This information is helpful for users and for machine learning practitioners to understand and improve their models. Given the value provided by counterfactual explanations, there is a growing interest in the research community to investigate and propose new methods. However, we identify two issues that could hinder the progress in this field. (1) Existing metrics do not accurately reflect the value of an explainability method for the users. (2) Comparisons between methods are usually performed with datasets like CelebA, where images are annotated with attributes that do not fully describe them and with subjective attributes such as ``Attractive''. In this work, we address these problems by proposing an evaluation method with a principled metric to evaluate and compare different counterfactual explanation methods. The evaluation is based on a synthetic dataset where images are fully described by their annotated attributes. As a result, we are able to perform a fair comparison of multiple explainability methods in the recent literature, obtaining insights about their performance.

    "abstract": "The financial markets, which involve more than $90 trillion market capitals, attract the attention of innumerable investors around the world. Recently, reinforcement learning in financial markets (FinRL) has emerged as a promising direction to train agents for making profitable investment decisions. However, the evaluation of most FinRL methods only focuses on profit-related measures and ignores many critical axes, which are far from satisfactory for financial practitioners to deploy these methods into real-world financial markets. Therefore, we introduce PRUDEX-Compass, which has 6 axes, i.e., Profitability, Risk-control, Universality, Diversity, rEliability, and eXplainability, with a total of 17 measures for a systematic evaluation. Specifically, i) we propose AlphaMix+ as a strong FinRL baseline, which leverages mixture-of-experts (MoE) and risk-sensitive approaches to make diversified risk-aware investment decisions, ii) we evaluate 8 FinRL methods in 4 long-term real-world datasets of influential financial markets to demonstrate the usage of our PRUDEX-Compass, iii) PRUDEX-Compass together with 4 real-world datasets, standard implementation of 8 FinRL methods and a portfolio management environment is released as public resources to facilitate the design and comparison of new FinRL methods. We hope that PRUDEX-Compass can not only shed light on future FinRL research to prevent untrustworthy results from stagnating FinRL into successful industry deployment but also provide a new challenging algorithm evaluation scenario for the reinforcement learning (RL) community",

    "volume": "survey",
    "abstract": "Temporal Point Processes (TPPs) serve as the standard mathematical framework for modeling asynchronous event sequences in continuous time. However, classical TPP models are often constrained by strong assumptions, limiting their ability to capture complex real-world event dynamics. To overcome this limitation, researchers have proposed Neural TPPs, which leverage neural network parametrizations to offer more flexible and efficient modeling. While recent studies demonstrate the effectiveness of Neural TPPs, they often lack a unified setup, relying on different baselines, datasets, and experimental configurations. This makes it challenging to identify the key factors driving improvements in predictive accuracy, hindering research progress. To bridge this gap, we present a comprehensive large-scale experimental study that systematically evaluates the predictive accuracy of state-of-the-art neural TPP models. Our study encompasses multiple real-world and synthetic event sequence datasets, following a carefully designed unified setup. We thoroughly investigate the influence of major architectural components such as event encoding, history encoder, and decoder parametrization on both time and mark prediction tasks. Additionally, we delve into the less explored area of probabilistic calibration for neural TPP models. By analyzing our results, we draw insightful conclusions regarding the significance of history size and the impact of architectural components on predictive accuracy. Furthermore, we shed light on the miscalibration of mark distributions in neural TPP models. Our study aims to provide valuable insights into the performance and characteristics of neural TPP models, contributing to a better understanding of their strengths and limitations",

    "abstract": "This survey reviews works in which language models (LMs) are augmented with reasoning skills and the ability to use tools. The former is defined as decomposing a potentially complex task into simpler subtasks while the latter consists in calling external modules such as a code interpreter. LMs can leverage these augmentations separately or in combination via heuristics, or learn to do so from demonstrations. While adhering to a standard missing tokens prediction objective, such augmented LMs can use various, possibly non-parametric external modules to expand their context processing ability, thus departing from the pure language modeling paradigm. We therefore refer to them as Augmented Language Models (ALMs). The missing token objective allows ALMs to learn to reason, use tools, and even act, while still performing standard natural language tasks and even outperforming most regular LMs on several benchmarks. In this work, after reviewing current advance in ALMs, we conclude that this new research direction has the potential to address common limitations of traditional LMs such as interpretability, consistency, and scalability issues",

Lifelong or continual learning addresses this setting, whereby an agent faces a continual stream of problems and must strive to capture the knowledge necessary for solving each new task it encounters. If the agent is capable of accumulating knowledge in some form of compositional representation, it could then selectively reuse and combine relevant pieces of knowledge to construct novel solutions. Despite the intuitive appeal of this simple idea, the literatures on lifelong learning and compositional learning have proceeded largely separately.

Meanwhile, the use of self-supervised learning (SSL) for the purpose of natural language processing (NLP) has seen tremendous successes during the past couple of years, with this new learning paradigm yielding powerful language models. Inspired by the excellent results obtained in the field of NLP, self-supervised methods that rely on clustering, contrastive learning, distillation, and information-maximization, which all fall under the banner of discriminative SSL, have experienced a swift uptake in the area of computer vision. Shortly afterwards, generative SSL frameworks that are mostly based on masked image modeling, complemented and surpassed the results obtained with discriminative SSL. Consequently, within a span of three years, over $100$ unique general-purpose frameworks for generative and discriminative SSL, with a focus on imaging, were proposed. In this survey, we review a plethora of research efforts conducted on image-oriented SSL, providing a historic view and paying attention to best practices as well as useful software packages. While doing so, we discuss pretext tasks for image-based SSL, as well as techniques that are commonly used in image-based SSL.
