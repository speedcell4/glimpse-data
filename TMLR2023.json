    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "A rational design of new therapeutic drugs aims to find a molecular structure with desired biological functionality, e.g., an ability to activate or suppress a specific protein via binding to it. Molecular docking is a common technique for evaluating protein-molecule interactions. Recently, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach to generating molecules with the docking score (DS) as a reward. In this work, we reproduce, scrutinize and improve the recent RL model for molecule generation called FREED (Yang et al., 2021). Extensive evaluation of the proposed method reveals several limitations and challenges despite the outstanding results reported for three target proteins. Our contributions include fixing numerous implementation bugs and simplifying the model while increasing its quality, significantly extending experiments, and conducting an accurate comparison with current state-of-the-art methods for protein-conditioned molecule generation. We show that the resulting fixed model is capable of producing molecules with superior docking scores compared to alternative approaches",

Hereby, we introduce the topic of projective equivariance to the machine learning audience. We theoretically study the relation of projectively and linearly equivariant linear layers. We find that in some important cases, surprisingly, the two types of layers coincide. We also propose a way to construct a projectively equivariant neural network, which boils down to building a standard equivariant network where the linear group representations acting on each intermediate feature space are lifts of projective group representations. Projective equivariance is showcased in two simple experiments. Code for the experiments is provided in the supplementary material",

    "title": "Improving Native CNN Robustness with Filter Frequency Regularization",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Neural networks tend to overfit the training distribution and perform poorly on out-of-distribution data. A conceptually simple solution lies in adversarial training, which introduces worst-case perturbations into the training data and thus improves model generalization to some extent. However, it is only one ingredient towards generally more robust models and requires knowledge about the potential attacks or inference time data corruptions during model training. This paper focuses on the native robustness of models that can learn robust behavior directly from conventional training data without out-of-distribution examples. To this end, we study the frequencies in learned convolution filters. Clean-trained models often prioritize high-frequency information, whereas adversarial training enforces models to shift the focus to low-frequency details during training. By mimicking this behavior through frequency regularization in learned convolution weights, we achieve improved native robustness to adversarial attacks, common corruptions, and other out-of-distribution tests. Additionally, this method leads to more favorable shifts in decision-making towards low-frequency information, such as shapes, which inherently aligns more closely with human vision",

These operators, however, have a few critical limitations. In this work, we investigate a simple soft-greedy operator, which we call resmax, that takes actions proportionally to their max action gap: the residual to the estimated maximal value. It is simple to use and ensures coverage of the state-space like $\\varepsilon$-greedy, but focuses exploration more on potentially promising actions like softmax. Further, it does not concentrate probability as quickly as softmax, and so better avoids overemphasizing sub-optimal actions that appear high-valued during learning. Additionally, we prove it is a non-expansion for any fixed exploration hyperparameter, unlike the softmax policy which requires a state-action specific temperature to obtain a non-expansion (called mellowmax). We empirically validate that resmax is comparable to or outperforms $\\varepsilon$-greedy and softmax across a variety of environments in tabular and deep RL",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We consider the problem of learning differentially private linear and logistic regression models that do not exhibit disparate performance for minority groups in the data. Small-sized datasets pose a challenging regime for differential privacy; that is, satisfying differential privacy while learning models from data can lead to models with worse accuracy for minority---in size---subgroups. To address this challenge, inspired by Abowd & Schmutte (2018), we propose: (i) to systematically tailor the privacy budget to the different groups, (ii) use linear optimization oracles in a grid to optimize Lagrangian objectives that correspond to fair learning and optimization. We present efficient differentially private algorithms for linear and logistic regression subject to fairness constraints (e.g., bounded group loss) that allocate the privacy budget based on the private standard error of each subgroup in the data. Consequently, the formulation reduces the amount of noise added to these groups, which leads to more accurate models for such groups. We validate the proposed, group-aware budget allocation, method on synthetic and real-world datasets where we show significant reductions in prediction error for the smallest groups, while still preserving sufficient privacy to protect the minority group from re-identification attacks. In addition, we provide sample complexity lower bounds for our problem formulation",

    "title": "Smoothed Differential Privacy",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Differential privacy (DP) is a widely-accepted and widely-applied notion of privacy based on worst-case analysis. Often, DP classifies most mechanisms without additive noise as non-private (Dwork et al., 2014). Thus, additive noises are added to improve privacy (to achieve DP). However, in many real-world applications, adding additive noise is undesirable (Bagdasaryan et al., 2019) and sometimes prohibited (Liu et al., 2020). In this paper, we propose a natural extension of DP following the worst average-case idea behind the celebrated smoothed analysis (Spielman & Teng, May 2004). Our notion, smoothed DP, can effectively measure the privacy leakage of mechanisms without additive noises under realistic settings. We prove that any discrete mechanism with sampling procedures is more private than what DP predicts, while many continuous mechanisms with sampling procedures are still non-private under smoothed DP. In addition, we prove several desirable properties of smoothed DP, including composition, robustness to post-processing, and distribution reduction. Based on those properties, we propose an efficient algorithm to calculate the privacy parameters for smoothed DP. Experimentally, we verify that, according to smoothed DP, the discrete sampling mechanisms are private in real-world elections, and some discrete neural networks can be private without adding any additive noise. We believe that these results contribute to the theoretical foundation of realistic privacy measures beyond worst-case analysis",

Motivated by this challenge, we introduce SPIDER, an algorithmic framework that aims to Search PersonalIzed neural architecture for feDERated learning. SPIDER is designed based on two unique features: (1) alternately optimizing one architecture-homogeneous global model in a generic FL manner and architecture-heterogeneous local models that are connected to the global model by weight-sharing-based regularization, (2) achieving architecture-heterogeneous local models by a perturbation-based neural architecture search method.

    "title": "DreamEdit: Subject-driven Image Editing",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Subject-driven image generation aims at generating images containing customized subjects, which has recently drawn enormous attention from the research community. Nevertheless, the previous works cannot precisely control the background and position of the target subject. In this work, we aspire to fill the void of the existing subject-driven generation tasks. To this end, we propose two novel subject-driven editing sub-tasks, i.e., Subject Replacement and Subject Addition. The new tasks are challenging in multiple aspects: replacing a subject with a customized one can totally change its shape, texture, and color, while adding a target subject to a designated position in a provided scene necessitates a rational context-aware posture of the subject. To conquer these two novel tasks, we first manually curate a new dataset called DreamEditBench containing 22 different types of subjects, and 440 source images, which cover diverse scenarios with different difficulty levels. We plan to host DreamEditBench as a platform and hire trained evaluators for standardized human evaluation. We also devise an innovative method DreamEditor to resolve these tasks by performing iterative generation, which enables a smooth adaptation to the customized subject. In this project, we conduct automatic and human evaluations to understand the performance of our DreamEditor and baselines on DreamEditBench. We found that the new tasks are challenging for the existing models. For Subject Replacement, we found that the existing models are particularly sensitive to the shape and color of the original subject. When the original subject and the customized subject are highly different, the model failure rate will dramatically increase. For Subject Addition, we found that the existing models cannot easily blend the customized subjects into the background smoothly, which causes noticeable artifacts in the generated image. We hope that DreamEditBench can become a standardized platform to enable future investigations towards building more controllable subject-driven image editing.

    "title": "UnIVAL: Unified Model for Image, Video, Audio and Language Tasks",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have made the ambitious quest for generalist agents significantly far from being a fantasy. A key hurdle for building such general models is the diversity and heterogeneity of tasks and modalities. A promising solution is unification, allowing the support of a myriad of tasks and modalities within one unified framework. While few large models (e.g., Flamingo (Alayrac et al. 2022)), trained on massive datasets, can support more than two modalities, current small to mid-scale unified models are still limited to 2 modalities, usually image-text or video-text. The question that we ask is: is it possible to build efficiently a unified model that can support all modalities? To answer this, we propose UnIVAL, a step further towards this ambitious goal. Without relying on fancy datasets sizes or models with billions of parameters, the ~ 0.25B parameter UnIVAL model goes beyond two modalities and unifies text, images, video, and audio into a single model. Our model is efficiently pretrained on many tasks, based on task balancing and multimodal curriculum learning. UnIVAL shows competitive performance to existing state-of-the-art approaches, across image and video-text tasks. The feature representations learned from image and video-text modalities, allows the model to achieve competitive performance when finetuned on audio-text tasks, despite not being pretrained on audio. Thanks to the unified model, we propose a novel study on multimodal model merging via weight interpolation of models trained on different multimodal tasks, showing their benefits in particular for out-of-distribution generalization. Finally, we motivate unification by showing the synergy between tasks. The model weights and code are available at: https://github.com/mshukor/UnIVAL",

    "title": "IndicTrans2: Towards High-Quality and Accessible Machine Translation Models for all 22 Scheduled Indian Languages",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "India has a rich linguistic landscape, with languages from 4 major language families spoken by over a billion people. 22 of these languages listed in the Constitution of India (referred to as scheduled languages) are the focus of this work. Given the linguistic diversity, high-quality and accessible Machine Translation (MT) systems are essential in a country like India. Before this work, there was (i) no parallel training data spanning all 22 languages, (ii) no robust benchmarks covering all these languages and containing content relevant to India, and (iii) no existing translation models that support all 22 scheduled languages of India. In this work, we aim to address this gap by focusing on the missing pieces required for enabling wide, easy, and open access to good machine translation systems for all 22 scheduled Indian languages. We identify four key areas of improvement: curating and creating larger training datasets, creating diverse and high-quality benchmarks, training multilingual models, and releasing models with open access. Our first contribution is the release of the Bharat Parallel Corpus Collection (BPCC), the largest publicly available parallel corpora for Indic languages. BPCC contains a total of 230M bitext pairs, of which a total of 126M were newly added, including 644K manually translated sentence pairs created as part of this work. Our second contribution is the release of the first $n$-way parallel benchmark covering all 22 Indian languages, featuring diverse domains, Indian-origin content, and conversational test sets. Next, we present IndicTrans2, the first translation model to support all 22 languages, surpassing existing models in performance on multiple existing and new benchmarks created as a part of this work.

However, the optimization gap between BNNs and their full-precision counterparts has long been an open problem limiting their performance. In this work, we propose a novel optimization pipeline to enhance the performance of BNNs. The main approach includes three key components: (1) BNext, a strong binary baseline based on an optimization-friendly basic block design, (2) knowledge complexity, a simple yet effective teacher-selection metric taking the capacity gap between teachers and binary students under consideration, (3) consecutive knowledge distillation (CKD), a novel multi-round optimization technique to transfer high-confidence knowledge from strong teachers to low-capacity BNNs. We empirically validate the superiority of the method on several vision classification tasks CIFAR-10/100 & ImageNet. For instance, the BNext family outperforms previous BNNs under different capacity levels and contributes the first binary neural network to reach the state-of-the-art 80.57\\% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with 0.82 GOPS, which verifies the potential of BNNs and already contributes a strong baseline for future research on high-accuracy BNNs.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning has shown lots of success in closed, well-defined domains such as games (Chess, Go, StarCraft). The next frontier is real-world scenarios, where setups are numerous and varied. For this, agents need to learn the underlying environment dynamics, so as to robustly generalise to conditions that differ from those they were trained on. Model-based reinforcement learning algorithms, such as MuZero or Dreamer, aim to accomplish this by learning a world model. However, leveraging a world model has not yet consistently shown greater generalisation capabilities compared to model-free alternatives. In this work, we propose improving the data efficiency and generalisation capabilities of MuZero by explicitly incorporating the \\emph{symmetries} of the environment in its world-model architecture. We prove that, so long as the neural networks used by MuZero are equivariant to a particular symmetry group acting on the environment, the entirety of MuZero's action-selection algorithm will also be equivariant to that group. As such, Equivariant MuZero is guaranteed to behave symmetrically in symmetrically-transformed states, and will hence be more data-efficient when learning its world models. We evaluate Equivariant MuZero on procedurally-generated MiniPacman and on Chaser from the ProcGen suite: training on a set of mazes, and then testing on unseen rotated versions, demonstrating the benefits of equivariance. We verify that our improvements hold even when only some of the components of Equivariant MuZero obey strict equivariance, which highlights the robustness of our construction",

These DP models are typically pretrained on large public datasets and then fine-tuned on private downstream datasets that are relatively large and similar in distribution to the pretraining data. However, in many applications including personalization and federated learning, it is crucial to perform well (i) in the few-shot setting, as obtaining large amounts of labeled data may be problematic; and (ii) on datasets from a wide variety of domains for use in various specialist settings. To understand under which conditions few-shot DP can be effective, we perform an exhaustive set of experiments that reveals how the accuracy and vulnerability to attack of few-shot DP image classification models are affected as the number of shots per class, privacy level, model architecture, downstream dataset, and subset of learnable parameters in the model vary. We show that to achieve DP accuracy on par with non-private models, the shots per class must be increased as the privacy level increases. We also show that learning parameter-efficient FiLM adapters under DP is competitive with learning just the final classifier layer or learning all of the network parameters. Finally, we evaluate DP federated learning systems and establish state-of-the-art performance on the challenging FLAIR benchmark",

Then, multiple instances of the pre-trained DVAE model are integrated into a multi-source mixture model with a discrete observation-to-source assignment latent variable. The posterior distributions of both the discrete observation-to-source assignment variable and the continuous DVAE variables representing the sources content/position are estimated using the variational expectation-maximization algorithm, leading to multi-source trajectories estimation. We illustrate the versatility of the proposed MixDVAE model on two tasks: a computer vision task, namely multi-object tracking, and an audio processing task, namely single-channel audio source separation. Experimental results show that the proposed method works well on these two tasks, and outperforms several baseline methods",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Actor-critic algorithms such as DDPG, TD3, and SAC, which are built on Silver's deterministic policy gradient theorem, are among the most successful reinforcement-learning methods, but their mathematical basis is not entirely clear. In particular, the critic networks in these algorithms learn to estimate action-value functions by a \"bootstrapping\" technique based on Bellman error, and it is unclear why this approach works so well in practice, given that Bellman error is only very loosely related to value error, i.e. to the inaccuracy of the action-value estimate. Here we show that policy training in this class of actor-critic methods depends not on the accuracy of the critic's action-value estimate but on how well the critic estimates the gradient of the action-value, which is better assessed using what we call difference error. We show that this difference error is closely related to the Bellman error — a finding which helps to explain why Bellman-based bootstrapping leads to good policies. Further, we show that value error and difference error show different dynamics along on-policy trajectories through state-action space: value error is a low-pass anticausal (i.e., backward-in-time) filter of Bellman error, and therefore accumulates along trajectories, whereas difference error is a high-pass filter of Bellman error. It follows that techniques which reduce the high-frequency Fourier components of the Bellman error may improve policy training even if they increase the actual size of the Bellman errors. These findings help to explain certain aspects of actor-critic methods that are otherwise theoretically puzzling, such as the use of policy (as distinct from exploratory) noise, and they suggest other measures that may improve these methods",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Minimax optimization has seen a surge in interest with the advent of modern applications such as GANs, and it is inherently more challenging than simple minimization. The difficulty is exacerbated by the training data residing at multiple edge devices or \\textit{clients}, especially when these clients can have heterogeneous datasets and heterogeneous local computation capabilities. We propose a general federated minimax optimization framework that subsumes such settings and several existing methods like Local SGDA. We show that naive aggregation of model updates made by clients running unequal number of local steps can result in optimizing a mismatched objective function -- a phenomenon previously observed in standard federated minimization. To fix this problem, we propose normalizing the client updates by the number of local steps. We analyze the convergence of the proposed algorithm for classes of nonconvex-concave and nonconvex-nonconcave functions and characterize the impact of heterogeneous client data, partial client participation, and heterogeneous local computations. For all the function classes considered, we significantly improve the existing computation and communication complexity results. Experimental results support our theoretical claims",

    "abstract": "Automated video summarization is a vision task that aims to generate concise summaries of lengthy videos. Recent advancements in deep learning have led to highly performant video summarization models; however, there has been a lack of attention given to fairness and unbiased representation in the generated summaries. To bridge this gap, we introduce and analytically define the fair video summarization problem, and demonstrate its connections to the well-established problem of fair clustering. To facilitate fair model development, we also introduce the FairVidSum dataset, which is similar in design to state-of-the-art video summarization datasets such as TVSum and SumMe, but also includes annotations for sensitive attributes and individuals alongside frame importance scores. Finally, we propose the SumBal metric for quantifying the fairness of an outputted video summary. We conduct extensive experiments to benchmark the fairness of various state-of-the-art video summarization models. Our results highlight the need for better models that balance accuracy and fairness to ensure equitable representation and inclusion in summaries. For completeness, we also provide a novel fair-only baseline, FVS-LP, to showcase the fairness-utility gap models can improve upon",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Existing deep-learning based tomographic image reconstruction methods do not provide accurate uncertainty estimates of their reconstructions, hindering their real-world deployment. This paper develops a method, termed as linearised deep image prior (DIP), to estimate the uncertainty associated with reconstructions produced by the DIP with total variation (TV) regularisation. We endow the DIP with conjugate Gaussian-linear model type error-bars computed from a local linearisation of the neural network around its optimised parameters. To preserve conjugacy, we approximate the TV regulariser with a Gaussian surrogate. This approach provides pixel-wise uncertainty estimates and a marginal likelihood objective for hyperparameter optimisation. We demonstrate the method on synthetic data and real-measured high-resolution 2D $\\mu$CT data, and show that it provides superior calibration of uncertainty estimates relative to previous probabilistic formulations of the~DIP.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Deep image prior (DIP) and its variants have shown remarkable potential to solve inverse problems in computational imaging (CI), needing no separate training data. Practical DIP models are often substantially overparameterized. During the learning process, these models first learn the desired visual content and then pick up potential modeling and observational noise, i.e., performing early learning then overfitting. Thus, the practicality of DIP hinges on early stopping (ES) that can capture the transition period. In this regard, most previous DIP works for CI tasks only demonstrate the potential of the models, reporting the peak performance against the ground truth but providing no clue about how to operationally obtain near-peak performance without access to the ground truth. In this paper, we set to break this practicality barrier of DIP, and propose an effective ES strategy that consistently detects near-peak performance across several CI tasks and DIP variants. Simply based on the running variance of DIP intermediate reconstructions, our ES method not only outpaces the existing ones---which only work in very narrow regimes, but also remains effective when combined with methods that try to mitigate overfitting",

However, diffusion models are themselves trained on large datasets, often with noisy annotations, and it remains an open question to which extent these models contribute to downstream classification performance. In particular, it remains unclear if they generalize enough to improve over directly using the additional data of their pre-training process for augmentation. We systematically evaluate a range of existing methods to generate images from diffusion models and study new extensions to assess their benefit for data augmentation. Personalizing diffusion models towards the target data outperforms simpler prompting strategies. However, using the pre-training data of the diffusion model alone, via a simple nearest-neighbor retrieval procedure, leads to even stronger downstream performance. Our study explores the potential of diffusion models in generating new training data, and surprisingly finds that these sophisticated models are not yet able to beat a simple and strong image retrieval baseline on simple downstream vision tasks",

We integrate Bayesian filtering and optimal control into learning the diffusion process, enabling the generation of constrained stochastic processes governed by sparse observations at intermediate stages and terminal constraints.

Accounting for them can greatly improve predictive power when physical resources or computation time is limited. In this paper, we draw on recent theoretical results on the estimation of local function complexity (LFC), derived from the domain of local polynomial smoothing (LPS), to establish a notion of local structural complexity, which is used to develop a model-agnostic active learning (AL) framework. Due to its reliance on pointwise estimates, the LPS model class is not robust and scalable concerning large input space dimensions that typically come along with real-world problems. Here, we derive and estimate the Gaussian process regression (GPR)-based analog of the LPS-based LFC and use it as a substitute in the above framework to make it robust and scalable. We assess the effectiveness of our LFC estimate in an AL application on a prototypical low-dimensional synthetic dataset, before taking on the challenging real-world task of reconstructing a quantum chemical force field for a small organic molecule and demonstrating state-of-the-art performance with a significantly reduced training demand",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Transferring trained policies and value functions from one task to another, such as one game to another with a different board size, board shape, or more substantial rule changes, is a challenging problem. Popular benchmarks for reinforcement learning (RL), such as Atari games and ProcGen, have limited variety especially in terms of action spaces. Due to a focus on such benchmarks, the development of transfer methods that can also handle changes in action spaces has received relatively little attention. Furthermore, we argue that progress towards more general methods should include benchmarks where new problem instances can be described by domain experts, rather than machine learning experts, using convenient, high-level domain specific languages (DSLs). In addition to enabling end users to more easily describe their problems, user-friendly DSLs also contain relevant task information which can be leveraged to make effective zero-shot transfer plausibly achievable. As an example, we use the Ludii general game system, which includes a highly varied set of over 1000 distinct games described in such a language. We propose a simple baseline approach for transferring fully convolutional policy-value networks, which are used to guide search agents similar to AlphaZero, between any pair of games modelled in this system. Extensive results---including various cases of highly successful zero-shot transfer---are provided for a wide variety of source and target games",

    "abstract": "Capsule Networks have emerged as a powerful class of deep learning architectures, known for robust performance with relatively few parameters compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). However, their inherent efficiency is often overshadowed by their slow, iterative routing mechanisms which establish connections between Capsule layers, posing computational challenges resulting in an inability to scale. In this paper, we introduce a novel, non-iterative routing mechanism, inspired by trainable prototype clustering. This innovative approach aims to mitigate computational complexity, while retaining, if not enhancing, performance efficacy. Furthermore, we harness a shared Capsule subspace, negating the need to project each lower-level Capsule to each higher-level Capsule, thereby significantly reducing memory requisites during training. Our approach demonstrates superior results compared to the current best non-iterative Capsule Network and tests on the Imagewoof dataset, which is too computationally demanding to handle efficiently by iterative approaches.

    "abstract": "Gridworlds have been long-utilised in AI research, particularly in reinforcement learning, as they provide simple yet scalable models for many real-world applications such as robot navigation, emergent behaviour, and operations research. We initiate a study of gridworlds using the mathematical framework of reconfigurable systems and state complexes due to Abrams, Ghrist & Peterson. State complexes, a higher-dimensional analogue of state graphs, represent all possible configurations of a system as a single geometric space, thus making them conducive to study using geometric, topological, or combinatorial methods. The main contribution of this work is a modification to the original Abrams, Ghrist & Peterson setup which we introduce to capture agent braiding and thereby more naturally represent the topology of gridworlds. With this modification, the state complexes may exhibit geometric defects (failure of Gromov's Link Condition). Serendipitously, we discover these failures for agent-only cases occur exactly where undesirable or dangerous states appear in the gridworld. Our results therefore provide a novel method for seeking guaranteed safety limitations in discrete task environments with single or multiple agents, and offer useful safety information (in geometric and topological forms) for incorporation in or analysis of machine learning systems. More broadly, our work introduces tools from geometric group theory and combinatorics to the AI community and demonstrates a proof-of-concept for this geometric viewpoint of the task domain through the example of simple environments",

    "title": "Partial Optimal Transport for Support Subset Selection",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In probabilistic terms, optimal transport aims to find a joint distribution that couples two distributions and minimizes the cost of transforming one distribution to another. Any feasible coupling necessarily maintains the support of both distributions. However, maintaining the entire support is not ideal when only a subset of one of the distributions, namely the source, is assumed to align with the other target distribution. For these cases, which are common in machine learning applications, we study the semi-relaxed partial optimal transport problem that relaxes the constraints on the joint distribution allowing it to under-represent a subset of the source by over-representing other subsets of the source by a constant factor. In the discrete distribution case, such as in the case of two samples from continuous random variables, optimal transport with the relaxed constraints is a linear program. When sufficiently relaxed, the solution has a source marginal with only a subset of its original support. We investigate the scaling path of solutions, specifically the relaxed marginal distribution for the source, across different relaxations and show that it is distinct from the solutions from penalty-based semi-relaxed unbalanced optimal transport problems and fully-relaxed partial optimal transport, which have previously been explored. We demonstrate the usefulness of this support subset selection in applications such as color transfer, partial point cloud alignment, and semi-supervised machine learning, where a part of data is curated to have reliable labels and another part is unlabeled or has unreliable labels. Our experiments show that optimal transport under the relaxed constraint can improve the performance of these applications by allowing for more flexible alignment between distributions",

DG leverages multiple source domains for model training, while single domain generalization (SDG) further restricts such setting by exploiting only a single source domain. Nevertheless, both DG and SDG assume that the source domains are fully labeled, which might not be practical in many real world scenarios. In this paper, we present a new problem, i.e., semi-supervised single domain generalization (SS-SDG), which aims to train a model with a partially labeled single source domain to generalize to multiple unseen testing domains. We propose an effective framework to address this problem. In particular, we design a label-free adversarial data augmentation strategy to diversify the source domain, and propose a novel multi-pair FixMatch loss to generalize classifiers to unseen testing domains. Extensive experiments on OfficeHome, PACS and DomainNet20 datasets show that our method surpasses the latest SDG and semi-supervised methods.

Existing approaches have encountered challenges such as style bias towards training domains, insufficient feature-space disentanglement to highlight semantic features, and discriminativeness of the latent space. Additionally, they rely on a confidence-based target outlier detection approach, which can lead to misclassifications when target open samples visually align with the source domain data. In response to these challenges, we present a solution named \\textsc{ODG-Net}. We aim to create a direct open-set classifier within a \\textit{discriminative}, \\textit{unbiased}, and \\textit{disentangled} semantic embedding space. To enrich data density and diversity, we introduce a generative augmentation framework that produces \\textit{style-interpolated} novel domains for closed-set images and novel pseudo-open images by \\textit{interpolating the contents of paired training images}. Our augmentation strategy skillfully utilizes \\textit{disentangled style and content information} to synthesize images effectively. Furthermore, we tackle the issue of style bias by representing all images in relation to all source domain properties, which effectively accentuates complementary visual features. Consequently, we train a multi-class semantic object classifier, incorporating both closed and open class classification capabilities, along with a style classifier to identify style primitives. The joint use of style and semantic classifiers facilitates the disentanglement of the latent space, thereby enhancing the generalization performance of the semantic classifier. To ensure discriminativeness in both closed and open spaces, we optimize the semantic feature space using novel metric losses. The experimental results on six benchmark datasets convincingly demonstrate that \\textsc{ODG-Net} surpasses the state-of-the-art by an impressive margin of $1-4\\%$ in both open and closed-set DG scenarios",

    "abstract": "Electronic Health Records (EHRs) provide a rich source of medical information across different modalities such as electrocardiograms (ECG), structured EHRs (sEHR), and unstructured EHRs (text). Inspired by the fact that many cardiac and non-cardiac diseases influence the behavior of the ECG, we leverage structured EHRs and unstructured EHRs from multiple sources by pairing with ECGs and propose a set of three new multi-modal contrastive learning models that combine ECG, sEHR, and text modalities. The performance of these models is compared against different baseline models such as supervised learning models trained from scratch with random weights initialization, and self-supervised learning models trained only on ECGs. We pre-train the models on a large proprietary dataset of about 9 $million$ ECGs from around 2.4 $million$ patients and evaluate the pre-trained models on various downstream tasks such as classification, zero-shot retrieval, and out-of-distribution detection involving the prediction of various heart conditions using ECG waveforms as input, and demonstrate that the models presented in this work show significant improvements compared to all baseline modes",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Latent world models allow agents to reason about complex environments with high-dimensional observations. However, adapting to new environments and effectively leveraging previous knowledge remain significant challenges. We present Variational Causal Dynamics (VCD), a structured world model that exploits the invariance of causal mechanisms across environments to achieve fast and modular adaptation. By causally factorising a transition model, VCD is able to identify reusable components across different environments. This is achieved by combining causal discovery and variational inference to learn a latent representation and transition model jointly in an unsupervised manner. Specifically, we optimise the evidence lower bound jointly over a representation model and a transition model structured as a causal graphical model. In evaluations on simulated environments with state and image observations, we show that VCD is able to successfully identify causal variables, and to discover consistent causal structures across different environments. Moreover, given a small number of observations in a previously unseen, intervened environment, VCD is able to identify the sparse changes in the dynamics and to adapt efficiently. In doing so, VCD significantly extends the capabilities of the current state-of-the-art in latent world models while also comparing favourably in terms of prediction accuracy",

    "title": "RCT Rejection Sampling for Causal Estimation Evaluation",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Confounding is a significant obstacle to unbiased estimation of causal effects from observational data. For settings with high-dimensional covariates---such as text data, genomics, or the behavioral social sciences---researchers have proposed methods to adjust for confounding by adapting machine learning methods to the goal of causal estimation. However, empirical evaluation of these adjustment methods has been challenging and limited. In this work, we build on a promising empirical evaluation strategy that simplifies evaluation design and uses real data: subsampling randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to create confounded observational datasets while using the average causal effects from the RCTs as ground-truth. We contribute a new sampling algorithm, which we call RCT rejection sampling, and provide theoretical guarantees that causal identification holds in the observational data to allow for valid comparisons to the ground-truth RCT. Using synthetic data, we show our algorithm indeed results in low bias when oracle estimators are evaluated on the confounded samples, which is not always the case for a previously proposed algorithm. In addition to this identification result, we highlight several finite data considerations for evaluation designers who plan to use RCT rejection sampling on their own datasets. As a proof of concept, we implement an example evaluation pipeline and walk through these finite data considerations with a novel, real-world RCT---which we release publicly---consisting of approximately 70k observations and text data as high-dimensional covariates. Together, these contributions build towards a broader agenda of improved empirical evaluation for causal estimation",

    "abstract": "The emerging availability of various machine learning models creates a great demand to harness the collective intelligence of many independently well-trained models to improve overall performance. Considering the privacy concern and non-negligible communication costs, one-shot federated learning and ensemble learning in a data-free manner attract significant attention. However, conventional ensemble selection approaches are neither training efficient nor applicable to federated learning due to the risk of privacy leakage from local clients; meanwhile, the \"many could be better than all\" principle under data-free constraints makes it even more challenging. Therefore, it becomes crucial to design an effective ensemble selection strategy to find a good subset of the base models as the ensemble team for the federated learning scenario. In this paper, we propose a novel data-free diversity-based framework, DeDES, to address the ensemble selection problem with diversity consideration for models under the one-shot federated learning setting. Experimental results show that our method can achieve both better performance and higher efficiency over 5 datasets, 4 different model structures, and both homogeneous and heterogeneous model groups under four different data-partition strategies",

We refer to this setting as Universal Graph Continual Learning (UGCL), which includes node-unit node classification (NUNC), graph-unit node classification (GUNC), and graph-unit graph classification (GUGC). Our novel method maintains a replay memory of nodes and neighbours to remind the model of past graph structures through distillation. Emphasizing the importance of preserving distinctive graph structures across tasks, we enforce that coarse-to-grain graph representations stay close to previous ones by minimizing our proposed global and local structure losses.

To avoid clients having to share their data with anyone, XCLP employs two cryptographically secure protocols: secure Hamming distance computation and secure summation. We demonstrate two distinct applications of XCLP within federated learning. In the first, we use it in a one-shot way to predict labels for unseen test points. In the second, we use it to repeatedly pseudo-label unlabeled training data in a federated semi-supervised setting.

Moreover, the principal should be few-shot adaptable and minimize the number of interventions, because interventions are often costly. We introduce MERMAIDE, a model-based meta-learning framework to train a principal that can quickly adapt to out-of-distribution agents with different learning strategies and reward functions. We validate this approach step-by-step. First, in a Stackelberg setting with a best-response agent, we show that meta-learning enables quick convergence to the theoretically known Stackelberg equilibrium at test time, although noisy observations severely increase the sample complexity. We then show that our model-based meta-learning approach is cost-effective in intervening on bandit agents with unseen explore-exploit strategies.

In this method, the model weights are initially computed by using the current task dataset. Next, the dataset of the current task is merged with the stored samples from the earlier tasks and the model weights are updated using the combined dataset. This aids in preventing the model weights converging to the optimal parameters of the current task and enables the preservation of information from earlier tasks. We choose to adapt our technique to graph data structure and the task of node classification on graphs.

Sparse regression and greedy algorithms have emerged as popular approaches to tackle this challenge.

In this article, we present a novel algorithm that strikes a balance between comprehensiveness and efficiency in equation learning. Inspired by stepwise regression, our approach combines the coefficient of determination, $R^2$, and the Bayesian model evidence, $p(y|\\mathcal{M})$, in a novel way. Through three extensive numerical experiments involving random polynomials and dynamical systems, we compare our method against two standard approaches, four state-of-the-art methods, and bidirectional stepwise regression incorporating $p(y|\\mathcal{M})$. The results demonstrate that our less greedy algorithm surpasses all other methods in terms of identification accuracy. Furthermore, we discover a heuristic approach to mitigate the overfitting penalty associated with $R^2$ and propose an equation learning procedure solely based on $R^2$, which achieves high rates of exact equation recovery",

    "abstract": "Due to the high cost and time-consuming nature of collecting labeled data, having insufficient labeled data is a common challenge that can negatively impact the performance of deep learning models when applied to real-world applications. Active learning (AL) aims to reduce the cost and time required for obtaining labeled data by selecting valuable samples during model training. However, recent works have pointed out the performance unreliability of existing AL algorithms for deep learning (DL) architectures under different scenarios, which manifests as their performance being comparable (or worse) to that of basic random selection. This behavior compromises the applicability of these approaches. We address this problem by proposing a theoretically motivated AL framework for DL architectures. We demonstrate that the most valuable samples for the model are those that, unsurprisingly, improve its performance on the entire dataset, most of which is unlabeled, and present a framework to efficiently estimate such performance (or loss) via influence functions, pseudo labels and diversity selection. Experimental results show that the proposed reliable active learning via influence functions (RALIF) can consistently outperform the random selection baseline as well as other existing and state-of-the art active learning approaches",

    "abstract": "In contrast to training traditional machine learning~(ML) models in data centers, federated learning~(FL) trains ML models over local datasets contained on resource-constrained heterogeneous edge devices. Existing FL algorithms aim to learn a single global model for all participating devices, which may not be helpful to all devices participating in the training due to the heterogeneity of the data across the devices. Recently, Hanzely and Richt\\'{a}rik (2020) proposed a new formulation for training personalized FL models aimed at balancing the trade-off between the traditional global model and the local models that could be trained by individual devices using their private data only. They derived a new algorithm, called {\\em loopless gradient descent}~(L2GD), to solve it and showed that this algorithms leads to improved communication complexity guarantees in regimes when more personalization is required. In this paper, we equip their L2GD algorithm with a {\\em bidirectional} compression mechanism to further reduce the communication bottleneck between the local devices and the server. Unlike other compression-based algorithms used in the FL-setting, our compressed L2GD algorithm operates on a probabilistic communication protocol, where communication does not happen on a fixed schedule. Moreover, our compressed L2GD algorithm maintains a similar convergence rate as vanilla SGD without compression. To empirically validate the efficiency of our algorithm, we perform diverse numerical experiments on both convex and non-convex problems and using various compression techniques",

Concept-based explanations have emerged as a superior approach that is more interpretable than feature attribution estimates such as pixel saliency.

To address this, we propose a novel post-hoc unsupervised method that automatically uncovers the concepts learned by deep models during training. By decomposing the latent space of a layer in singular vectors and refining them by unsupervised clustering, we uncover concept vectors aligned with directions of high variance that are relevant to the model prediction, and that point to semantically distinct concepts. Our extensive experiments reveal that the majority of our concepts are readily understandable to humans, exhibit coherency, and bear relevance to the task at hand. Moreover, we showcase the practical utility of our method in dataset exploration, where our concept vectors successfully identify outlier training samples affected by various confounding factors.

Given a pre-trained network trained on source domain data, the proposed framework modifies the affine parameters of the batch normalization layers using source anchoring based self-distillation. This ensures that the model incorporates knowledge from the newly encountered domains, without catastrophically forgetting the previously seen domains. We also propose a source-prototype driven contrastive alignment to ensure natural grouping of the target samples, while maintaining the already learnt semantic information.

We then fit a hidden Markov model (HMM) over the resulting sequences of metrics. The HMM represents training as a stochastic process of transitions between latent states, providing an intuitive overview of significant changes during training.

    "abstract": "Machine learning models have shone in a variety of domains and attracted increasing attention from both the security and the privacy communities. One important yet worrying question is: Will training models under the differential privacy (DP) constraint have an unfavorable impact on their adversarial robustness? While previous works have postulated that privacy comes at the cost of worse robustness, we give the first theoretical analysis to show that DP models can indeed be robust and accurate, even sometimes more robust than their naturally-trained non-private counterparts. We observe three key factors that influence the privacy-robustness-accuracy tradeoff: (1) hyper-parameters for DP optimizers are critical; (2) pre-training on public data significantly mitigates the accuracy and robustness drop; (3) choice of DP optimizers makes a difference. With these factors set properly, we achieve 90\\% natural accuracy, 72\\% robust accuracy ($+9\\%$ than the non-private model) under $l_2(0.5)$ attack, and 69\\% robust accuracy ($+16\\%$ than the non-private model) with pre-trained SimCLRv2 model under $l_\\infty(4/255)$ attack on CIFAR10 with $\\epsilon=2$. In fact, we show both theoretically and empirically that DP models are Pareto optimal on the accuracy-robustness tradeoff. Empirically, the robustness of DP models is consistently observed across various datasets and models. We believe our encouraging results are a significant step towards training models that are private as well as robust",

    "abstract": "Neural Persistence is a prominent measure for quantifying neural network complexity, proposed in the emerging field of topological data analysis in deep learning. In this work, however, we find both theoretically and empirically that the variance of network weights and spatial concentration of large weights are the main factors that impact neural persistence. Whilst this captures useful information for linear classifiers, we find that no relevant spatial structure is present in later layers of deep neural networks, making neural persistence roughly equivalent to the variance of weights. Additionally, the proposed averaging procedure across layers for deep neural networks does not consider interaction between layers. Based on our analysis, we propose an extension of the filtration underlying neural persistence to the whole neural network instead of single layers, which is equivalent to calculating neural persistence on one particular matrix. This yields our deep graph persistence measure, which implicitly incorporates persistent paths through the network and alleviates variance-related issues through standardisation.

    "title": "Replay-enhanced Continual Reinforcement Learning",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Replaying past experiences has proven to be a highly effective approach for averting catastrophic forgetting in supervised continual learning. However, some crucial factors are still largely ignored, making it vulnerable to serious failure, when used as a solution to forgetting in continual reinforcement learning, even in the context of perfect memory where all data of previous tasks are accessible in the current task. On the one hand, since most reinforcement learning algorithms are not invariant to the reward scale, the previously well-learned tasks (with high rewards) may appear to be more salient to the current learning process than the current task (with small initial rewards). This causes the agent to concentrate on those salient tasks at the expense of generality on the current task. On the other hand, offline learning on replayed tasks while learning a new task may induce a distributional shift between the dataset and the learned policy on old tasks, resulting in forgetting. In this paper, we introduce RECALL, a replay-enhanced method that greatly improves the plasticity of existing replay-based methods on new tasks while effectively avoiding the recurrence of catastrophic forgetting in continual reinforcement learning. RECALL leverages adaptive normalization on approximate targets and policy distillation on old tasks to enhance generality and stability, respectively. Extensive experiments on the Continual World benchmark show that RECALL performs significantly better than purely perfect memory replay, and achieves comparable or better overall performance against state-of-the-art continual learning methods",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The A* algorithm is commonly used to solve NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems. When provided with a completely informed heuristic function, A* can solve such problems in time complexity that is polynomial in the solution cost and branching factor. In light of this fact, we examine a line of recent publications that propose fitting deep neural networks to the completely informed heuristic function. We assert that these works suffer from inherent scalability limitations since --- under the assumption of NP $\\not \\subseteq$ P/poly --- such approaches result in either (a) network sizes that scale super-polynomially in the instance sizes or (b) the accuracy of the fitted deep neural networks scales inversely with the instance sizes. Complementing our theoretical claims, we provide experimental results for three representative NP-hard search problems. The results suggest that fitting deep neural networks to informed heuristic functions requires network sizes that grow quickly with the problem instance size. We conclude by suggesting that the research community should focus on scalable methods for integrating heuristic search with machine learning, as opposed to methods relying on informed heuristic estimation",

    "abstract": "In this work, we address the problem of long-distance navigation for battery electric vehicles (BEVs), where one or more charging sessions are required to reach the intended destination. We consider the availability and performance of the charging stations to be unknown and stochastic, and develop a combinatorial semi-bandit framework for exploring the road network to learn the parameters of the queue time and charging power distributions. Within this framework, we first outline a method for transforming the road network graph into a graph of feasible paths between charging stations to handle the constrained combinatorial optimization problem in an efficient way. Then, for the feasibility graph, we use a Bayesian approach to model the stochastic edge weights, utilizing conjugate priors for the one-parameter exponential and two-parameter gamma distributions, the latter of which is novel to multi-armed bandit literature. Finally, we apply combinatorial versions of Thompson Sampling, BayesUCB and Epsilon-greedy to the problem. We demonstrate the performance of our framework on long-distance navigation problem instances in large-scale country-sized road networks, with simulation experiments in Norway, Sweden and Finland",

    "abstract": "Normalizing flows (NFs) as generative models enjoy desirable properties such as exact invertibility and exact likelihood evaluation, while being efficient to sample from. These properties, however, come at the cost of heavy restrictions on the architecture. Due to these limitations, modeling multi-modal probability distributions can yield poor results even with low-dimensional data. Additionally, typical flow architectures employed on real image datasets produce samples with visible aliasing artifacts and limited variation. The latent decomposition of flow-models also falls short on that of competing methods, with uneven contribution to a decoded image. In this work we build an invertible generative model using conditional normalizing flows in a hierarchical fashion to circumvent the aforementioned limitations. We show that we can achieve superior sample quality among flow-based models with fewer parameters compared to the state of the art. We demonstrate ability to control individual levels of detail via the latent decomposition of our model",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We address the problem of evaluating the quality of self-supervised learning (SSL) models without access to supervised labels, while being agnostic to the architecture, learning algorithm or data manipulation used during training. We argue that representations can be evaluated through the lens of expressiveness and learnability. We propose to use the Intrinsic Dimension (ID) to assess expressiveness and introduce Cluster Learnability (CL) to assess learnability. CL is measured in terms of the performance of a KNN classifier trained to predict labels obtained by clustering the representations with K-means. We thus combine CL and ID into a single predictor – CLID. Through a large-scale empirical study with a diverse family of SSL algorithms, we find that CLID better correlates with in-distribution model performance than other competing recent evaluation schemes. We also benchmark CLID on out-of-domain generalization, where CLID serves as a predictor of the transfer performance of SSL models on several visual classification tasks, yielding improvements with respect to the competing baselines",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "This paper addresses a gap in the current state of the art by providing a solution for modeling causal relationships that evolve over time and occur at different time scales. Specifically, we introduce the multiscale non-stationary directed acyclic graph (MN-DAG), a framework for modeling multivariate time series data. Our contribution is twofold. Firstly, we expose a probabilistic generative model by leveraging results from spectral and causality theories. Our model allows sampling an MN-DAG according to user-specified priors on the time-dependence and multiscale properties of the causal graph. Secondly, we devise a Bayesian method named Multiscale Non-stationary Causal Structure Learner (MN-CASTLE) that uses stochastic variational inference to estimate MN-DAGs. The method also exploits information from the local partial correlation between time series over different time resolutions. The data generated from an MN-DAG reproduces well-known features of time series in different domains, such as volatility clustering and serial correlation. Additionally, we show the superior performance of MN-CASTLE on synthetic data with different multiscale and non-stationary properties compared to baseline models. Finally, we apply MN-CASTLE to identify the drivers of the natural gas prices in the US market. Causal relationships have strengthened during the COVID-19 outbreak and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, a fact that baseline methods fail to capture. MN-CASTLE identifies the causal impact of critical economic drivers on natural gas prices, such as seasonal factors, economic uncertainty, oil prices, and gas storage deviations",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) has recently achieved tremendous empirical advancements in learning image representation. However, our understanding of the principle behind learning such a representation is still limited. This work shows that joint-embedding SSL approaches learn a representation of image patches, which reflects their co-occurrence. Such a connection to co-occurrence modeling can be established formally, and it supplements the prevailing invariance perspective. We empirically show that learning a representation for fixed-scale patches and aggregating local patch representations as the image representation achieves similar or even better results than the baseline methods. We denote this process as {\\it BagSSL}. Even with $32\\times 32$ patch representation, BagSSL achieves $62\\%$ top-1 linear probing accuracy on ImageNet. On the other hand, with a multi-scale pretrained model, we show that the whole image embedding is approximately the average of local patch embeddings. While the SSL representation is relatively invariant at the global scale, we show that locality is preserved when we zoom into local patch-level representation. Further, we show that patch representation aggregation can improve various SOTA baseline methods by a large margin. The patch representation is considerably easier to understand, and this work makes a step to demystify self-supervised representation learning",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "While active learning (AL) techniques have demonstrated the potential to produce high-performance models with fewer labeled data, their application remains limited due to the necessity for multiple rounds of interaction with annotators. This paper studies the problem of one-round AL, which aims at selecting a subset of unlabeled points and querying their labels \\emph{all at once}. A fundamental challenge is how to measure the utility of different choices of labeling queries for learning a target model. Our key idea is to learn such a utility metric from a small initial labeled set. We demonstrate that our approach leads to state-of-the-art performance on various AL benchmarks and is more robust to the lack of initial labeled data. In addition to algorithmic development and evaluation, we introduce a novel metric for quantifying `\\emph{utility transferability}' -- the degree of correlation between the performance changes of two learning algorithms due to variations in training data selection. Previous studies have often observed a notable utility transferability between models, even those with differing complexities. Such transferability enabled our approach, as well as other techniques such as coresets, hyperparameter tuning, and data valuation, to scale up to more sophisticated target models by substituting them with smaller proxy models. Nevertheless, utility transferability has not yet been rigorously defined within a formal mathematical framework, a gap that our work addresses innovatively. We further propose two Monte Carlo-based methods for efficiently comparing utility transferability for different proxy models, thereby facilitating a more informed selection of proxy models",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great promise with algorithms learning in environments with large state and action spaces purely from scalar reward signals. A crucial challenge for current deep RL algorithms is that they require a tremendous amount of environment interactions for learning. This can be infeasible in situations where such interactions are expensive, such as in robotics. Offline RL algorithms try to address this issue by bootstrapping the learning process from existing logged data without needing to interact with the environment from the very beginning. While online RL algorithms are typically evaluated as a function of the number of environment interactions, there isn't a single established protocol for evaluating offline RL methods. In this paper, we propose a sequential approach to evaluate offline RL algorithms as a function of the training set size and thus by their data efficiency. Sequential evaluation provides valuable insights into the data efficiency of the learning process and the robustness of algorithms to distribution changes in the dataset while also harmonizing the visualization of the offline and online learning phases. Our approach is generally applicable and easy to implement. We compare several existing offline RL algorithms using this approach and present insights from a variety of tasks and offline datasets",

    "abstract": "Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aims to make learning machines less opaque, and offers researchers and practitioners various tools to reveal the decision-making strategies of neural networks. In this work, we investigate how XAI methods can be used for exploring and visualizing the diversity of feature representations learned by Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs). Our goal is to provide a global understanding of BNNs by making their decision-making strategies a) visible and tangible through feature visualizations and b) quantitatively measurable with a distance measure learned by contrastive learning. Our work provides new insights into the posterior distribution in terms of human-understandable feature information with regard to the underlying decision-making strategies. The main findings of our work are the following: 1) global XAI methods can be applied to explain the diversity of decision-making strategies of BNN instances, 2) Monte Carlo dropout with commonly used Dropout rates exhibit increased diversity in feature representations compared to the multimodal posterior approximation of MultiSWAG, 3) the diversity of learned feature representations highly correlates with the uncertainty estimate for the output and 4) the inter-mode diversity of the multimodal posterior decreases as the network width increases, while the intra-mode diversity increases. These findings are consistent with the recent Deep Neural Networks theory, providing additional intuitions about what the theory implies in terms of humanly understandable concepts",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The gold standard for the identification of causal effects are randomized controlled trials (RCT), but RCTs may not always be feasible to conduct. When treatments depend on a threshold however, such as the blood sugar threshold for diabetes diagnosis, we can still sometimes estimate causal effects with regression discontinuities (RDs). RDs are valid when units just above and below the threshold have the same distribution of covariates and thus no confounding in the presence of noise, establishing an as-if randomization. In practice however, implementing RD studies can be difficult as identifying treatment thresholds require considerable domain expertise -- furthermore, the thresholds may differ across subgroups (e.g., the blood sugar threshold for diabetes may differ across demographics), and ignoring these differences can lower statistical power. Finding the thresholds and to whom they apply is an important problem currently solved manually by domain experts, and data-driven approaches are needed when domain expertise is not sufficient. Here, we introduce Regression Discontinuity SubGroup Discovery (RDSGD), a machine-learning method that identifies statistically powerful and interpretable subgroups for RD thresholds. Using a medical claims dataset with over 60 million patients, we apply RDSGD to multiple clinical contexts and identify subgroups with increased compliance to treatment assignment thresholds. As treatment thresholds matter for many diseases and policy decisions, RDSGD can be a powerful tool for discovering new avenues for causal estimation",

ISL splits the data into different environments, and learns a structure that is invariant to the target across different environments by imposing a consistency constraint. The proposed aggregation mechanism then selects the classifier based on a graph structure that reflects the causal mechanisms in the data more accurately compared to the structures learnt from individual environments. Furthermore, we extend ISL to a self-supervised learning setting, where accurate causal structure discovery does not rely on any labels. Self-supervised ISL utilizes proposals for invariant causality, by iteratively setting different nodes as targets. On synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that ISL accurately discovers the causal structure, outperforms alternative methods, and yields superior generalization for datasets with significant distribution shifts",

Despite the efforts devoted, existing algorithms with theoretic finite-sample guarantees typically assume exploratory data coverage or strong realizable function classes (e.g., Bellman-completeness), which is hard to be satisfied in reality. While there are recent works that successfully tackle these strong assumptions, they either require the gap assumptions that could only be satisfied by part of MDPs or use the behavior regularization that makes the optimality of learned policy even intractable. To solve this challenge, we provide finite-sample guarantees for a simple algorithm based on marginalized importance sampling (MIS), showing that sample-efficient offline RL for general MDPs is possible with only a partial coverage dataset (instead of assuming a dataset covering all possible policies) and weak realizable function classes (assuming function classes containing simply one function) given additional side information of a covering distribution. We demonstrate that the covering distribution trades off prior knowledge of the optimal trajectories against the coverage requirement of the dataset, revealing the effect of this inductive bias in the learning processes. Furthermore, when considering the exploratory dataset, our analysis shows that only realizable function classes are enough for learning near-optimal policies, even with no side information on the additional coverage distributions",

Knowing this distribution allows analyzing the treatment's expected utility or quantifying the uncertainty regarding a treatment's effect. This information is essential for prescribing optimal treatments. The ability of a model to predict accurate individual treatment effect distributions is captured by its likelihood. In light of this, we propose a novel neural architecture, NOFLITE, that uses normalizing flows to directly optimize this likelihood, while simultaneously learning flexible estimates of the individual treatment effect distribution.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We investigate the convergence of stochastic mirror descent (SMD) under interpolation in relatively smooth and smooth convex optimization. In relatively smooth convex optimization we provide new convergence guarantees for SMD with a constant stepsize. For smooth convex optimization we propose a new adaptive stepsize scheme --- the mirror stochastic Polyak stepsize (mSPS). Notably, our convergence results in both settings do not make bounded gradient assumptions or bounded variance assumptions, and we show convergence to a neighborhood that vanishes under interpolation. Consequently, these results correspond to the first convergence guarantees under interpolation for the exponentiated gradient algorithm for fixed or adaptive stepsizes. mSPS generalizes the recently proposed stochastic Polyak stepsize (SPS) (Loizou et al. 2021) to mirror descent and remains both practical and efficient for modern machine learning applications while inheriting the benefits of mirror descent. We complement our results with experiments across various supervised learning tasks and different instances of SMD, demonstrating the effectiveness of mSPS",

These techniques, however, extend receptive fields to the complete graph, at substantial computational cost and risking a change in the inductive biases of conventional GNNs, or require complex architecture adjustments. As a conservative alternative, we use positional encodings to expand receptive fields to r-hop neighborhoods. More specifically, our method augments the input graph with additional nodes/edges and uses positional encodings as node and/or edge features. We thus modify graphs before inputting them to a downstream GNN model, instead of modifying the model itself. This makes our method model-agnostic, i.e., compatible with any of the existing GNN architectures. We also provide examples of positional encodings that are lossless with a one-to-one map between the original and the modified graphs. We demonstrate that extending receptive fields via positional encodings and a virtual fully- connected node significantly improves GNN performance and alleviates over-squashing using small r. We obtain improvements on a variety of models and datasets and reach competitive performance using traditional GNNs or graph Transformers",

    "abstract": "While current deep learning algorithms have been successful for a wide variety of artificial intelligence (AI) tasks, including those involving structured image data, they present deep neurophysiological conceptual issues due to their reliance on the gradients that are computed by backpropagation of errors (backprop). Gradients are required to obtain synaptic weight adjustments but require knowledge of feed forward activities in order to conduct backward propagation, a biologically implausible process. This is known as the \"weight transport problem''. Therefore, in this work, we present a more biologically plausible approach towards solving the weight transport problem for image data. This approach, which we name the error-kernel driven activation alignment (EKDAA) algorithm, accomplishes through the introduction of locally derived error transmission kernels and error maps. Like standard deep learning networks, EKDAA performs the standard forward process via weights and activation functions; however, its backward error computation involves adaptive error kernels that propagate local error signals through the network. The efficacy of EKDAA is demonstrated by performing visual-recognition tasks on the Fashion MNIST, CIFAR-10 and SVHN benchmarks, along with demonstrating its ability to extract visual features from natural color images. Furthermore, in order to demonstrate its non-reliance on gradient computations, results are presented for an EKDAA-trained CNN that employs a non-differentiable activation function",

In this paper, we propose a simple learning rule for full-rank DPPs based on a minorization-maximization (MM) algorithm, which monotonically increases the likelihood in each iteration. We show that our minorizer of the MM algorithm provides a tighter lower-bound compared to an existing method locally. We also generalize the algorithm for further acceleration.

Despite emerging empirical evidence, theoretical study on why RL helps is still at its early stage. This paper presents the first systematic study on policy optimization methods for online CO problems. We show that online CO problems can be naturally formulated as latent Markov Decision Processes (LMDPs), and prove convergence bounds on natural policy gradient (NPG) for solving LMDPs. Furthermore, our theory explains the benefit of curriculum learning: it can find a strong sampling policy and reduce the distribution shift, a critical quantity that governs the convergence rate in our theorem. For a canonical online CO problem, the Best Choice Problem (BCP), we formally prove that distribution shift is reduced exponentially with curriculum learning even if the curriculum is a randomly generated BCP on a smaller scale. Our theory also shows we can simplify the curriculum learning scheme used in prior work from multi-step to single-step. Lastly, we provide extensive experiments on the Best Choice Problem, Online Knapsack, and AdWords to verify our findings",

In particular, bit-flip weight perturbations in quantized networks can significantly degrade performance, underscoring the need to improve DNN resilience. In this paper, we introduce a training mechanism to learn the quantization range of different DNN layers to enhance DNN robustness against bit-flip errors on the model parameters. The proposed approach, called weight clipping-aware training (WCAT), minimizes the quantization range while preserving performance, striking a balance between the two. Our experimental results on different models and datasets showcase that DNNs trained with WCAT can tolerate a high amount of noise while keeping the accuracy close to the baseline model. Moreover, we show that our method significantly enhances DNN robustness against adversarial bit-flip attacks. Finally, when considering the energy-reliability trade-off inherent in on-chip SRAM memories, we observe that WCAT consistently improves the Pareto frontier of test accuracy and energy consumption across diverse models",

Prior work has either hard-coded object-centric features, used complex object-centric generative models, or updated state using local spatial features. However, these approaches have had limited success in enabling general RL agents. Motivated by this, we introduce \"Feature- Attending Recurrent Modules\" (FARM), an architecture for learning state representations that relies on simple, broadly applicable inductive biases for capturing spatial and temporal regularities. FARM learns a state representation that is distributed across multiple modules that each attend to spatiotemporal features with an expressive feature attention mechanism. We show that this improves an RL agent's ability to generalize across object-centric tasks. We study task suites in both 2D and 3D environments and find that FARM better generalizes compared to competing architectures that leverage attention or multiple modules",

Our method guarantees risk control at any user-specified level even when the underlying data distribution shifts drastically, even adversarially, over time in an unknown fashion. The technique we propose is highly flexible as it can be applied with any base online learning algorithm (e.g., a deep neural network trained online), requiring minimal implementation effort and essentially zero additional computational cost. We further extend our approach to control multiple risks simultaneously, so the prediction sets we generate are valid for all given risks. To demonstrate the utility of our method, we conduct experiments on real-world tabular time-series data sets showing that the proposed method rigorously controls various natural risks. Furthermore, we show how to construct valid intervals for an online image-depth estimation problem that previous sequential calibration schemes cannot handle",

To extend beyond the single domain formulation and towards more realistic learning scenarios, we explore model design spaces beyond MLPs, i.e., transformer backbones, which provide flexibility where attention layers govern interactions among treatments and covariates to exploit structural similarities of potential outcomes for confounding control. Through careful model design, Transformers as Treatment Effect Estimators (TransTEE) is proposed. We show empirically that TransTEE can: (1) serve as a general-purpose treatment effect estimator which significantly outperforms competitive baselines on a variety of challenging TEE problems (e.g., discrete, continuous, structured, or dosage-associated treatments.) and is applicable to both when covariates are tabular and when they consist of structural data (e.g., texts, graphs); (2) yield multiple advantages: compatibility with propensity score modeling, parameter efficiency, robustness to continuous treatment value distribution shifts, explainable in covariate adjustment, and real-world utility in auditing pre-trained language models",

    "abstract": "Statistical heterogeneity severely limits the performance of federated learning (FL), motivating several explorations e.g., FedProx, MOON and FedDyn, to alleviate this problem. Despite effectiveness, their considered scenario generally requires samples from almost all classes during the local training of each client, although some covariate shifts may exist among clients. In fact, the natural case of partially class-disjoint data (PCDD), where each client contributes a few classes (instead of all classes) of samples, is practical yet underexplored. Specifically, the unique collapse and invasion characteristics of PCDD can induce the biased optimization direction in local training, which prevents the efficiency of federated learning. To address this dilemma, we propose a manifold reshaping approach called FedMR to calibrate the feature space of local training. Our FedMR adds two interplaying losses to the vanilla federated learning: one is the intra-class loss to decorrelate feature dimensions for anti-collapse; and the other one is the inter-class loss to guarantee the proper margin among categories in the feature expansion. We conduct extensive experiments on a range of datasets to demonstrate that our FedMR achieves much higher accuracy and better communication efficiency",

Learning a forward dynamics model in combination with a latent policy has been shown to solve these issues. However, the limited supervision in the IfO scenario can lead to mode collapse when learning the generative forward dynamics model and the corresponding latent policy. In this paper, we analyze the mode collapse problem in this setting and show that it is caused by a combination of deterministic expert data and bad initialization of the models. Under the assumption of piecewise continuous system dynamics, we propose ILPO-MP, a method to prevent the mode collapse using clustering of expert transitions to impose a mode prior on the generative model and the latent policy.

    "abstract": "Model sparsity is a promising approach to reducing parameters or FLOPs of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Compared to unstructured or coarse-grained structured sparsity, fine-grained structured sparsity, e.g., N:M sparse pattern, can achieve a better balance between accuracy and efficiency on general computing platforms like CPUs and GPUs. In particular, the 2:4 sparsity can accelerate CNN inference by 2$\\times$ speed and with negligible accuracy drop. However, N:M sparsity needs to be supported by GPU within specific hardware circuits and hardly achieves significant speedups on common GPUs. To accelerate CNNs with general-purposed computing resources and simultaneously retain the model accuracy as much as possible, this paper proposes complementary sparsity (CS). CS denotes that only one weight can be retained for weights spaced at the same distance. On the one hand, CS features high mask flexibility, which is naturally favorable to high model accuracy. Moreover, we propose a CS-specific sparse training method to improve CS-based CNNs' accuracy under high parameter sparsities ($>$75\\%). On the other hand, CS itself is memory-access balanced and robust to pattern hyperparameters, which can be utilized to speedup CS-based convolution computation on CPUs and common GPUs. We thus propose a CS convolution parallel computing algorithm that adapts to common GPUs without sparse tensor cores. Experimental results show that compared to other sparsity patterns, the proposed CS can achieve the optimal trade-off in terms of accuracy and latency for CPUs and common GPUs, respectively.

With $k=1$, we localize individual neurons that are highly relevant for a particular feature and perform a number of case studies to illustrate general properties of LLMs. In particular, we show that early layers make use of sparse combinations of neurons to represent many features in superposition, that middle layers have seemingly dedicated neurons to represent higher-level contextual features, and that increasing scale causes representational sparsity to increase on average, but there are multiple types of scaling dynamics.

These experiments show that our model succeeds in discovering units which are similar to those proposed previously in form, content, and level of abstraction, and which show promise for capturing meaningful information at a higher level of abstraction",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recently, there has been significant progress in teaching language models to perform step-by-step reasoning to solve complex numerical reasoning tasks. Chain-of-thoughts prompting (CoT) is the state-of-art method for many of these tasks. CoT uses language models to produce text describing reasoning, and computation, and finally the answer to a question. Here we propose `Program of Thoughts' (PoT), which uses language models (mainly Codex) to generate text and programming language statements, and finally an answer. In PoT, the computation can be delegated to a program interpreter, which is used to execute the generated program, thus decoupling complex computation from reasoning and language understanding. We evaluate PoT on five math word problem datasets and three financial-QA datasets in both few-shot and zero-shot settings. We find that PoT has an average performance gain over CoT of around 12% across all datasets. By combining PoT with self-consistency decoding, we can achieve extremely strong performance on all the math datasets and financial datasets. All of our data and code will be released",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Privacy concerns grow with the success of modern deep learning models, especially when the training set contains sensitive data. Differentially private generative model (DPGM) can serve as a solution to circumvent such concerns by generating data that are distributionally similar to the original data yet with differential privacy (DP) guarantees. While GAN has attracted major attention, existing DPGMs based on flow generative models are limited and only developed on low-dimensional tabular datasets. The capability of exact density estimation makes the flow model exceptional when density estimation is of interest. In this work, we will first show that it is challenging (or even infeasible) to train a DP-flow via DP-SGD, i.e. the workhorse algorithm for private deep learning, on high-dimensional image sets with acceptable utility, and then we give an effective solution by reducing the generation from the pixel space to a lower dimensional latent space. We show the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed method via extensive experiments, where the proposed method achieves a significantly better privacy-utility trade-off compared to existing alternatives. Notably, our method is the first DPGM to scale to high-resolution image sets (up to 256 × 256). Our code is available at https://github.com/dihjiang/DP-LFlow",

    "abstract": "Replay methods are known to be successful at mitigating catastrophic forgetting in continual learning scenarios despite having limited access to historical data. However, storing historical data is cheap in many real-world settings, yet replaying all historical data is often prohibited due to processing time constraints. In such settings, we propose that continual learning systems should learn the time to learn and schedule which tasks to replay at different time steps. We first demonstrate the benefits of our proposal by using Monte Carlo tree search to find a proper replay schedule, and show that the found replay schedules can outperform fixed scheduling policies when combined with various replay methods in different continual learning settings. Additionally, we propose a framework for learning replay scheduling policies with reinforcement learning. We show that the learned policies can generalize better in new continual learning scenarios compared to equally replaying all seen tasks, without added computational cost. Our study reveals the importance of learning the time to learn in continual learning, which brings current research closer to real-world needs",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Decentralized learning algorithms enable the training of deep learning models over large distributed datasets, without the need for a central server. The current state-of-the-art decentralized algorithms mostly assume the data distributions to be Independent and Identically Distributed (IID). In practical scenarios, the distributed datasets can have significantly different data distributions across the agents. This paper focuses on improving decentralized learning on non-IID data with minimal compute and memory overheads. We propose Neighborhood Gradient Mean (NGM), a novel decentralized learning algorithm that modifies the local gradients of each agent using self- and cross-gradient information. In particular, the proposed method averages the local gradients with model-variant or data-variant cross-gradients based on the communication budget. Model-variant cross-gradients are derivatives of the received neighbors' model parameters with respect to the local dataset. Data-variant cross-gradient derivatives of the local model with respect to its neighbors' datasets. The data-variant cross-gradients are aggregated through an additional communication round. We theoretically analyze the convergence characteristics of NGM and demonstrate its efficiency on non-IID data sampled from various vision and language datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method either remains competitive or outperforms (by 0-6%) the existing state-of-the-art (SoTA) decentralized learning algorithm on non-IID data with significantly less compute and memory requirements. Further, we show that the model-variant cross-gradient information available locally at each agent can improve the performance on non-IID data by 3-20% without additional communication costs",

For computational reasons, the Sliced Wasserstein (SW) distance was introduced as an alternative to the Wasserstein distance, and has seen uses for training generative Neural Networks (NNs). While convergence of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) has been observed practically in such a setting, there is to our knowledge no theoretical guarantee for this observation. Leveraging recent works on convergence of SGD on non-smooth and non-convex functions by Bianchi et al. (2022), we aim to bridge that knowledge gap, and provide a realistic context under which fixed-step SGD trajectories for the SW loss on NN parameters converge. More precisely, we show that the trajectories approach the set of (sub)-gradient flow equations as the step decreases. Under stricter assumptions, we show a much stronger convergence result for noised and projected SGD schemes, namely that the long-run limits of the trajectories approach a set of generalised critical points of the loss function",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Neurally-parameterized Structural Causal Models in the Pearlian notion to causality, referred to as NCM, were recently introduced as a step towards next-generation learning systems. However, said NCM are only concerned with the learning aspect of causal inference and totally miss out on the architecture aspect. That is, actual causal inference within NCM is intractable in that the NCM won't return an answer to a query in polynomial time. This insight follows as corollary to the more general statement on the intractability of arbitrary structural causal model (SCM) parameterizations, which we prove in this work through classical 3-SAT reduction. Since future learning algorithms will be required to deal with both high dimensional data and highly complex mechanisms governing the data, we ultimately believe work on tractable inference for causality to be decisive. We also show that not all \"causal\" models are created equal. More specifically, there are models capable of answering causal queries that are not SCM, which we refer to as partially causal models (PCM). We provide a tabular taxonomy in terms of tractability properties for all of the different model families, namely correlation-based, PCM and SCM. To conclude our work, we also provide some initial ideas on how to overcome parts of the intractability of causal inference with SCM by showing an example of how parameterizing an SCM with SPN modules can at least allow for tractable mechanisms. With this work we hope that our insights can raise awareness for this novel research direction since achieving success with causality in real world downstream tasks will not only depend on learning correct models but also require having the practical ability to gain access to model inferences",

In this work, we observe that many existing self-supervised learning algorithms can be both unified and generalized when seen through the lens of equivariant representations. Specifically, we introduce a general framework we call Homomorphic Self-Supervised Learning, and theoretically show how it may subsume the use of input-augmentations provided an augmentation-homomorphic feature extractor. We validate this theory experimentally for simple augmentations, demonstrate the necessity of representational structure for feature-space SSL, and further empirically explore how the parameters of this framework relate to those of traditional augmentation-based self-supervised learning.

    "abstract": "Our study is motivated by robotics, where when dealing with robots or other physical systems, we often need to balance competing concerns of relying on complex, multimodal data coming from a variety of sensors with a general lack of large representative datasets. Despite the complexity of modern robotic platforms and the need for multimodal interaction, there has been little research on integrating more than two modalities in a low data regime with the real-world constraint that sensors fail due to obstructions or adverse conditions. In this work, we consider a case in which natural language is used as a retrieval query against objects, represented across multiple modalities, in a physical environment. We introduce extended multimodal alignment (EMMA), a method that learns to select the appropriate object while jointly refining modality-specific embeddings through a geometric (distance-based) loss. In contrast to prior work, our approach is able to incorporate an arbitrary number of views (modalities) of a particular piece of data.

    "title": "Worst-case Feature Risk Minimization for Data-Efficient Learning",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Deep learning models typically require massive amounts of annotated data to train a strong model for a task of interest. However, data annotation is time-consuming and costly. How to use labeled data from a related but distinct domain, or just a few samples to train a satisfactory model are thus important questions. To achieve this goal, models should resist overfitting to the specifics of the training data in order to generalize well to new data. This paper proposes a novel Worst-case Feature Risk Minimization (WFRM) method that helps improve model generalization. Specifically, we tackle a minimax optimization problem in feature space at each training iteration. Given the input features, we seek the feature perturbation that maximizes the current training loss and then minimizes the training loss of the worst-case features. By incorporating our WFRM during training, we significantly improve model generalization under distributional shift – Domain Generalization (DG) and in the low-data regime – Few-shot Learning (FSL). We theoretically analyze WFRM and find the key reason why it works better than ERM – it induces an empirical risk-based semi-adaptive $L_{2}$ regularization of the classifier weights, enabling a better risk-complexity trade-off. We evaluate WFRM on two data-efficient learning tasks, including three standard DG benchmarks of PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome and the most challenging FSL benchmark Meta-Dataset. Despite the simplicity, our method consistently improves various DG and FSL methods, leading to the new state-of-the-art performances in all settings.

It is typically implicitly assumed that $\\mathbb{P}^{Y|X}$ is the ``true'' posterior label distribution. However, in many real-world scenarios, the labels $Y_1,...,Y_n$ are obtained by aggregating expert opinions using a voting procedure, resulting in a one-hot distribution $\\mathbb{P}_{\\textup{vote}}^{Y|X}$. This is the case for most datasets, even well-known ones like ImageNet. For such ``voted'' labels, CP guarantees are thus w.r.t. $\\mathbb{P}_{\\textup{vote}}=\\mathbb{P}^X \\otimes \\mathbb{P}_{\\textup{vote}}^{Y|X}$ rather than the true distribution $\\mathbb{P}$.

However, when experts do not agree because of ambiguous labels, approximating $\\mathbb{P}^{Y|X}$ with a one-hot distribution $\\mathbb{P}_{\\textup{vote}}^{Y|X}$ ignores this uncertainty. In this paper, we propose to leverage expert opinions to approximate $\\mathbb{P}^{Y|X}$ using a non-degenerate distribution $\\mathbb{P}_{\\textup{agg}}^{Y|X}$.

However, training these models for large systems can be quite challenging as they incur significant computational and memory expense---these systems are often forced to rely on autoregressive time-stepping of the neural network to predict future temporal states. While this is effective in managing costs, it can lead to uncontrolled error growth over time and eventual instability. We analyze the sources of this autoregressive error growth using prototypical neural operator models for physical systems and explore ways to mitigate it. We introduce architectural and application-specific improvements that allow for careful control of instability-inducing operations within these models without inflating the compute/memory expense. We present results on several scientific systems that include Navier-Stokes fluid flow, rotating shallow water, and a high-resolution global weather forecasting system. We demonstrate that applying our design principles to neural operators leads to significantly lower errors for long-term forecasts as well as longer time horizons without qualitative signs of divergence compared to the original models for these systems.

In this paper, we aim at answering two intriguing questions: (1) Can we go beyond the KL-based objective? (2) Besides the popular cosine similarity, can we design a better similarity function? We provide answers to both questions by generalizing the KL-based mutual information to the $f$-Mutual Information in Contrastive Learning ($f$-MICL) using the $f$-divergences. To answer the first question, we provide a wide range of $f$-MICL objectives which share the nice properties of InfoNCE (e.g., alignment and uniformity), and meanwhile result in similar or even superior performance. For the second question, assuming that the joint feature distribution is proportional to the Gaussian kernel, we derive an $f$-Gaussian similarity with better interpretability and empirical performance. Finally, we identify close relationships between the $f$-MICL objective and several popular InfoNCE-based objectives. Using benchmark tasks from both vision and natural language, we empirically evaluate $f$-MICL with different $f$-divergences on various architectures (SimCLR, MoCo, and MoCo v3) and datasets.

    "abstract": "In a contextual pricing problem, a seller aims at maximizing the revenue over a sequence of sales sessions (described by feature vectors) using binary-censored feedback of \"sold\" or \"not sold\". Existing methods often overlook two practical challenges (1) the best pricing strategy could change over time; (2) the prices and pricing policies must conform to hard constraints due to safety, ethical or legal restrictions. We address both challenges by solving a more general problem of \"universal dynamic regret\" minimization in proper online learning with exp-concave losses --- an open problem posed by Baby & Wang (2021) that we partially resolve in this paper, with attention restricted to loss functions coming from a generalized linear model. Here \"dynamic regret\" measures the performance relative to a non-stationary sequence of policies, and \"proper\" means that the learner must choose feasible strategies within a pre-defined convex set, which we use to model the safety constraints. In this work, we consider a linear noisy valuation model for the customers.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Vision-language pre-training (VLP) has recently proven highly effective for various uni- and multi-modal downstream applications. However, most existing end-to-end VLP methods use high-resolution image-text-box data to perform well on fine-grained region-level tasks, such as object detection, segmentation, and referring expression comprehension. Unfortunately, such high-resolution images with accurate bounding box annotations are expensive to collect and use for supervision at scale. In this work, we propose VoLTA (Vision Language Transformer with weakly-supervised local-feature Alignment), a new VLP paradigm that only utilizes image-caption data but achieves fine-grained region-level image understanding, eliminating the need for expensive box annotations. VoLTA adopts graph optimal transport-based weakly-supervised alignment on local image patches and text tokens to germinate an explicit, self-normalized, and interpretable low-level matching criterion. In addition, VoLTA pushes multi-modal fusion deep into the uni-modal backbones during pre training and removes fusion-specific transformer layers, further reducing memory requirements. Extensive experiments on a wide range of vision- and vision-language downstream tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of VoLTA on fine-grained applications without compromising the coarse-grained downstream performance, often outperforming methods using significantly more caption and box annotations",

    "abstract": "When deep neural networks became state of the art image classifiers, numerous max pooling operations were an important component of the architecture. However, modern computer vision networks typically have few, if any, max pooling operations. To understand whether this trend is justified, we develop a mathematical framework analyzing ReLU based approximations of max pooling, and prove a sense in which max pooling cannot be replicated. We formulate and analyze a novel class of optimal approximations, and find that the residual can be made exponentially small in the kernel size, but only with an exponentially wide approximation. This work gives a theoretical basis for understanding the reduced use of max pooling in newer architectures. It also enables us to establish an empirical observation about natural images: since max pooling does not seem necessary, the inputs on which max pooling is distinct – those with a large difference between the max and other values – are not prevalent",

    "title": "Beyond Distribution Shift: Spurious Features Through the Lens of Training Dynamics",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are prone to learning spurious features that correlate with the label during training but are irrelevant to the learning problem. This hurts model generalization and poses problems when deploying them in safety-critical applications. This paper aims to better understand the effects of spurious features through the lens of the learning dynamics of the internal neurons during the training process. We make the following observations: (1) While previous works highlight the harmful effects of spurious features on the generalization ability of DNNs, we emphasize that not all spurious features are harmful. Spurious features can be \"benign\" or \"harmful\" depending on whether they are \"harder\" or \"easier\" to learn than the core features for a given model. This definition is model and dataset dependent. (2) We build upon this premise and use instance difficulty methods (like Prediction Depth) to quantify \"easiness\" for a given model and to identify this behavior during the training phase. (3) We empirically show that the harmful spurious features can be detected by observing the learning dynamics of the DNN's early layers. In other words, easy features learned by the initial layers of a DNN early during the training can (potentially) hurt model generalization. We verify our claims on medical and vision datasets, both simulated and real, and justify the empirical success of our hypothesis by showing the theoretical connections between Prediction Depth and information-theoretic concepts like $\\mathcal{V}$-usable information. Lastly, our experiments show that monitoring only accuracy during training (as is common in machine learning pipelines) is insufficient to detect spurious features. We, therefore, highlight the need for monitoring early training dynamics using suitable instance difficulty metrics",

It has been shown that many state-of-the-art multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms are prone to converging to Pareto-dominated equilibria due to the uncertainty each agent has about the policy of the other agents during training. To address sub-optimal equilibrium selection, we propose Pareto Actor-Critic (Pareto-AC), which is an actor-critic algorithm that utilises a simple property of no-conflict games (a superset of cooperative games): the Pareto-optimal equilibrium in a no-conflict game maximises the returns of all agents and, therefore, is the preferred outcome for all agents. We evaluate Pareto-AC in a diverse set of multi-agent games and show that it converges to higher episodic returns compared to seven state-of-the-art MARL algorithms and that it successfully converges to a Pareto-optimal equilibrium in a range of matrix games. Finally, we propose PACDCG, a graph neural network extension of Pareto-AC, which is shown to efficiently scale in games with a large number of agents",

Its cumulative Bayesian regret goes down to zero exponentially fast in $N$, the offline dataset size if the expert is competent enough. Since this algorithm is computationally impractical, we then propose the iRLSVI algorithm that can be seen as a combination of the RLSVI algorithm for online RL, and imitation learning. Our empirical results show that the proposed iRLSVI algorithm is able to achieve significant reduction in regret as compared to two baselines: no offline data, and offline dataset but used without suitably modeling the generative policy.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is an emerging paradigm that permits a large number of clients with heterogeneous data to coordinate learning of a unified global model without the need to share data amongst each other. A major challenge in federated learning is the heterogeneity of data across client, which can degrade the performance of standard FL algorithms. Standard FL algorithms involve averaging of model parameters or gradient updates to approximate the global model at the server. However, we argue that in heterogeneous settings, averaging can result in information loss and lead to poor generalization due to the bias induced by dominant client gradients. We hypothesize that to generalize better across non-i.i.d datasets, the algorithms should focus on learning the invariant mechanism that is constant while ignoring spurious mechanisms that differ across clients. Inspired from recent works in Out-of-Distribution generalization, we propose a gradient masked averaging approach for FL as an alternative to the standard averaging of client updates. This aggregation technique for client updates can be adapted as a drop-in replacement in most existing federated algorithms. We perform extensive experiments on multiple FL algorithms with in-distribution, real-world, feature-skewed out-of-distribution, and quantity imbalanced datasets and show that it provides consistent improvements, particularly in the case of heterogeneous clients",

The latter is a framework for optimizing nonconvex functions where a sequence of surrogate objective functions, called continuations, are locally optimized. Second, we show that optimizing affine Gaussian policies and performing entropy regularization can be interpreted as implicitly optimizing deterministic policies by continuation. Based on these theoretical results, we argue that exploration in policy-gradient algorithms consists in computing a continuation of the return of the policy at hand, and that the variance of policies should be history-dependent functions adapted to avoid local extrema rather than to maximize the return of the policy",

    "abstract": "Riemannian geometry provides us with powerful tools to explore the latent space of generative models while preserving the underlying structure of the data. The latent space can be equipped it with a Riemannian metric, pulled back from the data manifold. With this metric, we can systematically navigate the space relying on geodesics defined as the shortest curves between two points. Generative models are often stochastic, causing the data space, the Riemannian metric, and the geodesics, to be stochastic as well. Stochastic objects are at best impractical, and at worst impossible, to manipulate. A common solution is to approximate the stochastic pullback metric by its expectation. But the geodesics derived from this expected Riemannian metric do not correspond to the expected length-minimising curves. In this work, we propose another metric whose geodesics explicitly minimise the expected length of the pullback metric. We show this metric defines a Finsler metric, and we compare it with the expected Riemannian metric. In high dimensions, we prove that both metrics converge to each other at a rate of $\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{1}{D}\\right)$. This convergence implies that the established expected Riemannian metric is an accurate approximation of the theoretically more grounded Finsler metric. This provides justification for using the expected Riemannian metric for practical implementations",

We present a new framework for understanding and designing discretization invariant neural networks (DI-Nets), which generalizes many discrete networks such as convolutional neural networks as well as continuous networks such as neural operators. Our analysis establishes upper bounds on the deviation in model outputs under different finite discretizations, and highlights the central role of point set discrepancy in characterizing such bounds. This insight leads to the design of a family of neural networks driven by numerical integration via quasi-Monte Carlo sampling with discretizations of low discrepancy. We prove by construction that DI-Nets universally approximate a large class of maps between integrable function spaces, and show that discretization invariance also describes backpropagation through such models. Applied to neural fields, convolutional DI-Nets can learn to classify and segment visual data under various discretizations, and sometimes generalize to new types of discretizations at test time",

    "abstract": "Sparse subspace clustering (SSC) using greedy-based neighbor selection, such as orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP), has been known as a popular computationally-efficient alternative to the standard $\\ell_1$-minimization based methods. However, existing stopping rules of OMP to halt neighbor search needs additional offline work to estimate some ground truths, e.g., subspace dimension and/or noise strength. This paper proposes a new SSC scheme using generalized OMP (GOMP), a soup-up of OMP whereby multiple, say $p(\\geq1)$, neighbors are identified per iteration to further speed up neighbor acquisition, along with a new stopping rule requiring nothing more than a knowledge of the ambient signal dimension and the number $p$ of identified neighbors in each iteration. Compared to conventional OMP (i.e., $p=1$), the proposed GOMP method involves fewer iterations, thereby enjoying lower algorithmic complexity. Under the semi-random model, analytic performance guarantees are provided. It is shown that, with a high probability, (i) GOMP can retrieve more true neighbors than OMP, consequently yielding higher data clustering accuracy, and (ii) the proposed stopping rule terminates neighbor search once the number of recovered neighbors is close to the subspace dimension. Issues about selecting $p$ for practical implementation are also discussed. Computer simulations using both synthetic and real data are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and validate our analytic study",

In this work, we study communication compression and aggregation mechanisms for curvature information in order to reduce these costs while preserving theoretically superior local convergence guarantees. We prove that the recently developed class of three point compressors (3PC) of [Richtarik et al., 2022] for gradient communication can be generalized to Hessian communication as well. This result opens up a wide variety of communication strategies, such as contractive compression and lazy aggregation, available to our disposal to compress prohibitively costly curvature information. Moreover, we discovered several new 3PC mechanisms, such as adaptive thresholding and Bernoulli aggregation, which require reduced communication and occasional Hessian computations. Furthermore, we extend and analyze our approach to bidirectional communication compression and partial device participation setups to cater to the practical considerations of applications in federated learning. For all our methods, we derive fast condition-number-independent local linear and/or superlinear convergence rates. Finally, with extensive numerical evaluations on convex optimization problems, we illustrate that our designed schemes achieve state-of-the-art communication complexity compared to several key baselines using second-order information",

Despite its success, federated learning faces several challenges related to its decentralized nature. In this work, we develop a novel algorithmic procedure with theoretical speedup guarantees that simultaneously handles two of these hurdles, namely (i) data heterogeneity, i.e., data distributions can vary substantially across clients, and (ii) system heterogeneity, i.e., the computational power of the clients could differ significantly. By leveraging previous works in the realm of representation learning (Collins et al., 2021; Liang et al., 2020), our method constructs a global common representation utilizing the data from all clients. Additionally, it learns a user-specific set of parameters resulting in a personalized solution for each individual client. Furthermore, it mitigates the effects of stragglers by adaptively selecting clients based on their computational characteristics, thus achieving for the first time near optimal sample complexity and provable logarithmic speedup. Experimental results support our theoretical findings showing the superiority of our method over alternative personalized federated schemes in system and data heterogeneous environments",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in humans. PD is characterized by the gradual loss of dopaminergic neurons in the Substantia Nigra (SN, a part of the mid-brain). Counting the number of dopaminergic neurons in the SN is one of the most important indexes in evaluating drug efficacy in PD animal models. Currently, analyzing and quantifying dopaminergic neurons is conducted manually by experts through analysis of digital pathology images which is laborious, time-consuming, and highly subjective. As such, a reliable and unbiased automated system is demanded for the quantification of dopaminergic neurons in digital pathology images. Recent years have seen a surge in adopting deep learning solutions in medical image processing. However, developing high-performing deep learning models hinges on the availability of large-scale, high-quality annotated data, which can be expensive to acquire, especially in applications like digital pathology image analysis. To this end, we propose an end-to-end deep learning framework based on self-supervised learning for the segmentation and quantification of dopaminergic neurons in PD animal models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first deep learning model that detects the cell body of dopaminergic neurons, counts the number of dopaminergic neurons, and provides characteristics of individual dopaminergic neurons as a numerical output. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in quantifying neurons with high precision, which can provide a faster turnaround for drug efficacy studies,better understanding of dopaminergic neuronal health status, and unbiased results in PD pre-clinical research. As part of our contributions, we also provide the first publicly available dataset of histology digital images along with expert annotations for the segmentation of TH-positive DA neuronal soma",

    "title": "Analysis of Convolutions, Non-linearity and Depth in Graph Neural Networks using Neural Tangent Kernel",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The fundamental principle of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is to exploit the structural information of the data by aggregating the neighboring nodes using a `graph convolution' in conjunction with a suitable choice for the network architecture, such as depth and activation functions. Therefore, understanding the influence of each of the design choice on the network performance is crucial. Convolutions based on graph Laplacian have emerged as the dominant choice with the symmetric normalization of the adjacency matrix as the most widely adopted one. However, some empirical studies show that row normalization of the adjacency matrix outperforms it in node classification. Despite the widespread use of GNNs, there is no rigorous theoretical study on the representation power of these convolutions, that could explain this behavior. Similarly, the empirical observation of the linear GNNs performance being on par with non-linear ReLU GNNs lacks rigorous theory. In this work, we theoretically analyze the influence of different aspects of the GNN architecture using the Graph Neural Tangent Kernel in a semi-supervised node classification setting. Under the population Degree Corrected Stochastic Block Model, we prove that: (i) linear networks capture the class information as good as ReLU networks; (ii) row normalization preserves the underlying class structure better than other convolutions; (iii) performance degrades with network depth due to over-smoothing, but the loss in class information is the slowest in row normalization; (iv) skip connections retain the class information even at infinite depth, thereby eliminating over-smoothing. We finally validate our theoretical findings numerically and on real datasets such as Cora and Citeseer",

    "abstract": "This paper studies zero-shot node classification, which aims to predict new classes (i.e., unseen classes) of nodes in a graph. This problem is challenging yet promising in a variety of real-world applications such as social analysis and bioinformatics. The key of zero-shot node classification is to enable the knowledge transfer of nodes from training classes to unseen classes. However, existing methods typically ignore the dependencies between nodes and classes, and fail to be organically integrated in a united way. In this paper, we present a novel framework called the Graph Contrastive Embedding Network (GraphCEN) for zero-shot node classification. Specifically, GraphCEN first constructs an affinity graph to model the relations between the classes. Then the node- and class-level contrastive learning (CL) are proposed to jointly learn node embeddings and class assignments in an end-to-end manner. The two-level CL can be optimized to mutually enhance each other. Extensive experiments indicate that our GraphCEN significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on multiple challenging benchmark datasets",

The optimal complexity of stochastic first-order methods in terms of the number of gradient evaluations of individual functions is $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n + n^{1/2}\\varepsilon^{-1}\\right)$, attained by the optimal SGD methods SPIDER (Fang et al., 2018) and PAGE (Li et al., 2021), for example, where $\\varepsilon$ is the error tolerance. However, i) the big-$\\mathcal{O}$ notation hides crucial dependencies on the smoothness constants associated with the functions, and ii) the rates and theory in these methods assume simplistic sampling mechanisms that do not offer any flexibility. In this work we remedy the situation. First, we generalize the PAGE (Li et al., 2021) algorithm so that it can provably work with virtually any (unbiased) sampling mechanism. This is particularly useful in federated learning, as it allows us to construct and better understand the impact of various combinations of client and data sampling strategies. Second, our analysis is sharper as we make explicit use of certain novel inequalities that capture the intricate interplay between the smoothness constants and the sampling procedure. Indeed, our analysis is better even for the simple sampling procedure analyzed in the PAGE (Li et al., 2021) paper. However, this already improved bound can be further sharpened by a different sampling scheme which we propose. In summary, we provide the most general and most accurate analysis of optimal SGD in the smooth nonconvex regime. Finally, our theoretical findings are supposed with carefully designed experiments",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Many methods for Model-based Reinforcement learning (MBRL) in Markov decision processes (MDPs) provide guarantees for both the accuracy of the model they can deliver and the learning efficiency. At the same time, state abstraction techniques allow for a reduction of the size of an MDP while maintaining a bounded loss with respect to the original problem. Therefore, it may come as a surprise that no such guarantees are available when combining both techniques, i.e., where MBRL merely observes abstract states. Our theoretical analysis shows that abstraction can introduce a dependence between samples collected online (e.g., in the real world). That means that, without taking this dependence into account, results for MBRL do not directly extend to this setting. Our result shows that we can use concentration inequalities for martingales to overcome this problem. This result makes it possible to extend the guarantees of existing MBRL algorithms to the setting with abstraction. We illustrate this by combining R-MAX, a prototypical MBRL algorithm, with abstraction, thus producing the first performance guarantees for model-based ‘RL from Abstracted Observations': model-based reinforcement learning with an abstract model",

We demonstrate that, without hyperparameter tuning, the kernel density integral transformation can be used as a simple drop-in replacement for either method, offering robustness to the weaknesses of each. Alternatively, with tuning of a single continuous hyperparameter, we frequently outperform both of these methods.

    "title": "Overcoming Resource Constraints in Federated Learning: Large Models Can Be Trained with only Weak Clients",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is emerging as a popular, promising decentralized learning framework that enables collaborative training among clients, with no need to share private data between them or to a centralized server. However, considering many edge clients do not have sufficient computing, memory, or communication capabilities, federated learning of large models still faces significant bottlenecks. To keep such weak but crucial clients in the loop, prior works either consider a heterogeneous-client setting where clients train models with different sizes; or offload training to the server. However, the heterogeneous-client setting requires some clients to train full model, which is not aligned with the resource-constrained setting; while the latter ones break privacy promises in FL when sharing intermediate representations or labels with the server. To overcome these limitations, in this work, we formulate a realistic, but much less explored, cross-device FL setting in which no client can train a full large model nor is willing to share any intermediate information with the remote server. Under such a formulation, we develop a principal sub-model (PriSM) training methodology to collaboratively train a full large model, while assigning each client a small sub-model that is a probabilistic low-rank approximation to the full server model. When creating sub-models, PriSM first performs a principal kernel analysis in the orthogonal kernel space to obtain importance of each kernel. Then, PriSM adopts a novel importance-aware sampling process to select a subset of kernels (i.e., a kernel with high importance is assigned with a higher sampling probability). This sampling process ensures each sub-model is still a low-rank approximation to the full model, while all sub-models together achieve nearly full coverage on the principal kernels. To further improve memory efficiency while still preserving accuracy, PriSM also exploits low-rank structure in intermediate representations and allows each sub-model to learn only a subset of them. Our evaluations on various datasets and models (CNNs, LSTMs, Transformers) under different resource-constrained settings demonstrate that PriSM yields an accuracy improvement of up to $10\\%$ compared to existing works. More importantly, PriSM does not incur significant accuracy degradation compared to full-model training (e.g., only $\\sim 2\\%$ accuracy drops for ResNet-18/CIFAR-10 when clients train only $0.2\\times$ sub-models)",

By performing randomized smoothing in the low-dimensional projected space, we characterize the certified region of our smoothed composite classifier back in the high-dimensional input space and prove a tractable lower bound on its volume. We show experimentally on CIFAR-10 and SVHN that classifiers without the initial projection are vulnerable to perturbations that are normal to the data manifold and yet are captured by the certified regions of our method.

Towards that goal, we introduce TALLY, a method that addresses this multi-domain long-tailed learning problem. Built upon a proposed selective balanced sampling strategy, TALLY achieves this by mixing the semantic representation of one example with the domain-associated nuisances of another, producing a new representation for use as data augmentation. To improve the disentanglement of semantic representations, TALLY further utilizes a domain-invariant class prototype that averages out domain-specific effects. We evaluate TALLY on several benchmarks and real-world datasets and find that it consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in both subpopulation and domain shift",

Inspired by MVP(Wei et al., 2022b) that displays impressive gains with CLIP, in this work, we also employ the semantically rich CLIP latent as target and further tap its potential by introducing a new MIM pipeline, CAE v2, to learn a high-quality encoder and facilitate model convergence on the pre-training task. CAE v2 is an improved variant of CAE (Chen et al., 2023), applying the CLIP latent on two pretraining tasks, i.e., visible latent alignment and masked latent alignment. Visible latent alignment directly mimics the visible latent representations from the encoder to the corresponding CLIP latent, which is beneficial for facilitating model convergence and improving the representative ability of the encoder. Masked latent alignment predicts the representations of masked patches within the feature space of CLIP latent as standard MIM task does, effectively aligning the representations computed from the encoder and the regressor into the same domain. We pretrain CAE v2 on ImageNet-1K images and evaluate on various downstream vision tasks, including image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection and instance segmentation. Experiments show that our CAE v2 achieves competitive performance and even outperforms the CLIP vision encoder, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.

These schedules account for the properties of the loss function and adapt to convergence metrics such as the gradient norm.

However, the state of the art suffers a major limitation: it assumes that causal interactions occur only at the frequency at which data is observed. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a method that allows structural learning of linear causal relationships occurring at different time scales. Specifically, we explicitly take into account instantaneous and lagged inter-relations between multiple time series, represented at different scales, hinging on wavelet transform. We cast the problem as the learning of a multiscale causal graph having sparse structure and dagness constraints, enforcing causality through directed and acyclic topology. To solve the resulting (non-convex) formulation, we propose an algorithm termed MS-CASTLE, which exhibits consistent performance across different noise distributions and wavelet choices. We also propose a single-scale version of our algorithm, SS-CASTLE, which outperforms existing methods in computational efficiency, performance, and robustness on synthetic data. Finally, we apply the proposed approach to learn the multiscale causal structure of the risk of 15 global equity markets, during covid-19 pandemic, illustrating the importance of multiscale analysis to reveal useful interactions at different time resolutions.

We propose distributed safe online gradient descent (D-Safe-OGD) with an exploration phase, where all agents estimate the constraint parameters collaboratively to build estimated feasible sets, ensuring the action selection safety during the optimization phase.

    "abstract": "Certifiably robust defenses against adversarial patches for image classifiers ensure correct prediction against any changes to a constrained neighborhood of pixels. PatchCleanser, the state-of-the-art certified defense, uses a double-masking strategy for robust classification. The success of this strategy relies heavily on the model's invariance to image pixel masking. In this paper, we take a closer look at model training schemes to improve this invariance. Instead of using Random Cutout augmentations like PatchCleanser, we introduce the notion of worst-case masking, i.e., selecting masked images which maximize classification loss. However, finding worst-case masks requires an exhaustive search, which might be prohibitively expensive to do on-the-fly during training. To solve this problem, we propose a two-round greedy masking strategy (Greedy Cutout) which finds an approximate worst-case mask location with much less compute. We show that the models trained with our Greedy Cutout improves certified robust accuracy over Random Cutout in PatchCleanser across a range of datasets and architectures.

In this work, we propose Sequential Learning-to-Defer (SLTD), a framework for learning-to-defer to a domain expert in sequential decision-making settings. Contrary to existing literature, we pose the problem of learning-to-defer as model-based reinforcement learning (RL) to i) account for long-term consequences of ML-based actions using RL and ii) adaptively defer based on the dynamics (model-based). Our proposed framework determines whether to defer (at each time step) by quantifying whether a deferral now will improve the value compared to delaying deferral to the next time step. To quantify the improvement, we account for potential future deferrals. As a result, we learn a pre-emptive deferral policy (i.e. a policy that defers early if using the ML-based policy could worsen long-term outcomes). Our deferral policy is adaptive to the non-stationarity in the dynamics. We demonstrate that adaptive deferral via SLTD provides an improved trade-off between long-term outcomes and deferral frequency on synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world data with non-stationary dynamics. Finally, we interpret the deferral decision by decomposing the propagated (long-term) uncertainty around the outcome, to justify the deferral decision",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Causal discovery (CD) from time-varying data is important in neuroscience, medicine, and machine learning. Techniques for CD encompass randomized experiments, which are generally unbiased but expensive, and algorithms such as Granger causality, conditional-independence-based, structural-equation-based, and score-based methods that are only accurate under strong assumptions made by human designers. However, as demonstrated in other areas of machine learning, human expertise is often not entirely accurate and tends to be outperformed in domains with abundant data. In this study, we examine whether we can enhance domain-specific causal discovery for time series using a data-driven approach. Our findings indicate that this procedure significantly outperforms human-designed, domain-agnostic causal discovery methods, such as Mutual Information, VAR-LiNGAM, and Granger Causality on the MOS 6502 microprocessor, the NetSim fMRI dataset, and the Dream3 gene dataset. We argue that, when feasible, the causality field should consider a supervised approach in which domain-specific CD procedures are learned from extensive datasets with known causal relationships, rather than being designed by human specialists. Our findings promise a new approach toward improving CD in neural and medical data and for the broader machine learning community",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning in sparse-reward navigation environments with expensive and limited interactions is challenging and poses a need for effective exploration. Motivated by complex navigation tasks that require real-world training (when cheap simulators are not available), we consider an agent that faces an unknown distribution of environments and must decide on an exploration strategy. It may leverage a series of training environments to improve its policy before it is evaluated in a test environment drawn from the same environment distribution. Most existing approaches focus on fixed exploration strategies, while the few that view exploration as a meta-optimization problem tend to ignore the need for _cost-efficient_ exploration. We propose a cost-aware Bayesian optimization approach that efficiently searches over a class of dynamic subgoal-based exploration strategies. The algorithm adjusts a variety of levers --- the locations of the subgoals, the length of each episode, and the number of replications per trial --- in order to overcome the challenges of sparse rewards, expensive interactions, and noise. An experimental evaluation demonstrates that the new approach outperforms existing baselines across a number of problem domains. We also provide a theoretical foundation and prove that the method asymptotically identifies a near-optimal subgoal design",

    "abstract": "The phenomenon of distribution shift (DS) occurs when a dataset at test time differs from the dataset at training time, which can significantly impair the performance of a machine learning model in practical settings due to a lack of knowledge about the data's distribution at test time. To address this problem, we postulate that real-world distributions are composed of latent Invariant Elementary Distributions (I.E.D) across different domains. This assumption implies an invariant structure in the solution space that enables knowledge transfer to unseen domains. To exploit this property for domain generalization, we introduce a modular neural network layer consisting of Gated Domain Units (GDUs) that learn a representation for each latent elementary distribution. During inference, a weighted ensemble of learning machines can be created by comparing new observations with the representations of each elementary distribution. Our flexible framework also accommodates scenarios where explicit domain information is not present. Extensive experiments on image, text, and graph data show consistent performance improvement on out-of-training target domains. These findings support the practicality of the I.E.D assumption and the effectiveness of GDUs for domain generalisation",

In this framework, the probabilistic graphical model is converted into a sequence of clique tree forests (SCTF) with bounded clique sizes. We show that the SCTF can be used to efficiently compute the partition function. We propose two new algorithms which are used to construct the SCTF and prove the correctness of both. The first is an algorithm for incremental construction of CTFs that is guaranteed to give a valid CTF with bounded clique sizes and the second is an approximation algorithm that takes a calibrated CTF as input and yields a valid and calibrated CTF with reduced clique sizes as the output.

    "abstract": "Edge devices can benefit remarkably from federated learning due to their distributed nature; however, their limited resource and computing power poses limitations in deployment. A possible solution to this problem is to utilize off-the-shelf sparse learning algorithms at the clients to meet their resource budget. However, such naive deployment in the clients causes significant accuracy degradation, especially for highly resource-constrained clients. In particular, our investigations reveal that the lack of consensus in the sparsity masks among the clients may potentially slow down the convergence of the global model and cause a substantial accuracy drop. With these observations, we present \\textit{federated lottery aware sparsity hunting} (FLASH), a unified sparse learning framework for training a sparse sub-model that maintains the performance under ultra-low parameter density while yielding proportional communication benefits. Moreover, given that different clients may have different resource budgets, we present \\textit{hetero-FLASH} where clients can take different density budgets based on their device resource limitations instead of supporting only one target parameter density. Experimental analysis on diverse models and datasets shows the superiority of FLASH in closing the gap with an unpruned baseline while yielding up to $\\mathord{\\sim}10.1\\%$ improved accuracy with $\\mathord{\\sim}10.26\\times$ fewer communication, compared to existing alternatives, at similar hyperparameter settings",

However, it has already been pointed out empirically that linear models on many tasks can outperform graph auto-encoders. In our work, we prove that the solution space induced by graph auto-encoders is a subset of the solution space of a linear map. This demonstrates that linear embedding models have at least the representational power of graph auto-encoders based on graph convolutional networks. So why are we still using nonlinear graph auto-encoders? One reason could be that actively restricting the linear solution space might introduce an inductive bias that helps improve learning and generalization. While many researchers believe that the nonlinearity of the encoder is the critical ingredient towards this end, we instead identify the node features of the graph as a more powerful inductive bias. We give theoretical insights by introducing a corresponding bias in a linear model and analyzing the change in the solution space. Our experiments are aligned with other empirical work on this question and show that the linear encoder can outperform the nonlinear encoder when using feature information",

The goal is to specify DNN width, depth, and the number of training samples needed to guarantee a certain testing error. Under mild assumptions on data distributions or operator structures, our analysis shows that deep operator learning can have a relaxed dependence on the discretization resolution of PDEs and, hence, lessen the curse of dimensionality in many PDE-related problems including elliptic equations, parabolic equations, and Burgers equations.

    "abstract": "In learning tasks with label noise, improving model robustness against overfitting is a pivotal challenge because the model eventually memorizes labels, including the noisy ones. Identifying the samples with noisy labels and preventing the model from learning them is a promising approach to address this challenge. When training with noisy labels, the per-class confidence scores of the model, represented by the class probabilities, can be reliable criteria for assessing whether the input label is the true label or the corrupted one. In this work, we exploit this observation and propose a novel discriminator metric called confidence error and a sieving strategy called CONFES to differentiate between the clean and noisy samples effectively. We provide theoretical guarantees on the probability of error for our proposed metric. Then, we experimentally illustrate the superior performance of our proposed approach compared to recent studies on various settings, such as synthetic and real-world label noise. Moreover, we show CONFES can be combined with other state-of-the-art approaches, such as Co-teaching and DivideMix to further improve model performance",

Within medical imaging, accurate regression models have the potential to automate various tasks, helping to lower costs and improve patient outcomes. Such safety-critical deployment does however require reliable estimation of model uncertainty, also under the wide variety of distribution shifts that might be encountered in practice. Motivated by this, we set out to investigate the reliability of regression uncertainty estimation methods under various real-world distribution shifts. To that end, we propose an extensive benchmark of 8 image-based regression datasets with different types of challenging distribution shifts. We then employ our benchmark to evaluate many of the most common uncertainty estimation methods, as well as two state-of-the-art uncertainty scores from the task of out-of-distribution detection. We find that while methods are well calibrated when there is no distribution shift, they all become highly overconfident on many of the benchmark datasets. This uncovers important limitations of current uncertainty estimation methods, and the proposed benchmark therefore serves as a challenge to the research community. We hope that our benchmark will spur more work on how to develop truly reliable regression uncertainty estimation methods",

    "abstract": "Graph classification has gained growing attention in the graph machine learning community and a variety of semi-supervised methods have been developed to reduce the high cost of annotation. They usually combine graph neural networks (GNNs) and extensive semi-supervised techniques such as knowledge distillation. However, they adhere to the close-set assumption that unlabeled graphs all belong to known classes, limiting their applications in the real world. This paper goes further, investigating a practical problem of semi-supervised open-world graph classification where these unlabeled graph data could come from unseen classes. A novel approach named Rationale-Informed GNN (RIGNN) is proposed, which takes a rationale view to detect components containing the most information related to the label space and classify unlabeled graphs into a known class or an unseen class. In particular, RIGNN contains a relational detector and a feature extractor to produce effective rationale features, which maximize the mutual information with label information and exhibit sufficient disentanglement with non-rationale elements. Furthermore, we construct a graph-of-graph based on geometrical relationships, which gives instructions on enhancing rationale representations. In virtue of effective rationale representations, we can provide accurate and balanced predictions for unlabeled graphs. An extension is also made to accomplish effective open-set graph classification. We verify our proposed methods on four benchmark datasets in various settings and experimental results reveal the effectiveness of our proposed RIGNN compared with state-of-the-art methods",

In a similar vein, distillation of expert behavior can lead to poor results when given sub-optimal experts. We compare several common approaches for skill transfer on multiple domains including changes in task and system dynamics. We identify how existing methods fail and introduce an alternative approach to mitigate these problems. Our approach learns to sequence temporally-extended skills for exploration but learns the final policy directly from the raw experience.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The effectiveness of many existing techniques for removing backdoors from machine learning models relies on access to clean in-distribution data. However, given that these models are often trained on proprietary datasets, it may not be practical to assume that in-distribution samples will always be available. On the other hand, model inversion techniques, which are typically viewed as privacy threats, can reconstruct realistic training samples from a given model, potentially eliminating the need for in-distribution data. To date, the only prior attempt to integrate backdoor removal and model inversion involves a simple combination that produced very limited results. This work represents a first step toward a more thorough understanding of how model inversion techniques could be leveraged for effective backdoor removal. Specifically, we seek to answer several key questions: What properties must reconstructed samples possess to enable successful defense? Is perceptual similarity to clean samples enough, or are additional characteristics necessary? Is it possible for reconstructed samples to contain backdoor triggers? We demonstrate that relying solely on perceptual similarity is insufficient for effective defenses. The stability of model predictions in response to input and parameter perturbations also plays a critical role. To address this, we propose a new bi-level optimization based framework for model inversion that promotes stability in addition to visual quality. Interestingly, we also find that reconstructed samples from a pre-trained generator's latent space do not contain backdoors, even when signals from a backdoored model are utilized for reconstruction. We provide a theoretical analysis to explain this observation. Our evaluation shows that our stabilized model inversion technique achieves state-of-the-art backdoor removal performance without requiring access to clean in-distribution data. Furthermore, its performance is on par with or even better than using the same amount of clean samples",

Recently, several studies have addressed this issue and proposed methods with momentum that are more robust to data heterogeneity than DSGDm, although their convergence rates remain dependent on data heterogeneity and deteriorate when the data distributions are heterogeneous. In this study, we propose Momentum Tracking, which is a method with momentum whose convergence rate is proven to be independent of data heterogeneity. More specifically, we analyze the convergence rate of Momentum Tracking in the setting where the objective function is non-convex and the stochastic gradient is used. Then, we identify that it is independent of data heterogeneity for any momentum coefficient $\\beta \\in [0, 1)$. Through experiments, we demonstrate that Momentum Tracking is more robust to data heterogeneity than the existing decentralized learning methods with momentum and can consistently outperform these existing methods when the data distributions are heterogeneous",

    "title": "RIFLE: Imputation and Robust Inference from Low Order Marginals",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The ubiquity of missing values in real-world datasets poses a challenge for statistical inference and can prevent similar datasets from being analyzed in the same study, precluding many existing datasets from being used for new analyses. While an extensive collection of packages and algorithms have been developed for data imputation, the overwhelming majority perform poorly if there are many missing values and low sample sizes, which are unfortunately common characteristics in empirical data. Such low-accuracy estimations adversely affect the performance of downstream statistical models. We develop a statistical inference framework for predicting the target variable in the presence of missing data without imputation. Our framework, RIFLE (Robust InFerence via Low-order moment Estimations), estimates low-order moments of the underlying data distribution with corresponding confidence intervals to learn a distributionally robust model. We specialize our framework to linear regression and normal discriminant analysis, and we provide convergence and performance guarantees. This framework can also be adapted to impute missing data. We compare RIFLE with state-of-the-art approaches (including MICE, Amelia, MissForest, KNN-imputer, MIDA, and Mean Imputer) in numerical experiments. Our experiments demonstrate that RIFLE outperforms other benchmark algorithms when the percentage of missing values is high and/or when the number of data points is relatively small. RIFLE is publicly available",

    "title": "Offline Reinforcement Learning with Mixture of Deterministic Policies",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Offline reinforcement learning (RL) has recently attracted considerable attention as an approach for utilizing past experiences to learn a policy. Recent studies have reported the challenges of offline RL, such as estimating the values of actions that are outside the data distribution. To mitigate offline RL issues, we propose an algorithm that leverages a mixture of deterministic policies. When the data distribution is multimodal, fitting a policy modeled with a unimodal distribution, such as Gaussian distribution, may lead to interpolation between separate modes, thereby resulting in the value estimation of actions that are outside the data distribution. In our framework, the state-action space is divided by learning discrete latent variables, and the sub-policies corresponding to each region are trained. The proposed algorithm was derived by considering the variational lower bound of the offline RL objective function. We show empirically that the use of the proposed mixture policy can reduce the accumulation of the critic loss in offline RL, which was reported in previous studies. Experimental results also indicate that using a mixture of deterministic policies in offline RL improves the performance with the D4RL benchmarking datasets",

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is a machine learning paradigm to distributively learn machine learning models from decentralized data that remains on-device. Despite the success of standard Federated optimization methods, such as Federated Averaging (FedAvg) in FL, the energy demands and hardware induced constraints for on-device learning have not been considered sufficiently in the literature. Specifically, an essential demand for on-device learning is to enable trained models to be quantized to various bit-widths based on the energy needs and heterogeneous hardware designs across the federation. In this work, we introduce multiple variants of federated averaging algorithm that train neural networks robust to quantization. Such networks can be quantized to various bit-widths with only limited reduction in full precision model accuracy. We perform extensive experiments on standard FL benchmarks to evaluate our proposed FedAvg variants for quantization robustness and provide a convergence analysis for our Quantization-Aware variants in FL. Our results demonstrate that integrating quantization robustness results in FL models that are significantly more robust to different bit-widths during quantized on-device inference",

In this work we design algorithms for selecting cohorts that not only preserve fairness, but also maximize the utility of the selected cohort under two notions of utility that we introduce and motivate. We give optimal (or approximately optimal) polynomial-time algorithms for this problem in both an offline setting, and an online setting where candidates arrive one at a time and are classified as they arrive",

Like graph neural networks, CRaWl layers update node features on a graph and thus can freely be combined or interleaved with GNN layers. Yet CRaWl operates fundamentally different from message passing graph neural networks. CRaWl layers extract and aggregate information on subgraphs appearing along random walks through a graph using 1D Convolutions. Thereby it detects long range interactions and computes non-local features. As the theoretical basis for our approach, we prove a theorem stating that the expressiveness of CRaWl is incomparable with that of the Weisfeiler Leman algorithm and hence with graph neural networks. That is, there are functions expressible by CRaWl, but not by GNNs and vice versa. This result extends to higher levels of the Weisfeiler Leman hierarchy and thus to higher-order GNNs. Empirically, we show that CRaWl matches state-of-the-art GNN architectures across a multitude of benchmark datasets for classification and regression on graphs",

    "title": "Global Contrastive Learning for Long-Tailed Classification",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We consider the long-tailed classification problem in which a few classes in the training data dominate the majority of the other classes. For concreteness, we focus on the visual domain in this paper. Most current methods employ contrastive learning to learn a representation for long-tailed data. In this paper, first, we investigate $k$-positive sampling, a popular baseline method widely used to build contrastive learning models for imbalanced data. Previous works show that $k$-positive learning, which only chooses $k$ positive samples (instead of all positive images) for each query image, suffers from inferior performance in long-tailed data. In this work, we further point out that k-positive learning limits the learning capability of both head and tail classes. Based on this perspective, we propose a novel contrastive learning framework that improves the limitation in k-positive learning by enlarging its positive selection space, so it can help the model learn more semantic discrimination features. Second, we analyze how the temperature (the hyperparameter used for tuning a concentration of samples on feature space) affects the gradients of each class in long-tailed learning, and propose a new method that can mitigate inadequate gradients between classes, which can help model learning easier. We name this framework as CoGloAT. Finally, we go on to introduce a new prototype learning framework namely ProCo based on coreset selection, which creates a global prototype for each cluster while keeping the computation cost within a reasonable time and show that combining CoGloAT with ProCo can further enhance the model learning ability on long-tailed data",

    "abstract": "We address the question of binary classification when no labels are available and the input features are categorical. The lack of labels means supervised approaches can't be used, and the lack of a natural distance measure means that most unsupervised methods do poorly. For such problems, where the alternatives might be a) do nothing or b) heuristic rules-based approaches, we offer a third alternative: a classifier that approximates Naive Bayes. Our primary scenarios are those that involve distinguishing scripted, or bot, web traffic from that of legitimate users. Our main assumption is the existence of some attribute $x_*$ more prevalent in the benign than the scripted traffic; i.e., $P(x_*|\\overline{\\mbox{bot}}) = K \\cdot P(x_*|\\mbox{bot}),$ for $K>1.$ We show that any such disparity yields a lower bound on $P(\\mbox{bot}|x_{j})$ even when we have no prior estimates of $P(x_*|\\overline{\\mbox{bot}}),$ $P(x_*|\\mbox{bot})$ or $K$ (except that $K>1$). We show that when at least one bin of at least one feature receives no attack traffic then we under-estimate the actual conditional probability by a factor of $1-1/K.$ Thus, any attribute with a large disparity between prevalence in benign and abuse traffic (i.e., $K$ is large), allows good approximation of the Naive Bayes classifier without the benefit of labels. The approach is particularly suited to problems where $K$ is high and thus the approximation is very accurate. Example problems (and relevant attributes) might be: password-guessing, if login attempts from legitimate users succeed at a much higher rate than those from password-guessing attackers; Credit Card Verification Value (CVV) guessing, if an attacker exhaustively tries all possible 3 or 4-digit values and fails at a higher rate than legitimate users; account registration, if legitimate users use email addresses from services that do not allow fee anonymous accounts (e.g., {\\tt .edu}) at a much higher rate than attackers; click-fraud if legitimate users visit pages and services that contain no ads at a higher rate than click-fraud bots",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Feedforward neural networks with homogeneous activation functions possess an internal symmetry: the functions they compute do not change when the incoming and outgoing weights at any hidden unit are rescaled by reciprocal positive values. This paper makes two contributions to our understanding of these networks. The first is to describe a simple procedure, or {\\it fix}, for balancing the weights in these networks: this procedure computes multiplicative rescaling factors---one at each hidden unit---that rebalance the weights of these networks without changing the end-to-end functions that they compute. Specifically, given an initial network with arbitrary weights, the procedure determines the functionally equivalent network whose weight matrix is of minimal $\\ell_{p,q}$-norm; the weights at each hidden unit are said to be balanced when this norm is stationary with respect to rescaling transformations. The optimal rescaling factors are computed in an iterative fashion via simple multiplicative updates, and the updates are notable in that (a) they do not require the tuning of learning rates, (b) they operate in parallel on the rescaling factors at all hidden units, and (c) they converge monotonically to a global minimizer of the $\\ell_{p,q}$-norm. The paper's second contribution is to analyze the optimization landscape for learning in these networks. We suppose that the network's loss function consists of two terms---one that is invariant to rescaling transformations, measuring predictive accuracy, and another (a regularizer) that breaks this invariance, penalizing large weights. We show how to derive a weight-balancing {\\it flow} such that the regularizer remains minimal with respect to rescaling transformations as the weights descend in the loss function. These dynamics reduce to an ordinary gradient flow for $\\ell_2$-norm regularization, but not otherwise. In this way our analysis suggests a canonical pairing of alternative flows and regularizers",

    "abstract": "Mixup is a popular regularization technique for training deep neural networks that improves generalization and increases robustness to certain distribution shifts. It perturbs input training data in the direction of other randomly-chosen instances in the training set. To better leverage the structure of the data, we extend mixup in a simple, broadly applicable way to $k$-mixup, which perturbs $k$-batches of training points in the direction of other $k$-batches. The perturbation is done with displacement interpolation, i.e. interpolation under the Wasserstein metric. We demonstrate theoretically and in simulations that $k$-mixup preserves cluster and manifold structures, and we extend theory studying the efficacy of standard mixup to the $k$-mixup case. Our empirical results show that training with $k$-mixup further improves generalization and robustness across several network architectures and benchmark datasets of differing modalities. For the wide variety of real datasets considered, the performance gains of $k$-mixup over standard mixup are similar to or larger than the gains of mixup itself over standard ERM after hyperparameter optimization. In several instances, in fact, $k$-mixup achieves gains in settings where standard mixup has negligible to zero improvement over ERM",

    "abstract": "The automated analysis of medical time series, such as the electrocardiogram (ECG), electroencephalogram (EEG), pulse oximetry, etc, has the potential to serve as a valuable tool for diagnostic decisions, allowing for remote monitoring of patients and more efficient use of expensive and time-consuming medical procedures. Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been demonstrated to process such signals effectively. However, previous research has primarily focused on classifying medical time series rather than attempting to regress the continuous-valued physiological parameters central to diagnosis. One significant challenge in this regard is the imbalanced nature of the dataset, as a low prevalence of abnormal conditions can lead to heavily skewed data that results in inaccurate predictions and a lack of certainty in such predictions when deployed. To address these challenges, we propose HypUC, a framework for imbalanced probabilistic regression in medical time series, making several contributions. (i) We introduce a simple kernel density-based technique to tackle the imbalanced regression problem with medical time series. (ii) Moreover, we employ a probabilistic regression framework that allows uncertainty estimation for the predicted continuous values. (iii) We also present a new approach to calibrate the predicted uncertainty further. (iv) Finally, we demonstrate a technique to use calibrated uncertainty estimates to improve the predicted continuous value and show the efficacy of the calibrated uncertainty estimates to flag unreliable predictions. HypUC is evaluated on a large, diverse, real-world dataset of ECGs collected from millions of patients, outperforming several conventional baselines on various diagnostic tasks, suggesting potential use-case for the reliable clinical deployment of deep learning models and a prospective clinical trial. Consequently, a hyperkalemia diagnosis algorithm based on HypUC is going to be the subject of a real-world clinical prospective study",

To capture this complexity, high capacity architectures like recurrent- or attention-based sequential deep learning models have become popular.

Extending them, in this paper, we investigate the capabilities of linear models for time-series forecasting and present Time-Series Mixer (TSMixer), a novel architecture designed by stacking multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). TSMixer is based on mixing operations along both the time and feature dimensions to extract information efficiently. On popular academic benchmarks, the simple-to-implement TSMixer is comparable to specialized state-of-the-art models that leverage the inductive biases of specific benchmarks. On the challenging and large scale M5 benchmark, a real-world retail dataset, TSMixer demonstrates superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art alternatives. Our results underline the importance of efficiently utilizing cross-variate and auxiliary information for improving the performance of time series forecasting.

Transfer learning has the potential to bridge the gap between related yet different domains. For medical applications, however, it remains unclear whether it is more beneficial to pre-train on natural or medical images. We aim to shed light on this problem by comparing initialization on ImageNet and RadImageNet on seven medical classification tasks. Our work includes a replication study, which yields results contrary to previously published findings. In our experiments, ResNet50 models pre-trained on ImageNet tend to outperform those trained on RadImageNet. To gain further insights, we investigate the learned representations using Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and compare the predictions of the different models. Our results indicate that, contrary to intuition, ImageNet and RadImageNet may converge to distinct intermediate representations, which appear to diverge further during fine-tuning. Despite these distinct representations, the predictions of the models remain similar. Our findings show that the similarity between networks before and after fine-tuning does not correlate with performance gains, suggesting that the advantages of transfer learning might not solely originate from the reuse of features in the early layers of a convolutional neural network",

To evaluate human-LM interaction, we develop a new framework, Human-AI Language-based Interaction Evaluation (HALIE), that defines the components of interactive systems and dimensions to consider when designing evaluation metrics. Compared to standard, non-interactive evaluation, HALIE captures (i) the interactive process, not only the final output; (ii) the first-person subjective experience, not just a third-party assessment; and (iii) notions of preference beyond quality (e.g., enjoyment and ownership). We then design five tasks to cover different forms of interaction: social dialogue, question answering, crossword puzzles, summarization, and metaphor generation. With four state-of-the-art LMs (three variants of OpenAI's GPT-3 and AI21 Labs' Jurassic-1), we find that better non-interactive performance does not always translate to better human-LM interaction. In particular, we highlight three cases where the results from non-interactive and interactive metrics diverge and underscore the importance of human-LM interaction for LM evaluation",

In a recent paper it was shown that disease progression can be predicted effectively using performance outcome measures and demographic data. In our work we build on this to investigate the modeling side, using continuous time models to predict progression. We benchmark four continuous time models using a publicly available multiple sclerosis dataset. We find that the best continuous model is often able to outperform the best benchmarked discrete time model.

    "title": "On the special role of class-selective neurons in early training",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "It is commonly observed that deep networks trained for classification exhibit class-selective neurons in their early and intermediate layers. Intriguingly, recent studies have shown that these class-selective neurons can be ablated without deteriorating network function. But if class-selective neurons are not necessary, why do they exist? We attempt to answer this question in a series of experiments on ResNet-50s trained on ImageNet. We first show that class-selective neurons emerge during the first few epochs of training, before receding rapidly but not completely; this suggests that class-selective neurons found in trained networks are in fact vestigial remains of early training. With single-neuron ablation experiments, we then show that class-selective neurons are important for network function in this early phase of training. We also observe that the network is close to a linear regime in this early phase; we thus speculate that class-selective neurons appear early in training as quasi-linear shortcut solutions to the classification task. Finally, in causal experiments where we regularize against class selectivity at different points in training, we show that the presence of class-selective neurons early in training is critical to the successful training of the network; in contrast, class-selective neurons can be suppressed later in training with little effect on final accuracy. It remains to be understood by which mechanism the presence of class-selective neurons in the early phase of training contributes to the successful training of networks",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Solving complex classification tasks using deep neural networks typically requires large amounts of annotated data. However, corresponding class labels are noisy when provided by error-prone annotators, e.g., crowdworkers. Training standard deep neural networks leads to subpar performances in such multi-annotator supervised learning settings. We address this issue by presenting a probabilistic training framework named multi-annotator deep learning (MaDL). A downstream ground truth and an annotator performance model are jointly trained in an end-to-end learning approach. The ground truth model learns to predict instances' true class labels, while the annotator performance model infers probabilistic estimates of annotators' performances. A modular network architecture enables us to make varying assumptions regarding annotators' performances, e.g., an optional class or instance dependency. Further, we learn annotator embeddings to estimate annotators' densities within a latent space as proxies of their potentially correlated annotations. Together with a weighted loss function, we improve the learning from correlated annotation patterns. In a comprehensive evaluation, we examine three research questions about multi-annotator supervised learning. Our findings show MaDL's state-of-the-art performance and robustness against many correlated, spamming annotators",

    "abstract": "Fast gradient-based optimization algorithms have become increasingly essential for the computationally efficient training of machine learning models. One technique is to multiply the gradient by a preconditioner matrix to produce a step, but it is unclear what the best preconditioner matrix is. This paper introduces a novel machine learning optimizer called LODO, which tries to online meta-learn the best preconditioner during optimization. Specifically, our optimizer merges Learning to Optimize (L2O) techniques with quasi-Newton methods to learn preconditioners parameterized as neural networks; they are more flexible than preconditioners in other quasi-Newton methods. Unlike other L2O methods, LODO does not require any meta-training on a training task distribution, and instead learns to optimize on the fly while optimizing on the test task, adapting to the local characteristics of the loss landscape while traversing it. Theoretically, we show that our optimizer approximates the inverse Hessian in noisy loss landscapes and is capable of representing a wide range of inverse Hessians. We experimentally verify that our algorithm can optimize in noisy settings, and show that simpler alternatives for representing the inverse Hessians worsen performance. Lastly, we use our optimizer to train a semi-realistic deep neural network with 95k parameters at speeds comparable to those of standard neural network optimizers",

We consider a general class of Markovian stepsizes for learning, which contain i.i.d. random stepsize, cyclic stepsize as well as the constant stepsize as special cases, and motivated by the literature which shows that heaviness of the tails (measured by the so-called ``tail-index\") in the SGD iterates is correlated with generalization, we study tail-index and provide a number of theoretical results that demonstrate how the tail-index varies on the stepsize scheduling. Our results bring a new understanding of the benefits of cyclic and randomized stepsizes compared to constant stepsize in terms of the tail behavior. We illustrate our theory on linear regression experiments and show through deep learning experiments that Markovian stepsizes can achieve even a heavier tail and be a viable alternative to cyclic and i.i.d. randomized stepsize rules",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Bootstrapping is behind much of the successes of deep Reinforcement Learning. However, learning the value function via bootstrapping often leads to unstable training due to fast-changing target values. Target Networks are employed to stabilize training by using an additional set of lagging parameters to estimate the target values. Despite the popularity of Target Networks, their effect on the optimization is still misunderstood. In this work, we show that they act as an implicit regularizer which can be beneficial in some cases, but also have disadvantages such as being inflexible and can result in instabilities, even when vanilla TD(0) converges. To overcome these issues, we propose an explicit Functional Regularization alternative that is flexible and a convex regularizer in function space and we theoretically study its convergence. We conducted an experimental study across a range of environments, discount factors, and off-policiness data collections to investigate the effectiveness of the regularization induced by Target Networks and Functional Regularization in terms of performance, accuracy, and stability. Our findings emphasize that Functional Regularization can be used as a drop-in replacement for Target Networks and result in performance improvement. Furthermore, adjusting both the regularization weight and the network update period in Functional Regularization can result in further performance improvements compared to solely adjusting the network update period as typically done with Target Networks. Our approach also enhances the ability to networks to recover accurate $Q$-values",

It is crucial for many applications, in particular for fashion or retail industries, to make optimal inventory decisions and avoid massive wastes. By tracking thousands of fashion trends on social media with state-of-the-art computer vision approaches, we propose a new model for fashion time series forecasting. Our contribution is twofold. We first provide publicly a dataset gathering 10000 weekly fashion time series. As influence dynamics are the key of emerging trend detection, we associate with each time series an external weak signal representing behaviours of influencers. Secondly, to leverage such a dataset, we propose a new hybrid forecasting mode. Our approach combines per-time-series parametric models with seasonal components and a global recurrent neural network to include sporadic external signals. This hybrid model provides state-of-the-art results on the proposed fashion dataset, on the weekly time series of the M4 competition, and illustrates the benefit of the contribution of external weak signals",

    "title": "Detecting incidental correlation in multimodal learning via latent variable modeling",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Multimodal neural networks often fail to utilize all modalities. They subsequently generalize worse than their unimodal counterparts, or make predictions that only depend on a subset of modalities. We refer to this problem as \\emph{modality underutilization}. Existing work has addressed this issue by ensuring that there are no systematic biases in dataset creation, or that our neural network architectures and optimization algorithms are capable of learning modality interactions. We demonstrate that even when these favorable conditions are met, modality underutilization can still occur in the small data regime. To explain this phenomenon, we put forth a concept that we call \\emph{incidental correlation}. It is a spurious correlation that emerges in small datasets, despite not being a part of the underlying data generating process (DGP). We develop our argument using a DGP under which multimodal neural networks must utilize all modalities, since all paths between the inputs and target are causal. This represents an idealized scenario that often fails to materialize. Instead, due to incidental correlation, small datasets sampled from this DGP have higher likelihood under an alternative DGP with spurious paths between the inputs and target. Multimodal neural networks that use these spurious paths for prediction fail to utilize all modalities. Given its harmful effects, we propose to detect incidental correlation via latent variable modeling. We specify an identifiable variational autoencoder such that the latent posterior encodes the spurious correlations between the inputs and target. This allows us to interpret the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the latent posterior and prior as the severity of incidental correlation. We use an ablation study to show that identifiability is important in this context, since we derive our conclusions from the latent posterior. Using experiments with synthetic data, as well as with VQA v2.0 and NLVR2, we demonstrate that incidental correlation emerges in the small data regime, and leads to modality underutilization. Practitioners of multimodal learning can use our method to detect whether incidental correlation is present in their datasets, and determine whether they should collect additional data",

Sketching, which consists in looking for solutions among a subspace of reduced dimension, is a well-studied approach to alleviate these computational burdens. However, statistically-accurate sketches, such as the Gaussian one, usually contain few null entries, such that their application to kernel methods and their non-sparse Gram matrices remains slow in practice. In this paper, we show that sparsified Gaussian (and Rademacher) sketches still produce theoretically-valid approximations while allowing for important time and space savings thanks to an efficient \\emph{decomposition trick}. To support our method, we derive excess risk bounds for both single and multiple output kernel problems, with generic Lipschitz losses, hereby providing new guarantees for a wide range of applications, from robust regression to multiple quantile regression.

    "abstract": "Existing graph contrastive learning (GCL) techniques typically require two forward passes for a single instance to construct the contrastive loss, which is effective for capturing the low-frequency signals of node features. Such a dual-pass design has shown empirical success on homophilic graphs, but its effectiveness on heterophilic graphs, where directly connected nodes typically have different labels, is unknown. In addition, existing GCL approaches fail to provide strong performance guarantees. Coupled with the unpredictability of GCL approaches on heterophilic graphs, their applicability in real-world contexts is limited. Then, a natural question arises: Can we design a GCL method that works for both homophilic and heterophilic graphs with a performance guarantee? To answer this question, we theoretically study the concentration property of features obtained by neighborhood aggregation on homophilic and heterophilic graphs, introduce the single-pass graph contrastive learning loss based on the property, and provide performance guarantees for the minimizer of the loss on downstream tasks. As a direct consequence of our analysis, we implement the Single-Pass Graph Contrastive Learning method (SP-GCL). Empirically, on 14 benchmark datasets with varying degrees of homophily, the features learned by the SP-GCL can match or outperform existing strong baselines with significantly less computational overhead, which demonstrates the usefulness of our findings in real-world cases",

In this paper, we propose an alternative way to speed up the training of neural ODEs. The key idea is to speed up the adjoint method by using Gauß-Legendre quadrature to solve integrals faster than ODE-based methods while remaining memory efficient.

Cascades of pretrained models with conditional execution address these requirements based on the intuition that some inputs are easy enough that they can be processed correctly by a smaller model allowing for an early exit. If the smaller model is not sufficiently confident in its prediction, the input is passed on to a larger model. The selection of the confidence threshold allows to trade off computational cost against accuracy. In this work we explore the effective design of model cascades, thoroughly evaluate the impact on the accuracy-efficiency trade-off, and provide a reproducible state-of-the-art baseline that is currently missing for related research. We demonstrate that model cascades dominate the ImageNet Pareto front already with 2-model cascades, achieving an average reduction in compute effort at equal accuracy of almost 3.1x above 86% and more than 1.9x between 80% and 86% top-1 accuracy, while 3-model cascades achieve 4.4x above 87% accuracy.

    "abstract": "Mathematical notation makes up a large portion of STEM literature, yet finding semantic representations for formulae remains a challenging problem. Because mathematical notation is precise, and its meaning changes significantly with small character shifts, the methods that work for natural text do not necessarily work well for mathematical expressions. This work describes an approach for representing mathematical expressions in a continuous vector space. We use the encoder of a sequence-to-sequence architecture, trained on visually different but mathematically equivalent expressions, to generate vector representations (or embeddings). We compare this approach with a structural approach that considers visual layout to embed an expression and show that our proposed approach is better at capturing mathematical semantics. Finally, to expedite future research, we publish a corpus of equivalent transcendental and algebraic expression pairs",

    "title": "Representations and Computations in Transformers that Support Generalization on Structured Tasks",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Transformers have shown remarkable success in natural language processing and computer vision, serving as the foundation of large language and multimodal models. These networks can capture nuanced context sensitivity across high-dimensional language tokens or image pixels, but it remains unclear how highly structured behavior and systematic generalization can arise in these systems. Here, we explore the solution process a causal transformer discovers as it learns to solve a set of algorithmic tasks involving copying, sorting, and hierarchical compositions of these operations. We search for the minimal layer and head configuration sufficient to solve these tasks and unpack the roles of the attention heads, as well as how token representations are reweighted across layers to complement these roles. Our results provide new insights into how attention layers in transformers support structured computation within and across tasks: 1) Replacing fixed position labels with labels sampled from a larger set enables strong length generalization and faster learning. The learnable embeddings of these labels develop different representations, capturing sequence order if necessary, depending on task demand. 2) Two-layer transformers can learn reliable solutions to the multi-level problems we explore. The first layer tends to transform the input representation to allow the second layer to share computation across repeated components within a task or across related tasks. 3) We introduce an analysis pipeline that quantifies how the representation space in a given layer prioritizes different aspects of each item. We show that these representations prioritize information needed to guide attention relative to information that only requires downstream readout",
