    "title": "An Analysis of Model-Based Reinforcement Learning From Abstracted Observations",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Many methods for Model-based Reinforcement learning (MBRL) in Markov decision processes (MDPs) provide guarantees for both the accuracy of the model they can deliver and the learning efficiency. At the same time, state abstraction techniques allow for a reduction of the size of an MDP while maintaining a bounded loss with respect to the original problem. Therefore, it may come as a surprise that no such guarantees are available when combining both techniques, i.e., where MBRL merely observes abstract states. Our theoretical analysis shows that abstraction can introduce a dependence between samples collected online (e.g., in the real world). That means that, without taking this dependence into account, results for MBRL do not directly extend to this setting. Our result shows that we can use concentration inequalities for martingales to overcome this problem. This result makes it possible to extend the guarantees of existing MBRL algorithms to the setting with abstraction. We illustrate this by combining R-MAX, a prototypical MBRL algorithm, with abstraction, thus producing the first performance guarantees for model-based â€˜RL from Abstracted Observations': model-based reinforcement learning with an abstract model",

    "abstract": "Feature preprocessing continues to play a critical role when applying machine learning and statistical methods to tabular data. In this paper, we propose the use of the kernel density integral transformation as a feature preprocessing step. Our approach subsumes the two leading feature preprocessing methods as limiting cases: linear min-max scaling and quantile transformation. We demonstrate that, without hyperparameter tuning, the kernel density integral transformation can be used as a simple drop-in replacement for either method, offering robustness to the weaknesses of each. Alternatively, with tuning of a single continuous hyperparameter, we frequently outperform both of these methods. Finally, we show that the kernel density transformation can be profitably applied to statistical data analysis, particularly in correlation analysis and univariate clustering",

    "title": "Overcoming Resource Constraints in Federated Learning: Large Models Can Be Trained with only Weak Clients",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is emerging as a popular, promising decentralized learning framework that enables collaborative training among clients, with no need to share private data between them or to a centralized server. However, considering many edge clients do not have sufficient computing, memory, or communication capabilities, federated learning of large models still faces significant bottlenecks. To keep such weak but crucial clients in the loop, prior works either consider a heterogeneous-client setting where clients train models with different sizes; or offload training to the server. However, the heterogeneous-client setting requires some clients to train full model, which is not aligned with the resource-constrained setting; while the latter ones break privacy promises in FL when sharing intermediate representations or labels with the server. To overcome these limitations, in this work, we formulate a realistic, but much less explored, cross-device FL setting in which no client can train a full large model nor is willing to share any intermediate information with the remote server. Under such a formulation, we develop a principal sub-model (PriSM) training methodology to collaboratively train a full large model, while assigning each client a small sub-model that is a probabilistic low-rank approximation to the full server model. When creating sub-models, PriSM first performs a principal kernel analysis in the orthogonal kernel space to obtain importance of each kernel. Then, PriSM adopts a novel importance-aware sampling process to select a subset of kernels (i.e., a kernel with high importance is assigned with a higher sampling probability). This sampling process ensures each sub-model is still a low-rank approximation to the full model, while all sub-models together achieve nearly full coverage on the principal kernels. To further improve memory efficiency while still preserving accuracy, PriSM also exploits low-rank structure in intermediate representations and allows each sub-model to learn only a subset of them. Our evaluations on various datasets and models (CNNs, LSTMs, Transformers) under different resource-constrained settings demonstrate that PriSM yields an accuracy improvement of up to $10\\%$ compared to existing works. More importantly, PriSM does not incur significant accuracy degradation compared to full-model training (e.g., only $\\sim 2\\%$ accuracy drops for ResNet-18/CIFAR-10 when clients train only $0.2\\times$ sub-models)",

While randomized smoothing typically yields robust $\\ell_2$-ball certificates, recent research has generalized provable robustness to different norm balls as well as anisotropic regions.

By performing randomized smoothing in the low-dimensional projected space, we characterize the certified region of our smoothed composite classifier back in the high-dimensional input space and prove a tractable lower bound on its volume. We show experimentally on CIFAR-10 and SVHN that classifiers without the initial projection are vulnerable to perturbations that are normal to the data manifold and yet are captured by the certified regions of our method.

Current methods for addressing this problem only consider scenarios where all examples come from the same distribution.

We study this multi-domain long-tailed learning problem and aim to produce a model that generalizes well across all classes and domains. Towards that goal, we introduce TALLY, a method that addresses this multi-domain long-tailed learning problem. Built upon a proposed selective balanced sampling strategy, TALLY achieves this by mixing the semantic representation of one example with the domain-associated nuisances of another, producing a new representation for use as data augmentation. To improve the disentanglement of semantic representations, TALLY further utilizes a domain-invariant class prototype that averages out domain-specific effects. We evaluate TALLY on several benchmarks and real-world datasets and find that it consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in both subpopulation and domain shift",

Inspired by MVP(Wei et al., 2022b) that displays impressive gains with CLIP, in this work, we also employ the semantically rich CLIP latent as target and further tap its potential by introducing a new MIM pipeline, CAE v2, to learn a high-quality encoder and facilitate model convergence on the pre-training task. CAE v2 is an improved variant of CAE (Chen et al., 2023), applying the CLIP latent on two pretraining tasks, i.e., visible latent alignment and masked latent alignment. Visible latent alignment directly mimics the visible latent representations from the encoder to the corresponding CLIP latent, which is beneficial for facilitating model convergence and improving the representative ability of the encoder. Masked latent alignment predicts the representations of masked patches within the feature space of CLIP latent as standard MIM task does, effectively aligning the representations computed from the encoder and the regressor into the same domain. We pretrain CAE v2 on ImageNet-1K images and evaluate on various downstream vision tasks, including image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection and instance segmentation. Experiments show that our CAE v2 achieves competitive performance and even outperforms the CLIP vision encoder, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.

We instantiate our mechanism for noisy gradient descent on non-convex, convex and strongly convex loss functions, respectively, to derive schedules for the noise variance and step size. These schedules account for the properties of the loss function and adapt to convergence metrics such as the gradient norm. When using these schedules, we show that noisy gradient descent converges at essentially the same rate as its noise-free counterpart. Numerical experiments show that the schedules consistently perform well across a range of datasets without manual tuning",

    "abstract": "Causal structure learning methods are vital for unveiling causal relationships embedded into observed data. However, the state of the art suffers a major limitation: it assumes that causal interactions occur only at the frequency at which data is observed. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a method that allows structural learning of linear causal relationships occurring at different time scales. Specifically, we explicitly take into account instantaneous and lagged inter-relations between multiple time series, represented at different scales, hinging on wavelet transform. We cast the problem as the learning of a multiscale causal graph having sparse structure and dagness constraints, enforcing causality through directed and acyclic topology. To solve the resulting (non-convex) formulation, we propose an algorithm termed MS-CASTLE, which exhibits consistent performance across different noise distributions and wavelet choices. We also propose a single-scale version of our algorithm, SS-CASTLE, which outperforms existing methods in computational efficiency, performance, and robustness on synthetic data. Finally, we apply the proposed approach to learn the multiscale causal structure of the risk of 15 global equity markets, during covid-19 pandemic, illustrating the importance of multiscale analysis to reveal useful interactions at different time resolutions.

    "abstract": "This paper addresses safe distributed online optimization over an unknown set of linear safety constraints. A network of agents aims at jointly minimizing a global, time-varying function, which is only partially observable to each individual agent. Therefore, agents must engage in local communications to generate a safe sequence of actions competitive with the best minimizer sequence in hindsight, and the gap between the two sequences is quantified via dynamic regret. We propose distributed safe online gradient descent (D-Safe-OGD) with an exploration phase, where all agents estimate the constraint parameters collaboratively to build estimated feasible sets, ensuring the action selection safety during the optimization phase. We prove that for convex functions, D-Safe-OGD achieves a dynamic regret bound of $O(T^{2/3} \\sqrt{\\log T} + T^{1/3}C_T^*)$, where $C_T^*$ denotes the path-length of the best minimizer sequence.

    "abstract": "Certifiably robust defenses against adversarial patches for image classifiers ensure correct prediction against any changes to a constrained neighborhood of pixels. PatchCleanser, the state-of-the-art certified defense, uses a double-masking strategy for robust classification. The success of this strategy relies heavily on the model's invariance to image pixel masking. In this paper, we take a closer look at model training schemes to improve this invariance. Instead of using Random Cutout augmentations like PatchCleanser, we introduce the notion of worst-case masking, i.e., selecting masked images which maximize classification loss. However, finding worst-case masks requires an exhaustive search, which might be prohibitively expensive to do on-the-fly during training. To solve this problem, we propose a two-round greedy masking strategy (Greedy Cutout) which finds an approximate worst-case mask location with much less compute. We show that the models trained with our Greedy Cutout improves certified robust accuracy over Random Cutout in PatchCleanser across a range of datasets and architectures. Certified robust accuracy on ImageNet with a ViT-B16-224 model increases from 58.1% to 62.3% against a 3% square patch applied anywhere on the image",

    "title": "Learning-to-defer for sequential medical decision-making under uncertainty",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Learning-to-defer is a framework to automatically defer decision-making to a human expert when ML-based decisions are deemed unreliable. Existing learning-to-defer frameworks are not designed for sequential settings. That is, they defer at every instance independently, based on immediate predictions, while ignoring the potential long-term impact of these interventions. As a result, existing frameworks are myopic. Further, they do not defer adaptively, which is crucial when human interventions are costly. In this work, we propose Sequential Learning-to-Defer (SLTD), a framework for learning-to-defer to a domain expert in sequential decision-making settings. Contrary to existing literature, we pose the problem of learning-to-defer as model-based reinforcement learning (RL) to i) account for long-term consequences of ML-based actions using RL and ii) adaptively defer based on the dynamics (model-based). Our proposed framework determines whether to defer (at each time step) by quantifying whether a deferral now will improve the value compared to delaying deferral to the next time step. To quantify the improvement, we account for potential future deferrals. As a result, we learn a pre-emptive deferral policy (i.e. a policy that defers early if using the ML-based policy could worsen long-term outcomes). Our deferral policy is adaptive to the non-stationarity in the dynamics. We demonstrate that adaptive deferral via SLTD provides an improved trade-off between long-term outcomes and deferral frequency on synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world data with non-stationary dynamics. Finally, we interpret the deferral decision by decomposing the propagated (long-term) uncertainty around the outcome, to justify the deferral decision",

However, as demonstrated in other areas of machine learning, human expertise is often not entirely accurate and tends to be outperformed in domains with abundant data. In this study, we examine whether we can enhance domain-specific causal discovery for time series using a data-driven approach. Our findings indicate that this procedure significantly outperforms human-designed, domain-agnostic causal discovery methods, such as Mutual Information, VAR-LiNGAM, and Granger Causality on the MOS 6502 microprocessor, the NetSim fMRI dataset, and the Dream3 gene dataset.

It may leverage a series of training environments to improve its policy before it is evaluated in a test environment drawn from the same environment distribution. Most existing approaches focus on fixed exploration strategies, while the few that view exploration as a meta-optimization problem tend to ignore the need for _cost-efficient_ exploration. We propose a cost-aware Bayesian optimization approach that efficiently searches over a class of dynamic subgoal-based exploration strategies. The algorithm adjusts a variety of levers --- the locations of the subgoals, the length of each episode, and the number of replications per trial --- in order to overcome the challenges of sparse rewards, expensive interactions, and noise.

This assumption implies an invariant structure in the solution space that enables knowledge transfer to unseen domains. To exploit this property for domain generalization, we introduce a modular neural network layer consisting of Gated Domain Units (GDUs) that learn a representation for each latent elementary distribution. During inference, a weighted ensemble of learning machines can be created by comparing new observations with the representations of each elementary distribution. Our flexible framework also accommodates scenarios where explicit domain information is not present.

A possible solution to this problem is to utilize off-the-shelf sparse learning algorithms at the clients to meet their resource budget. However, such naive deployment in the clients causes significant accuracy degradation, especially for highly resource-constrained clients. In particular, our investigations reveal that the lack of consensus in the sparsity masks among the clients may potentially slow down the convergence of the global model and cause a substantial accuracy drop. With these observations, we present \\textit{federated lottery aware sparsity hunting} (FLASH), a unified sparse learning framework for training a sparse sub-model that maintains the performance under ultra-low parameter density while yielding proportional communication benefits. Moreover, given that different clients may have different resource budgets, we present \\textit{hetero-FLASH} where clients can take different density budgets based on their device resource limitations instead of supporting only one target parameter density.

This demonstrates that linear embedding models have at least the representational power of graph auto-encoders based on graph convolutional networks. So why are we still using nonlinear graph auto-encoders? One reason could be that actively restricting the linear solution space might introduce an inductive bias that helps improve learning and generalization. While many researchers believe that the nonlinearity of the encoder is the critical ingredient towards this end, we instead identify the node features of the graph as a more powerful inductive bias. We give theoretical insights by introducing a corresponding bias in a linear model and analyzing the change in the solution space.

    "title": "Label Noise-Robust Learning using a Confidence-Based Sieving Strategy",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In learning tasks with label noise, improving model robustness against overfitting is a pivotal challenge because the model eventually memorizes labels, including the noisy ones. Identifying the samples with noisy labels and preventing the model from learning them is a promising approach to address this challenge. When training with noisy labels, the per-class confidence scores of the model, represented by the class probabilities, can be reliable criteria for assessing whether the input label is the true label or the corrupted one. In this work, we exploit this observation and propose a novel discriminator metric called confidence error and a sieving strategy called CONFES to differentiate between the clean and noisy samples effectively. We provide theoretical guarantees on the probability of error for our proposed metric. Then, we experimentally illustrate the superior performance of our proposed approach compared to recent studies on various settings, such as synthetic and real-world label noise. Moreover, we show CONFES can be combined with other state-of-the-art approaches, such as Co-teaching and DivideMix to further improve model performance",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Many important computer vision applications are naturally formulated as regression problems. Within medical imaging, accurate regression models have the potential to automate various tasks, helping to lower costs and improve patient outcomes. Such safety-critical deployment does however require reliable estimation of model uncertainty, also under the wide variety of distribution shifts that might be encountered in practice. Motivated by this, we set out to investigate the reliability of regression uncertainty estimation methods under various real-world distribution shifts. To that end, we propose an extensive benchmark of 8 image-based regression datasets with different types of challenging distribution shifts. We then employ our benchmark to evaluate many of the most common uncertainty estimation methods, as well as two state-of-the-art uncertainty scores from the task of out-of-distribution detection. We find that while methods are well calibrated when there is no distribution shift, they all become highly overconfident on many of the benchmark datasets. This uncovers important limitations of current uncertainty estimation methods, and the proposed benchmark therefore serves as a challenge to the research community. We hope that our benchmark will spur more work on how to develop truly reliable regression uncertainty estimation methods",

    "title": "RIGNN: A Rationale Perspective for Semi-supervised Open-world Graph Classification",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Graph classification has gained growing attention in the graph machine learning community and a variety of semi-supervised methods have been developed to reduce the high cost of annotation. They usually combine graph neural networks (GNNs) and extensive semi-supervised techniques such as knowledge distillation. However, they adhere to the close-set assumption that unlabeled graphs all belong to known classes, limiting their applications in the real world. This paper goes further, investigating a practical problem of semi-supervised open-world graph classification where these unlabeled graph data could come from unseen classes. A novel approach named Rationale-Informed GNN (RIGNN) is proposed, which takes a rationale view to detect components containing the most information related to the label space and classify unlabeled graphs into a known class or an unseen class. In particular, RIGNN contains a relational detector and a feature extractor to produce effective rationale features, which maximize the mutual information with label information and exhibit sufficient disentanglement with non-rationale elements. Furthermore, we construct a graph-of-graph based on geometrical relationships, which gives instructions on enhancing rationale representations. In virtue of effective rationale representations, we can provide accurate and balanced predictions for unlabeled graphs. An extension is also made to accomplish effective open-set graph classification. We verify our proposed methods on four benchmark datasets in various settings and experimental results reveal the effectiveness of our proposed RIGNN compared with state-of-the-art methods",

Skill reuse is one of the most common approaches, but current methods have considerable limitations. For example, fine-tuning an existing policy frequently fails, as the policy can degrade rapidly early in training. In a similar vein, distillation of expert behavior can lead to poor results when given sub-optimal experts. We compare several common approaches for skill transfer on multiple domains including changes in task and system dynamics. We identify how existing methods fail and introduce an alternative approach to mitigate these problems. Our approach learns to sequence temporally-extended skills for exploration but learns the final policy directly from the raw experience. This conceptual split enables rapid adaptation and thus efficient data collection but without constraining the final solution. It significantly outperforms many classical methods across a suite of evaluation tasks and we use a broad set of ablations to highlight the importance of different components of our method",

    "title": "Turning a Curse into a Blessing: Enabling In-Distribution-Data-Free Backdoor Removal via Stabilized Model Inversion",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The effectiveness of many existing techniques for removing backdoors from machine learning models relies on access to clean in-distribution data. However, given that these models are often trained on proprietary datasets, it may not be practical to assume that in-distribution samples will always be available. On the other hand, model inversion techniques, which are typically viewed as privacy threats, can reconstruct realistic training samples from a given model, potentially eliminating the need for in-distribution data. To date, the only prior attempt to integrate backdoor removal and model inversion involves a simple combination that produced very limited results. This work represents a first step toward a more thorough understanding of how model inversion techniques could be leveraged for effective backdoor removal. Specifically, we seek to answer several key questions: What properties must reconstructed samples possess to enable successful defense? Is perceptual similarity to clean samples enough, or are additional characteristics necessary? Is it possible for reconstructed samples to contain backdoor triggers? We demonstrate that relying solely on perceptual similarity is insufficient for effective defenses. The stability of model predictions in response to input and parameter perturbations also plays a critical role. To address this, we propose a new bi-level optimization based framework for model inversion that promotes stability in addition to visual quality. Interestingly, we also find that reconstructed samples from a pre-trained generator's latent space do not contain backdoors, even when signals from a backdoored model are utilized for reconstruction. We provide a theoretical analysis to explain this observation. Our evaluation shows that our stabilized model inversion technique achieves state-of-the-art backdoor removal performance without requiring access to clean in-distribution data. Furthermore, its performance is on par with or even better than using the same amount of clean samples",

For decentralized learning, a straightforward approach using momentum is Distributed SGD (DSGD) with momentum (DSGDm). However, DSGDm performs worse than DSGD when the data distributions are statistically heterogeneous. Recently, several studies have addressed this issue and proposed methods with momentum that are more robust to data heterogeneity than DSGDm, although their convergence rates remain dependent on data heterogeneity and deteriorate when the data distributions are heterogeneous. In this study, we propose Momentum Tracking, which is a method with momentum whose convergence rate is proven to be independent of data heterogeneity. More specifically, we analyze the convergence rate of Momentum Tracking in the setting where the objective function is non-convex and the stochastic gradient is used. Then, we identify that it is independent of data heterogeneity for any momentum coefficient $\\beta \\in [0, 1)$. Through experiments, we demonstrate that Momentum Tracking is more robust to data heterogeneity than the existing decentralized learning methods with momentum and can consistently outperform these existing methods when the data distributions are heterogeneous",

We investi- gate to which degree the conceptual advantages of Bayesian Optimization can be combined with the computational efficiency of optimistic optimization. By mapping the kernel to a dissimilarity, we obtain an optimistic optimization algorithm for the Bayesian Optimization setting with a run-time of up to $O(N log N )$. As a high-level take-away we find that, when using stationary kernels on objectives of low evaluation cost, optimistic optimization can be preferable over Bayesian optimization, while for strongly coupled and parametric models, Bayesian optimization can perform much better, even at low evaluation cost.

However, existing encoding methods of a vanilla transformer are not always directly applicable to a linear transformer, because the latter requires a decomposition of the query and key representations into separate kernel functions.

In this work, we put together a variety of existing linear relative positional encoding approaches under a canonical form and further propose a family of linear relative positional encoding algorithms via unitary transformation. Our formulation leads to a principled framework that can be used to develop new relative positional encoding methods that preserve linear space-time complexity. Equipped with different models, the proposed linearized relative positional encoding (LRPE) family derives effective encoding for various applications. Experiments show that compared with existing methods, LRPE achieves state-of-the-art performance in language modeling, text classification, and image classification.

    "abstract": "The ubiquity of missing values in real-world datasets poses a challenge for statistical inference and can prevent similar datasets from being analyzed in the same study, precluding many existing datasets from being used for new analyses. While an extensive collection of packages and algorithms have been developed for data imputation, the overwhelming majority perform poorly if there are many missing values and low sample sizes, which are unfortunately common characteristics in empirical data. Such low-accuracy estimations adversely affect the performance of downstream statistical models. We develop a statistical inference framework for predicting the target variable in the presence of missing data without imputation. Our framework, RIFLE (Robust InFerence via Low-order moment Estimations), estimates low-order moments of the underlying data distribution with corresponding confidence intervals to learn a distributionally robust model. We specialize our framework to linear regression and normal discriminant analysis, and we provide convergence and performance guarantees. This framework can also be adapted to impute missing data. We compare RIFLE with state-of-the-art approaches (including MICE, Amelia, MissForest, KNN-imputer, MIDA, and Mean Imputer) in numerical experiments. Our experiments demonstrate that RIFLE outperforms other benchmark algorithms when the percentage of missing values is high and/or when the number of data points is relatively small.

Recent studies have reported the challenges of offline RL, such as estimating the values of actions that are outside the data distribution. To mitigate offline RL issues, we propose an algorithm that leverages a mixture of deterministic policies. When the data distribution is multimodal, fitting a policy modeled with a unimodal distribution, such as Gaussian distribution, may lead to interpolation between separate modes, thereby resulting in the value estimation of actions that are outside the data distribution. In our framework, the state-action space is divided by learning discrete latent variables, and the sub-policies corresponding to each region are trained. The proposed algorithm was derived by considering the variational lower bound of the offline RL objective function. We show empirically that the use of the proposed mixture policy can reduce the accumulation of the critic loss in offline RL, which was reported in previous studies. Experimental results also indicate that using a mixture of deterministic policies in offline RL improves the performance with the D4RL benchmarking datasets",

Specifically, an essential demand for on-device learning is to enable trained models to be quantized to various bit-widths based on the energy needs and heterogeneous hardware designs across the federation. In this work, we introduce multiple variants of federated averaging algorithm that train neural networks robust to quantization. Such networks can be quantized to various bit-widths with only limited reduction in full precision model accuracy. We perform extensive experiments on standard FL benchmarks to evaluate our proposed FedAvg variants for quantization robustness and provide a convergence analysis for our Quantization-Aware variants in FL.

For concreteness, we focus on the visual domain in this paper. Most current methods employ contrastive learning to learn a representation for long-tailed data. In this paper, first, we investigate $k$-positive sampling, a popular baseline method widely used to build contrastive learning models for imbalanced data. Previous works show that $k$-positive learning, which only chooses $k$ positive samples (instead of all positive images) for each query image, suffers from inferior performance in long-tailed data. In this work, we further point out that k-positive learning limits the learning capability of both head and tail classes. Based on this perspective, we propose a novel contrastive learning framework that improves the limitation in k-positive learning by enlarging its positive selection space, so it can help the model learn more semantic discrimination features. Second, we analyze how the temperature (the hyperparameter used for tuning a concentration of samples on feature space) affects the gradients of each class in long-tailed learning, and propose a new method that can mitigate inadequate gradients between classes, which can help model learning easier. We name this framework as CoGloAT. Finally, we go on to introduce a new prototype learning framework namely ProCo based on coreset selection, which creates a global prototype for each cluster while keeping the computation cost within a reasonable time and show that combining CoGloAT with ProCo can further enhance the model learning ability on long-tailed data",

    "abstract": "We address the question of binary classification when no labels are available and the input features are categorical. The lack of labels means supervised approaches can't be used, and the lack of a natural distance measure means that most unsupervised methods do poorly. For such problems, where the alternatives might be a) do nothing or b) heuristic rules-based approaches, we offer a third alternative: a classifier that approximates Naive Bayes. Our primary scenarios are those that involve distinguishing scripted, or bot, web traffic from that of legitimate users. Our main assumption is the existence of some attribute $x_*$ more prevalent in the benign than the scripted traffic; i.e., $P(x_*|\\overline{\\mbox{bot}}) = K \\cdot P(x_*|\\mbox{bot}),$ for $K>1.$ We show that any such disparity yields a lower bound on $P(\\mbox{bot}|x_{j})$ even when we have no prior estimates of $P(x_*|\\overline{\\mbox{bot}}),$ $P(x_*|\\mbox{bot})$ or $K$ (except that $K>1$). We show that when at least one bin of at least one feature receives no attack traffic then we under-estimate the actual conditional probability by a factor of $1-1/K.$ Thus, any attribute with a large disparity between prevalence in benign and abuse traffic (i.e., $K$ is large), allows good approximation of the Naive Bayes classifier without the benefit of labels. The approach is particularly suited to problems where $K$ is high and thus the approximation is very accurate. Example problems (and relevant attributes) might be: password-guessing, if login attempts from legitimate users succeed at a much higher rate than those from password-guessing attackers; Credit Card Verification Value (CVV) guessing, if an attacker exhaustively tries all possible 3 or 4-digit values and fails at a higher rate than legitimate users; account registration, if legitimate users use email addresses from services that do not allow fee anonymous accounts (e.g., {\\tt .edu}) at a much higher rate than attackers; click-fraud if legitimate users visit pages and services that contain no ads at a higher rate than click-fraud bots",

    "abstract": "Feedforward neural networks with homogeneous activation functions possess an internal symmetry: the functions they compute do not change when the incoming and outgoing weights at any hidden unit are rescaled by reciprocal positive values. This paper makes two contributions to our understanding of these networks. The first is to describe a simple procedure, or {\\it fix}, for balancing the weights in these networks: this procedure computes multiplicative rescaling factors---one at each hidden unit---that rebalance the weights of these networks without changing the end-to-end functions that they compute. Specifically, given an initial network with arbitrary weights, the procedure determines the functionally equivalent network whose weight matrix is of minimal $\\ell_{p,q}$-norm; the weights at each hidden unit are said to be balanced when this norm is stationary with respect to rescaling transformations. The optimal rescaling factors are computed in an iterative fashion via simple multiplicative updates, and the updates are notable in that (a) they do not require the tuning of learning rates, (b) they operate in parallel on the rescaling factors at all hidden units, and (c) they converge monotonically to a global minimizer of the $\\ell_{p,q}$-norm. The paper's second contribution is to analyze the optimization landscape for learning in these networks. We suppose that the network's loss function consists of two terms---one that is invariant to rescaling transformations, measuring predictive accuracy, and another (a regularizer) that breaks this invariance, penalizing large weights. We show how to derive a weight-balancing {\\it flow} such that the regularizer remains minimal with respect to rescaling transformations as the weights descend in the loss function. These dynamics reduce to an ordinary gradient flow for $\\ell_2$-norm regularization, but not otherwise. In this way our analysis suggests a canonical pairing of alternative flows and regularizers",

The perturbation is done with displacement interpolation, i.e. interpolation under the Wasserstein metric. We demonstrate theoretically and in simulations that $k$-mixup preserves cluster and manifold structures, and we extend theory studying the efficacy of standard mixup to the $k$-mixup case. Our empirical results show that training with $k$-mixup further improves generalization and robustness across several network architectures and benchmark datasets of differing modalities.

    "abstract": "The automated analysis of medical time series, such as the electrocardiogram (ECG), electroencephalogram (EEG), pulse oximetry, etc, has the potential to serve as a valuable tool for diagnostic decisions, allowing for remote monitoring of patients and more efficient use of expensive and time-consuming medical procedures. Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been demonstrated to process such signals effectively. However, previous research has primarily focused on classifying medical time series rather than attempting to regress the continuous-valued physiological parameters central to diagnosis. One significant challenge in this regard is the imbalanced nature of the dataset, as a low prevalence of abnormal conditions can lead to heavily skewed data that results in inaccurate predictions and a lack of certainty in such predictions when deployed. To address these challenges, we propose HypUC, a framework for imbalanced probabilistic regression in medical time series, making several contributions. (i) We introduce a simple kernel density-based technique to tackle the imbalanced regression problem with medical time series. (ii) Moreover, we employ a probabilistic regression framework that allows uncertainty estimation for the predicted continuous values. (iii) We also present a new approach to calibrate the predicted uncertainty further. (iv) Finally, we demonstrate a technique to use calibrated uncertainty estimates to improve the predicted continuous value and show the efficacy of the calibrated uncertainty estimates to flag unreliable predictions. HypUC is evaluated on a large, diverse, real-world dataset of ECGs collected from millions of patients, outperforming several conventional baselines on various diagnostic tasks, suggesting potential use-case for the reliable clinical deployment of deep learning models and a prospective clinical trial. Consequently, a hyperkalemia diagnosis algorithm based on HypUC is going to be the subject of a real-world clinical prospective study",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Real-world time-series datasets are often multivariate with complex dynamics. To capture this complexity, high capacity architectures like recurrent- or attention-based sequential deep learning models have become popular. However, recent work demonstrates that simple univariate linear models can outperform such deep learning models on several commonly used academic benchmarks. Extending them, in this paper, we investigate the capabilities of linear models for time-series forecasting and present Time-Series Mixer (TSMixer), a novel architecture designed by stacking multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). TSMixer is based on mixing operations along both the time and feature dimensions to extract information efficiently. On popular academic benchmarks, the simple-to-implement TSMixer is comparable to specialized state-of-the-art models that leverage the inductive biases of specific benchmarks. On the challenging and large scale M5 benchmark, a real-world retail dataset, TSMixer demonstrates superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art alternatives. Our results underline the importance of efficiently utilizing cross-variate and auxiliary information for improving the performance of time series forecasting. We present various analyses to shed light into the capabilities of TSMixer. The design paradigms utilized in TSMixer are expected to open new horizons for deep learning-based time series forecasting",

    "abstract": "While a key component to the success of deep learning is the availability of massive amounts of training data, medical image datasets are often limited in diversity and size. Transfer learning has the potential to bridge the gap between related yet different domains. For medical applications, however, it remains unclear whether it is more beneficial to pre-train on natural or medical images. We aim to shed light on this problem by comparing initialization on ImageNet and RadImageNet on seven medical classification tasks. Our work includes a replication study, which yields results contrary to previously published findings. In our experiments, ResNet50 models pre-trained on ImageNet tend to outperform those trained on RadImageNet. To gain further insights, we investigate the learned representations using Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and compare the predictions of the different models. Our results indicate that, contrary to intuition, ImageNet and RadImageNet may converge to distinct intermediate representations, which appear to diverge further during fine-tuning. Despite these distinct representations, the predictions of the models remain similar. Our findings show that the similarity between networks before and after fine-tuning does not correlate with performance gains, suggesting that the advantages of transfer learning might not solely originate from the reuse of features in the early layers of a convolutional neural network",

    "abstract": "Many real-world applications of language models (LMs), such as writing assistance and code autocomplete, involve human-LM interaction. However, most benchmarks are non-interactive in that a model produces output without human involvement. To evaluate human-LM interaction, we develop a new framework, Human-AI Language-based Interaction Evaluation (HALIE), that defines the components of interactive systems and dimensions to consider when designing evaluation metrics. Compared to standard, non-interactive evaluation, HALIE captures (i) the interactive process, not only the final output; (ii) the first-person subjective experience, not just a third-party assessment; and (iii) notions of preference beyond quality (e.g., enjoyment and ownership). We then design five tasks to cover different forms of interaction: social dialogue, question answering, crossword puzzles, summarization, and metaphor generation. With four state-of-the-art LMs (three variants of OpenAI's GPT-3 and AI21 Labs' Jurassic-1), we find that better non-interactive performance does not always translate to better human-LM interaction. In particular, we highlight three cases where the results from non-interactive and interactive metrics diverge and underscore the importance of human-LM interaction for LM evaluation",

The majority of prior work in machine learning for multiple sclerosis has been centered around using Magnetic Resonance Imaging scans or laboratory tests; these modalities are both expensive to acquire and can be unreliable. In a recent paper it was shown that disease progression can be predicted effectively using performance outcome measures and demographic data. In our work we build on this to investigate the modeling side, using continuous time models to predict progression. We benchmark four continuous time models using a publicly available multiple sclerosis dataset. We find that the best continuous model is often able to outperform the best benchmarked discrete time model. We also carry out an extensive ablation to discover the sources of performance gains, we find that standardizing existing features leads to a larger performance increase than interpolating missing features",

    "abstract": "It is commonly observed that deep networks trained for classification exhibit class-selective neurons in their early and intermediate layers. Intriguingly, recent studies have shown that these class-selective neurons can be ablated without deteriorating network function. But if class-selective neurons are not necessary, why do they exist? We attempt to answer this question in a series of experiments on ResNet-50s trained on ImageNet. We first show that class-selective neurons emerge during the first few epochs of training, before receding rapidly but not completely; this suggests that class-selective neurons found in trained networks are in fact vestigial remains of early training. With single-neuron ablation experiments, we then show that class-selective neurons are important for network function in this early phase of training. We also observe that the network is close to a linear regime in this early phase; we thus speculate that class-selective neurons appear early in training as quasi-linear shortcut solutions to the classification task. Finally, in causal experiments where we regularize against class selectivity at different points in training, we show that the presence of class-selective neurons early in training is critical to the successful training of the network; in contrast, class-selective neurons can be suppressed later in training with little effect on final accuracy. It remains to be understood by which mechanism the presence of class-selective neurons in the early phase of training contributes to the successful training of networks",

However, corresponding class labels are noisy when provided by error-prone annotators, e.g., crowdworkers. Training standard deep neural networks leads to subpar performances in such multi-annotator supervised learning settings. We address this issue by presenting a probabilistic training framework named multi-annotator deep learning (MaDL). A downstream ground truth and an annotator performance model are jointly trained in an end-to-end learning approach. The ground truth model learns to predict instances' true class labels, while the annotator performance model infers probabilistic estimates of annotators' performances. A modular network architecture enables us to make varying assumptions regarding annotators' performances, e.g., an optional class or instance dependency. Further, we learn annotator embeddings to estimate annotators' densities within a latent space as proxies of their potentially correlated annotations. Together with a weighted loss function, we improve the learning from correlated annotation patterns. In a comprehensive evaluation, we examine three research questions about multi-annotator supervised learning. Our findings show MaDL's state-of-the-art performance and robustness against many correlated, spamming annotators",

    "abstract": "Fast gradient-based optimization algorithms have become increasingly essential for the computationally efficient training of machine learning models. One technique is to multiply the gradient by a preconditioner matrix to produce a step, but it is unclear what the best preconditioner matrix is. This paper introduces a novel machine learning optimizer called LODO, which tries to online meta-learn the best preconditioner during optimization. Specifically, our optimizer merges Learning to Optimize (L2O) techniques with quasi-Newton methods to learn preconditioners parameterized as neural networks; they are more flexible than preconditioners in other quasi-Newton methods. Unlike other L2O methods, LODO does not require any meta-training on a training task distribution, and instead learns to optimize on the fly while optimizing on the test task, adapting to the local characteristics of the loss landscape while traversing it. Theoretically, we show that our optimizer approximates the inverse Hessian in noisy loss landscapes and is capable of representing a wide range of inverse Hessians. We experimentally verify that our algorithm can optimize in noisy settings, and show that simpler alternatives for representing the inverse Hessians worsen performance. Lastly, we use our optimizer to train a semi-realistic deep neural network with 95k parameters at speeds comparable to those of standard neural network optimizers",

Our results bring a new understanding of the benefits of cyclic and randomized stepsizes compared to constant stepsize in terms of the tail behavior.

However, learning the value function via bootstrapping often leads to unstable training due to fast-changing target values. Target Networks are employed to stabilize training by using an additional set of lagging parameters to estimate the target values. Despite the popularity of Target Networks, their effect on the optimization is still misunderstood. In this work, we show that they act as an implicit regularizer which can be beneficial in some cases, but also have disadvantages such as being inflexible and can result in instabilities, even when vanilla TD(0) converges. To overcome these issues, we propose an explicit Functional Regularization alternative that is flexible and a convex regularizer in function space and we theoretically study its convergence. We conducted an experimental study across a range of environments, discount factors, and off-policiness data collections to investigate the effectiveness of the regularization induced by Target Networks and Functional Regularization in terms of performance, accuracy, and stability. Our findings emphasize that Functional Regularization can be used as a drop-in replacement for Target Networks and result in performance improvement. Furthermore, adjusting both the regularization weight and the network update period in Functional Regularization can result in further performance improvements compared to solely adjusting the network update period as typically done with Target Networks.

    "abstract": "Multimodal neural networks often fail to utilize all modalities. They subsequently generalize worse than their unimodal counterparts, or make predictions that only depend on a subset of modalities. We refer to this problem as \\emph{modality underutilization}. Existing work has addressed this issue by ensuring that there are no systematic biases in dataset creation, or that our neural network architectures and optimization algorithms are capable of learning modality interactions. We demonstrate that even when these favorable conditions are met, modality underutilization can still occur in the small data regime. To explain this phenomenon, we put forth a concept that we call \\emph{incidental correlation}. It is a spurious correlation that emerges in small datasets, despite not being a part of the underlying data generating process (DGP). We develop our argument using a DGP under which multimodal neural networks must utilize all modalities, since all paths between the inputs and target are causal. This represents an idealized scenario that often fails to materialize. Instead, due to incidental correlation, small datasets sampled from this DGP have higher likelihood under an alternative DGP with spurious paths between the inputs and target. Multimodal neural networks that use these spurious paths for prediction fail to utilize all modalities. Given its harmful effects, we propose to detect incidental correlation via latent variable modeling. We specify an identifiable variational autoencoder such that the latent posterior encodes the spurious correlations between the inputs and target. This allows us to interpret the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the latent posterior and prior as the severity of incidental correlation. We use an ablation study to show that identifiability is important in this context, since we derive our conclusions from the latent posterior. Using experiments with synthetic data, as well as with VQA v2.0 and NLVR2, we demonstrate that incidental correlation emerges in the small data regime, and leads to modality underutilization.

In this paper, we show that sparsified Gaussian (and Rademacher) sketches still produce theoretically-valid approximations while allowing for important time and space savings thanks to an efficient \\emph{decomposition trick}.

In addition, existing GCL approaches fail to provide strong performance guarantees. Coupled with the unpredictability of GCL approaches on heterophilic graphs, their applicability in real-world contexts is limited. Then, a natural question arises: Can we design a GCL method that works for both homophilic and heterophilic graphs with a performance guarantee? To answer this question, we theoretically study the concentration property of features obtained by neighborhood aggregation on homophilic and heterophilic graphs, introduce the single-pass graph contrastive learning loss based on the property, and provide performance guarantees for the minimizer of the loss on downstream tasks. As a direct consequence of our analysis, we implement the Single-Pass Graph Contrastive Learning method (SP-GCL).

We demonstrate that BaM-SSL mitigates confirmation bias in SOTA SSL methods across standard vision benchmarks of CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, giving up to 16% improvement in test accuracy on the CIFAR-100 with 400 labels benchmark. Furthermore, we also demonstrate their effectiveness in additional realistic and challenging problems, such as class-imbalanced datasets and in photonics science",

    "abstract": "Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) is the workhorse algorithm for recent advances in private deep learning. It provides a single privacy guarantee to all datapoints in the dataset. We propose \\emph{output-specific} $(\\varepsilon,\\delta)$-DP to characterize privacy guarantees for individual examples when releasing models trained by DP-SGD. We also design an efficient algorithm to investigate individual privacy across a number of datasets. We find that most examples enjoy stronger privacy guarantees than the worst-case bound. We further discover that the training loss and the privacy parameter of an example are well-correlated. This implies groups that are underserved in terms of model utility simultaneously experience weaker privacy guarantees. For example, on CIFAR-10, the average $\\varepsilon$ of the class with the lowest test accuracy is 44.2\\% higher than that of the class with the highest accuracy",

    "abstract": "We make contributions towards improving adaptive-optimizer performance. Our improvements are based on suppression of the range of adaptive stepsizes in the AdaBelief optimizer.

Secondly, we extend AdaBelief by further suppressing the range of the adaptive stepsizes. To achieve the above goal, we perform mutual layerwise vector projections between the gradient $\\boldsymbol{g}_t$ and its first momentum $\\boldsymbol{m}_t$ before using them to estimate the second momentum. The new optimization method is referred to as \\emph{Aida}. Thirdly, extensive experimental results show that Aida outperforms nine optimizers when training transformers and LSTMs for NLP, and VGG and ResNet for image classification over CIAF10 and CIFAR100 while matching the best performance of the nine methods when training WGAN-GP models for image generation tasks. Furthermore, Aida produces higher validation accuracies than AdaBelief for training ResNet18 over ImageNet",

However, training them via the adjoint method is slow compared to discrete models due to the requirement of numerically solving ODEs. To speed neural ODEs up, a common approach is to regularise the solutions. However, this approach may affect the expressivity of the model; when the trajectory itself matters, this is particularly important. In this paper, we propose an alternative way to speed up the training of neural ODEs. The key idea is to speed up the adjoint method by using GauÃŸ-Legendre quadrature to solve integrals faster than ODE-based methods while remaining memory efficient. We also extend the idea to training SDEs using the Wong-Zakai theorem, by training a corresponding ODE and transferring the parameters. Our approach leads to faster training of neural ODEs, especially for large models. It also presents a new way to train SDE-based models",

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art deep learning models are becoming ever larger. However, many practical applications are constrained by the cost of inference. Cascades of pretrained models with conditional execution address these requirements based on the intuition that some inputs are easy enough that they can be processed correctly by a smaller model allowing for an early exit. If the smaller model is not sufficiently confident in its prediction, the input is passed on to a larger model. The selection of the confidence threshold allows to trade off computational cost against accuracy. In this work we explore the effective design of model cascades, thoroughly evaluate the impact on the accuracy-efficiency trade-off, and provide a reproducible state-of-the-art baseline that is currently missing for related research. We demonstrate that model cascades dominate the ImageNet Pareto front already with 2-model cascades, achieving an average reduction in compute effort at equal accuracy of almost 3.1x above 86% and more than 1.9x between 80% and 86% top-1 accuracy, while 3-model cascades achieve 4.4x above 87% accuracy.

We use the encoder of a sequence-to-sequence architecture, trained on visually different but mathematically equivalent expressions, to generate vector representations (or embeddings).

    "abstract": "Transformers have shown remarkable success in natural language processing and computer vision, serving as the foundation of large language and multimodal models. These networks can capture nuanced context sensitivity across high-dimensional language tokens or image pixels, but it remains unclear how highly structured behavior and systematic generalization can arise in these systems. Here, we explore the solution process a causal transformer discovers as it learns to solve a set of algorithmic tasks involving copying, sorting, and hierarchical compositions of these operations. We search for the minimal layer and head configuration sufficient to solve these tasks and unpack the roles of the attention heads, as well as how token representations are reweighted across layers to complement these roles. Our results provide new insights into how attention layers in transformers support structured computation within and across tasks: 1) Replacing fixed position labels with labels sampled from a larger set enables strong length generalization and faster learning. The learnable embeddings of these labels develop different representations, capturing sequence order if necessary, depending on task demand. 2) Two-layer transformers can learn reliable solutions to the multi-level problems we explore. The first layer tends to transform the input representation to allow the second layer to share computation across repeated components within a task or across related tasks. 3) We introduce an analysis pipeline that quantifies how the representation space in a given layer prioritizes different aspects of each item. We show that these representations prioritize information needed to guide attention relative to information that only requires downstream readout",

Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) provides general solutions to address these problems thanks to a convenient multi-level decomposition of the tasks, making their solution accessible. Although often used in practice, few works provide theoretical guarantees to justify this outcome effectively. Thus, it is not yet clear when to prefer such approaches compared to standard flat ones. In this work, we provide an option-dependent upper bound to the regret suffered by regret minimization algorithms in finite-horizon problems. We illustrate that the performance improvement derives from the planning horizon reduction induced by the temporal abstraction enforced by the hierarchical structure. Then, focusing on a sub-setting of HRL approaches, the options framework, we highlight how the average duration of the available options affects the planning horizon and, consequently, the regret itself. Finally, we relax the assumption of having pre-trained options to show how, in particular situations, is still preferable a hierarchical approach over a standard one",

Recent progress in question-answering has been achieved either through prompting methods against very large pretrained Language Models in zero or few-shot fashion, or by fine-tuning smaller models, sometimes in conjunction with information retrieval. We focus on the less explored question of the extent to which zero-shot generalisation can be enabled in smaller models with retrieval against a corpus within which sufficient information to answer a particular question may not exist. We establish strong baselines in this setting for diverse evaluation datasets (StrategyQA, CommonsenseQA, IIRC, DROP, Musique and ARC-DA), and show that performance can be significantly improved by adding retrieval-augmented training datasets which are designed to expose our models to a variety of heuristic reasoning strategies such as weighing partial evidence or ignoring an irrelevant context",

Message passing neural networks have been shown to be limited in their expressive power and recent approaches to over come this either lack scalability or require structural information to be encoded into the feature space. The general framework presented here overcomes the scalability issues associated with global permutation equivariance by operating more locally on sub-graphs. In addition, through operating on sub-graphs the expressive power of higher-dimensional global permutation equivariant networks is improved; this is due to fact that two non-distinguishable graphs often contain distinguishable sub-graphs. Furthermore, the proposed framework only requires a choice of $k$-hops for creating ego-network sub-graphs and a choice of representation space to be used for each layer, which makes the method easily applicable across a range of graph based domains. We experimentally validate the method on a range of graph benchmark classification tasks, demonstrating statistically indistinguishable results from the state-of-the-art on six out of seven benchmarks. Further, we demonstrate that the use of local update functions offers a significant improvement in GPU memory over global methods",

We recover the result of Barber & Duchi (2014) stating that histogram estimators are optimal against Lipschitz distributions for the L2 risk and, under regular differential privacy, we extend it to other norms and notions of privacy. Then, we investigate higher degrees of smoothness, drawing two conclusions: First, and contrary to what happens with constant privacy budget (Wasserman & Zhou, 2010), there are regimes where imposing privacy degrades the regular minimax risk of estimation on Sobolev densities. Second, so-called projection estimators are near-optimal against the same classes of densities in this new setup with pure differential privacy, but contrary to the constant privacy budget case, it comes at the cost of relaxation. With zero concentrated differential privacy, there is no need for relaxation, and we prove that the estimation is optimal",

We identify this setting as Graph Intersection-induced Transfer Learning (GITL), which is motivated by practical applications in e-commerce or academic co-authorship predictions. We develop a framework to effectively leverage the structural prior in this setting. We first create an intersection subgraph using the shared nodes between the two graphs, then transfer knowledge from the source-enriched intersection subgraph to the full target graph.

Their expensive solution techniques have led to an increased interest in deep neural network based surrogates. However, the practical utility of training such surrogates is contingent on their ability to model complex multi-scale spatio-temporal phenomena. {In recent years}, various neural network architectures have been proposed to target such phenomena, most notably Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs), which give a natural handle over local \\& global spatial information via parameterization of different Fourier modes, and U-Nets which treat local and global information via downsampling and upsampling paths. However, large-scale comparisons between these convolution-based approaches are notoriously sparse. In this work, we make such comprehensive comparisons regarding performance, runtime complexity, memory requirements, and generalization capabilities. Concretely, we stress-test various FNO, (Dilated) ResNet, and U-Net like approaches to fluid mechanics problems in both vorticity-stream and velocity function form. For U-Nets, we transfer recent architectural improvements from computer vision, most notably from object segmentation and generative modeling. Next, we use our insights on design considerations, and introduce U-FNets, i.e., modern U-Nets that are augmented with FNO downsampling layers. Those architectures further improve performance without major degradation of computational cost. Finally, we ablate and discuss various choices for parameter conditioning}, and show promising results on generalization to different PDE parameters and time-scales with a single surrogate model.

We show that this kernel is both theoretically sound and empirically effective. Our contribution is mainly of a theoretical nature, presenting the first formally sound kernel for moment-matching distributional reinforcement learning with good practical performance.

We then define the stability and convergence criteria of dynamical systems on manifolds and provide necessary and sufficient conditions of strictly stable equilibrium points for both continuous and discrete dynamics.

    "title": "Learning to Boost Resilience of Complex Networks via Neural Edge Rewiring",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The resilience of complex networks refers to their ability to maintain functionality in the face of structural attacks. This ability can be improved by performing minimal modifications to the network structure via degree-preserving edge rewiring-based methods. Existing learning-free edge rewiring methods, although effective, are limited in their ability to generalize to different graphs. Such a limitation cannot be trivially addressed by existing graph neural networks (GNNs)-based learning approaches since there is no rich initial node features for GNNs to learn meaningful representations. In this work, inspired by persistent homology, we specifically design a variant of GNN called FireGNN to learn meaningful node representations solely from graph structures. We then develop an end-to-end inductive method called ResiNet, which aims to discover resilient network topologies while balancing network utility. ResiNet reformulates the optimization of network resilience as a Markov decision process equipped with edge rewiring action space. It learns to sequentially select the appropriate edges to rewire for maximizing resilience. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ResiNet outperforms existing approaches and achieves near-optimal resilience gains on various graphs while balancing network utility",

    "abstract": "Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is essential for various scientific domains but computationally expensive. Learning-based force fields have made significant progress in accelerating ab-initio MD simulation but are not fast enough for many real-world applications due to slow inference for large systems and small time steps (femtosecond-level). We aim to address these challenges by learning a multi-scale graph neural network that directly simulates coarse-grained MD with a very large time step (nanosecond-level) and a novel refinement module based on diffusion models to mitigate simulation instability. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated in two complex systems: single-chain coarse-grained polymers and multi-component Li-ion polymer electrolytes. For evaluation, we simulate trajectories much longer than the training trajectories for systems with different chemical compositions that the model is not trained on. Structural and dynamical properties can be accurately recovered at several orders of magnitude higher speed than classical force fields by getting out of the femtosecond regime",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Calibration of neural networks is a topical problem that is becoming more and more important as neural networks increasingly underpin real-world applications. The problem is especially noticeable when using modern neural networks, for which there is a significant difference between the confidence of the model and the probability of correct prediction. Various strategies have been proposed to improve calibration, yet accurate calibration remains challenging. We propose a novel framework with two contributions: introducing a new differentiable surrogate for expected calibration error (DECE) that allows calibration quality to be directly optimised, and a meta-learning framework that uses DECE to optimise for validation set calibration with respect to model hyper-parameters. The results show that we achieve competitive performance with existing calibration approaches. Our framework opens up a new avenue and toolset for tackling calibration, which we believe will inspire further work on this important challenge",

    "title": "Understanding convolution on graphs via energies",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) typically operate by message-passing, where the state of a node is updated based on the information received from its neighbours. Most message-passing models act as graph convolutions, where features are mixed by a shared, linear transformation before being propagated over the edges. On node-classification tasks, graph convolutions have been shown to suffer from two limitations: poor performance on heterophilic graphs, and over-smoothing. It is common belief that both phenomena occur because such models behave as low-pass filters, meaning that the Dirichlet energy of the features decreases along the layers incurring a smoothing effect that ultimately makes features no longer distinguishable. In this work, we rigorously prove that simple graph-convolutional models can actually enhance high frequencies and even lead to an asymptotic behaviour we refer to as over-sharpening, opposite to over-smoothing. We do so by showing that linear graph convolutions with symmetric weights minimize a multi-particle energy that generalizes the Dirichlet energy; in this setting, the weight matrices induce edge-wise attraction (repulsion) through their positive (negative) eigenvalues, thereby controlling whether the features are being smoothed or sharpened. We also extend the analysis to non-linear GNNs, and demonstrate that some existing time-continuous GNNs are instead always dominated by the low frequencies. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings through ablations and real-world experiments",

    "title": "One-Step Distributional Reinforcement Learning",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) allows an agent interacting sequentially with an environment to maximize its long-term expected return. In the distributional RL (DistrRL) paradigm, the agent goes beyond the limit of the expected value, to capture the underlying probability distribution of the return across all time steps. The set of DistrRL algorithms has led to improved empirical performance. Nevertheless, the theory of DistrRL is still not fully understood, especially in the control case. In this paper, we present the simpler one-step distributional reinforcement learning (OS-DistrRL) framework encompassing only the randomness induced by the one-step dynamics of the environment. Contrary to DistrRL, we show that our approach comes with a unified theory for both policy evaluation and control. Indeed, we propose two OS-DistrRL algorithms for which we provide an almost sure convergence analysis. The proposed approach compares favorably with categorical DistrRL on various environments",

    "title": "Dual Representation Learning for Out-of-distribution Detection",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "To classify in-distribution samples, deep neural networks explore strongly label-related information and discard weakly label-related information according to the information bottleneck. Out-of-distribution samples drawn from distributions differing from that of in-distribution samples could be assigned with unexpected high-confidence predictions because they could obtain minimum strongly label-related information. To distinguish in- and out-of-distribution samples, Dual Representation Learning (DRL) makes out-of-distribution samples harder to have high-confidence predictions by exploring both strongly and weakly label-related information from in-distribution samples. For a pretrained network exploring strongly label-related information to learn label-discriminative representations, DRL trains its auxiliary network exploring the remaining weakly label-related information to learn distribution-discriminative representations. Specifically, for a label-discriminative representation, DRL constructs its complementary distribution-discriminative representation by integrating diverse representations less similar to the label-discriminative representation. Accordingly, DRL combines label- and distribution-discriminative representations to detect out-of-distribution samples. Experiments show that DRL outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for out-of-distribution detection",

    "title": "Cyclophobic Reinforcement Learning",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In environments with sparse rewards, finding a good inductive bias for exploration is crucial to the agent's success. However, there are two competing goals: novelty search and systematic exploration. While existing approaches such as curiosity-driven exploration find novelty, they sometimes do not systematically explore the whole state space, akin to depth-first-search vs breadth-first-search. In this paper, we propose a new intrinsic reward that is cyclophobic, i.e., it does not reward novelty, but punishes redundancy by avoiding cycles. Augmenting the cyclophobic intrinsic reward with a sequence of hierarchical representations based on the agent's cropped observations we are able to achieve excellent results in the MiniGrid and MiniHack environments. Both are particularly hard, as they require complex interactions with different objects in order to be solved. Detailed comparisons with previous approaches and thorough ablation studies show that our newly proposed cyclophobic reinforcement learning is more sample efficient than other state of the art methods in a variety of tasks",
