    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "A rational design of new therapeutic drugs aims to find a molecular structure with desired biological functionality, e.g., an ability to activate or suppress a specific protein via binding to it. Molecular docking is a common technique for evaluating protein-molecule interactions. Recently, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach to generating molecules with the docking score (DS) as a reward. In this work, we reproduce, scrutinize and improve the recent RL model for molecule generation called FREED (Yang et al., 2021). Extensive evaluation of the proposed method reveals several limitations and challenges despite the outstanding results reported for three target proteins. Our contributions include fixing numerous implementation bugs and simplifying the model while increasing its quality, significantly extending experiments, and conducting an accurate comparison with current state-of-the-art methods for protein-conditioned molecule generation. We show that the resulting fixed model is capable of producing molecules with superior docking scores compared to alternative approaches",

Hereby, we introduce the topic of projective equivariance to the machine learning audience. We theoretically study the relation of projectively and linearly equivariant linear layers. We find that in some important cases, surprisingly, the two types of layers coincide. We also propose a way to construct a projectively equivariant neural network, which boils down to building a standard equivariant network where the linear group representations acting on each intermediate feature space are lifts of projective group representations. Projective equivariance is showcased in two simple experiments. Code for the experiments is provided in the supplementary material",

    "title": "Improving Native CNN Robustness with Filter Frequency Regularization",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Neural networks tend to overfit the training distribution and perform poorly on out-of-distribution data. A conceptually simple solution lies in adversarial training, which introduces worst-case perturbations into the training data and thus improves model generalization to some extent. However, it is only one ingredient towards generally more robust models and requires knowledge about the potential attacks or inference time data corruptions during model training. This paper focuses on the native robustness of models that can learn robust behavior directly from conventional training data without out-of-distribution examples. To this end, we study the frequencies in learned convolution filters. Clean-trained models often prioritize high-frequency information, whereas adversarial training enforces models to shift the focus to low-frequency details during training. By mimicking this behavior through frequency regularization in learned convolution weights, we achieve improved native robustness to adversarial attacks, common corruptions, and other out-of-distribution tests. Additionally, this method leads to more favorable shifts in decision-making towards low-frequency information, such as shapes, which inherently aligns more closely with human vision",

These operators, however, have a few critical limitations. In this work, we investigate a simple soft-greedy operator, which we call resmax, that takes actions proportionally to their max action gap: the residual to the estimated maximal value. It is simple to use and ensures coverage of the state-space like $\\varepsilon$-greedy, but focuses exploration more on potentially promising actions like softmax. Further, it does not concentrate probability as quickly as softmax, and so better avoids overemphasizing sub-optimal actions that appear high-valued during learning. Additionally, we prove it is a non-expansion for any fixed exploration hyperparameter, unlike the softmax policy which requires a state-action specific temperature to obtain a non-expansion (called mellowmax). We empirically validate that resmax is comparable to or outperforms $\\varepsilon$-greedy and softmax across a variety of environments in tabular and deep RL",

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of learning differentially private linear and logistic regression models that do not exhibit disparate performance for minority groups in the data. Small-sized datasets pose a challenging regime for differential privacy; that is, satisfying differential privacy while learning models from data can lead to models with worse accuracy for minority---in size---subgroups. To address this challenge, inspired by Abowd & Schmutte (2018), we propose: (i) to systematically tailor the privacy budget to the different groups, (ii) use linear optimization oracles in a grid to optimize Lagrangian objectives that correspond to fair learning and optimization. We present efficient differentially private algorithms for linear and logistic regression subject to fairness constraints (e.g., bounded group loss) that allocate the privacy budget based on the private standard error of each subgroup in the data. Consequently, the formulation reduces the amount of noise added to these groups, which leads to more accurate models for such groups. We validate the proposed, group-aware budget allocation, method on synthetic and real-world datasets where we show significant reductions in prediction error for the smallest groups, while still preserving sufficient privacy to protect the minority group from re-identification attacks. In addition, we provide sample complexity lower bounds for our problem formulation",

    "title": "Smoothed Differential Privacy",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Differential privacy (DP) is a widely-accepted and widely-applied notion of privacy based on worst-case analysis. Often, DP classifies most mechanisms without additive noise as non-private (Dwork et al., 2014). Thus, additive noises are added to improve privacy (to achieve DP). However, in many real-world applications, adding additive noise is undesirable (Bagdasaryan et al., 2019) and sometimes prohibited (Liu et al., 2020). In this paper, we propose a natural extension of DP following the worst average-case idea behind the celebrated smoothed analysis (Spielman & Teng, May 2004). Our notion, smoothed DP, can effectively measure the privacy leakage of mechanisms without additive noises under realistic settings. We prove that any discrete mechanism with sampling procedures is more private than what DP predicts, while many continuous mechanisms with sampling procedures are still non-private under smoothed DP. In addition, we prove several desirable properties of smoothed DP, including composition, robustness to post-processing, and distribution reduction. Based on those properties, we propose an efficient algorithm to calculate the privacy parameters for smoothed DP. Experimentally, we verify that, according to smoothed DP, the discrete sampling mechanisms are private in real-world elections, and some discrete neural networks can be private without adding any additive noise. We believe that these results contribute to the theoretical foundation of realistic privacy measures beyond worst-case analysis",

SPIDER is designed based on two unique features: (1) alternately optimizing one architecture-homogeneous global model in a generic FL manner and architecture-heterogeneous local models that are connected to the global model by weight-sharing-based regularization, (2) achieving architecture-heterogeneous local models by a perturbation-based neural architecture search method.

    "title": "DreamEdit: Subject-driven Image Editing",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Subject-driven image generation aims at generating images containing customized subjects, which has recently drawn enormous attention from the research community. Nevertheless, the previous works cannot precisely control the background and position of the target subject. In this work, we aspire to fill the void of the existing subject-driven generation tasks. To this end, we propose two novel subject-driven editing sub-tasks, i.e., Subject Replacement and Subject Addition. The new tasks are challenging in multiple aspects: replacing a subject with a customized one can totally change its shape, texture, and color, while adding a target subject to a designated position in a provided scene necessitates a rational context-aware posture of the subject. To conquer these two novel tasks, we first manually curate a new dataset called DreamEditBench containing 22 different types of subjects, and 440 source images, which cover diverse scenarios with different difficulty levels. We plan to host DreamEditBench as a platform and hire trained evaluators for standardized human evaluation. We also devise an innovative method DreamEditor to resolve these tasks by performing iterative generation, which enables a smooth adaptation to the customized subject. In this project, we conduct automatic and human evaluations to understand the performance of our DreamEditor and baselines on DreamEditBench. We found that the new tasks are challenging for the existing models. For Subject Replacement, we found that the existing models are particularly sensitive to the shape and color of the original subject. When the original subject and the customized subject are highly different, the model failure rate will dramatically increase. For Subject Addition, we found that the existing models cannot easily blend the customized subjects into the background smoothly, which causes noticeable artifacts in the generated image. We hope that DreamEditBench can become a standardized platform to enable future investigations towards building more controllable subject-driven image editing.

    "title": "UnIVAL: Unified Model for Image, Video, Audio and Language Tasks",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have made the ambitious quest for generalist agents significantly far from being a fantasy. A key hurdle for building such general models is the diversity and heterogeneity of tasks and modalities. A promising solution is unification, allowing the support of a myriad of tasks and modalities within one unified framework. While few large models (e.g., Flamingo (Alayrac et al. 2022)), trained on massive datasets, can support more than two modalities, current small to mid-scale unified models are still limited to 2 modalities, usually image-text or video-text. The question that we ask is: is it possible to build efficiently a unified model that can support all modalities? To answer this, we propose UnIVAL, a step further towards this ambitious goal. Without relying on fancy datasets sizes or models with billions of parameters, the ~ 0.25B parameter UnIVAL model goes beyond two modalities and unifies text, images, video, and audio into a single model. Our model is efficiently pretrained on many tasks, based on task balancing and multimodal curriculum learning. UnIVAL shows competitive performance to existing state-of-the-art approaches, across image and video-text tasks. The feature representations learned from image and video-text modalities, allows the model to achieve competitive performance when finetuned on audio-text tasks, despite not being pretrained on audio. Thanks to the unified model, we propose a novel study on multimodal model merging via weight interpolation of models trained on different multimodal tasks, showing their benefits in particular for out-of-distribution generalization. Finally, we motivate unification by showing the synergy between tasks. The model weights and code are available at: https://github.com/mshukor/UnIVAL",

    "title": "IndicTrans2: Towards High-Quality and Accessible Machine Translation Models for all 22 Scheduled Indian Languages",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "India has a rich linguistic landscape, with languages from 4 major language families spoken by over a billion people. 22 of these languages listed in the Constitution of India (referred to as scheduled languages) are the focus of this work. Given the linguistic diversity, high-quality and accessible Machine Translation (MT) systems are essential in a country like India. Before this work, there was (i) no parallel training data spanning all 22 languages, (ii) no robust benchmarks covering all these languages and containing content relevant to India, and (iii) no existing translation models that support all 22 scheduled languages of India. In this work, we aim to address this gap by focusing on the missing pieces required for enabling wide, easy, and open access to good machine translation systems for all 22 scheduled Indian languages. We identify four key areas of improvement: curating and creating larger training datasets, creating diverse and high-quality benchmarks, training multilingual models, and releasing models with open access. Our first contribution is the release of the Bharat Parallel Corpus Collection (BPCC), the largest publicly available parallel corpora for Indic languages. BPCC contains a total of 230M bitext pairs, of which a total of 126M were newly added, including 644K manually translated sentence pairs created as part of this work. Our second contribution is the release of the first $n$-way parallel benchmark covering all 22 Indian languages, featuring diverse domains, Indian-origin content, and conversational test sets. Next, we present IndicTrans2, the first translation model to support all 22 languages, surpassing existing models in performance on multiple existing and new benchmarks created as a part of this work.

However, the optimization gap between BNNs and their full-precision counterparts has long been an open problem limiting their performance. In this work, we propose a novel optimization pipeline to enhance the performance of BNNs. The main approach includes three key components: (1) BNext, a strong binary baseline based on an optimization-friendly basic block design, (2) knowledge complexity, a simple yet effective teacher-selection metric taking the capacity gap between teachers and binary students under consideration, (3) consecutive knowledge distillation (CKD), a novel multi-round optimization technique to transfer high-confidence knowledge from strong teachers to low-capacity BNNs. We empirically validate the superiority of the method on several vision classification tasks CIFAR-10/100 & ImageNet. For instance, the BNext family outperforms previous BNNs under different capacity levels and contributes the first binary neural network to reach the state-of-the-art 80.57\\% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with 0.82 GOPS, which verifies the potential of BNNs and already contributes a strong baseline for future research on high-accuracy BNNs.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning has shown lots of success in closed, well-defined domains such as games (Chess, Go, StarCraft). The next frontier is real-world scenarios, where setups are numerous and varied. For this, agents need to learn the underlying environment dynamics, so as to robustly generalise to conditions that differ from those they were trained on. Model-based reinforcement learning algorithms, such as MuZero or Dreamer, aim to accomplish this by learning a world model. However, leveraging a world model has not yet consistently shown greater generalisation capabilities compared to model-free alternatives. In this work, we propose improving the data efficiency and generalisation capabilities of MuZero by explicitly incorporating the \\emph{symmetries} of the environment in its world-model architecture. We prove that, so long as the neural networks used by MuZero are equivariant to a particular symmetry group acting on the environment, the entirety of MuZero's action-selection algorithm will also be equivariant to that group. As such, Equivariant MuZero is guaranteed to behave symmetrically in symmetrically-transformed states, and will hence be more data-efficient when learning its world models. We evaluate Equivariant MuZero on procedurally-generated MiniPacman and on Chaser from the ProcGen suite: training on a set of mazes, and then testing on unseen rotated versions, demonstrating the benefits of equivariance. We verify that our improvements hold even when only some of the components of Equivariant MuZero obey strict equivariance, which highlights the robustness of our construction",

These DP models are typically pretrained on large public datasets and then fine-tuned on private downstream datasets that are relatively large and similar in distribution to the pretraining data. However, in many applications including personalization and federated learning, it is crucial to perform well (i) in the few-shot setting, as obtaining large amounts of labeled data may be problematic; and (ii) on datasets from a wide variety of domains for use in various specialist settings. To understand under which conditions few-shot DP can be effective, we perform an exhaustive set of experiments that reveals how the accuracy and vulnerability to attack of few-shot DP image classification models are affected as the number of shots per class, privacy level, model architecture, downstream dataset, and subset of learnable parameters in the model vary. We show that to achieve DP accuracy on par with non-private models, the shots per class must be increased as the privacy level increases. We also show that learning parameter-efficient FiLM adapters under DP is competitive with learning just the final classifier layer or learning all of the network parameters. Finally, we evaluate DP federated learning systems and establish state-of-the-art performance on the challenging FLAIR benchmark",

Then, multiple instances of the pre-trained DVAE model are integrated into a multi-source mixture model with a discrete observation-to-source assignment latent variable. The posterior distributions of both the discrete observation-to-source assignment variable and the continuous DVAE variables representing the sources content/position are estimated using the variational expectation-maximization algorithm, leading to multi-source trajectories estimation. We illustrate the versatility of the proposed MixDVAE model on two tasks: a computer vision task, namely multi-object tracking, and an audio processing task, namely single-channel audio source separation. Experimental results show that the proposed method works well on these two tasks, and outperforms several baseline methods",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Actor-critic algorithms such as DDPG, TD3, and SAC, which are built on Silver's deterministic policy gradient theorem, are among the most successful reinforcement-learning methods, but their mathematical basis is not entirely clear. In particular, the critic networks in these algorithms learn to estimate action-value functions by a \"bootstrapping\" technique based on Bellman error, and it is unclear why this approach works so well in practice, given that Bellman error is only very loosely related to value error, i.e. to the inaccuracy of the action-value estimate. Here we show that policy training in this class of actor-critic methods depends not on the accuracy of the critic's action-value estimate but on how well the critic estimates the gradient of the action-value, which is better assessed using what we call difference error. We show that this difference error is closely related to the Bellman error â a finding which helps to explain why Bellman-based bootstrapping leads to good policies. Further, we show that value error and difference error show different dynamics along on-policy trajectories through state-action space: value error is a low-pass anticausal (i.e., backward-in-time) filter of Bellman error, and therefore accumulates along trajectories, whereas difference error is a high-pass filter of Bellman error. It follows that techniques which reduce the high-frequency Fourier components of the Bellman error may improve policy training even if they increase the actual size of the Bellman errors. These findings help to explain certain aspects of actor-critic methods that are otherwise theoretically puzzling, such as the use of policy (as distinct from exploratory) noise, and they suggest other measures that may improve these methods",

    "abstract": "Minimax optimization has seen a surge in interest with the advent of modern applications such as GANs, and it is inherently more challenging than simple minimization. The difficulty is exacerbated by the training data residing at multiple edge devices or \\textit{clients}, especially when these clients can have heterogeneous datasets and heterogeneous local computation capabilities. We propose a general federated minimax optimization framework that subsumes such settings and several existing methods like Local SGDA. We show that naive aggregation of model updates made by clients running unequal number of local steps can result in optimizing a mismatched objective function -- a phenomenon previously observed in standard federated minimization. To fix this problem, we propose normalizing the client updates by the number of local steps. We analyze the convergence of the proposed algorithm for classes of nonconvex-concave and nonconvex-nonconcave functions and characterize the impact of heterogeneous client data, partial client participation, and heterogeneous local computations. For all the function classes considered, we significantly improve the existing computation and communication complexity results. Experimental results support our theoretical claims",

    "abstract": "Automated video summarization is a vision task that aims to generate concise summaries of lengthy videos. Recent advancements in deep learning have led to highly performant video summarization models; however, there has been a lack of attention given to fairness and unbiased representation in the generated summaries. To bridge this gap, we introduce and analytically define the fair video summarization problem, and demonstrate its connections to the well-established problem of fair clustering. To facilitate fair model development, we also introduce the FairVidSum dataset, which is similar in design to state-of-the-art video summarization datasets such as TVSum and SumMe, but also includes annotations for sensitive attributes and individuals alongside frame importance scores. Finally, we propose the SumBal metric for quantifying the fairness of an outputted video summary. We conduct extensive experiments to benchmark the fairness of various state-of-the-art video summarization models. Our results highlight the need for better models that balance accuracy and fairness to ensure equitable representation and inclusion in summaries. For completeness, we also provide a novel fair-only baseline, FVS-LP, to showcase the fairness-utility gap models can improve upon",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Existing deep-learning based tomographic image reconstruction methods do not provide accurate uncertainty estimates of their reconstructions, hindering their real-world deployment. This paper develops a method, termed as linearised deep image prior (DIP), to estimate the uncertainty associated with reconstructions produced by the DIP with total variation (TV) regularisation. We endow the DIP with conjugate Gaussian-linear model type error-bars computed from a local linearisation of the neural network around its optimised parameters. To preserve conjugacy, we approximate the TV regulariser with a Gaussian surrogate. This approach provides pixel-wise uncertainty estimates and a marginal likelihood objective for hyperparameter optimisation. We demonstrate the method on synthetic data and real-measured high-resolution 2D $\\mu$CT data, and show that it provides superior calibration of uncertainty estimates relative to previous probabilistic formulations of the~DIP.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Deep image prior (DIP) and its variants have shown remarkable potential to solve inverse problems in computational imaging (CI), needing no separate training data. Practical DIP models are often substantially overparameterized. During the learning process, these models first learn the desired visual content and then pick up potential modeling and observational noise, i.e., performing early learning then overfitting. Thus, the practicality of DIP hinges on early stopping (ES) that can capture the transition period. In this regard, most previous DIP works for CI tasks only demonstrate the potential of the models, reporting the peak performance against the ground truth but providing no clue about how to operationally obtain near-peak performance without access to the ground truth. In this paper, we set to break this practicality barrier of DIP, and propose an effective ES strategy that consistently detects near-peak performance across several CI tasks and DIP variants. Simply based on the running variance of DIP intermediate reconstructions, our ES method not only outpaces the existing ones---which only work in very narrow regimes, but also remains effective when combined with methods that try to mitigate overfitting",

However, diffusion models are themselves trained on large datasets, often with noisy annotations, and it remains an open question to which extent these models contribute to downstream classification performance. In particular, it remains unclear if they generalize enough to improve over directly using the additional data of their pre-training process for augmentation. We systematically evaluate a range of existing methods to generate images from diffusion models and study new extensions to assess their benefit for data augmentation. Personalizing diffusion models towards the target data outperforms simpler prompting strategies. However, using the pre-training data of the diffusion model alone, via a simple nearest-neighbor retrieval procedure, leads to even stronger downstream performance. Our study explores the potential of diffusion models in generating new training data, and surprisingly finds that these sophisticated models are not yet able to beat a simple and strong image retrieval baseline on simple downstream vision tasks",

We integrate Bayesian filtering and optimal control into learning the diffusion process, enabling the generation of constrained stochastic processes governed by sparse observations at intermediate stages and terminal constraints.

Accounting for them can greatly improve predictive power when physical resources or computation time is limited. In this paper, we draw on recent theoretical results on the estimation of local function complexity (LFC), derived from the domain of local polynomial smoothing (LPS), to establish a notion of local structural complexity, which is used to develop a model-agnostic active learning (AL) framework. Due to its reliance on pointwise estimates, the LPS model class is not robust and scalable concerning large input space dimensions that typically come along with real-world problems. Here, we derive and estimate the Gaussian process regression (GPR)-based analog of the LPS-based LFC and use it as a substitute in the above framework to make it robust and scalable. We assess the effectiveness of our LFC estimate in an AL application on a prototypical low-dimensional synthetic dataset, before taking on the challenging real-world task of reconstructing a quantum chemical force field for a small organic molecule and demonstrating state-of-the-art performance with a significantly reduced training demand",

    "abstract": "Transferring trained policies and value functions from one task to another, such as one game to another with a different board size, board shape, or more substantial rule changes, is a challenging problem. Popular benchmarks for reinforcement learning (RL), such as Atari games and ProcGen, have limited variety especially in terms of action spaces. Due to a focus on such benchmarks, the development of transfer methods that can also handle changes in action spaces has received relatively little attention. Furthermore, we argue that progress towards more general methods should include benchmarks where new problem instances can be described by domain experts, rather than machine learning experts, using convenient, high-level domain specific languages (DSLs). In addition to enabling end users to more easily describe their problems, user-friendly DSLs also contain relevant task information which can be leveraged to make effective zero-shot transfer plausibly achievable. As an example, we use the Ludii general game system, which includes a highly varied set of over 1000 distinct games described in such a language. We propose a simple baseline approach for transferring fully convolutional policy-value networks, which are used to guide search agents similar to AlphaZero, between any pair of games modelled in this system. Extensive results---including various cases of highly successful zero-shot transfer---are provided for a wide variety of source and target games",

    "abstract": "Capsule Networks have emerged as a powerful class of deep learning architectures, known for robust performance with relatively few parameters compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). However, their inherent efficiency is often overshadowed by their slow, iterative routing mechanisms which establish connections between Capsule layers, posing computational challenges resulting in an inability to scale. In this paper, we introduce a novel, non-iterative routing mechanism, inspired by trainable prototype clustering. This innovative approach aims to mitigate computational complexity, while retaining, if not enhancing, performance efficacy. Furthermore, we harness a shared Capsule subspace, negating the need to project each lower-level Capsule to each higher-level Capsule, thereby significantly reducing memory requisites during training. Our approach demonstrates superior results compared to the current best non-iterative Capsule Network and tests on the Imagewoof dataset, which is too computationally demanding to handle efficiently by iterative approaches.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Gridworlds have been long-utilised in AI research, particularly in reinforcement learning, as they provide simple yet scalable models for many real-world applications such as robot navigation, emergent behaviour, and operations research. We initiate a study of gridworlds using the mathematical framework of reconfigurable systems and state complexes due to Abrams, Ghrist & Peterson. State complexes, a higher-dimensional analogue of state graphs, represent all possible configurations of a system as a single geometric space, thus making them conducive to study using geometric, topological, or combinatorial methods. The main contribution of this work is a modification to the original Abrams, Ghrist & Peterson setup which we introduce to capture agent braiding and thereby more naturally represent the topology of gridworlds. With this modification, the state complexes may exhibit geometric defects (failure of Gromov's Link Condition). Serendipitously, we discover these failures for agent-only cases occur exactly where undesirable or dangerous states appear in the gridworld. Our results therefore provide a novel method for seeking guaranteed safety limitations in discrete task environments with single or multiple agents, and offer useful safety information (in geometric and topological forms) for incorporation in or analysis of machine learning systems. More broadly, our work introduces tools from geometric group theory and combinatorics to the AI community and demonstrates a proof-of-concept for this geometric viewpoint of the task domain through the example of simple environments",

    "title": "Partial Optimal Transport for Support Subset Selection",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In probabilistic terms, optimal transport aims to find a joint distribution that couples two distributions and minimizes the cost of transforming one distribution to another. Any feasible coupling necessarily maintains the support of both distributions. However, maintaining the entire support is not ideal when only a subset of one of the distributions, namely the source, is assumed to align with the other target distribution. For these cases, which are common in machine learning applications, we study the semi-relaxed partial optimal transport problem that relaxes the constraints on the joint distribution allowing it to under-represent a subset of the source by over-representing other subsets of the source by a constant factor. In the discrete distribution case, such as in the case of two samples from continuous random variables, optimal transport with the relaxed constraints is a linear program. When sufficiently relaxed, the solution has a source marginal with only a subset of its original support. We investigate the scaling path of solutions, specifically the relaxed marginal distribution for the source, across different relaxations and show that it is distinct from the solutions from penalty-based semi-relaxed unbalanced optimal transport problems and fully-relaxed partial optimal transport, which have previously been explored. We demonstrate the usefulness of this support subset selection in applications such as color transfer, partial point cloud alignment, and semi-supervised machine learning, where a part of data is curated to have reliable labels and another part is unlabeled or has unreliable labels. Our experiments show that optimal transport under the relaxed constraint can improve the performance of these applications by allowing for more flexible alignment between distributions",

DG leverages multiple source domains for model training, while single domain generalization (SDG) further restricts such setting by exploiting only a single source domain. Nevertheless, both DG and SDG assume that the source domains are fully labeled, which might not be practical in many real world scenarios. In this paper, we present a new problem, i.e., semi-supervised single domain generalization (SS-SDG), which aims to train a model with a partially labeled single source domain to generalize to multiple unseen testing domains. We propose an effective framework to address this problem. In particular, we design a label-free adversarial data augmentation strategy to diversify the source domain, and propose a novel multi-pair FixMatch loss to generalize classifiers to unseen testing domains. Extensive experiments on OfficeHome, PACS and DomainNet20 datasets show that our method surpasses the latest SDG and semi-supervised methods.

Existing approaches have encountered challenges such as style bias towards training domains, insufficient feature-space disentanglement to highlight semantic features, and discriminativeness of the latent space. Additionally, they rely on a confidence-based target outlier detection approach, which can lead to misclassifications when target open samples visually align with the source domain data. In response to these challenges, we present a solution named \\textsc{ODG-Net}. We aim to create a direct open-set classifier within a \\textit{discriminative}, \\textit{unbiased}, and \\textit{disentangled} semantic embedding space. To enrich data density and diversity, we introduce a generative augmentation framework that produces \\textit{style-interpolated} novel domains for closed-set images and novel pseudo-open images by \\textit{interpolating the contents of paired training images}. Our augmentation strategy skillfully utilizes \\textit{disentangled style and content information} to synthesize images effectively. Furthermore, we tackle the issue of style bias by representing all images in relation to all source domain properties, which effectively accentuates complementary visual features. Consequently, we train a multi-class semantic object classifier, incorporating both closed and open class classification capabilities, along with a style classifier to identify style primitives. The joint use of style and semantic classifiers facilitates the disentanglement of the latent space, thereby enhancing the generalization performance of the semantic classifier. To ensure discriminativeness in both closed and open spaces, we optimize the semantic feature space using novel metric losses.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Latent world models allow agents to reason about complex environments with high-dimensional observations. However, adapting to new environments and effectively leveraging previous knowledge remain significant challenges. We present Variational Causal Dynamics (VCD), a structured world model that exploits the invariance of causal mechanisms across environments to achieve fast and modular adaptation. By causally factorising a transition model, VCD is able to identify reusable components across different environments. This is achieved by combining causal discovery and variational inference to learn a latent representation and transition model jointly in an unsupervised manner. Specifically, we optimise the evidence lower bound jointly over a representation model and a transition model structured as a causal graphical model. In evaluations on simulated environments with state and image observations, we show that VCD is able to successfully identify causal variables, and to discover consistent causal structures across different environments. Moreover, given a small number of observations in a previously unseen, intervened environment, VCD is able to identify the sparse changes in the dynamics and to adapt efficiently. In doing so, VCD significantly extends the capabilities of the current state-of-the-art in latent world models while also comparing favourably in terms of prediction accuracy",

    "title": "RCT Rejection Sampling for Causal Estimation Evaluation",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Confounding is a significant obstacle to unbiased estimation of causal effects from observational data. For settings with high-dimensional covariates---such as text data, genomics, or the behavioral social sciences---researchers have proposed methods to adjust for confounding by adapting machine learning methods to the goal of causal estimation. However, empirical evaluation of these adjustment methods has been challenging and limited. In this work, we build on a promising empirical evaluation strategy that simplifies evaluation design and uses real data: subsampling randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to create confounded observational datasets while using the average causal effects from the RCTs as ground-truth. We contribute a new sampling algorithm, which we call RCT rejection sampling, and provide theoretical guarantees that causal identification holds in the observational data to allow for valid comparisons to the ground-truth RCT. Using synthetic data, we show our algorithm indeed results in low bias when oracle estimators are evaluated on the confounded samples, which is not always the case for a previously proposed algorithm. In addition to this identification result, we highlight several finite data considerations for evaluation designers who plan to use RCT rejection sampling on their own datasets. As a proof of concept, we implement an example evaluation pipeline and walk through these finite data considerations with a novel, real-world RCT---which we release publicly---consisting of approximately 70k observations and text data as high-dimensional covariates. Together, these contributions build towards a broader agenda of improved empirical evaluation for causal estimation",

    "abstract": "The emerging availability of various machine learning models creates a great demand to harness the collective intelligence of many independently well-trained models to improve overall performance. Considering the privacy concern and non-negligible communication costs, one-shot federated learning and ensemble learning in a data-free manner attract significant attention. However, conventional ensemble selection approaches are neither training efficient nor applicable to federated learning due to the risk of privacy leakage from local clients; meanwhile, the \"many could be better than all\" principle under data-free constraints makes it even more challenging. Therefore, it becomes crucial to design an effective ensemble selection strategy to find a good subset of the base models as the ensemble team for the federated learning scenario. In this paper, we propose a novel data-free diversity-based framework, DeDES, to address the ensemble selection problem with diversity consideration for models under the one-shot federated learning setting. Experimental results show that our method can achieve both better performance and higher efficiency over 5 datasets, 4 different model structures, and both homogeneous and heterogeneous model groups under four different data-partition strategies",

We refer to this setting as Universal Graph Continual Learning (UGCL), which includes node-unit node classification (NUNC), graph-unit node classification (GUNC), and graph-unit graph classification (GUGC). Our novel method maintains a replay memory of nodes and neighbours to remind the model of past graph structures through distillation. Emphasizing the importance of preserving distinctive graph structures across tasks, we enforce that coarse-to-grain graph representations stay close to previous ones by minimizing our proposed global and local structure losses.

We introduce MERMAIDE, a model-based meta-learning framework to train a principal that can quickly adapt to out-of-distribution agents with different learning strategies and reward functions. We validate this approach step-by-step. First, in a Stackelberg setting with a best-response agent, we show that meta-learning enables quick convergence to the theoretically known Stackelberg equilibrium at test time, although noisy observations severely increase the sample complexity. We then show that our model-based meta-learning approach is cost-effective in intervening on bandit agents with unseen explore-exploit strategies.

In this method, the model weights are initially computed by using the current task dataset. Next, the dataset of the current task is merged with the stored samples from the earlier tasks and the model weights are updated using the combined dataset. This aids in preventing the model weights converging to the optimal parameters of the current task and enables the preservation of information from earlier tasks. We choose to adapt our technique to graph data structure and the task of node classification on graphs.

Sparse regression and greedy algorithms have emerged as popular approaches to tackle this challenge.

In this article, we present a novel algorithm that strikes a balance between comprehensiveness and efficiency in equation learning. Inspired by stepwise regression, our approach combines the coefficient of determination, $R^2$, and the Bayesian model evidence, $p(y|\\mathcal{M})$, in a novel way. Through three extensive numerical experiments involving random polynomials and dynamical systems, we compare our method against two standard approaches, four state-of-the-art methods, and bidirectional stepwise regression incorporating $p(y|\\mathcal{M})$. The results demonstrate that our less greedy algorithm surpasses all other methods in terms of identification accuracy. Furthermore, we discover a heuristic approach to mitigate the overfitting penalty associated with $R^2$ and propose an equation learning procedure solely based on $R^2$, which achieves high rates of exact equation recovery",

    "abstract": "Due to the high cost and time-consuming nature of collecting labeled data, having insufficient labeled data is a common challenge that can negatively impact the performance of deep learning models when applied to real-world applications. Active learning (AL) aims to reduce the cost and time required for obtaining labeled data by selecting valuable samples during model training. However, recent works have pointed out the performance unreliability of existing AL algorithms for deep learning (DL) architectures under different scenarios, which manifests as their performance being comparable (or worse) to that of basic random selection. This behavior compromises the applicability of these approaches. We address this problem by proposing a theoretically motivated AL framework for DL architectures. We demonstrate that the most valuable samples for the model are those that, unsurprisingly, improve its performance on the entire dataset, most of which is unlabeled, and present a framework to efficiently estimate such performance (or loss) via influence functions, pseudo labels and diversity selection. Experimental results show that the proposed reliable active learning via influence functions (RALIF) can consistently outperform the random selection baseline as well as other existing and state-of-the art active learning approaches",

    "abstract": "In contrast to training traditional machine learning~(ML) models in data centers, federated learning~(FL) trains ML models over local datasets contained on resource-constrained heterogeneous edge devices. Existing FL algorithms aim to learn a single global model for all participating devices, which may not be helpful to all devices participating in the training due to the heterogeneity of the data across the devices. Recently, Hanzely and Richt\\'{a}rik (2020) proposed a new formulation for training personalized FL models aimed at balancing the trade-off between the traditional global model and the local models that could be trained by individual devices using their private data only. They derived a new algorithm, called {\\em loopless gradient descent}~(L2GD), to solve it and showed that this algorithms leads to improved communication complexity guarantees in regimes when more personalization is required. In this paper, we equip their L2GD algorithm with a {\\em bidirectional} compression mechanism to further reduce the communication bottleneck between the local devices and the server. Unlike other compression-based algorithms used in the FL-setting, our compressed L2GD algorithm operates on a probabilistic communication protocol, where communication does not happen on a fixed schedule. Moreover, our compressed L2GD algorithm maintains a similar convergence rate as vanilla SGD without compression. To empirically validate the efficiency of our algorithm, we perform diverse numerical experiments on both convex and non-convex problems and using various compression techniques",

Concept-based explanations have emerged as a superior approach that is more interpretable than feature attribution estimates such as pixel saliency.

To address this, we propose a novel post-hoc unsupervised method that automatically uncovers the concepts learned by deep models during training. By decomposing the latent space of a layer in singular vectors and refining them by unsupervised clustering, we uncover concept vectors aligned with directions of high variance that are relevant to the model prediction, and that point to semantically distinct concepts. Our extensive experiments reveal that the majority of our concepts are readily understandable to humans, exhibit coherency, and bear relevance to the task at hand. Moreover, we showcase the practical utility of our method in dataset exploration, where our concept vectors successfully identify outlier training samples affected by various confounding factors.

This ensures that the model incorporates knowledge from the newly encountered domains, without catastrophically forgetting the previously seen domains.

We then fit a hidden Markov model (HMM) over the resulting sequences of metrics. The HMM represents training as a stochastic process of transitions between latent states, providing an intuitive overview of significant changes during training.

    "abstract": "Machine learning models have shone in a variety of domains and attracted increasing attention from both the security and the privacy communities. One important yet worrying question is: Will training models under the differential privacy (DP) constraint have an unfavorable impact on their adversarial robustness? While previous works have postulated that privacy comes at the cost of worse robustness, we give the first theoretical analysis to show that DP models can indeed be robust and accurate, even sometimes more robust than their naturally-trained non-private counterparts. We observe three key factors that influence the privacy-robustness-accuracy tradeoff: (1) hyper-parameters for DP optimizers are critical; (2) pre-training on public data significantly mitigates the accuracy and robustness drop; (3) choice of DP optimizers makes a difference. With these factors set properly, we achieve 90\\% natural accuracy, 72\\% robust accuracy ($+9\\%$ than the non-private model) under $l_2(0.5)$ attack, and 69\\% robust accuracy ($+16\\%$ than the non-private model) with pre-trained SimCLRv2 model under $l_\\infty(4/255)$ attack on CIFAR10 with $\\epsilon=2$. In fact, we show both theoretically and empirically that DP models are Pareto optimal on the accuracy-robustness tradeoff. Empirically, the robustness of DP models is consistently observed across various datasets and models. We believe our encouraging results are a significant step towards training models that are private as well as robust",

    "abstract": "Neural Persistence is a prominent measure for quantifying neural network complexity, proposed in the emerging field of topological data analysis in deep learning. In this work, however, we find both theoretically and empirically that the variance of network weights and spatial concentration of large weights are the main factors that impact neural persistence. Whilst this captures useful information for linear classifiers, we find that no relevant spatial structure is present in later layers of deep neural networks, making neural persistence roughly equivalent to the variance of weights. Additionally, the proposed averaging procedure across layers for deep neural networks does not consider interaction between layers. Based on our analysis, we propose an extension of the filtration underlying neural persistence to the whole neural network instead of single layers, which is equivalent to calculating neural persistence on one particular matrix. This yields our deep graph persistence measure, which implicitly incorporates persistent paths through the network and alleviates variance-related issues through standardisation.

    "title": "Replay-enhanced Continual Reinforcement Learning",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Replaying past experiences has proven to be a highly effective approach for averting catastrophic forgetting in supervised continual learning. However, some crucial factors are still largely ignored, making it vulnerable to serious failure, when used as a solution to forgetting in continual reinforcement learning, even in the context of perfect memory where all data of previous tasks are accessible in the current task. On the one hand, since most reinforcement learning algorithms are not invariant to the reward scale, the previously well-learned tasks (with high rewards) may appear to be more salient to the current learning process than the current task (with small initial rewards). This causes the agent to concentrate on those salient tasks at the expense of generality on the current task. On the other hand, offline learning on replayed tasks while learning a new task may induce a distributional shift between the dataset and the learned policy on old tasks, resulting in forgetting. In this paper, we introduce RECALL, a replay-enhanced method that greatly improves the plasticity of existing replay-based methods on new tasks while effectively avoiding the recurrence of catastrophic forgetting in continual reinforcement learning. RECALL leverages adaptive normalization on approximate targets and policy distillation on old tasks to enhance generality and stability, respectively. Extensive experiments on the Continual World benchmark show that RECALL performs significantly better than purely perfect memory replay, and achieves comparable or better overall performance against state-of-the-art continual learning methods",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The A* algorithm is commonly used to solve NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems. When provided with a completely informed heuristic function, A* can solve such problems in time complexity that is polynomial in the solution cost and branching factor. In light of this fact, we examine a line of recent publications that propose fitting deep neural networks to the completely informed heuristic function. We assert that these works suffer from inherent scalability limitations since --- under the assumption of NP $\\not \\subseteq$ P/poly --- such approaches result in either (a) network sizes that scale super-polynomially in the instance sizes or (b) the accuracy of the fitted deep neural networks scales inversely with the instance sizes. Complementing our theoretical claims, we provide experimental results for three representative NP-hard search problems. The results suggest that fitting deep neural networks to informed heuristic functions requires network sizes that grow quickly with the problem instance size. We conclude by suggesting that the research community should focus on scalable methods for integrating heuristic search with machine learning, as opposed to methods relying on informed heuristic estimation",

    "abstract": "In this work, we address the problem of long-distance navigation for battery electric vehicles (BEVs), where one or more charging sessions are required to reach the intended destination. We consider the availability and performance of the charging stations to be unknown and stochastic, and develop a combinatorial semi-bandit framework for exploring the road network to learn the parameters of the queue time and charging power distributions. Within this framework, we first outline a method for transforming the road network graph into a graph of feasible paths between charging stations to handle the constrained combinatorial optimization problem in an efficient way. Then, for the feasibility graph, we use a Bayesian approach to model the stochastic edge weights, utilizing conjugate priors for the one-parameter exponential and two-parameter gamma distributions, the latter of which is novel to multi-armed bandit literature. Finally, we apply combinatorial versions of Thompson Sampling, BayesUCB and Epsilon-greedy to the problem. We demonstrate the performance of our framework on long-distance navigation problem instances in large-scale country-sized road networks, with simulation experiments in Norway, Sweden and Finland",

These properties, however, come at the cost of heavy restrictions on the architecture. Due to these limitations, modeling multi-modal probability distributions can yield poor results even with low-dimensional data. Additionally, typical flow architectures employed on real image datasets produce samples with visible aliasing artifacts and limited variation. The latent decomposition of flow-models also falls short on that of competing methods, with uneven contribution to a decoded image. In this work we build an invertible generative model using conditional normalizing flows in a hierarchical fashion to circumvent the aforementioned limitations. We show that we can achieve superior sample quality among flow-based models with fewer parameters compared to the state of the art.

We argue that representations can be evaluated through the lens of expressiveness and learnability. We propose to use the Intrinsic Dimension (ID) to assess expressiveness and introduce Cluster Learnability (CL) to assess learnability. CL is measured in terms of the performance of a KNN classifier trained to predict labels obtained by clustering the representations with K-means. We thus combine CL and ID into a single predictor â CLID. Through a large-scale empirical study with a diverse family of SSL algorithms, we find that CLID better correlates with in-distribution model performance than other competing recent evaluation schemes. We also benchmark CLID on out-of-domain generalization, where CLID serves as a predictor of the transfer performance of SSL models on several visual classification tasks, yielding improvements with respect to the competing baselines",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "This paper addresses a gap in the current state of the art by providing a solution for modeling causal relationships that evolve over time and occur at different time scales. Specifically, we introduce the multiscale non-stationary directed acyclic graph (MN-DAG), a framework for modeling multivariate time series data. Our contribution is twofold. Firstly, we expose a probabilistic generative model by leveraging results from spectral and causality theories. Our model allows sampling an MN-DAG according to user-specified priors on the time-dependence and multiscale properties of the causal graph. Secondly, we devise a Bayesian method named Multiscale Non-stationary Causal Structure Learner (MN-CASTLE) that uses stochastic variational inference to estimate MN-DAGs. The method also exploits information from the local partial correlation between time series over different time resolutions. The data generated from an MN-DAG reproduces well-known features of time series in different domains, such as volatility clustering and serial correlation. Additionally, we show the superior performance of MN-CASTLE on synthetic data with different multiscale and non-stationary properties compared to baseline models. Finally, we apply MN-CASTLE to identify the drivers of the natural gas prices in the US market. Causal relationships have strengthened during the COVID-19 outbreak and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, a fact that baseline methods fail to capture. MN-CASTLE identifies the causal impact of critical economic drivers on natural gas prices, such as seasonal factors, economic uncertainty, oil prices, and gas storage deviations",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) has recently achieved tremendous empirical advancements in learning image representation. However, our understanding of the principle behind learning such a representation is still limited. This work shows that joint-embedding SSL approaches learn a representation of image patches, which reflects their co-occurrence. Such a connection to co-occurrence modeling can be established formally, and it supplements the prevailing invariance perspective. We empirically show that learning a representation for fixed-scale patches and aggregating local patch representations as the image representation achieves similar or even better results than the baseline methods. We denote this process as {\\it BagSSL}. Even with $32\\times 32$ patch representation, BagSSL achieves $62\\%$ top-1 linear probing accuracy on ImageNet. On the other hand, with a multi-scale pretrained model, we show that the whole image embedding is approximately the average of local patch embeddings. While the SSL representation is relatively invariant at the global scale, we show that locality is preserved when we zoom into local patch-level representation. Further, we show that patch representation aggregation can improve various SOTA baseline methods by a large margin. The patch representation is considerably easier to understand, and this work makes a step to demystify self-supervised representation learning",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "While active learning (AL) techniques have demonstrated the potential to produce high-performance models with fewer labeled data, their application remains limited due to the necessity for multiple rounds of interaction with annotators. This paper studies the problem of one-round AL, which aims at selecting a subset of unlabeled points and querying their labels \\emph{all at once}. A fundamental challenge is how to measure the utility of different choices of labeling queries for learning a target model. Our key idea is to learn such a utility metric from a small initial labeled set. We demonstrate that our approach leads to state-of-the-art performance on various AL benchmarks and is more robust to the lack of initial labeled data. In addition to algorithmic development and evaluation, we introduce a novel metric for quantifying `\\emph{utility transferability}' -- the degree of correlation between the performance changes of two learning algorithms due to variations in training data selection. Previous studies have often observed a notable utility transferability between models, even those with differing complexities. Such transferability enabled our approach, as well as other techniques such as coresets, hyperparameter tuning, and data valuation, to scale up to more sophisticated target models by substituting them with smaller proxy models. Nevertheless, utility transferability has not yet been rigorously defined within a formal mathematical framework, a gap that our work addresses innovatively. We further propose two Monte Carlo-based methods for efficiently comparing utility transferability for different proxy models, thereby facilitating a more informed selection of proxy models",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great promise with algorithms learning in environments with large state and action spaces purely from scalar reward signals. A crucial challenge for current deep RL algorithms is that they require a tremendous amount of environment interactions for learning. This can be infeasible in situations where such interactions are expensive, such as in robotics. Offline RL algorithms try to address this issue by bootstrapping the learning process from existing logged data without needing to interact with the environment from the very beginning. While online RL algorithms are typically evaluated as a function of the number of environment interactions, there isn't a single established protocol for evaluating offline RL methods. In this paper, we propose a sequential approach to evaluate offline RL algorithms as a function of the training set size and thus by their data efficiency. Sequential evaluation provides valuable insights into the data efficiency of the learning process and the robustness of algorithms to distribution changes in the dataset while also harmonizing the visualization of the offline and online learning phases. Our approach is generally applicable and easy to implement. We compare several existing offline RL algorithms using this approach and present insights from a variety of tasks and offline datasets",

In this work, we investigate how XAI methods can be used for exploring and visualizing the diversity of feature representations learned by Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs). Our goal is to provide a global understanding of BNNs by making their decision-making strategies a) visible and tangible through feature visualizations and b) quantitatively measurable with a distance measure learned by contrastive learning. Our work provides new insights into the posterior distribution in terms of human-understandable feature information with regard to the underlying decision-making strategies. The main findings of our work are the following: 1) global XAI methods can be applied to explain the diversity of decision-making strategies of BNN instances, 2) Monte Carlo dropout with commonly used Dropout rates exhibit increased diversity in feature representations compared to the multimodal posterior approximation of MultiSWAG, 3) the diversity of learned feature representations highly correlates with the uncertainty estimate for the output and 4) the inter-mode diversity of the multimodal posterior decreases as the network width increases, while the intra-mode diversity increases.

    "abstract": "The gold standard for the identification of causal effects are randomized controlled trials (RCT), but RCTs may not always be feasible to conduct. When treatments depend on a threshold however, such as the blood sugar threshold for diabetes diagnosis, we can still sometimes estimate causal effects with regression discontinuities (RDs). RDs are valid when units just above and below the threshold have the same distribution of covariates and thus no confounding in the presence of noise, establishing an as-if randomization. In practice however, implementing RD studies can be difficult as identifying treatment thresholds require considerable domain expertise -- furthermore, the thresholds may differ across subgroups (e.g., the blood sugar threshold for diabetes may differ across demographics), and ignoring these differences can lower statistical power. Finding the thresholds and to whom they apply is an important problem currently solved manually by domain experts, and data-driven approaches are needed when domain expertise is not sufficient. Here, we introduce Regression Discontinuity SubGroup Discovery (RDSGD), a machine-learning method that identifies statistically powerful and interpretable subgroups for RD thresholds. Using a medical claims dataset with over 60 million patients, we apply RDSGD to multiple clinical contexts and identify subgroups with increased compliance to treatment assignment thresholds. As treatment thresholds matter for many diseases and policy decisions, RDSGD can be a powerful tool for discovering new avenues for causal estimation",

ISL splits the data into different environments, and learns a structure that is invariant to the target across different environments by imposing a consistency constraint. The proposed aggregation mechanism then selects the classifier based on a graph structure that reflects the causal mechanisms in the data more accurately compared to the structures learnt from individual environments. Furthermore, we extend ISL to a self-supervised learning setting, where accurate causal structure discovery does not rely on any labels. Self-supervised ISL utilizes proposals for invariant causality, by iteratively setting different nodes as targets. On synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that ISL accurately discovers the causal structure, outperforms alternative methods, and yields superior generalization for datasets with significant distribution shifts",

While there are recent works that successfully tackle these strong assumptions, they either require the gap assumptions that could only be satisfied by part of MDPs or use the behavior regularization that makes the optimality of learned policy even intractable. To solve this challenge, we provide finite-sample guarantees for a simple algorithm based on marginalized importance sampling (MIS), showing that sample-efficient offline RL for general MDPs is possible with only a partial coverage dataset (instead of assuming a dataset covering all possible policies) and weak realizable function classes (assuming function classes containing simply one function) given additional side information of a covering distribution. We demonstrate that the covering distribution trades off prior knowledge of the optimal trajectories against the coverage requirement of the dataset, revealing the effect of this inductive bias in the learning processes. Furthermore, when considering the exploratory dataset, our analysis shows that only realizable function classes are enough for learning near-optimal policies, even with no side information on the additional coverage distributions",

Knowing this distribution allows analyzing the treatment's expected utility or quantifying the uncertainty regarding a treatment's effect. This information is essential for prescribing optimal treatments. The ability of a model to predict accurate individual treatment effect distributions is captured by its likelihood. In light of this, we propose a novel neural architecture, NOFLITE, that uses normalizing flows to directly optimize this likelihood, while simultaneously learning flexible estimates of the individual treatment effect distribution.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We investigate the convergence of stochastic mirror descent (SMD) under interpolation in relatively smooth and smooth convex optimization. In relatively smooth convex optimization we provide new convergence guarantees for SMD with a constant stepsize. For smooth convex optimization we propose a new adaptive stepsize scheme --- the mirror stochastic Polyak stepsize (mSPS). Notably, our convergence results in both settings do not make bounded gradient assumptions or bounded variance assumptions, and we show convergence to a neighborhood that vanishes under interpolation. Consequently, these results correspond to the first convergence guarantees under interpolation for the exponentiated gradient algorithm for fixed or adaptive stepsizes. mSPS generalizes the recently proposed stochastic Polyak stepsize (SPS) (Loizou et al. 2021) to mirror descent and remains both practical and efficient for modern machine learning applications while inheriting the benefits of mirror descent. We complement our results with experiments across various supervised learning tasks and different instances of SMD, demonstrating the effectiveness of mSPS",

These techniques, however, extend receptive fields to the complete graph, at substantial computational cost and risking a change in the inductive biases of conventional GNNs, or require complex architecture adjustments. As a conservative alternative, we use positional encodings to expand receptive fields to r-hop neighborhoods. More specifically, our method augments the input graph with additional nodes/edges and uses positional encodings as node and/or edge features. We thus modify graphs before inputting them to a downstream GNN model, instead of modifying the model itself. This makes our method model-agnostic, i.e., compatible with any of the existing GNN architectures. We also provide examples of positional encodings that are lossless with a one-to-one map between the original and the modified graphs. We demonstrate that extending receptive fields via positional encodings and a virtual fully- connected node significantly improves GNN performance and alleviates over-squashing using small r. We obtain improvements on a variety of models and datasets and reach competitive performance using traditional GNNs or graph Transformers",

    "abstract": "While current deep learning algorithms have been successful for a wide variety of artificial intelligence (AI) tasks, including those involving structured image data, they present deep neurophysiological conceptual issues due to their reliance on the gradients that are computed by backpropagation of errors (backprop). Gradients are required to obtain synaptic weight adjustments but require knowledge of feed forward activities in order to conduct backward propagation, a biologically implausible process. This is known as the \"weight transport problem''. Therefore, in this work, we present a more biologically plausible approach towards solving the weight transport problem for image data. This approach, which we name the error-kernel driven activation alignment (EKDAA) algorithm, accomplishes through the introduction of locally derived error transmission kernels and error maps. Like standard deep learning networks, EKDAA performs the standard forward process via weights and activation functions; however, its backward error computation involves adaptive error kernels that propagate local error signals through the network. The efficacy of EKDAA is demonstrated by performing visual-recognition tasks on the Fashion MNIST, CIFAR-10 and SVHN benchmarks, along with demonstrating its ability to extract visual features from natural color images. Furthermore, in order to demonstrate its non-reliance on gradient computations, results are presented for an EKDAA-trained CNN that employs a non-differentiable activation function",

In this paper, we propose a simple learning rule for full-rank DPPs based on a minorization-maximization (MM) algorithm, which monotonically increases the likelihood in each iteration. We show that our minorizer of the MM algorithm provides a tighter lower-bound compared to an existing method locally. We also generalize the algorithm for further acceleration.

Despite emerging empirical evidence, theoretical study on why RL helps is still at its early stage. This paper presents the first systematic study on policy optimization methods for online CO problems. We show that online CO problems can be naturally formulated as latent Markov Decision Processes (LMDPs), and prove convergence bounds on natural policy gradient (NPG) for solving LMDPs. Furthermore, our theory explains the benefit of curriculum learning: it can find a strong sampling policy and reduce the distribution shift, a critical quantity that governs the convergence rate in our theorem. For a canonical online CO problem, the Best Choice Problem (BCP), we formally prove that distribution shift is reduced exponentially with curriculum learning even if the curriculum is a randomly generated BCP on a smaller scale. Our theory also shows we can simplify the curriculum learning scheme used in prior work from multi-step to single-step. Lastly, we provide extensive experiments on the Best Choice Problem, Online Knapsack, and AdWords to verify our findings",

In particular, bit-flip weight perturbations in quantized networks can significantly degrade performance, underscoring the need to improve DNN resilience. In this paper, we introduce a training mechanism to learn the quantization range of different DNN layers to enhance DNN robustness against bit-flip errors on the model parameters. The proposed approach, called weight clipping-aware training (WCAT), minimizes the quantization range while preserving performance, striking a balance between the two. Our experimental results on different models and datasets showcase that DNNs trained with WCAT can tolerate a high amount of noise while keeping the accuracy close to the baseline model. Moreover, we show that our method significantly enhances DNN robustness against adversarial bit-flip attacks. Finally, when considering the energy-reliability trade-off inherent in on-chip SRAM memories, we observe that WCAT consistently improves the Pareto frontier of test accuracy and energy consumption across diverse models",

However, these approaches have had limited success in enabling general RL agents. Motivated by this, we introduce \"Feature- Attending Recurrent Modules\" (FARM), an architecture for learning state representations that relies on simple, broadly applicable inductive biases for capturing spatial and temporal regularities. FARM learns a state representation that is distributed across multiple modules that each attend to spatiotemporal features with an expressive feature attention mechanism. We show that this improves an RL agent's ability to generalize across object-centric tasks. We study task suites in both 2D and 3D environments and find that FARM better generalizes compared to competing architectures that leverage attention or multiple modules",

Our method guarantees risk control at any user-specified level even when the underlying data distribution shifts drastically, even adversarially, over time in an unknown fashion. The technique we propose is highly flexible as it can be applied with any base online learning algorithm (e.g., a deep neural network trained online), requiring minimal implementation effort and essentially zero additional computational cost. We further extend our approach to control multiple risks simultaneously, so the prediction sets we generate are valid for all given risks. To demonstrate the utility of our method, we conduct experiments on real-world tabular time-series data sets showing that the proposed method rigorously controls various natural risks. Furthermore, we show how to construct valid intervals for an online image-depth estimation problem that previous sequential calibration schemes cannot handle",

To extend beyond the single domain formulation and towards more realistic learning scenarios, we explore model design spaces beyond MLPs, i.e., transformer backbones, which provide flexibility where attention layers govern interactions among treatments and covariates to exploit structural similarities of potential outcomes for confounding control. Through careful model design, Transformers as Treatment Effect Estimators (TransTEE) is proposed. We show empirically that TransTEE can: (1) serve as a general-purpose treatment effect estimator which significantly outperforms competitive baselines on a variety of challenging TEE problems (e.g., discrete, continuous, structured, or dosage-associated treatments.) and is applicable to both when covariates are tabular and when they consist of structural data (e.g., texts, graphs); (2) yield multiple advantages: compatibility with propensity score modeling, parameter efficiency, robustness to continuous treatment value distribution shifts, explainable in covariate adjustment, and real-world utility in auditing pre-trained language models",

    "abstract": "Statistical heterogeneity severely limits the performance of federated learning (FL), motivating several explorations e.g., FedProx, MOON and FedDyn, to alleviate this problem. Despite effectiveness, their considered scenario generally requires samples from almost all classes during the local training of each client, although some covariate shifts may exist among clients. In fact, the natural case of partially class-disjoint data (PCDD), where each client contributes a few classes (instead of all classes) of samples, is practical yet underexplored. Specifically, the unique collapse and invasion characteristics of PCDD can induce the biased optimization direction in local training, which prevents the efficiency of federated learning. To address this dilemma, we propose a manifold reshaping approach called FedMR to calibrate the feature space of local training. Our FedMR adds two interplaying losses to the vanilla federated learning: one is the intra-class loss to decorrelate feature dimensions for anti-collapse; and the other one is the inter-class loss to guarantee the proper margin among categories in the feature expansion. We conduct extensive experiments on a range of datasets to demonstrate that our FedMR achieves much higher accuracy and better communication efficiency",

Learning a forward dynamics model in combination with a latent policy has been shown to solve these issues. However, the limited supervision in the IfO scenario can lead to mode collapse when learning the generative forward dynamics model and the corresponding latent policy. In this paper, we analyze the mode collapse problem in this setting and show that it is caused by a combination of deterministic expert data and bad initialization of the models. Under the assumption of piecewise continuous system dynamics, we propose ILPO-MP, a method to prevent the mode collapse using clustering of expert transitions to impose a mode prior on the generative model and the latent policy.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Model sparsity is a promising approach to reducing parameters or FLOPs of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Compared to unstructured or coarse-grained structured sparsity, fine-grained structured sparsity, e.g., N:M sparse pattern, can achieve a better balance between accuracy and efficiency on general computing platforms like CPUs and GPUs. In particular, the 2:4 sparsity can accelerate CNN inference by 2$\\times$ speed and with negligible accuracy drop. However, N:M sparsity needs to be supported by GPU within specific hardware circuits and hardly achieves significant speedups on common GPUs. To accelerate CNNs with general-purposed computing resources and simultaneously retain the model accuracy as much as possible, this paper proposes complementary sparsity (CS). CS denotes that only one weight can be retained for weights spaced at the same distance. On the one hand, CS features high mask flexibility, which is naturally favorable to high model accuracy. Moreover, we propose a CS-specific sparse training method to improve CS-based CNNs' accuracy under high parameter sparsities ($>$75\\%). On the other hand, CS itself is memory-access balanced and robust to pattern hyperparameters, which can be utilized to speedup CS-based convolution computation on CPUs and common GPUs. We thus propose a CS convolution parallel computing algorithm that adapts to common GPUs without sparse tensor cores. Experimental results show that compared to other sparsity patterns, the proposed CS can achieve the optimal trade-off in terms of accuracy and latency for CPUs and common GPUs, respectively.

With $k=1$, we localize individual neurons that are highly relevant for a particular feature and perform a number of case studies to illustrate general properties of LLMs. In particular, we show that early layers make use of sparse combinations of neurons to represent many features in superposition, that middle layers have seemingly dedicated neurons to represent higher-level contextual features, and that increasing scale causes representational sparsity to increase on average, but there are multiple types of scaling dynamics.

In PoT, the computation can be delegated to a program interpreter, which is used to execute the generated program, thus decoupling complex computation from reasoning and language understanding. We evaluate PoT on five math word problem datasets and three financial-QA datasets in both few-shot and zero-shot settings. We find that PoT has an average performance gain over CoT of around 12% across all datasets. By combining PoT with self-consistency decoding, we can achieve extremely strong performance on all the math datasets and financial datasets. All of our data and code will be released",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Privacy concerns grow with the success of modern deep learning models, especially when the training set contains sensitive data. Differentially private generative model (DPGM) can serve as a solution to circumvent such concerns by generating data that are distributionally similar to the original data yet with differential privacy (DP) guarantees. While GAN has attracted major attention, existing DPGMs based on flow generative models are limited and only developed on low-dimensional tabular datasets. The capability of exact density estimation makes the flow model exceptional when density estimation is of interest. In this work, we will first show that it is challenging (or even infeasible) to train a DP-flow via DP-SGD, i.e. the workhorse algorithm for private deep learning, on high-dimensional image sets with acceptable utility, and then we give an effective solution by reducing the generation from the pixel space to a lower dimensional latent space. We show the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed method via extensive experiments, where the proposed method achieves a significantly better privacy-utility trade-off compared to existing alternatives. Notably, our method is the first DPGM to scale to high-resolution image sets (up to 256 Ã 256). Our code is available at https://github.com/dihjiang/DP-LFlow",

In this paper, we study the generalization performance of a binary classifier trained on a dataset privatized under the label differential privacy achieved by the randomized response mechanism. Particularly, we establish minimax lower bounds for the excess risks of the deep neural network plug-in classifier, theoretically quantifying how privacy guarantee $\\epsilon$ affects its generalization performance. Our theoretical result shows: (1) the randomized response mechanism slows down the convergence of excess risk by lessening the multiplicative constant term compared with the non-private case $(\\epsilon=\\infty)$; (2) as $\\epsilon$ decreases, the optimal structure of the neural network should be smaller for better generalization performance; (3) the convergence of its excess risk is guaranteed even if $\\epsilon$ is adaptive to the size of training sample $n$ at a rate slower than $O(n^{-1/2})$.

    "abstract": "Replay methods are known to be successful at mitigating catastrophic forgetting in continual learning scenarios despite having limited access to historical data. However, storing historical data is cheap in many real-world settings, yet replaying all historical data is often prohibited due to processing time constraints. In such settings, we propose that continual learning systems should learn the time to learn and schedule which tasks to replay at different time steps. We first demonstrate the benefits of our proposal by using Monte Carlo tree search to find a proper replay schedule, and show that the found replay schedules can outperform fixed scheduling policies when combined with various replay methods in different continual learning settings. Additionally, we propose a framework for learning replay scheduling policies with reinforcement learning. We show that the learned policies can generalize better in new continual learning scenarios compared to equally replaying all seen tasks, without added computational cost. Our study reveals the importance of learning the time to learn in continual learning, which brings current research closer to real-world needs",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Decentralized learning algorithms enable the training of deep learning models over large distributed datasets, without the need for a central server. The current state-of-the-art decentralized algorithms mostly assume the data distributions to be Independent and Identically Distributed (IID). In practical scenarios, the distributed datasets can have significantly different data distributions across the agents. This paper focuses on improving decentralized learning on non-IID data with minimal compute and memory overheads. We propose Neighborhood Gradient Mean (NGM), a novel decentralized learning algorithm that modifies the local gradients of each agent using self- and cross-gradient information. In particular, the proposed method averages the local gradients with model-variant or data-variant cross-gradients based on the communication budget. Model-variant cross-gradients are derivatives of the received neighbors' model parameters with respect to the local dataset. Data-variant cross-gradient derivatives of the local model with respect to its neighbors' datasets. The data-variant cross-gradients are aggregated through an additional communication round. We theoretically analyze the convergence characteristics of NGM and demonstrate its efficiency on non-IID data sampled from various vision and language datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method either remains competitive or outperforms (by 0-6%) the existing state-of-the-art (SoTA) decentralized learning algorithm on non-IID data with significantly less compute and memory requirements. Further, we show that the model-variant cross-gradient information available locally at each agent can improve the performance on non-IID data by 3-20% without additional communication costs",

For computational reasons, the Sliced Wasserstein (SW) distance was introduced as an alternative to the Wasserstein distance, and has seen uses for training generative Neural Networks (NNs). While convergence of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) has been observed practically in such a setting, there is to our knowledge no theoretical guarantee for this observation. Leveraging recent works on convergence of SGD on non-smooth and non-convex functions by Bianchi et al. (2022), we aim to bridge that knowledge gap, and provide a realistic context under which fixed-step SGD trajectories for the SW loss on NN parameters converge. More precisely, we show that the trajectories approach the set of (sub)-gradient flow equations as the step decreases. Under stricter assumptions, we show a much stronger convergence result for noised and projected SGD schemes, namely that the long-run limits of the trajectories approach a set of generalised critical points of the loss function",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Neurally-parameterized Structural Causal Models in the Pearlian notion to causality, referred to as NCM, were recently introduced as a step towards next-generation learning systems. However, said NCM are only concerned with the learning aspect of causal inference and totally miss out on the architecture aspect. That is, actual causal inference within NCM is intractable in that the NCM won't return an answer to a query in polynomial time. This insight follows as corollary to the more general statement on the intractability of arbitrary structural causal model (SCM) parameterizations, which we prove in this work through classical 3-SAT reduction. Since future learning algorithms will be required to deal with both high dimensional data and highly complex mechanisms governing the data, we ultimately believe work on tractable inference for causality to be decisive. We also show that not all \"causal\" models are created equal. More specifically, there are models capable of answering causal queries that are not SCM, which we refer to as partially causal models (PCM). We provide a tabular taxonomy in terms of tractability properties for all of the different model families, namely correlation-based, PCM and SCM. To conclude our work, we also provide some initial ideas on how to overcome parts of the intractability of causal inference with SCM by showing an example of how parameterizing an SCM with SPN modules can at least allow for tractable mechanisms. With this work we hope that our insights can raise awareness for this novel research direction since achieving success with causality in real world downstream tasks will not only depend on learning correct models but also require having the practical ability to gain access to model inferences",

In this work, we observe that many existing self-supervised learning algorithms can be both unified and generalized when seen through the lens of equivariant representations. Specifically, we introduce a general framework we call Homomorphic Self-Supervised Learning, and theoretically show how it may subsume the use of input-augmentations provided an augmentation-homomorphic feature extractor. We validate this theory experimentally for simple augmentations, demonstrate the necessity of representational structure for feature-space SSL, and further empirically explore how the parameters of this framework relate to those of traditional augmentation-based self-supervised learning.

    "abstract": "Our study is motivated by robotics, where when dealing with robots or other physical systems, we often need to balance competing concerns of relying on complex, multimodal data coming from a variety of sensors with a general lack of large representative datasets. Despite the complexity of modern robotic platforms and the need for multimodal interaction, there has been little research on integrating more than two modalities in a low data regime with the real-world constraint that sensors fail due to obstructions or adverse conditions. In this work, we consider a case in which natural language is used as a retrieval query against objects, represented across multiple modalities, in a physical environment. We introduce extended multimodal alignment (EMMA), a method that learns to select the appropriate object while jointly refining modality-specific embeddings through a geometric (distance-based) loss. In contrast to prior work, our approach is able to incorporate an arbitrary number of views (modalities) of a particular piece of data.

    "title": "Worst-case Feature Risk Minimization for Data-Efficient Learning",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Deep learning models typically require massive amounts of annotated data to train a strong model for a task of interest. However, data annotation is time-consuming and costly. How to use labeled data from a related but distinct domain, or just a few samples to train a satisfactory model are thus important questions. To achieve this goal, models should resist overfitting to the specifics of the training data in order to generalize well to new data. This paper proposes a novel Worst-case Feature Risk Minimization (WFRM) method that helps improve model generalization. Specifically, we tackle a minimax optimization problem in feature space at each training iteration. Given the input features, we seek the feature perturbation that maximizes the current training loss and then minimizes the training loss of the worst-case features. By incorporating our WFRM during training, we significantly improve model generalization under distributional shift â Domain Generalization (DG) and in the low-data regime â Few-shot Learning (FSL). We theoretically analyze WFRM and find the key reason why it works better than ERM â it induces an empirical risk-based semi-adaptive $L_{2}$ regularization of the classifier weights, enabling a better risk-complexity trade-off. We evaluate WFRM on two data-efficient learning tasks, including three standard DG benchmarks of PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome and the most challenging FSL benchmark Meta-Dataset. Despite the simplicity, our method consistently improves various DG and FSL methods, leading to the new state-of-the-art performances in all settings.

It is typically implicitly assumed that $\\mathbb{P}^{Y|X}$ is the ``true'' posterior label distribution. However, in many real-world scenarios, the labels $Y_1,...,Y_n$ are obtained by aggregating expert opinions using a voting procedure, resulting in a one-hot distribution $\\mathbb{P}_{\\textup{vote}}^{Y|X}$. This is the case for most datasets, even well-known ones like ImageNet. For such ``voted'' labels, CP guarantees are thus w.r.t. $\\mathbb{P}_{\\textup{vote}}=\\mathbb{P}^X \\otimes \\mathbb{P}_{\\textup{vote}}^{Y|X}$ rather than the true distribution $\\mathbb{P}$.

However, when experts do not agree because of ambiguous labels, approximating $\\mathbb{P}^{Y|X}$ with a one-hot distribution $\\mathbb{P}_{\\textup{vote}}^{Y|X}$ ignores this uncertainty. In this paper, we propose to leverage expert opinions to approximate $\\mathbb{P}^{Y|X}$ using a non-degenerate distribution $\\mathbb{P}_{\\textup{agg}}^{Y|X}$.

However, training these models for large systems can be quite challenging as they incur significant computational and memory expense---these systems are often forced to rely on autoregressive time-stepping of the neural network to predict future temporal states. While this is effective in managing costs, it can lead to uncontrolled error growth over time and eventual instability. We analyze the sources of this autoregressive error growth using prototypical neural operator models for physical systems and explore ways to mitigate it. We introduce architectural and application-specific improvements that allow for careful control of instability-inducing operations within these models without inflating the compute/memory expense. We present results on several scientific systems that include Navier-Stokes fluid flow, rotating shallow water, and a high-resolution global weather forecasting system. We demonstrate that applying our design principles to neural operators leads to significantly lower errors for long-term forecasts as well as longer time horizons without qualitative signs of divergence compared to the original models for these systems.

In this paper, we aim at answering two intriguing questions: (1) Can we go beyond the KL-based objective? (2) Besides the popular cosine similarity, can we design a better similarity function? We provide answers to both questions by generalizing the KL-based mutual information to the $f$-Mutual Information in Contrastive Learning ($f$-MICL) using the $f$-divergences. To answer the first question, we provide a wide range of $f$-MICL objectives which share the nice properties of InfoNCE (e.g., alignment and uniformity), and meanwhile result in similar or even superior performance. For the second question, assuming that the joint feature distribution is proportional to the Gaussian kernel, we derive an $f$-Gaussian similarity with better interpretability and empirical performance. Finally, we identify close relationships between the $f$-MICL objective and several popular InfoNCE-based objectives. Using benchmark tasks from both vision and natural language, we empirically evaluate $f$-MICL with different $f$-divergences on various architectures (SimCLR, MoCo, and MoCo v3) and datasets.

Existing methods often overlook two practical challenges (1) the best pricing strategy could change over time; (2) the prices and pricing policies must conform to hard constraints due to safety, ethical or legal restrictions. We address both challenges by solving a more general problem of \"universal dynamic regret\" minimization in proper online learning with exp-concave losses --- an open problem posed by Baby & Wang (2021) that we partially resolve in this paper, with attention restricted to loss functions coming from a generalized linear model. Here \"dynamic regret\" measures the performance relative to a non-stationary sequence of policies, and \"proper\" means that the learner must choose feasible strategies within a pre-defined convex set, which we use to model the safety constraints. In this work, we consider a linear noisy valuation model for the customers. In the case of a known strictly log-concave market noise, our algorithm achieves $\\tilde{O}(d^3T^{1/3}C_T^{2/3} \\vee d^3)$ dynamic regret in comparison with the optimal policy series, where $T$, $d$ and $C_T$ stand for the time horizon, the feature dimension and the total variation (characterizing non-stationarity) respectively. This regret is near-optimal with respect to $T$ (within $O(\\log T)$ gaps) and $C_T$, and our algorithm is adaptable to unknown $C_T$ and remains feasible throughout.

However, most existing end-to-end VLP methods use high-resolution image-text-box data to perform well on fine-grained region-level tasks, such as object detection, segmentation, and referring expression comprehension. Unfortunately, such high-resolution images with accurate bounding box annotations are expensive to collect and use for supervision at scale. In this work, we propose VoLTA (Vision Language Transformer with weakly-supervised local-feature Alignment), a new VLP paradigm that only utilizes image-caption data but achieves fine-grained region-level image understanding, eliminating the need for expensive box annotations. VoLTA adopts graph optimal transport-based weakly-supervised alignment on local image patches and text tokens to germinate an explicit, self-normalized, and interpretable low-level matching criterion. In addition, VoLTA pushes multi-modal fusion deep into the uni-modal backbones during pre training and removes fusion-specific transformer layers, further reducing memory requirements. Extensive experiments on a wide range of vision- and vision-language downstream tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of VoLTA on fine-grained applications without compromising the coarse-grained downstream performance, often outperforming methods using significantly more caption and box annotations",

    "title": "Benefits of Max Pooling in Neural Networks: Theoretical and Experimental Evidence",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "When deep neural networks became state of the art image classifiers, numerous max pooling operations were an important component of the architecture. However, modern computer vision networks typically have few, if any, max pooling operations. To understand whether this trend is justified, we develop a mathematical framework analyzing ReLU based approximations of max pooling, and prove a sense in which max pooling cannot be replicated. We formulate and analyze a novel class of optimal approximations, and find that the residual can be made exponentially small in the kernel size, but only with an exponentially wide approximation. This work gives a theoretical basis for understanding the reduced use of max pooling in newer architectures. It also enables us to establish an empirical observation about natural images: since max pooling does not seem necessary, the inputs on which max pooling is distinct â those with a large difference between the max and other values â are not prevalent",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Many recent successful off-policy multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms for cooperative partially observable environments focus on finding factorized value functions, leading to convoluted network structures. Building on the structure of independent Q-learners, our LAN algorithm takes a radically different approach, leveraging a dueling architecture to learn for each agent a decentralized best-response policies via individual advantage functions. The learning is stabilized by a centralized critic whose primary objective is to reduce the moving target problem of the individual advantages. The critic, whose network's size is independent of the number of agents, is cast aside after learning. Evaluation on the StarCraft II multi-agent challenge benchmark shows that LAN reaches state-of-the-art performance and is highly scalable with respect to the number of agents, opening up a promising alternative direction for MARL research",

    "title": "Beyond Distribution Shift: Spurious Features Through the Lens of Training Dynamics",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are prone to learning spurious features that correlate with the label during training but are irrelevant to the learning problem. This hurts model generalization and poses problems when deploying them in safety-critical applications. This paper aims to better understand the effects of spurious features through the lens of the learning dynamics of the internal neurons during the training process. We make the following observations: (1) While previous works highlight the harmful effects of spurious features on the generalization ability of DNNs, we emphasize that not all spurious features are harmful. Spurious features can be \"benign\" or \"harmful\" depending on whether they are \"harder\" or \"easier\" to learn than the core features for a given model. This definition is model and dataset dependent. (2) We build upon this premise and use instance difficulty methods (like Prediction Depth) to quantify \"easiness\" for a given model and to identify this behavior during the training phase. (3) We empirically show that the harmful spurious features can be detected by observing the learning dynamics of the DNN's early layers. In other words, easy features learned by the initial layers of a DNN early during the training can (potentially) hurt model generalization. We verify our claims on medical and vision datasets, both simulated and real, and justify the empirical success of our hypothesis by showing the theoretical connections between Prediction Depth and information-theoretic concepts like $\\mathcal{V}$-usable information. Lastly, our experiments show that monitoring only accuracy during training (as is common in machine learning pipelines) is insufficient to detect spurious features. We, therefore, highlight the need for monitoring early training dynamics using suitable instance difficulty metrics",
