    "title": "Spectral learning of Bernoulli linear dynamical systems models for decision-making",
    "abstract": "Latent linear dynamical systems with Bernoulli observations provide a powerful modeling framework for identifying the temporal dynamics underlying binary time series data, which arise in a variety of contexts such as binary decision-making and discrete stochastic processes\nsuch as binned neural spike trains. Here we develop a spectral learning method for fast, efficient fitting of probit-Bernoulli latent linear dynamical system (LDS) models. Our approach extends traditional subspace identification methods to the Bernoulli setting via a transformation of the first and second sample moments. This results in a robust, fixed-cost estimator that avoids the hazards of local optima and the long computation time of iterative fitting procedures like the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. In regimes where data is limited or assumptions about the statistical structure of the data are not met, we demonstrate that the spectral estimate provides a good initialization for Laplace-EM fitting. Finally, we show that the estimator provides substantial benefits to real world settings by analyzing data from mice performing a sensory decision-making task",

    "title": "Towards Better Generalization with Flexible Representation of Multi-Module Graph Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become compelling models designed to perform learning and inference on graph-structured data. However, little work has been done to understand the fundamental limitations of GNNs for scaling to larger graphs and generalizing to out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. In this paper, we use a random graph generator to systematically investigate how the graph size and structural properties affect the predictive performance of GNNs. We present specific evidence that the average node degree is a key feature in determining whether GNNs can generalize to unseen graphs, and that the use of multiple node update functions can improve the generalization performance of GNNs when dealing with graphs of multimodal degree distributions. Accordingly, we propose a multi-module GNN framework that allows the network to adapt flexibly to new graphs by generalizing a single canonical nonlinear transformation over aggregated inputs. Our results show that the multi-module GNNs improve the OOD generalization on a variety of inference tasks in the direction of diverse structural features",

    "title": "Assisting Human Decisions in Document Matching",
    "abstract": "Many practical applications, ranging from paper-reviewer assignment in peer review to job-applicant matching for hiring, require human decision makers to identify relevant matches by combining their expertise with predictions from machine learning models. In many such model-assisted document matching tasks, the decision makers have stressed the need for assistive information about the model outputs (or the data) to facilitate their decisions. In this paper, we devise a proxy matching task that allows us to evaluate which kinds of assistive information improve decision makers’ performance (in terms of accuracy and time). Through a crowdsourced (N = 271 participants) study, we find that providing black-box model explanations reduces users’ accuracy on the matching task, contrary to the commonly-held belief that they can be helpful by allowing better understanding of the model. On the other hand, custom methods that are designed to closely attend to some task-specific desiderata are found to be effective in improving user performance. Surprisingly, we also find that the users’ perceived utility of assistive information is misaligned with their objective utility (measured through their task performance)",

By analyzing over 10,000 records of human Xiangqi play, we highlight the existence of both transitive and non-transitive elements within the game’s strategic structure. To address non-transitivity, we introduce the JiangJun algorithm, an innovative combination of Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and Policy Space Response Oracles (PSRO) designed to approximate a Nash equilibrium. We evaluate the algorithm empirically using a WeChat mini program and achieve a Master level with a 99.41% win rate against human players. The algorithm’s effectiveness in overcoming non-transitivity is confirmed by a plethora of metrics, such as relative population performance and visualization results.

    "title": "Contrastive Attraction and Contrastive Repulsion for Representation Learning",
    "abstract": "Contrastive learning (CL) methods effectively learn data representations in a self-supervision manner, where the encoder contrasts each positive sample over multiple negative samples via a one-vs-many softmax cross-entropy loss. By leveraging large amounts of unlabeled image data, recent CL methods have achieved promising results when pretrained on large-scale datasets, such as ImageNet. However, most of them consider the augmented views from the same instance are positive pairs, while views from other instances are negative ones. Such binary partition insufficiently considers the relation between samples and tends to yield worse performance when generalized on images in the wild. In this paper, to further improve the performance of CL and enhance its robustness on various datasets, we propose a doubly CL strategy that contrasts positive samples and negative ones within themselves separately. We realize this strategy with contrastive attraction and contrastive repulsion (CACR), which makes the query not only exert a greater force to attract more distant positive samples but also do so to repel closer negative samples. Theoretical analysis reveals that CACR generalizes CL's behavior by positive attraction and negative repulsion. It further considers the intra-contrastive relation within the positive and negative pairs to narrow the gap between the sampled and true distribution, which is important when datasets are less curated. Extensive large-scale experiments on standard vision tasks show that CACR not only consistently outperforms existing CL methods on benchmark datasets, but also shows better robustness when generalized on imbalanced image datasets",

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising alternative to create supervisory signals to real-world problems, avoiding the extensive cost of manual labeling. SSL is particularly attractive for unsupervised tasks such as anomaly detection (AD), where labeled anomalies are rare or often nonexistent. A large catalog of augmentation functions has been used for SSL-based AD (SSAD) on image data, and recent works have reported that the type of augmentation has a significant impact on accuracy. Motivated by those, this work sets out to put image-based SSAD under a larger lens and investigate the role of data augmentation in SSAD. Through extensive experiments on 3 different detector models and across 420 AD tasks, we provide comprehensive numerical and visual evidences that the alignment between data augmentation and anomaly-generating mechanism is the key to the success of SSAD, and in the lack thereof, SSL may even impair accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis on the role of data augmentation in SSAD",

    "abstract": "The integration of reasoning, learning, and decision-making is key to build more general artificial intelligence systems. As a step in this direction, we propose a novel neural-logic architecture, called differentiable logic machine (DLM), that can solve both inductive logic programming (ILP) and reinforcement learning (RL) problems, where the solution can be interpreted as a first-order logic program. Our proposition includes several innovations. Firstly, our architecture defines a restricted but expressive continuous relaxation of the space of first-order logic programs by assigning weights to predicates instead of rules, in contrast to most previous neural-logic approaches. Secondly, with this differentiable architecture, we propose several (supervised and RL) training procedures, based on gradient descent, which can recover a fully-interpretable solution (i.e., logic formula). Thirdly, to accelerate RL training, we also design a novel critic architecture that enables actor-critic algorithms. Fourthly, to solve hard problems, we propose an incremental training procedure that can learn a logic program progressively. Compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) differentiable ILP methods, DLM successfully solves all the considered ILP problems with a higher percentage of successful seeds (up to 3.5x). On RL problems, without requiring an interpretable solution, DLM outperforms other non-interpretable neural-logic RL approaches in terms of rewards (up to 3.9%). When enforcing interpretability, DLM can solve harder RL problems (e.g., Sorting, Path) than other interpretable RL methods. Moreover, we show that deep logic programs can be learned via incremental supervised training. In addition to this excellent performance, DLM can scale well in terms of memory and computational time, especially during the testing phase where it can deal with much more constants (>2x) than SOTA",

    "abstract": "Adversarial Training (AT) has been found to substantially improve the robustness of deep learning classifiers against adversarial attacks. AT involves obtaining robustness by including adversarial examples in training a classifier. Most variants of AT algorithms treat every training example equally. However, recent works have shown that better performance is achievable by treating them unequally. In addition, it has been observed that AT exerts an uneven influence on different classes in a training set and unfairly hurts examples corresponding to classes that are inherently harder to classify. Consequently, various reweighting schemes have been proposed that assign unequal weights to robust losses of individual examples in a training set. In this work, we propose a novel instance-wise reweighting scheme. It considers the vulnerability of each natural example and the resulting information loss on its adversarial counterpart occasioned by adversarial attacks. Through extensive experiments, we show that our proposed method significantly improves over existing reweighting schemes, especially against strong white and black-box attacks",

    "title": "Lifelong Reinforcement Learning with Modulating Masks",
    "abstract": "Lifelong learning aims to create AI systems that continuously and incrementally learn during a lifetime, similar to biological learning. Attempts so far have met problems, including catastrophic forgetting, interference among tasks, and the inability to exploit previous knowledge. While considerable research has focused on learning multiple supervised classification tasks that involve changes in the input distribution, lifelong reinforcement learning (LRL) must deal with variations in the state and transition distributions, and in the reward functions. Modulating masks with a fixed backbone network, recently developed for classification, are particularly suitable to deal with such a large spectrum of task variations. In this paper, we adapted modulating masks to work with deep LRL, specifically PPO and IMPALA agents. The comparison with LRL baselines in both discrete and continuous RL tasks shows superior performance. We further investigated the use of a linear combination of previously learned masks to exploit previous knowledge when learning new tasks: not only is learning  faster, the algorithm solves tasks that we could not otherwise solve from scratch due to extremely sparse rewards. The results suggest that RL with modulating masks is a promising approach to lifelong learning, to the composition of knowledge to learn increasingly complex tasks, and to knowledge reuse for efficient and faster learning",

    "title": "Semantic Self-adaptation: Enhancing Generalization with a Single Sample",
    "abstract": "The lack of out-of-domain generalization is a critical weakness of deep networks for semantic segmentation. Previous studies relied on the assumption of a static model, i. e., once the training process is complete, model parameters remain fixed at test time. In this work, we challenge this premise with a self-adaptive approach for semantic segmentation that adjusts the inference process to each input sample. Self-adaptation operates on two levels. First, it fine-tunes the parameters of convolutional layers to the input image using consistency regularization. Second, in Batch Normalization layers, self-adaptation interpolates between the training and the reference distribution derived from a single test sample. Despite both techniques being well known in the literature, their combination sets new state-of-the-art accuracy on synthetic-to-real generalization benchmarks. Our empirical study suggests that self-adaptation may complement the established practice of model regularization at training time for improving deep network generalization to out-of-domain data.

    "title": "Fair Kernel Regression through Cross-Covariance Operators",
    "abstract": "Ensuring fairness in machine learning models is a difficult problem from both a formulation and implementation perspective. One sensible criterion for achieving fairness is Equalised Odds, which requires that subjects in protected and unprotected groups have equal true and false positive rates. However, practical implementation is challenging. This work proposes two ways to address this issue through the conditional independence operator. First, given the output values, it is used as a fairness measure of independence between model predictions and sensitive variables. Second, it is used as a regularisation term in the problem formulation, which seeks optimal models that balance performance and fairness concerning the sensitive variables. To illustrate the potential of our approach, we consider different scenarios. First, we use the Gaussian model to provide new insights into the problem formulation and numerical results on its convergence. Second, we present the formulation using the conditional cross-covariance operator. We anticipate that a closed-form solution is possible in the general problem formulation, including in the case of a kernel formulation setting. Third, we introduce a normalised criterion of the conditional independence operator. All formulations are posed under the risk minimisation principle, which leads to theoretical results on the performance.\nAdditionally, insights are provided into using these operators under a Gaussian Process setting. Our methods are compared to state-of-the-art methods in terms of performance and fairness metrics on a representative set of real problems. The results obtained with our proposed methodology show promising performance-fairness curves. Furthermore, we discuss the usefulness of linear weights in the fair model to describe the behaviour of the features when enforcing fairness over a particular set of input features",

Recent work (e.g. score-matching networks, diffusion models) has approached the IGM problem from the perspective of pushing synthetic source data toward the target distribution via dynamical perturbations or flows in the ambient space.  In this direction, we present the score difference (SD) between arbitrary target and source distributions as a flow that optimally reduces the Kullback-Leibler divergence between them while also solving the Schrödinger bridge problem.  We apply the SD flow to convenient proxy distributions, which are aligned if and only if the original distributions are aligned.  We demonstrate the formal equivalence of this formulation to denoising diffusion models under certain conditions.  We also show that the training of generative adversarial networks includes a hidden data-optimization sub-problem, which induces the SD flow under certain choices of loss function when the discriminator is optimal. As a result, the SD flow provides a theoretical link between model classes that individually address the three challenges of the \"generative modeling trilemma\"—high sample quality, mode coverage, and fast sampling—thereby setting the stage for a unified approach",

    "abstract": "Variational inference with Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) enables learning of highly tractable yet multi-modal approximations of intractable target distributions with up to a few hundred dimensions. The two currently most effective methods for GMM-based variational inference, VIPS and iBayes-GMM, both employ independent natural gradient updates for the individual components and their weights. We show for the first time, that their derived updates are equivalent, although their practical implementations and theoretical guarantees differ. We identify several design choices that distinguish both approaches, namely with respect to sample selection, natural gradient estimation, stepsize adaptation, and whether trust regions are enforced or the number of components adapted. We argue that for both approaches, the quality of the learned approximations can heavily suffer from the respective design choices: By updating the individual components using samples from the mixture model, iBayes-GMM often fails to produce meaningful updates to low-weight components, and by using a zero-order method for estimating the natural gradient, VIPS scales badly to higher-dimensional problems. Furthermore, we show that information-geometric trust-regions (used by VIPS) are effective even when using first-order natural gradient estimates, and often outperform the improved Bayesian learning rule (iBLR) update used by iBayes-GMM. We systematically evaluate the effects of design choices and show that a hybrid approach significantly outperforms both prior works. Along with this work, we publish our highly modular and efficient implementation for natural gradient variational inference with Gaussian mixture models, which supports $432$ different combinations of design choices, facilitates the reproduction of all our experiments, and may prove valuable for the practitioner",

In both cases the gradient formula involves a solution of the semi-dual formulation of the optimal transport cost. Our study makes a connection between the gradient of the WGAN loss function and the Laguerre diagrams associated to semi-discrete transport maps. The learning problem is addressed with an alternating algorithm, which is in general not convergent. However, in most cases, it stabilizes close to a relevant  solution for the generative learning problem.

The study is mainly motivated by that random views, used in contrastive learning, and random masked (visible) patches, used in masked image modeling, are often about object parts. \n\nWe explain that contrastive learning is a part-to-whole task: the projection layer hallucinates the whole object representation from the object part representation learned from the encoder, and that masked image modeling is a part-to-part task: the masked patches of the object are hallucinated from the visible patches. The explanation suggests that the self-supervised pretrained encoder leans toward understanding the object part. We empirically compare the off-the-shelf encoders pretrained with several representative methods on object-level recognition and part-level recognition. The results show that the fully-supervised model outperforms self-supervised models for object-level recognition, and most self-supervised contrastive learning and masked image modeling methods outperform the fully-supervised method for part-level recognition.

    "abstract": "Running Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on large graphs suffers from notoriously inefficiency.  This is attributed to the sparse graph-based operations, which is hard to be accelerated by community hardware, e.g., GPUs and CPUs. One potential solution is to  ``sketch'' the original graph by removing unimportant edges, then both the training and inference process are executed on the sparsified graph with improved efficiency. Traditional graph sparsification work calculates the edge importance score, i.e., effective resistance, from graph topology with theoretical guarantee. However, estimating effective resistance is even more expensive than training GNNs itself. Later, learning-based sparsification methods propose to learn the edge importance from data, but with significant overhead due to the extra learning process. Thus, both of them introduce significant ahead-of-training overhead. In this paper, we experimentally and theoretically prove that effective resistance can be approximated using only the node degree information and achieve similar node presentations on graph with/without sparsification. Based on this finding, we propose DSpar, to sparsify the graph once before training based on only the node degree information with negligible ahead-of-training overhead. In practice, for the training phase, DSpar achieves up to $5.9\\times$ faster than baseline with almost no accuracy drop. For the inference phase, DSpar reduces up to $90\\%$ latency",

    "title": "Mind the Gap: Mitigating the Distribution Gap in Graph Few-shot Learning",
    "abstract": "Prevailing supervised deep graph learning models often suffer from the issue of label scarcity, leading to performance degradation in the face of limited annotated data. Although numerous graph few-shot learning (GFL) methods have been developed to mitigate this problem, they tend to rely excessively on labeled data. This over-reliance on labeled data can result in impaired generalization ability in the test phase due to the existence of a distribution gap. Moreover, existing GFL methods lack a general purpose as their designs are coupled with task or data-specific characteristics. To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel Self-Distilled Graph Few-shot Learning framework (SDGFL) that is both general and effective. SDGFL leverages a self-distilled contrastive learning procedure to boost GFL. Specifically, our model first pre-trains a graph encoder with contrastive learning using unlabeled data. Later, the trained encoder is frozen as a teacher model to distill a student model with a contrastive loss. The distilled model is then fed to GFL. By learning data representation in a self-supervised manner, SDGFL effectively mitigates the distribution gap and enhances generalization ability. Furthermore, our proposed framework is task and data-independent, making it a versatile tool for general graph mining purposes. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, we introduce an information-based measurement that quantifies its capability. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that SDGFL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on various graph mining tasks across multiple datasets in the few-shot scenario. We also provide a quantitative measurement of SDGFL’s superior performance in comparison to existing methods",

    "title": "Consistent Collaborative Filtering via Tensor Decomposition",
    "abstract": "Collaborative filtering is the de facto standard for analyzing users’ activities and building recommendation systems for items. In this work we develop Sliced Anti-symmetric Decomposition (SAD), a new model for collaborative filtering based on implicit feedback. In contrast to traditional techniques where a latent representation of users (user vectors) and items (item vectors) are estimated, SAD introduces one additional latent vector to each item, using a novel three-way tensor view of user-item interactions. This new vector extends user-item preferences calculated by standard dot products to general inner products, producing interactions between items when evaluating their relative preferences. SAD reduces to state-of-the-art (SOTA) collaborative filtering models when the vector collapses to 1, while in this paper we allow its value to be estimated from data. Allowing the values of the new item vector to be different from 1 has profound implications. It suggests users may have nonlinear mental models when evaluating items, allowing the existence of cycles in pairwise comparisons. We demonstrate the efficiency of SAD in both simulated and real world datasets containing over 1M user-item interactions. By comparing with seven SOTA collaborative filtering models with implicit feedbacks, SAD produces the most consistent personalized preferences, in the meanwhile maintaining top-level of accuracy in personalized recommendations. We release the model and inference algorithms in a Python library https://github.com/apple/ml-sad",

In this paper, we exploit more flexible metrics and examine two natural extensions of policy optimization with Wasserstein and Sinkhorn trust regions, namely Wasserstein policy optimization (WPO) and Sinkhorn policy optimization (SPO). Instead of restricting the policy to a parametric distribution class, we directly optimize the policy distribution and derive their close-form policy updates based on the Lagrangian duality. Theoretically, we show that WPO guarantees a monotonic performance improvement, and SPO provably converges to WPO as the entropic regularizer diminishes. Moreover, we prove that with a decaying Lagrangian multiplier to the trust region constraint, both methods converge to global optimality. Experiments across tabular domains, robotic locomotion, and continuous control tasks further demonstrate the performance improvement of both approaches, more robustness of WPO to sample insufficiency, and faster convergence of SPO, over state-of-art policy gradient methods",

It is currently unknown how many excitatory cortical cell types exist and what their defining morphological features are. Here we present GraphDINO, a purely data-driven approach to learn low-dimensional representations of 3D neuronal morphologies from unlabeled large-scale datasets. GraphDINO is a novel transformer-based representation learning method for spatially-embedded graphs. To enable self-supervised learning on transformers, we (1) developed data augmentation strategies for spatially-embedded graphs, (2) adapted the positional encoding and (3) introduced a novel attention mechanism, AC-Attention, which combines attention-based global interaction between nodes and classic graph convolutional processing. We show, in two different species and across multiple brain areas, that this method yields morphological cell type clusterings that are on par with manual feature-based classification by experts, but without using prior knowledge about the structural features of neurons. Moreover, it outperforms previous approaches on quantitative benchmarks predicting expert labels. Our method could potentially enable data-driven discovery of novel morphological features and cell types in large-scale datasets.

    "abstract": "Over the past decade, neural networks have been successful at making predictions from biological sequences, especially in the context of regulatory genomics. As in other fields of deep learning, tools have been devised to extract features such as sequence motifs that can explain the predictions made by a trained network. Here we intend to go beyond explainable machine learning and introduce SEISM, a selective inference procedure to test the association between these extracted features and the predicted phenotype. In particular, we discuss how training a one-layer convolutional network is formally equivalent to selecting motifs maximizing some association score. We adapt existing sampling-based selective inference procedures by quantizing this selection over an infinite set to a large but finite grid. Finally,we show that sampling under a specific choice of parameters is sufficient to characterize the composite null hypothesis typically used for selective inference - a result that goes well beyond our particular framework. We illustrate the behavior of our method in terms of calibration, power and speed and discuss its power/speed trade-off with a simpler data-split strategy. SEISM paves the way to an easier analysis of neural networks used in regulatory genomics, and to more powerful methods for genome wide association studies (GWAS)",

The dynamics variation is modeled by a pair of classifiers to distinguish between source dynamics and target dynamics. Theoretically, we provide an upper bound on the divergence between the learned policy and expert demonstrations in the source domain.

    "title": "The Meta-Evaluation Problem in Explainable AI: Identifying Reliable Estimators with MetaQuantus",
    "abstract": "One of the unsolved challenges in the field of Explainable AI (XAI) is determining how to most reliably estimate the quality of an explanation method in the absence of ground truth explanation labels. Resolving this issue is of utmost importance as the evaluation outcomes generated by competing evaluation methods (or ``quality estimators''), which aim at measuring the same property of an explanation method, frequently present conflicting rankings. Such disagreements can be challenging for practitioners to interpret, thereby complicating their ability to select the best-performing explanation method. We address this problem through a meta-evaluation of different quality estimators in XAI, which we define as ``the process of evaluating the evaluation method''. Our novel framework, MetaQuantus, analyses two complementary performance characteristics of a quality estimator: its resilience to noise and reactivity to randomness, thus circumventing the need for ground truth labels. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through a series of experiments, targeting various open questions in XAI such as the selection and hyperparameter optimisation of quality estimators. Our work is released under an open-source license (https://github.com/annahedstroem/MetaQuantus) to serve as a development tool for XAI- and Machine Learning (ML) practitioners to verify and benchmark newly constructed quality estimators in a given explainability context.

To assess the discrepancy between the prediction and the ground-truth in the downstream tasks for these contrastive pairs, we adapt expected calibration error (ECE) to graph contrastive learning. The analysis of ECE motivates us to propose a novel regularization method, Contrast-Reg, to ensure that decreasing the contrastive loss leads to better performance in the downstream tasks. As a plug-in regularizer, Contrast-Reg effectively improves the performance of existing graph contrastive learning algorithms. We provide both theoretical and empirical results to demonstrate the effectiveness of Contrast-Reg in enhancing the generalizability of the Graph Neural Network (GNN) model and improving the performance of graph contrastive algorithms with different similarity definitions and encoder backbones across various downstream tasks",

    "title": "Supervised Knowledge May Hurt Novel Class Discovery Performance",
    "abstract": "Novel class discovery (NCD) aims to infer novel categories in an unlabeled dataset by leveraging prior knowledge of a labeled set comprising disjoint but related classes. Given that most existing literature focuses primarily on utilizing supervised knowledge from a labeled set at the methodology level, this paper considers the question: Is supervised knowledge always helpful at different levels of semantic relevance? To proceed, we first establish a novel metric, so-called transfer leakage, to measure the semantic similarity between labeled/unlabeled datasets. To show the validity of the proposed metric, we build up a large-scale benchmark with various degrees of semantic similarities between labeled/unlabeled datasets on ImageNet by leveraging its hierarachical class structure. The results based on the proposed benchmark show that the proposed transfer leakage is in line with the hierarachical class structure; and that NCD performance is consistent with the semantic similarities (measured by the proposed metric). Next, by using the proposed transfer leakage, we conduct various empirical experiments with different levels of semantic similarity, yielding that supervised knowledge may hurt NCD performance. Specifically, using supervised information from a low-similarity labeled set may lead to a suboptimal result as compared to using pure self-supervised knowledge. These results reveal the inadequacy of the existing NCD literature which usually assumes that supervised knowledge is beneficial. Finally, we develop a pseudo-version of the transfer leakage as a practical reference to decide if supervised knowledge should be used in NCD. Its effectiveness is supported by our empirical studies, which show that the pseudo transfer leakage (with or without supervised knowledge) is consistent with the corresponding accuracy based on various datasets",

As spurious correlations often manifest in features of data that are anomalous to the desired task, such as watermarks or artifacts, we demonstrate that internal representations capable of detecting such artifactual concepts can be found by analyzing relationships within neural representations.

    "abstract": "Diversity is an important criterion for many areas of machine learning (ML), including generative modeling and dataset curation. However, existing metrics for measuring diversity are often domain-specific and limited in flexibility. In this paper we address the diversity evaluation problem by proposing the Vendi Score, which connects and extends ideas from ecology and quantum statistical mechanics to ml. The Vendi Score is defined as the exponential of the Shannon entropy of the eigenvalues of a similarity matrix. This matrix is induced by a user-defined similarity function applied to the sample to be evaluated for diversity. In taking a similarity function as input, the Vendi Score enables its user to specify any desired form of diversity. Importantly, unlike many existing metrics in ML, the Vendi Score does not require a reference dataset or distribution over samples or labels, it is therefore general and applicable to any generative model, decoding algorithm, and dataset from any domain where similarity can be defined. We showcase the Vendi Score on molecular generative modeling where we found it addresses shortcomings of the current diversity metric of choice in that domain. We also applied the Vendi Score to generative models of images and decoding algorithms of text where we found it confirms known results about diversity in those domains. Furthermore, we used the Vendi Score to measure mode collapse, a known shortcoming of generative adversarial networks (GANs). In particular, the Vendi Score revealed that even GANs that capture all the modes of a labelled dataset can be less diverse than the original dataset. Finally, the interpretability of the Vendi Score allowed us to diagnose several benchmark ML datasets for diversity, opening the door for diversity-informed data augmentation",

To allow for greater flexibility, we let each base arm have two outcomes, modeled as the output of a two-output Gaussian process (GP), where one outcome is used to compute super arm reward and the other for group reward. We then propose a novel double-UCB GP-bandit algorithm, called Thresholded Combinatorial Gaussian Process Upper Confidence Bounds (TCGP-UCB), which balances between maximizing cumulative super arm reward and satisfying group reward constraints and can be tuned to prefer one over the other. We also define a new notion of regret that combines super arm regret with group reward constraint satisfaction and prove that TCGP-UCB incurs $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{KT\\overline{\\gamma}_{T}} )$ regret with high probability, where $\\overline{\\gamma}_{T}$ is the maximum information gain associated with the set of base arm contexts that appeared in the first $T$ rounds and $K$ is the maximum super arm cardinality over all rounds.

We propose MetaQNL, a \"Quasi-Natural Language\" that can express both formal logic and natural language sentences, and MetaInduce, a learning algorithm that induces MetaQNL rules from training data consisting of questions and answers, with or without intermediate reasoning steps. In addition, we introduce soft matching—a flexible mechanism for applying rules without rigid matching, overcoming a typical source of brittleness in symbolic reasoning. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracies on multiple reasoning benchmarks; it learns compact models with much less data and produces not only answers but also checkable proofs.

This causes unfairness w.r.t the achievable accuracies of constrained devices, especially in cases with a skewed distribution of class labels across devices. We present a novel FL technique, CoCoFL, which maintains the full NN structure on all devices. To adapt to the devices’ heterogeneous resources, CoCoFL freezes and quantizes selected layers, reducing communication, computation, and memory requirements, whereas other layers are still trained in full precision, enabling to reach a high accuracy. Thereby, CoCoFL efficiently utilizes the available resources on devices and allows constrained devices to make a significant contribution to the FL system, preserving fairness among participants (accuracy parity) and significantly improving final accuracy",

We further generalize our study to the setting with stochastic first-order feedback, and show that a variation of TSODA can also achieve the same optimal regret in expectation. Our theoretical results and the superior performance of the proposed method are further validated by empirical experiments.

    "title": "On the Robustness of Dataset Inference",
    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) models are costly to train as they can require a significant amount of data, computational resources and technical expertise. Thus, they constitute valuable intellectual property that needs protection from adversaries wanting to steal them. Ownership verification techniques allow the victims of model stealing attacks to demonstrate that a suspect model was in fact stolen from theirs. Although a number of ownership verification techniques based on watermarking or fingerprinting have been proposed, most of them fall short either in terms of security guarantees (well-equipped adversaries can evade verification)  or computational cost. A fingerprinting technique, Dataset Inference (DI) has been shown to offer better robustness and efficiency than prior methods. The authors of DI provided a correctness proof for linear (suspect) models. However, in a subspace of the same setting, we prove that DI suffers from high false positives (FPs) -- it can incorrectly identify an independent model trained with non-overlapping data from the same distribution as stolen. We further prove that DI also triggers FPs in realistic, non-linear suspect models. We then confirm empirically that DI in the black-box setting leads to FPs, with high confidence. Second, we show that DI also suffers from false negatives (FNs) -- an adversary can fool DI by regularising a stolen model's decision boundaries using adversarial training, thereby leading to an FN. To this end, we demonstrate that black-box DI fails to identify a model adversarially trained from a stolen dataset -- the setting where DI is the hardest to evade. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings, the viability of fingerprinting-based ownership verification in general, and suggest directions for future work",

    "title": "Improving Differentially Private SGD via Randomly Sparsified Gradients",
    "abstract": "Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) has been widely adopted in deep learning to provide rigorously defined privacy, which requires gradient clipping to bound the maximum norm of individual gradients and additive isotropic Gaussian noise. With analysis of the convergence rate of DP-SGD in a non-convex setting, we identify that randomly sparsifying gradients before clipping and noisification adjusts a trade-off between internal components of the convergence bound and leads to a smaller upper bound when the noise is dominant. Additionally, our theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations show that the trade-off is not trivial but possibly a unique property of DP-SGD, as either canceling noisification or gradient clipping eliminates the trade-off in the bound. This observation is indicative, as it implies DP-SGD has special inherent room for (even simply random) gradient compression. To verify the observation an utilize it, we propose an efficient and lightweight extension using random sparsification (RS) to strengthen DP-SGD.  Experiments with various DP-SGD frameworks show that RS can improve performance. Additionally, the produced sparse gradients of RS exhibit advantages in reducing communication cost and strengthening privacy against reconstruction attacks, which are also key problems in private machine learning",

    "abstract": "With the increasing demand for deep learning models on mobile devices, splitting neural network computation between the device and a more powerful edge server has become an attractive solution.

Recent studies propose learning compressed representations that contain more relevant information for supervised downstream tasks, showing improved tradeoffs between compressed data size and supervised performance. However, existing evaluation metrics only provide an incomplete picture of split computing. This study introduces supervised compression for split computing (SC2) and proposes new evaluation criteria: minimizing computation on the mobile device, minimizing transmitted data size, and maximizing model accuracy. We conduct a comprehensive benchmark study using 10 baseline methods, three computer vision tasks, and over 180 trained models, and discuss various aspects of SC2. We also release our code and sc2bench, a Python package for future research on SC2.

We propose PRIVGNN, a privacy-preserving framework for releasing GNN models in a centralized setting. Assuming an access to a public unlabeled graph, PRIVGNN provides a framework to release GNN models trained explicitly on public data along with knowledge obtained from the private data in a privacy preserving manner. PRIVGNN combines the knowledge-distillation framework with the two noise mechanisms, random subsampling, and noisy labeling, to ensure rigorous privacy guarantees. We theoretically analyze our approach in the Rènyi differential privacy framework.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks have been shown to be vulnerable to small perturbations of their inputs, known as adversarial attacks. In this paper, we investigate the vulnerability of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models to adversarial attacks and propose a new attack algorithm called TransFool. To fool NMT models, TransFool builds on a multi-term optimization problem and a gradient projection step. By integrating the embedding representation of a language model, we generate fluent adversarial examples in the source language that maintain a high level of semantic similarity with the clean samples. Experimental results demonstrate that, for different translation tasks and NMT architectures, our white-box attack can severely degrade the translation quality while the semantic similarity between the original and the adversarial sentences stays high. Moreover, we show that TransFool is transferable to unknown target models. Finally, based on automatic and human evaluations, TransFool leads to improvement in terms of success rate, semantic similarity, and fluency compared to the existing attacks both in white-box and black-box settings. Thus, TransFool permits us to better characterize the vulnerability of NMT models and outlines the necessity to design strong defense mechanisms and more robust NMT systems for real-life applications",

    "abstract": "Let $V_* : \\mathbb{R}^d \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be some (possibly non-convex) potential function, and consider the probability measure $\\pi \\propto e^{-V_*}$. When $\\pi$ exhibits multiple modes, it is known that sampling techniques based on Wasserstein gradient flows of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence (e.g. Langevin Monte Carlo) suffer poorly in the rate of convergence, where the dynamics are unable to easily traverse between modes. In stark contrast, the work of Lu et al. (2019; 2022) has shown that the gradient flow of the KL with respect to the Fisher-Rao (FR) geometry exhibits a convergence rate to $\\pi$ is that \\textit{independent} of the potential function. In this short note, we complement these existing results in the literature by providing an explicit expansion of $\\text{KL}(\\rho_t^{\\text{FR}}\\|\\pi)$ in terms of $e^{-t}$, where $(\\rho_t^{\\text{FR}})_{t\\geq 0}$ is the FR gradient flow of the KL divergence. In turn, we are able to provide a clean asymptotic convergence rate, where the burn-in time is guaranteed to be finite. Our proof is based on observing a similarity between FR gradient flows and simulated annealing with linear scaling, and facts about cumulant generating functions. We conclude with simple synthetic experiments that demonstrate our theoretical findings are indeed tight. Based on our numerical findings, we conjecture that the asymptotic rates of convergence for Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao gradient flows are possibly related to this expansion in some cases",

    "abstract": "When training deep neural networks, keeping all tensors in high precision (e.g., 32-bit or even 16-bit floats) is often wasteful. However, keeping all tensors in low precision (e.g., 8-bit floats) can lead to unacceptable accuracy loss. Hence, it is important to use a precision assignment—a mapping from all tensors (arising in training) to precision levels (high or low)—that keeps most of the tensors in low precision and leads to sufficiently accurate models. We provide a technique that explores this memory-accuracy tradeoff by generating precision assignments for convolutional neural networks that (i) use less memory and (ii) lead to more accurate convolutional networks at the same time, compared to the precision assignments considered by prior work in low-precision floating-point training. We evaluate our technique on image classiﬁcation tasks by training convolutional networks on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. Our method typically provides > 2× memory reduction over a baseline precision assignment while preserving training accuracy, and gives further reductions by trading off accuracy. Compared to other baselines which sometimes cause training to diverge, our method provides similar or better memory reduction while avoiding divergence",

    "abstract": "Quantum computers are known to provide speedups over classical state-of-the-art machine learning methods in some specialized settings. For example, quantum kernel methods have been shown to provide an exponential speedup on a learning version of the discrete logarithm problem. Understanding the generalization of quantum models is essential to realizing similar speedups on problems of practical interest. Recent results demonstrate that generalization is hindered by the exponential size of the quantum feature space. Although these results suggest that quantum models cannot generalize when the number of qubits is large, in this paper we show that these results rely on overly restrictive assumptions. We consider a wider class of models by varying a hyperparameter that we call quantum kernel bandwidth. We analyze the large-qubit limit and provide explicit formulas for the generalization of a quantum model that can be solved in closed form. Specifically, we show that changing the value of the bandwidth can take a model from provably not being able to generalize to any target function to good generalization for well-aligned targets. Our analysis shows how the bandwidth controls the spectrum of the kernel integral operator and thereby the inductive bias of the model. We demonstrate empirically that our theory correctly predicts how varying the bandwidth affects generalization of quantum models on challenging datasets, including those far outside our theoretical assumptions. We discuss the implications of our results for quantum advantage in machine learning",

We then propose \\emph{Privacy-Preserving Energy Models (PPEMs)}, a novel energy-based generative model formulation where the representations for these attributes are isolated from other attributes. This structured formulation motivates a learning procedure where a penalty based on a statistical goodness of fit test, the \\emph{Kernel Stein Discrepancy}, can be applied to only the attributes requiring privacy so that $\\alpha$-LMDP may be satisfied without affecting the other attributes. We evaluate this approach using financial and healthcare datasets and demonstrate that the resulting learnt generative models produce high fidelity synthetic data while preserving privacy.

However, existing AL sampling schemes may not perform well in out-of-distribution (OOD) data scenarios, where the unlabeled data pool contains samples that do not belong to the pre-defined categories of the target task. Achieving strong AL performance under OOD data scenarios presents a challenge due to the inherent conflict between AL sampling strategies and OOD data detection. For instance, both more informative in-distribution (ID) data and OOD data in an unlabeled data pool would be assigned high informativeness scores (e.g., high entropy) during AL processes. To address this dilemma, we propose a Monte-Carlo Pareto Optimization for Active Learning (POAL) sampling scheme, which selects optimal subsets of unlabeled samples with fixed batch size from the unlabeled data pool. We formulate the AL sampling task as a multi-objective optimization problem and employ Pareto optimization based on two conflicting objectives: (1) the conventional AL sampling scheme (e.g., maximum entropy) and (2) the confidence of excluding OOD data samples.

Although recent work has proposed a variety of methods that can directly predict or theoretically bound the generalization capacity of a model, they rely on strong assumptions such as matching train/test distributions and access to model gradients. In order to characterize generalization when these assumptions are not satisfied, we propose neighborhood invariance, a measure of a classifier’s output invariance in a local transformation neighborhood. Specifically, we sample a set of transformations and given an input test point, calculate the invariance as the largest fraction of transformed points classified into the same class. Crucially, our measure is simple to calculate, does not depend on the test point’s true label, makes no assumptions about the data distribution or model, and can be applied even in out-of-domain (OOD) settings where existing methods cannot, requiring only selecting a set of appropriate data transformations. In experiments on robustness benchmarks in image classification, sentiment analysis, and natural language inference, we demonstrate a strong and robust correlation between our neighborhood invariance measure and actual OOD generalization on over 4,600 models evaluated on over 100 train/test domain pairs",

We address this question for image and text classification using DomainBed, WILDS, and Backgrounds Challenge as testbeds for studying different types of shifts---namely correlation and diversity shift. We search over a wide range of hyperparameters and examine classification accuracy (in-distribution and out-of-distribution) for over 20,000 models. We arrive at the following findings, which we expect to be helpful for practitioners: i) adaptive optimizers (e.g., Adam) perform worse than non-adaptive optimizers (e.g., SGD, momentum SGD) on out-of-distribution performance. In particular, even though there is no significant difference in in-distribution performance, we show a measurable difference in out-of-distribution performance. ii) in-distribution performance and out-of-distribution performance exhibit three types of behavior depending on the dataset---linear returns, increasing returns, and diminishing returns.

This is rather surprising, since undersampling algorithms discard excess majority group data. To understand this phenomenon, we ask if learning is fundamentally constrained by a lack of minority group samples. We prove that this is indeed the case in the setting of nonparametric binary classification. Our results show that in the worst case, an algorithm cannot outperform undersampling unless there is a high degree of overlap between the train and test distributions (which is unlikely to be the case in real-world datasets), or if the algorithm leverages additional structure about the distribution shift. In particular, in the case of label shift we show that there is always an undersampling algorithm that is minimax optimal. In the case of group-covariate shift we show that there is an undersampling algorithm that is minimax optimal when the overlap between the group distributions is small.

These strategies violate the main assumption in PDA: only unlabeled target domain samples are available. In addition, there are also experimental inconsistencies between developed methods - different architectures, hyper-parameter tuning, number of runs - yielding unfair comparisons. The main goal of this work is to provide a realistic evaluation of PDA methods under different model selection strategies and a consistent evaluation protocol. We evaluate 6 state-of-the-art PDA algorithms on 2 different real-world datasets using 7 different model selection strategies. Our two main findings are: (i) without target labels for model selection, the accuracy of the methods decreases up to 30 percentage points; (ii) only one method and model selection pair performs well on both datasets. Experiments were performed with our PyTorch framework, BenchmarkPDA, which we open source",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a simple yet effective provable method (named ABSGD) for addressing the data imbalance or label noise problem in deep learning. Our method is a simple modification to momentum SGD where we assign an individual importance weight to each sample in the mini-batch. The individual-level weight of a sampled data is systematically proportional to the exponential of a scaled loss value of the data, where the scaling factor is interpreted as the regularization parameter in the framework of distributionally robust optimization (DRO). Depending on whether the scaling factor is positive or negative, ABSGD is guaranteed to converge to a stationary point of an information-regularized min-max or min-min  DRO problem, respectively. Compared with existing class-level weighting schemes, our method can capture the diversity between individual examples within each class. Compared with existing individual-level weighting methods using meta-learning that require three backward propagations for computing mini-batch stochastic gradients, our method is more efficient with only one backward propagation at each iteration as in standard deep learning methods.  ABSGD is flexible enough to combine with other robust losses without any additional cost. Our empirical studies on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method",

Assuming a mild distribution shift, we wish to accept out-of-distribution (OOD) data from a new domain whenever a model's estimated competence foresees trustworthy responses, instead of rejecting OOD data outright. Trustworthiness is then predicted via a proxy incompetence score that is tightly linked to the performance of a classifier. We present a comprehensive experimental evaluation of existing proxy scores as incompetence scores for classification and highlight the resulting trade-offs between rejection rate and accuracy gain. For comparability with prior work, we focus on standard DG benchmarks and consider the effect of measuring incompetence via different learned representations in a closed versus an open world setting. Our results suggest that increasing incompetence scores are indeed predictive of reduced accuracy, leading to significant improvements of the average accuracy below a suitable incompetence threshold. However, the scores are not yet good enough to allow for a favorable accuracy/rejection trade-off in all tested domains. Surprisingly, our results also indicate that classifiers optimized for DG robustness do not outperform a naive Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) baseline in the competence region, that is, where test samples elicit low incompetence scores",

    "abstract": "Teaching Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to accurately classify nodes under severely noisy labels is an important problem in real-world graph learning applications, but is currently underexplored. Although pairwise training methods have demonstrated promise in supervised metric learning and unsupervised contrastive learning, they remain less studied on noisy graphs, where the structural pairwise interactions (PI) between nodes are abundant and thus might benefit label noise learning rather than the pointwise methods. This paper bridges the gap by proposing a pairwise framework for noisy node classification on graphs, which relies on the PI as a primary learning proxy in addition to the pointwise learning from the noisy node class labels. Our proposed framework PI-GNN contributes two novel components: (1) a confidence-aware PI estimation model that adaptively estimates the PI labels, which are defined as whether the two nodes share the same node labels, and (2) a decoupled training approach that leverages the estimated PI labels to regularize a node classification model for robust node classification. Extensive experiments on different datasets and GNN architectures demonstrate the effectiveness of PI-GNN, yielding a promising improvement over the state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "A probabilistic classifier is considered calibrated if it outputs probabilities equal to the expected class distribution given the classifier's output. Calibration is essential in safety-critical tasks where small deviations between the predicted probabilities and the actually observed class proportions can incur high costs. A common approach to improve the calibration of a classifier is to use a hold-out data set and a post-hoc calibration method to learn a correcting transformation for the classifier's output. This work explores the field of post-hoc calibration methods for multi-class classifiers and formulates two assumptions about the probability simplex which have been used by many existing non-parametric calibration methods, but despite this, have never been explicitly stated: assuming locally equal label distributions or assuming locally equal calibration errors. Based on the latter assumption, an intuitive non-parametric post-hoc calibration method is proposed, which is shown to offer improvements to the state-of-the-art according to the expected calibration error metric on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 data sets",

In this paper, we postulate a graph convolutional relationship between the observed and latent graphs, and formulate the graph structure learning task as a network inverse (deconvolution) problem. In lieu of eigendecomposition-based spectral methods or iterative optimization solutions, we unroll and truncate proximal gradient iterations to arrive at a parameterized neural network architecture that we call a Graph Deconvolution Network (GDN). GDNs can learn a distribution of graphs in a supervised fashion, perform link prediction or edge-weight regression tasks by adapting the loss function, and they are inherently inductive as well as node permutation equivariant. We corroborate GDN's superior graph learning performance and its generalization to larger graphs using synthetic data in supervised settings. Moreover, we demonstrate the robustness and representation power of GDNs on real world neuroimaging and social network datasets",

    "abstract": "Photorealistic object appearance modeling from 2D images is a constant topic in vision and graphics. While neural implicit methods (such as Neural Radiance Fields) have shown high-fidelity view synthesis results, they cannot relight the captured objects. More recent neural inverse rendering approaches have enabled object relighting, but they represent surface properties as simple BRDFs, and therefore cannot handle translucent objects. We propose Object-Centric Neural Scattering Functions (OSFs) for learning to reconstruct object appearance from only images. OSFs not only support free-viewpoint object relighting, but also can model both opaque and translucent objects. While accurately modeling subsurface light transport for translucent objects can be highly complex and even intractable for neural methods, OSFs learn to approximate the radiance transfer from a distant light to an outgoing direction at any spatial location. This approximation avoids explicitly modeling complex subsurface scattering, making learning a neural implicit model tractable. Experiments on real and synthetic data show that OSFs accurately reconstruct appearances for both opaque and translucent objects, allowing faithful free-viewpoint relighting as well as scene composition.

    "abstract": "The completeness axiom renders the explanation of a post-hoc eXplainable AI (XAI) method only locally faithful to the model, i.e. for a single decision. For the trustworthy application of XAI, in particular for high-stake decisions, a more global model understanding is required. To this end, concept-based methods have been proposed, which are however not guaranteed to be bound to the actual model reasoning. To circumvent this problem, we propose Multi-dimensional Concept Discovery (MCD) as an extension of previous approaches that fulfills a completeness relation on the level of concepts. Our method starts from general linear subspaces as concepts and does neither require reinforcing concept interpretability nor re-training of model parts. We propose sparse subspace clustering to discover improved concepts and fully leverage the potential of multi-dimensional subspaces. MCD offers two complementary analysis tools for concepts in input space: (1) concept activation maps, that show where a concept is expressed within a sample, allowing for concept characterization through prototypical samples, and (2) concept relevance heatmaps, that decompose the model decision into concept contributions. Both tools together enable a detailed global understanding of the model reasoning, which is guaranteed to relate to the model via a completeness relation. Thus, MCD paves the way towards more trustworthy concept-based XAI. We empirically demonstrate the superiority of MCD against more constrained concept definitions",

A major cause of model unfairness is the imbalanced representation of different groups in training data. Recently, several works aim to alleviate this issue using generated data. However, these approaches often use generated data to obtain similar amounts of data across groups, which is not optimal for achieving high fairness due to different learning difficulties and generated data qualities across groups. To address this issue, we propose a novel adaptive sampling approach that leverages both real and generated data for fairness. We design a bilevel optimization that finds the optimal data sampling ratios among groups and between real and generated data while training a model. The ratios are dynamically adjusted considering both the model's accuracy as well as its fairness. To efficiently solve our non-convex bilevel optimization, we propose a simple approximation to the solution given by the implicit function theorem. Extensive experiments show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art fairness and accuracy on the CelebA and ImageNet People Subtree datasets. We also observe that our method adaptively relies less on the generated data when it has poor quality.

    "abstract": "In real-world multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) applications, agents may not have perfect state information (e.g., due to inaccurate measurement or malicious attacks), which challenges the robustness of agents' policies. Though robustness is getting important in MARL deployment, little prior work has studied state uncertainties in MARL, neither in problem formulation nor algorithm design. Motivated by this robustness issue and the lack of corresponding studies, we study the problem of MARL with state uncertainty in this work. We provide the first attempt to the theoretical and empirical analysis of this challenging problem. We first model the problem as a Markov Game with state perturbation adversaries (MG-SPA) by introducing a set of state perturbation adversaries into a Markov Game. We then introduce robust equilibrium (RE) as the solution concept of an MG-SPA. We conduct a fundamental analysis regarding MG-SPA such as giving conditions under which such a robust equilibrium exists. Then we propose a robust multi-agent Q-learning (RMAQ) algorithm to find such an equilibrium, with convergence guarantees. To handle high-dimensional state-action space, we design a robust multi-agent actor-critic (RMAAC) algorithm based on an analytical expression of the policy gradient derived in the paper. Our experiments show that the proposed RMAQ algorithm converges to the optimal value function; our RMAAC algorithm outperforms several MARL and robust MARL methods in multiple multi-agent environments when state uncertainty is present.

    "title": "An Adaptive Half-Space Projection Method for Stochastic Optimization Problems with Group Sparse Regularization",
    "abstract": "Optimization problems with group sparse regularization are ubiquitous in various popular downstream applications, such as feature selection and compression for Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Nonetheless, the existing methods in the literature do not perform particularly well when such regularization is used in combination with a stochastic loss function. In particular, it is challenging to design a computationally efficient algorithm with a convergence guarantee and can compute group-sparse solutions. Recently, a half-space stochastic projected gradient (HSPG)  method was proposed that partly addressed these challenges. This paper presents a substantially enhanced version of HSPG that we call AdaHSPG+ that makes two noticeable advances. First, AdaHSPG+ is shown to have a stronger convergence result under significantly looser assumptions than those required by HSPG. This improvement in convergence is achieved by integrating variance reduction techniques with a new adaptive strategy for iteratively predicting the support of a solution. Second, AdaHSPG+ requires significantly less parameter tuning compared to HSPG, thus making it more practical and user-friendly. This advance is achieved by designing automatic and adaptive strategies for choosing the type of step employed at each iteration and for updating key hyperparameters. The numerical effectiveness of our proposed AdaHSPG+ algorithm is demonstrated on both convex and non-convex benchmark problems. The source code is available at https://github.com/tianyic/adahspg",

    "abstract": "Graph attention networks estimate the relational importance of node neighbors to aggregate relevant information over local neighborhoods for a prediction task. However, the inferred attentions are vulnerable to spurious correlations and connectivity in the training data, hampering the generalizability of models. We introduce CAR, a general-purpose regularization framework for graph attention networks. Embodying a causal inference approach based on invariance prediction, CAR aligns the attention mechanism with the causal effects of active interventions on graph connectivity in a scalable manner. CAR is compatible with a variety of graph attention architectures, and we show that it systematically improves generalizability on various node classification tasks. Our ablation studies indicate that CAR hones in on the aspects of graph structure most pertinent to the prediction (e.g., homophily), and does so more effectively than alternative approaches. Finally, we also show that \\methodname enhances interpretability of attention coefficients by accentuating node-neighbor relations that point to causal hypotheses",

    "title": "Analyzing Deep PAC-Bayesian Learning with Neural Tangent Kernel: Convergence, Analytic Generalization Bound, and Efficient Hyperparameter Selection",
    "abstract": "PAC-Bayes is a well-established framework for analyzing generalization performance in machine learning models. This framework provides a bound on the expected population error by considering the sum of training error and the divergence between posterior and prior distributions. In addition to being a successful generalization bound analysis tool, the PAC-Bayesian bound can also be incorporated into an objective function for training probabilistic neural networks, which we refer to simply as {\\it Deep PAC-Bayesian Learning}. Deep PAC-Bayesian learning has been shown to achieve competitive expected test set error and provide a tight generalization bound in practice at the same time through gradient descent training. Despite its empirical success, theoretical analysis of deep PAC-Bayesian learning for neural networks is rarely explored. To this end, this paper proposes a theoretical convergence and generalization analysis for Deep PAC-Bayesian learning. For a deep and wide probabilistic neural network, our analysis shows that PAC-Bayesian learning corresponds to solving a kernel ridge regression when the probabilistic neural tangent kernel (PNTK) is used as the kernel. We utilize this outcome in conjunction with the PAC-Bayes $\\mathcal{C}$-bound, enabling us to derive an analytical and guaranteed PAC-Bayesian generalization bound for the first time. Finally, drawing insight from our theoretical results, we propose a proxy measure for efficient hyperparameter selection, which is proven to be time-saving on various benchmarks. Our work not only provides a better understanding of the theoretical underpinnings of Deep PAC-Bayesian learning, but also offers practical tools for improving the training and generalization performance of these models",

    "title": "High-Modality Multimodal Transformer: Quantifying Modality & Interaction Heterogeneity for High-Modality Representation Learning",
    "abstract": "Many real-world problems are inherently multimodal, from the communicative modalities humans use to express social and emotional states such as spoken language, gestures, and paralinguistics to the force, proprioception, and visual sensors ubiquitous on robots. While there has been an explosion of interest in multimodal representation learning, these methods are still largely focused on a small set of modalities, primarily in the language, vision, and audio space. In order to accelerate generalization towards diverse and understudied modalities, this paper studies efficient representation learning for high-modality scenarios involving a large set of diverse modalities. Since adding new models for every new modality or task becomes prohibitively expensive, a critical technical challenge is heterogeneity quantification: how can we measure which modalities encode similar information and interactions in order to permit parameter sharing with previous modalities? This paper proposes two new information theoretic metrics for heterogeneity quantification: (1) modality heterogeneity studies how similar $2$ modalities $\\{X_1,X_2\\}$ are by measuring how much information can be transferred from $X_1$ to $X_2$, while (2) interaction heterogeneity studies how similarly pairs of modalities $\\{X_1,X_2\\}, \\{X_3,X_4\\}$ interact by measuring how much interaction information can be transferred from $\\{X_1,X_2\\}$ to $\\{X_3,X_4\\}$. We show the importance of these $2$ proposed metrics in high-modality scenarios as a way to automatically prioritize the fusion of modalities that contain unique information or unique interactions. The result is a single model, HighMMT, that scales up to $10$ modalities (text, image, audio, video, sensors, proprioception, speech, time-series, sets, and tables) and $15$ tasks from $5$ different research areas. Not only does HighMMT outperform prior methods on the tradeoff between performance and efficiency, it also demonstrates a crucial scaling behavior: performance continues to improve with each modality added, and it transfers to entirely new modalities and tasks during fine-tuning. We release our code and benchmarks, which we hope will present a unified platform for subsequent theoretical and empirical analysis",

    "abstract": "Demographic parity is the most widely recognized measure of group fairness in machine learning, which ensures equal treatment of different demographic groups. Numerous works aim to achieve demographic parity by pursuing the commonly used metric $\\Delta DP$. Unfortunately, in this paper, we reveal that the fairness metric $\\Delta DP$ can not precisely measure the violation of demographic parity, because it inherently has the following drawbacks: i) zero-value $\\Delta DP$ does not guarantee zero violation of demographic parity, ii)  $\\Delta DP$ values can vary with different classification thresholds. To this end, we propose two new fairness metrics, Area Between Probability density function Curves (ABPC) and Area Between Cumulative density function Curves (ABCC), to precisely measure the violation of demographic parity at the distribution level. The new fairness metrics directly measure the difference between the distributions of the prediction probability for different demographic groups. Thus our proposed new metrics enjoy: i) zero-value ABCC/ABPC guarantees zero violation of demographic parity; ii) ABCC/ABPC guarantees demographic parity while the classification thresholds are adjusted. We further re-evaluate the existing fair models with our proposed fairness metrics and observe different fairness behaviors of those models under the new metrics",

    "title": "Generating Adversarial Examples with Task Oriented Multi-Objective Optimization",
    "abstract": "Deep learning models, even the-state-of-the-art ones, are highly vulnerable to adversarial examples. Adversarial training is one of the most efficient methods to improve the model's robustness. The key factor for the success of adversarial training is the capability to generate \nqualified and divergent adversarial examples which satisfy some objectives/goals (e.g., finding adversarial examples that maximize the model losses for simultaneously attacking multiple models). Therefore, multi-objective optimization (MOO) is a natural tool for adversarial example generation to achieve multiple objectives/goals simultaneously. However, we observe that a naive application of MOO tends to maximize all objectives/goals equally, without caring if an objective/goal has been achieved yet. This leads to useless effort to further improve the goal-achieved tasks, while putting less focus on the goal-unachieved tasks. In this paper, we propose \\emph{Task Oriented MOO} to address this issue, in the context where we can explicitly define the goal achievement for a task. Our principle is to only maintain the goal-achieved tasks, while letting the optimizer spend more effort on improving the goal-unachieved tasks. We conduct comprehensive experiments for our Task Oriented MOO on various adversarial example generation schemes. The experimental results firmly demonstrate the merit of our proposed approach",

Theoretical guarantees for Denise are provided.  These include a novel universal approximation theorem adapted to our geometric deep learning problem and convergence to an optimal solution to the learning problem.

    "abstract": "Mean Field Control (MFC) is a powerful approximation tool to solve large-scale Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) problems. However, the success of MFC  relies on the presumption that given the local states and actions of all the agents, the next (local) states of the agents evolve conditionally independent of each other. Here we demonstrate that even in a MARL setting where agents share a common global state in addition to their local states evolving conditionally independently (thus introducing a correlation between the state transition processes of individual agents), the MFC can still be applied as a good approximation tool. The global state is assumed to be non-decomposable i.e., it cannot be expressed as a collection of local states of the agents. We compute the approximation error as $\\mathcal{O}(e)$ where $e=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}\\left[\\sqrt{|\\mathcal{X}|} +\\sqrt{|\\mathcal{U}|}\\right]$.  The size of the agent population is denoted by the term $N$, and $|\\mathcal{X}|, |\\mathcal{U}|$ respectively indicate the sizes of (local) state and action spaces of individual agents. The approximation error is found to be independent of the size of the shared global state space. We further demonstrate that in a special case if the reward and state transition functions are independent of the action distribution of the population, then the error can be improved to $e=\\frac{\\sqrt{|\\mathcal{X}|}}{\\sqrt{N}}$. Finally, we devise a Natural Policy Gradient based algorithm that solves the MFC problem with $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-3})$ sample complexity and obtains a policy that is within $\\mathcal{O}(\\max\\{e,\\epsilon\\})$ error of the optimal MARL policy for any $\\epsilon>0$",

    "abstract": "The need for reliable model explanations is prominent for many machine learning applications, particularly for tabular and time-series data as their use cases often involve high-stakes decision making.  Towards this goal, we introduce a novel interpretable modeling framework, Interpretable Mixture of Experts (IME), that yields high accuracy, comparable to `black-box' Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in many cases, along with useful interpretability capabilities. IME consists of an assignment module and a mixture of experts, with each sample being assigned to a single expert for prediction. We introduce multiple options for IME based on the assignment and experts being interpretable. When the experts are chosen to be interpretable such as linear models, IME yields an inherently-interpretable architecture where the explanations produced by IME are the exact descriptions of how the prediction is computed. In addition to constituting a standalone inherently-interpretable architecture, IME has the premise of being integrated with existing DNNs to offer interpretability to a subset of samples while maintaining the accuracy of the DNNs. Through extensive experiments on 15 tabular and time-series datasets, IME is demonstrated to be more accurate than single interpretable models and perform comparably with existing state-of-the-art DNNs in accuracy. On most datasets, IME even outperforms DNNs, while providing faithful explanations.  Lastly, IME's explanations are compared to commonly-used post-hoc explanations methods through a user study -- participants are able to better predict the model behavior when given IME explanations, while finding IME's explanations more faithful and trustworthy",

A recent line of work indicates that a hybrid of classical numerical techniques and machine learning can offer significant improvements over either approach alone. In this work, we show that the choice of the numerical scheme is crucial when incorporating physics-based priors. We build upon Fourier-based spectral methods, which are known to be more efficient than other numerical schemes for simulating PDEs with smooth and periodic solutions. Specifically, we develop ML-augmented spectral solvers for three common PDEs of fluid dynamics.

    "abstract": "Ad hoc teamwork (AHT) is the challenge of designing a robust learner agent that effectively collaborates with unknown teammates without prior coordination mechanisms. Early approaches address the AHT challenge by training the learner with a diverse set of handcrafted teammate policies, usually designed based on an expert's domain knowledge about the policies the learner may encounter. However, implementing teammate policies for training based on domain knowledge is not always feasible. In such cases, recent approaches attempted to improve the robustness of the learner by training it with teammate policies generated by optimising information-theoretic diversity metrics. The problem with optimising existing information-theoretic diversity metrics for teammate policy generation is the emergence of superficially different teammates. When used for AHT training, superficially different teammate behaviours may not improve a learner's robustness during collaboration with unknown teammates. In this paper, we present an automated teammate policy generation method optimising the Best-Response Diversity (BRDiv) metric, which measures diversity based on the compatibility of teammate policies in terms of returns. We evaluate our approach in environments with multiple valid coordination strategies, comparing against methods optimising information-theoretic diversity metrics and an ablation not optimising any diversity metric. Our experiments indicate that optimising BRDiv yields a diverse set of training teammate policies that improve the learner's performance relative to previous teammate generation approaches when collaborating with near-optimal previously unseen teammate policies",

This usually skimmed-over trick of throwing away the entire projector is actually critical for SSL methods to display competitive performances. For example, on ImageNet classification, more than 30 points of percentage can be gained that way. This is a little vexing, as one would hope that the network layer at which invariance is explicitly enforced by the SSL criterion during training (the last layer) should be the one to use for best generalization performance downstream. But it seems not to be, and this study sheds some light on why.\nThis trick, which we name Guillotine Regularization (GR), is in fact a generically applicable method that has been used to improve generalization performance in transfer learning scenarios.

The SF framework extended SR by linearly decomposing rewards into successor features and a reward weight vector allowing their application in high-dimensional tasks. But this came with the cost of having a linear relationship between reward functions and successor features, limiting its application to tasks where such a linear relationship exists. We propose a novel formulation of SR based on learning the cumulative discounted probability of successor features, called Successor Feature Representations (SFR). Crucially, SFR allows to reevaluate the expected return of policies for general reward functions.

    "title": "Lightweight Learner for Shared Knowledge Lifelong Learning",
    "abstract": "In Lifelong Learning (LL), agents continually learn as they encounter new conditions and tasks. Most current LL is limited to a single agent that learns tasks sequentially. Dedicated LL machinery is then deployed to mitigate the forgetting of old tasks as new tasks are learned. This is inherently slow. We propose a new Shared Knowledge Lifelong Learning (SKILL) challenge, which deploys a decentralized population of LL agents that each sequentially learn different tasks, with all agents operating independently and in parallel. After learning their respective tasks, agents share and consolidate their knowledge over a decentralized communication network, so that, in the end, all agents can master all tasks. We present one solution to SKILL which uses Lightweight Lifelong Learning (LLL) agents, where the goal is to facilitate efficient sharing by minimizing the fraction of the agent that is specialized for any given task. Each LLL agent thus consists of a common task-agnostic immutable part, where most parameters are, and individual task-specific modules that contain fewer parameters but are adapted to each task. Agents share their task-specific modules, plus summary information (\"task anchors\") representing their tasks in the common task-agnostic latent space of all agents. Receiving agents register each received task-specific module using the corresponding anchor. Thus, every agent improves its ability to solve new tasks each time new task-specific modules and anchors are received. If all agents can communicate with all others, eventually all agents become identical and can solve all tasks. On a new, very challenging SKILL-102 dataset with 102 image classification tasks (5,033 classes in total, 2,041,225 training, 243,464 validation, and 243,464 test images), we achieve much higher (and SOTA) accuracy over 8 LL baselines, while also achieving near perfect parallelization.

Most deep clustering algorithms are very effective when given the number of clusters K.

This paper proposes a plug-and-play clustering module to automatically adjust the number of clusters, which can be easily embedded into existing deep parametric clustering methods. By analyzing the goal of clustering, a split-and-merge framework is introduced to reduce the intra-class diversity and increase the inter-class difference, which leverages the entropy between different clusters. Specifically, given an initial clustering number, clusters can be split into sub-clusters or merged into super-clusters and converge to a stable number of K clusters at the end of training. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve comparable performance with the state-of-the-art works without requiring the number of clusters",

However, federated learning faces severe optimization difficulty when training samples are not independently and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.). In this paper, we point out that the client sampling practice plays a decisive role in the aforementioned optimization difficulty. We find that the negative client sampling will cause the merged data distribution of currently sampled clients heavily inconsistent with that of all available clients, and further make the aggregated gradient unreliable. To address this issue, we propose a novel learning rate adaptation mechanism to adaptively adjust the server learning rate for the aggregated gradient in each round, according to the consistency between the merged data distribution of currently sampled clients and that of all available clients. Specifically, we make theoretical deductions to find a meaningful and robust indicator that is positively related to the optimal server learning rate, which is supposed to minimize the Euclidean distance between the aggregated gradient given currently sampled clients and that if all clients could participate in the current round. We show that our proposed indicator can effectively reflect the merged data distribution of sampled clients, thus we utilize it for the server learning rate adaptation. Extensive experiments on multiple image and text classification tasks validate the great effectiveness of our method in various settings.

    "title": "A Measure of the Complexity of Neural Representations based on Partial Information Decomposition",
    "abstract": "In neural networks, task-relevant information is represented jointly by groups of neurons. However, the specific way in which this mutual information about the classification label is distributed among the individual neurons is not well understood: While parts of it may only be obtainable from specific single neurons, other parts are carried redundantly or synergistically by multiple neurons. We show how Partial Information Decomposition (PID), a recent extension of information theory, can disentangle these different contributions. From this, we introduce the measure of ``Representational Complexity'', which quantifies the difficulty of accessing information spread across multiple neurons. We show how this complexity is directly computable for smaller layers. For larger layers, we propose subsampling and coarse-graining procedures and prove corresponding bounds on the latter. Empirically, for quantized deep neural networks solving the MNIST and CIFAR10 tasks, we observe that representational complexity decreases both through successive hidden layers and over training, and compare the results to related measures. Overall, we propose representational complexity as a principled and interpretable summary statistic for analyzing the structure and evolution of neural representations and complex systems in general",

    "title": "Trip-ROMA: Self-Supervised Learning with Triplets and Random Mappings",
    "abstract": "Contrastive self-supervised learning (SSL) methods, such as MoCo and SimCLR, have achieved great success in unsupervised visual representation learning. They rely on a large number of negative pairs and thus require either large memory banks or large batches. Some recent non-contrastive SSL methods, such as BYOL and SimSiam, attempt to discard negative pairs and have also shown remarkable performance. To avoid collapsed solutions caused by not using negative pairs, these methods require non-trivial asymmetry designs. However, in small data regimes, we can not obtain a sufficient number of negative pairs or effectively avoid the over-fitting problem when negatives are not used at all. To address this situation, we argue that negative pairs are still important but one is generally sufficient for each positive pair. We show that a simple Triplet-based loss (Trip) can achieve surprisingly good performance without requiring large batches or asymmetry designs. Moreover, to alleviate the over-fitting problem in small data regimes and further enhance the effect of Trip, we propose a simple plug-and-play RandOm MApping (ROMA) strategy by randomly mapping samples into other spaces and requiring these randomly projected samples to satisfy the same relationship indicated by the triplets. Integrating the triplet-based loss with random mapping, we obtain the proposed method Trip-ROMA. Extensive experiments, including unsupervised representation learning and unsupervised few-shot learning, have been conducted on ImageNet-1K and seven small datasets. They successfully demonstrate the effectiveness of Trip-ROMA and consistently show that ROMA can further effectively boost other SSL methods.

    "title": "Agent-State Construction with Auxiliary Inputs",
    "abstract": "In many, if not every realistic sequential decision-making task, the decision-making agent is not able to model the full complexity of the world. The environment is often much larger and more complex than the agent, a setting also known as partial observability. In such settings, the agent must leverage more than just the current sensory inputs; it must construct an agent state that summarizes previous interactions with the world. Currently, a popular approach for tackling this problem is to learn the agent-state function via a recurrent network from the agent's sensory stream as input. Many impressive reinforcement learning applications have instead relied on environment-specific functions to aid the agent's inputs for history summarization. These augmentations are done in multiple ways, from simple approaches like concatenating observations to more complex ones such as uncertainty estimates. Although ubiquitous in the field, these additional inputs, which we term auxiliary inputs, are rarely emphasized, and it is not clear what their role or impact is. In this work we explore this idea further, and relate these auxiliary inputs to prior classic approaches to state construction. We present a series of examples illustrating the different ways of using auxiliary inputs for reinforcement learning. We show that these auxiliary inputs can be used to discriminate between observations that would otherwise be aliased, leading to more expressive features that smoothly interpolate between different states. Finally, we show that this approach is complementary to state-of-the-art methods such as recurrent neural networks and truncated back-propagation through time, and acts as a heuristic that facilitates longer temporal credit assignment, leading to better performance",

    "abstract": "Language models demonstrate both quantitative improvement and new qualitative capabilities with increasing scale. Despite their potentially transformative impact, these new capabilities are as yet poorly characterized. In order to inform future research, prepare for disruptive new model capabilities, and ameliorate socially harmful effects, it is vital that we understand the present and near-future capabilities and limitations of language models.\nTo address this challenge, we introduce the Beyond the Imitation Game benchmark (BIG- bench). BIG-bench currently consists of 204 tasks, contributed by 450 authors across 132 institutions. Task topics are diverse, drawing problems from linguistics, childhood develop- ment, math, common-sense reasoning, biology, physics, social bias, software development, and beyond. BIG-bench focuses on tasks that are believed to be beyond the capabilities of current language models. We evaluate the behavior of OpenAI's GPT models, Google- internal dense transformer architectures, and Switch-style sparse transformers on BIG-bench, across model sizes spanning millions to hundreds of billions of parameters. In addition, a team of human expert raters performed all tasks in order to provide a strong baseline. Findings include: model performance and calibration both improve with scale, but are poor in absolute terms (and when compared with rater performance); performance is remarkably similar across model classes, though with benefits from sparsity; tasks that improve gradually and predictably commonly involve a large knowledge or memorization component, whereas tasks that exhibit \"breakthrough\" behavior at a critical scale often involve multiple steps or components, or brittle metrics; social bias typically increases with scale in settings with ambiguous context, but this can be improved with prompting",

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been demonstrated to achieve state-of-the-art performance for a number of graph-based learning tasks, which leads to a rise in their employment in various domains. However, it has been shown that GNNs may inherit and even amplify bias within training data, which leads to unfair results towards certain sensitive groups. Meanwhile, training of GNNs introduces additional challenges, such as slow convergence and possible instability. Faced with these limitations, this work proposes FairNorm, a unified normalization-based framework that reduces the bias in GNN-based learning while also providing provably faster convergence. Specifically, FairNorm presents individual normalization operators over different sensitive groups and introduces fairness regularizers on the learnable parameters of normalization layers to reduce the bias in GNNs. The design of the proposed regularizers is built upon analyses that illuminate the sources of bias in graph-based learning. Experiments on node classification over real-world networks demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme in improving fairness in terms of statistical parity and equal opportunity compared to fairness-aware baselines. In addition, it is empirically shown that the proposed framework leads to faster convergence compared to the naive baseline where no normalization is employed",

In this paper, we aim to address the benefits of two ingredients -- prior functions and bootstrapping -- which have come into question.

Recent empirical evidence (see, e.g., ~\\cite{tseng2020fourier,aghazadeh2021epistatic,ha2021adaptive}) suggests that regularizing the spectral representation of such models improves their generalization power when labeled data is scarce. However, despite these empirical studies, the theoretical underpinning of when and how spectral regularization enables improved generalization is poorly understood. In this paper, we focus on learning pseudo-Boolean functions and demonstrate that regularizing the empirical mean squared error by the $L_1$ norm of the spectral transform of the learned function reshapes the loss landscape and allows for data-frugal learning under a restricted secant condition on the learner's empirical error measured against the ground truth function. Under a weaker quadratic growth condition, we show that stationary points, which also approximately interpolate the training data points achieve statistically optimal generalization performance. Complementing our theory, we empirically demonstrate that running gradient descent on the regularized loss results in a better generalization performance compared to baseline algorithms in several data-scarce real-world problems",

However, GDA has been proved to converge to stationary points for nonconvex minimax optimization, which are suboptimal compared with local minimax points. In this work, we develop cubic regularization (CR) type algorithms that globally converge to local minimax points in nonconvex-strongly-concave minimax optimization. We first show that local minimax points are equivalent to second-order stationary points of a certain envelope function. Then, inspired by the classic cubic regularization algorithm, we propose an algorithm named Cubic-LocalMinimax for finding local minimax points, and provide a comprehensive convergence analysis by leveraging its intrinsic potential function. Specifically, we establish the global convergence of Cubic-LocalMinimax to a local minimax point at a sublinear convergence rate and characterize its iteration complexity. Also, we propose a GDA-based solver for solving the cubic subproblem involved in Cubic-LocalMinimax up to certain pre-defined accuracy, and analyze the overall gradient and Hessian-vector product computation complexities of such an inexact Cubic-LocalMinimax algorithm. Moreover, we propose a stochastic variant of Cubic-LocalMinimax for large-scale minimax optimization, and characterize its sample complexity under stochastic sub-sampling. Experimental results demonstrate faster or comparable convergence speed of our stochastic Cubic-LocalMinimax than the state-of-the-art algorithms such as GDA and Minimax Cubic-Newton.

However, empirical studies have found mixed and even negative results. An open question, therefore, is under what conditions explanations can improve human understanding and in what way. To address this question, we first identify three core concepts that cover most existing quantitative measures of understanding: task decision boundary, model decision boundary, and model error. Using adapted causal diagrams, we provide a formal characterization of the relationship between these concepts and human approximations (i.e., understanding) of them. The relationship varies by the level of human intuition in different task types, such as emulation and discovery, which are often ignored when building or evaluating explanation methods. Our key result is that human intuitions are necessary for generating and evaluating machine explanations in human-AI decision making: without assumptions about human intuitions, explanations may improve human understanding of model decision boundary, but cannot improve human understanding of task decision boundary or model error. To validate our theoretical claims, we conduct human subject studies to show the importance of human intuitions. Together with our theoretical contributions, we provide a new paradigm for designing behavioral studies towards a rigorous view of the role of machine explanations across different tasks of human-AI decision making",

    "title": "Fairness via In-Processing in the Over-parameterized Regime: A Cautionary Tale with MinDiff Loss",
    "abstract": "Prior work has observed that the test error of state-of-the-art deep neural networks often continues to decrease with increasing over-parameterization, a phenomenon referred to as double descent. This allows deep learning engineers to instantiate large models without having to worry about over-fitting. Despite its benefits, however, prior work has shown that over-parameterization can exacerbate bias against minority subgroups. Several fairness-constrained DNN training methods have been proposed to address this concern. Here, we critically examine MinDiff, a fairness-constrained training procedure implemented within TensorFlow's Responsible AI Toolkit, that aims to achieve Equality of Opportunity. We show that although MinDiff improves fairness for under-parameterized models, it is likely to be ineffective in the over-parameterized regime. This is because an overfit model with zero training loss is trivially group-wise fair on training data, creating an “illusion of fairness,” thus turning off the MinDiff optimization (this will apply to any disparity-based measures which care about errors or accuracy; while it won’t apply to demographic parity). We find that within specified fairness constraints, under-parameterized MinDiff models can even have lower error compared to their over-parameterized counterparts (despite baseline over-parameterized models having lower error compared to their under-parameterized counterparts). We further show that MinDiff optimization is very sensitive to choice of batch size in the under-parameterized regime. Thus, fair model training using MinDiff requires time-consuming hyper-parameter searches. Finally, we suggest using previously proposed regularization techniques, viz. L2, early stopping and flooding in conjunction with MinDiff to train fair over-parameterized models. In our results, over-parameterized models trained using MinDiff+regularization with standard batch sizes are fairer than their under-parameterized counterparts, suggesting that at the very least, regularizers should be integrated into fair deep learning flows, like MinDiff",

    "title": "Graph-based Multi-ODE Neural Networks for Spatio-Temporal Traffic Forecasting",
    "abstract": "There is a recent surge in the development of spatio-temporal forecasting models in the transportation domain. Long-range traffic forecasting, however,  remains a challenging task due to the intricate and extensive spatio-temporal correlations observed in traffic networks. \nCurrent works primarily rely on road networks with graph structures and learn representations using graph neural networks (GNNs), but this approach suffers from over-smoothing problem in deep architectures. To tackle this problem, recent methods introduced the combination of GNNs with residual connections or neural ordinary differential equations (ODE). However, current graph ODE models face two key limitations in feature extraction: (1) they lean towards global temporal patterns, overlooking local patterns that are important for unexpected events; and (2) they lack dynamic semantic edges in their architectural design. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture called Graph-based Multi-ODE Neural Networks (GRAM-ODE) which is designed with multiple connective ODE-GNN modules to learn better representations by capturing different views of complex local and global dynamic spatio-temporal dependencies. We also add some techniques like shared weights and divergence constraints into the intermediate layers of distinct ODE-GNN modules to further improve their communication towards the forecasting task. Our extensive set of experiments conducted on six real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of GRAM-ODE compared with state-of-the-art baselines as well as the contribution of different components to the overall performance",

(1) Public benchmarks are flawed (e.g., due to potentially erroneous anomaly labels), (2) there is no widely accepted standard evaluation metric, and (3) evaluation protocols are mostly inconsistent. In this work, we address all three issues: (1) We critically analyze several of the most widely-used multivariate datasets, identify a number of significant issues, and select the best candidates for evaluation. (2) We introduce a new evaluation metric for time-series anomaly detection, which—in contrast to previous metrics—is recall consistent and takes temporal correlations into account. (3) We analyze and overhaul existing evaluation protocols and provide the largest benchmark of deep multivariate time-series anomaly detection methods to date. We focus on deep-learning based methods and multivariate data, a common setting in modern anomaly detection. We provide all implementations and analysis tools in a new comprehensive library for Time Series Anomaly Detection, called TimeSeAD",

    "title": "Data Models for Dataset Drift Controls in Machine Learning With Optical Images",
    "abstract": "Camera images are ubiquitous in machine learning research. They also play a central role in the delivery of important public services spanning medicine or environmental surveying. However, the application of machine learning models in these domains has been limited because of robustness concerns. A primary failure mode are performance drops due to differences between the training and deployment data. While there are methods to prospectively validate the robustness of machine learning models to such dataset drifts, existing approaches do not account for explicit models of machine learning's primary object of interest: the data. This limits our ability to study and understand the relationship between data generation and downstream machine learning model performance in a physically accurate manner. In this study, we demonstrate how to overcome this limitation by pairing traditional machine learning with physical optics to obtain explicit and differentiable data models. We demonstrate how such data models can be constructed for image data and used to control downstream machine learning model performance related to dataset drift. The findings are distilled into three applications. First, drift synthesis enables the controlled generation of physically faithful drift test cases to power model selection and targeted generalization. Second, the gradient connection between machine learning task model and data model allows advanced, precise tolerancing of task model sensitivity to changes in the data generation. These drift forensics can be used to precisely specify the acceptable data environments in which a task model may be run. Third, drift optimization opens up the possibility to create drifts that can help the task model learn better faster, effectively optimizing the data generating process itself to support the downstream machine vision task. This is an interesting upgrade to existing imaging pipelines which traditionally have been optimized to be consumed by human users but not machine learning models. Alongside the data model code we release two datasets to the public that we collected as part of this work. In total, the two datasets, Raw-Microscopy and Raw-Drone, comprise 1,488 scientifically calibrated reference raw sensor measurements, 8,928 raw intensity variations as well as 17,856 images processed through twelve data models with different configurations.

The goal of this paper is to address these issues with modular multi-source transfer learning techniques.

    "title": "Do Vision-Language Pretrained Models Learn Composable Primitive Concepts?",
    "abstract": "Vision-language (VL) pretrained models have achieved impressive performance on multimodal reasoning and zero-shot recognition tasks. Many of these VL models are pretrained on unlabeled image and caption pairs from the internet. In this paper, we study whether representations of primitive concepts–such as colors, shapes, or the attributes of object parts–emerge automatically within these pretrained VL models. We propose a two-step framework, Compositional Concept Mapping (CompMap), to investigate this. CompMap\nfirst asks a VL model to generate concept activations with text prompts from a predefined list of primitive concepts, and then learns to construct an explicit composition model that maps the primitive concept activations (e.g. the likelihood of black tail or red wing) to com-\nposite concepts (e.g. a red-winged blackbird). We demonstrate that a composition model can be designed as a set operation, and show that a composition model is straightforward for machines to learn from ground truth primitive concepts (as a linear classifier). We thus\nhypothesize that if primitive concepts indeed emerge in a VL pretrained model, its primitive concept activations can be used to learn a composition model similar to the one designed by experts. We propose a quantitative metric to measure the degree of similarity, and refer to the metric as the interpretability of the VL models’ learned primitive concept representations. We also measure the classification accuracy when using the primitive concept activations and the learned composition model to predict the composite concepts, and refer to it as the usefulness metric. Our study reveals that state-of-the-art VL pretrained models learn primitive concepts that are highly useful for fine-grained visual recognition on the CUB dataset, and compositional generalization tasks on the MIT-States dataset. However,\nwe observe that the learned composition models have low interpretability in our qualitative analyses. Our results reveal the limitations of existing VL models, and the necessity of pretraining objectives that encourage the acquisition of primitive concepts",

    "title": "A Simulation Environment and Reinforcement Learning Method for Waste Reduction",
    "abstract": "In retail (e.g., grocery stores, apparel shops, online retailers), inventory managers have to balance short-term risk (no items to sell) with long-term-risk (over ordering leading to product waste). This balancing task is made especially hard due to the lack of information about future customer purchases. In this paper, we study the problem of restocking a grocery store’s inventory with perishable items over time, from a distributional point of view. The objective is to maximize sales while minimizing waste, with uncertainty about the actual consumption by costumers. This problem is of a high relevance today, given the growing demand for food and the impact of food waste on the environment, the economy, and purchasing power. We frame inventory restocking as a new reinforcement learning task that exhibits stochastic behavior conditioned on the agent’s actions, making the environment partially observable. We make two main contributions. First, we introduce a new reinforcement learning environment, RetaiL, based on real grocery store data and expert knowledge. This environment is highly stochastic, and presents a unique challenge for reinforcement learning practitioners. We show that uncertainty about the future behavior of the environment is not handled well by classical supply chain algorithms, and that distributional approaches are a good way to account for the uncertainty. Second, we introduce GTDQN, a distributional reinforcement learning algorithm that learns a generalized lambda distribution over the reward space. GTDQN provides a strong baseline for our environment. It outperforms other distributional reinforcement learning approaches in this partially observable setting, in both overall reward and generated waste",

    "abstract": "The challenge of producing accurate statistics while respecting the privacy of the individuals in a sample is an important area of research. We study minimax lower bounds for classes of differentially private estimators. In particular, we show how to characterize the power of a statistical test under differential privacy in a plug-and-play fashion by solving an appropriate transport problem. With specific coupling constructions, this observation allows us to derive Le Cam-type and Fano-type inequalities not only for regular definitions of differential privacy but also for  those based on Renyi divergence. We then proceed to illustrate our results on three simple, fully worked out examples. In particular, we show that the problem class has a huge importance on the provable degradation of utility due to privacy. In certain scenarios, we show that maintaining privacy results in a noticeable reduction in performance only when the level of privacy protection is very high. Conversely, for other problems, even a modest level of privacy protection can lead to a significant decrease in performance. Finally, we demonstrate that the DP-SGLD algorithm, a private convex solver, can be employed for maximum likelihood estimation with a high degree of confidence, as it provides near-optimal results with respect to both the size of the sample and the level of privacy protection. This algorithm is applicable to a broad range of parametric estimation procedures, including exponential families",

We use a self-supervised feature extractor trained on the auxiliary dataset and train a normalizing flow on the extracted features by maximizing the likelihood on in-distribution data and minimizing the likelihood on the contrastive dataset. We show that this is equivalent to learning the normalized positive difference between the in-distribution and the contrastive feature density.

    "abstract": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are recognized as the candidate for the next-generation neural networks due to their bio-plausibility and energy efficiency. Recently, researchers have demonstrated that SNNs are able to achieve nearly state-of-the-art performance in image recognition tasks using surrogate gradient training. However, some essential questions exist pertaining to SNNs that are little studied: Do SNNs trained with surrogate gradient learn different representations from traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)? Does the time\ndimension in SNNs provide unique representation power? In this paper, we aim to answer these questions by conducting a representation similarity analysis between SNNs and ANNs using Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA). We start by analyzing the spatial dimension of\nthe networks, including both the width and the depth. Furthermore, our analysis of residual connections shows that SNNs learn a periodic pattern, which rectifies the representations in SNNs to be ANN-like. We additionally investigate the effect of the time dimension on SNN representation, finding that deeper layers encourage more dynamics along the time dimension. We also investigate the impact of input data such as event-stream data and adversarial attacks. Our work uncovers a host of new findings of representations in SNNs. We hope this work will inspire future research to fully comprehend the representation power of SNNs. Code is released at https://github.com/Intelligent-Computing-Lab-Yale/SNNCKA",

    "abstract": "A key property of successful learning algorithms is generalization. In classical supervised learning, generalization can be achieved by ensuring that the empirical error converges to the expected error as the number of training samples goes to infinity. Within this classical setting, we analyze the generalization properties of iterative optimizers such as stochastic gradient descent and natural gradient flow through the lens of dynamical systems and control theory. Specifically, we use contraction analysis to show that generalization and dynamical robustness are intimately related through the notion of algorithmic stability. \n\nIn particular, we prove that Riemannian contraction in a supervised learning setting implies generalization. We show that if a learning algorithm is contracting in some Riemannian metric with rate $\\lambda > 0$, it is uniformly algorithmically stable with rate $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\lambda n)$, where $n$ is the number of examples in the training set. The results hold for stochastic and deterministic optimization, in both continuous and discrete-time, for convex and non-convex loss surfaces. \n\nThe associated generalization bounds reduce to well-known results in the particular case of gradient descent over convex or strongly convex loss surfaces. They can be shown to be optimal in  certain linear settings, such as kernel ridge regression under gradient flow. Finally, we demonstrate that the well-known Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition is intimately related to the contraction of a model's outputs as they evolve under gradient descent.

Although agents initialized with such a prior policy can achieve a significantly higher reward with fewer samples when finetuned on the downstream task, it is still an open question how an optimal pretrained prior policy can be achieved in practice. In this work, we present POLTER (Policy Trajectory Ensemble Regularization) – a general method to regularize the pretraining that can be applied to any URL algorithm and is especially useful on data- and knowledge-based URL algorithms. It utilizes an ensemble of policies that are discovered during pretraining and moves the policy of the URL algorithm closer to its optimal prior.

In our main experiments, we evaluate POLTER on the Unsupervised Reinforcement Learning Benchmark (URLB), which consists of 12 tasks in 3 domains. We demonstrate the generality of our approach by improving the performance of a diverse set of data- and knowledge-based URL algorithms by 19% on average and up to 40% in the best case.

    "abstract": "Few-shot learning with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is an important challenge in expanding the remarkable success that GNNs have achieved. In the transductive node classification scenario, conventional supervised training methods for GNNs fail when only few labeled nodes are available. Self-training, wherein the GNN is trained in stages by augmenting the training data with a subset of the unlabeled data and the predictions of the GNN on this data (pseudolabels), has emerged as a promising approach to few-shot transductive learning. However, multi-stage self-training significantly increases the computational demands of GNN training. In addition, while the training set evolves considerably across the stages of self-training, the GNN architecture, graph topology and training hyperparameters are kept constant, adversely affecting the accuracy of the resulting model as well as the computational efficiency of training. To address this challenge, we propose FASTRAIN-GNN, a framework for efficient and accurate self-training of GNNs with few labeled nodes. FASTRAIN-GNN performs four main optimizations in each stage of self-training: (1) Sampling-based Pseudolabel Filtering removes nodes whose pseudolabels are likely to be incorrect from the enlarged training set. (2,3) Dynamic Sizing and Dynamic Regularization find the optimal network architecture and amount of training regularization in each stage of self-training, respectively, and (4) Progressive Graph Pruning removes selected edges between nodes in the training set to reduce the impact of over-smoothing. On few-shot node classification tasks using different GNN architectures, FASTRAIN-GNN produces models that are consistently more accurate (by up to 4.4%), while also substantially reducing the self-training time (by up to 2.1X) over the current state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a memory-augmented control solution to the optimal reference tracking problem for linear systems subject to adversarial disturbances. We assume that the dynamics of the linear system are known and that the reference signal is generated by a linear system\nwith unknown dynamics. Under these assumptions, finding the optimal tracking controller is formalized as an online convex optimization problem that leverages memory of past disturbance and reference values to capture their temporal effects on the performance. That is, a (disturbance, reference)-action control policy is formalized, which selects the control actions as a linear map of the past disturbance and reference values. The online convex optimization is then formulated over the parameters of the policy on its past disturbance and reference\nvalues to optimize general convex costs. It is shown that our approach outperforms robust control methods and achieves a tight regret bound O(√T) where in our regret analysis, we have benchmarked against the best linear policy",

    "title": "Reducing Predictive Feature Suppression in Resource-Constrained Contrastive Image-Caption Retrieval",
    "abstract": "To train image-caption retrieval (ICR) methods, contrastive loss functions are a common choice for optimization functions. \nUnfortunately, contrastive ICR methods are vulnerable to predictive feature suppression. \nPredictive features are features that correctly indicate the similarity between a query and a candidate item. \nHowever, in the presence of multiple predictive features during training, encoder models tend to suppress redundant predictive features, since these features are not needed to learn to discriminate between positive and\nnegative pairs. \nWe introduce an approach to reduce predictive feature suppression for resource-constrained ICR methods: latent target decoding (LTD). We add an additional decoder to the contrastive ICR framework, to reconstruct the input caption in a latent space of a general-purpose\nsentence encoder, which prevents the image and caption encoder from suppressing\npredictive features. \nWe implement the LTD objective as an optimization constraint, to ensure that the reconstruction loss is below a bound value while primarily optimizing for the contrastive loss. \nImportantly, LTD does not depend on additional training data or expensive (hard) negative mining strategies. \nOur experiments show that, unlike reconstructing the input caption in the input space, LTD reduces predictive feature suppression, measured by obtaining higher recall@k, r-precision, and nDCG scores than a contrastive ICR baseline.\nMoreover, we show that LTD should be implemented as an optimization constraint instead\nof a dual optimization objective. Finally, we show that LTD can be used with different\ncontrastive learning losses and a wide variety of resource-constrained ICR methods",

    "title": "Deep Double Descent via Smooth Interpolation",
    "abstract": "The ability of overparameterized deep networks to interpolate noisy data, while at the same time showing good generalization performance, has been recently characterized in terms of the double descent curve for the test error. Common intuition from polynomial regression suggests that overparameterized networks are able to sharply interpolate noisy data, without considerably deviating from the ground-truth signal, thus preserving generalization ability. At present, a precise characterization of the relationship between interpolation and generalization for deep networks is missing. In this work, we quantify sharpness of fit of the training data interpolated by neural network functions, by studying the loss landscape w.r.t. to the input variable locally to each training point, over volumes around cleanly- and noisily-labelled training samples, as we systematically increase the number of model parameters and training epochs. Our findings show that loss sharpness in the input space follows both model- and epoch-wise double descent, with worse peaks observed around noisy labels. While small interpolating models sharply fit both clean and noisy data, large interpolating models express a smooth loss landscape, where noisy targets are predicted over large volumes around training data points, in contrast to existing intuition",

    "abstract": "The Bayesian transformed Gaussian (BTG) model, proposed by Kedem and Oliviera in 1997, was developed as a Bayesian approach to trans-Kriging in the spatial statistics community. In this paper, we revisit BTG in the context of modern Gaussian process literature by framing it as a fully Bayesian counterpart to the Warped Gaussian process that marginalizes out a joint prior over input warping and kernel hyperparameters.  As with any other fully Bayesian approach, this treatment introduces prohibitively expensive computational overhead; unsurprisingly, the BTG posterior predictive distribution, itself estimated through high-dimensional integration, must be inverted in order to perform model prediction.  To address these challenges, we introduce principled numerical techniques for computing with BTG efficiently using a combination of doubly sparse quadrature rules, tight quantile bounds, and rank-one matrix algebra to enable both fast model prediction and model selection. These efficient methods allow us to compute with higher-dimensional datasets and apply BTG with layered transformations that greatly improve its expressibility. We demonstrate that BTG achieves superior empirical performance over MLE-based models in the low-data regime ---situations in which MLE tends to overfit",

    "title": "A Variational Perspective on Generative Flow Networks",
    "abstract": "Generative flow networks (GFNs) are a class of probabilistic models for sequential sampling of composite objects, proportional to a target distribution that is defined in terms of an energy function or a reward. GFNs are typically trained using a flow matching or trajectory balance objective, which matches forward and backward transition models over trajectories. In this work we introduce a variational objective for training GFNs, which is a convex combination of the reverse- and forward KL divergences, and compare it to the trajectory balance objective when sampling from the forward- and backward model, respectively. We show that, in certain settings, variational inference for GFNs is equivalent to minimizing the trajectory balance objective, in the sense that both methods compute the same score-function gradient. This insight suggests that in these settings, control variates, which are commonly used to reduce the variance of score-function gradient estimates, can also be used with the trajectory balance objective. We evaluate our findings and the performance of the proposed variational objective numerically by comparing it to the trajectory balance objective on two synthetic tasks",

    "title": "Differentially private partitioned variational inference",
    "abstract": "Learning a privacy-preserving model from sensitive data which are distributed across multiple devices is an increasingly important problem. The problem is often formulated in the federated learning context, with the aim of learning a single global model while keeping the data distributed. Moreover, Bayesian learning is a popular approach for modelling, since it naturally supports reliable uncertainty estimates. However, Bayesian learning is generally intractable even with centralised non-private data and so approximation techniques such as variational inference are a necessity. Variational inference has recently been extended to the non-private federated learning setting via the partitioned variational inference algorithm. For privacy protection, the current gold standard is called differential privacy. Differential privacy guarantees privacy in a strong, mathematically clearly defined sense.\n\nIn this paper, we present differentially private partitioned variational inference, the first general framework for learning a variational approximation to a Bayesian posterior distribution in the federated learning setting while minimising the number of communication rounds and providing differential privacy guarantees for data subjects.\n\nWe propose three alternative implementations in the general framework, one based on perturbing local optimisation runs done by individual parties, and two based on perturbing updates to the global model (one using a version of federated averaging, the second one adding virtual parties to the protocol), and compare their properties both theoretically and empirically.  We show that perturbing the local optimisation works well with simple and complex models as long as each party has enough local data. However, the privacy is always guaranteed independently by each party. In contrast, perturbing the global updates works best with relatively simple models. Given access to suitable secure primitives, such as secure aggregation or secure shuffling, the performance can be improved by all parties guaranteeing privacy jointly",

However, despite its importance to biological intelligence, this behavioral optimization problem is understudied in artificial intelligence research. Patch foraging is especially amenable to study given that it has a known optimal solution, which may be difficult to discover given current techniques in deep reinforcement learning. Here, we investigate deep reinforcement learning agents in an ecological patch foraging task. For the first time, we show that machine learning agents can learn to patch forage adaptively in patterns similar to biological foragers, and approach optimal patch foraging behavior when accounting for temporal discounting. Finally, we show emergent internal dynamics in these agents that resemble single-cell recordings from foraging non-human primates, which complements experimental and theoretical work on the neural mechanisms of biological foraging. This work suggests that agents interacting in complex environments with ecologically valid pressures arrive at common solutions, suggesting the emergence of foundational computations behind adaptive, intelligent behavior in both biological and artificial agents",

    "title": "Monotone deep Boltzmann machines",
    "abstract": "Deep Boltzmann machines (DBMs), one of the first ``deep'' learning methods ever studied, are multi-layered probabilistic models governed by a pairwise energy function that describes the likelihood of all variables/nodes in the network. In practice, DBMs are often constrained, i.e., via the \\emph{restricted} Boltzmann machine (RBM) architecture (which does not permit intra-layer connections), in order to allow for more efficient inference.  In this work, we revisit the generic DBM approach, and ask the question: are there other possible restrictions to their design that would enable efficient (approximate) inference?  In particular, we develop a new class of restricted model, the monotone DBM, which allows for arbitrary self-connection in each layer, but restricts the \\emph{weights} in a manner that guarantees the existence and global uniqueness of a mean-field fixed point. To do this, we leverage tools from the recently-proposed monotone Deep Equilibrium model and show that a particular choice of activation results in a fixed-point iteration that gives a variational mean-field solution.  While this approach is still largely conceptual, it is the first architecture that allows for efficient approximate inference in fully-general weight structures for DBMs.  We apply this approach to simple deep convolutional Boltzmann architectures and demonstrate that it allows for tasks such as the joint completion and classification of images, within a single deep probabilistic setting, while avoiding the pitfalls of mean-field inference in traditional RBMs",

Our visual novelty detection benchmark finds that methods that rank best on popular area-under-the-curve metrics may be outperformed by simpler alternatives when controlling false positives matters most.

Unlike probabilistic graphical models, they typically do not incorporate specific domain knowledge. As such, this work explores incorporating arbitrary dependency structures, as specified by Bayesian networks, into variational autoencoders (VAEs). This is achieved by developing a new type of graphical normalizing flow, which extends residual flows by encoding conditional independence through masking of the flow’s residual block weight matrices, and using these to extend both the prior and inference network of the VAE. We show that the proposed graphical VAE provides a more interpretable model that generalizes better in data-sparse settings, when practitioners know or can hypothesize about certain latent factors in their domain. Furthermore, we show that graphical residual flows provide not only density estimation and inference performance competitive with existing graphical flows, but also more stable and accurate inversion in practice as a byproduct of the flow’s Lipschitz bounds",

Prior work on computing the generalization error focuses on adding noise to target outputs. However, adding noise to the input is more in line with current pre-training practices. In the linear (in the inputs) regime, we provide an asymptotically exact formula for the generalization error for rank 1 data and an approximation for the generalization error for rank $r$ data. \nFrom this, we derive a formula for the amount of noise that needs to be added to the training data to minimize the denoising error. This results in the emergence of a shrinkage phenomenon for improving the performance of denoising DNNs by making the training SNR smaller than the test SNR. Further, we see that the amount of shrinkage (ratio of the train to test SNR) also follows a double descent curve",

Developers often train machine learning models on carefully curated datasets using only high-quality data; however, this reduces the utility of such models in production environments. We propose a novel neural network modification to mitigate the impacts of low-quality and missing data which involves replacing the fixed weights of a fully-connected layer with a function of additional input. This is inspired by neuromodulation in biological neural networks where the cortex can up- and down-regulate inputs based on their reliability and the presence of other data. In testing, with reliability scores as a modulating signal, models with modulating layers were found to be more robust against data quality degradation, including additional missingness. These models are superior to imputation as they save on training time by entirely skipping the imputation process and further allow the introduction of other data quality measures that imputation cannot handle. Our results suggest that explicitly accounting for reduced information quality with a modulating fully connected layer can enable the deployment of artificial intelligence systems in real-time applications",

    "abstract": "3D shapes have complementary abstractions from low-level geometry to part-based hierarchies to languages, which convey different levels of information. This paper presents a unified framework to translate between pairs of shape abstractions: $\\textit{Text}$ $\\Longleftrightarrow$ $\\textit{Point Cloud}$ $\\Longleftrightarrow$ $\\textit{Program}$. We propose $\\textbf{\\textit{Neural Shape Compiler}}$ to model the abstraction transformation as a conditional generation process. It converts 3D shapes of three abstract types into unified discrete shape code, transforms each shape code into code of other abstract types through the proposed $\\textit{ShapeCode Transformer}$, and decodes them to output the target shape abstraction. Point Cloud code is obtained in a class-agnostic way by the proposed $\\textit{Point}$VQVAE. On Text2Shape, ShapeGlot, ABO, Genre, and Program Synthetic datasets, Neural Shape Compiler shows strengths in $\\textit{Text}$ $\\Longrightarrow$ $\\textit{Point Cloud}$, $\\textit{Point Cloud}$ $\\Longrightarrow$ $\\textit{Text}$, $\\textit{Point Cloud}$ $\\Longrightarrow$ $\\textit{Program}$, and Point Cloud Completion tasks.

    "title": "Can Pruning Improve Certified Robustness of Neural Networks?",
    "abstract": "With the rapid development of deep learning, the sizes of deep neural networks are getting larger beyond the affordability of hardware platforms. Given the fact that neural networks are often over-parameterized, one effective way to reduce such computational overhead is neural network pruning, by removing redundant parameters from trained neural networks. It has been recently observed that pruning can not only reduce computational overhead but also can improve empirical robustness of deep neural networks (NNs), potentially owing to removing spurious correlations while preserving the predictive accuracies. This paper for the first time demonstrates that pruning can generally improve $L_\\infty$ certified robustness for ReLU-based NNs under the \\textit{complete verification} setting. Using the popular Branch-and-Bound (BaB) framework, we find that pruning can enhance the estimated bound tightness of certified robustness verification, by alleviating linear relaxation and sub-domain split problems. We empirically verify our findings with off-the-shelf pruning methods and further present a new stability-based pruning method tailored for reducing neuron instability, that outperforms existing pruning methods in enhancing certified robustness. Our experiments show that by appropriately pruning an NN, its certified accuracy can be boosted up to \\textbf{8.2\\%} under standard training, and up to \\textbf{24.5\\%} under adversarial training on the CIFAR10 dataset. We additionally observe the possible existence of {\\it certified lottery tickets} in our experiments that can match both standard and certified robust accuracies of the original dense models across different datasets. Our findings offer a new angle to study the intriguing interaction between sparsity and robustness, i.e. interpreting the interaction of sparsity and certified robustness via neuron stability. Codes will be fully released",

    "abstract": "A key challenge for much of the machine learning work on remote sensing and earth observation data is the difficulty in acquiring large amounts of accurately labeled data. This is particularly true for semantic segmentation tasks, which are much less common in the remote sensing domain because of the incredible difficulty in collecting precise, accurate, pixel-level annotations at scale. Recent efforts have addressed these challenges both through the creation of supervised datasets as well as the application of self-supervised methods. We continue these efforts on both fronts. First, we generate and release an improved version of the Agriculture-Vision dataset  (Chiu et al., 2020b) to include raw, full-field imagery for greater experimental flexibility. Second, we extend this dataset with the release of 3600 large, high-resolution (10cm/pixel), full-field, red-green-blue and near-infrared images for pre-training. Third, we incorporate the Pixel-to-Propagation Module Xie et al. (2021b) originally built on the SimCLR framework into the framework of MoCo-V2 Chen et al.(2020b). Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of this data by benchmarking different contrastive learning approaches on both downstream classification and semantic segmentation tasks. We explore both CNN and Swin Transformer Liu et al. (2021a) architectures within different frameworks based on MoCo-V2. Together, these approaches enable us to better detect key agricultural patterns of interest across a field from aerial imagery so that farmers may be alerted to problematic areas in a timely fashion to inform their management decisions. Furthermore, the release of these datasets will support numerous avenues of research for computer vision in remote sensing for agriculture",

    "abstract": "Functions of the ratio of the densities $p/q$ are widely used in machine learning to quantify the discrepancy between the two distributions $p$ and $q$. For high-dimensional distributions, binary classification-based density ratio estimators have shown great promise. However, when densities are well-separated, estimating the density ratio with a binary classifier is challenging. In this work, we show that the state-of-the-art density ratio estimators do perform poorly on well-separated cases and demonstrate that this is due to distribution shifts between training and evaluation time. We present an alternative method that leverages multi-class classification for density ratio estimation and does not suffer from distribution shift issues. The method uses a set of auxiliary densities $\\{m_k\\}_{k=1}^K$ and trains a multi-class logistic regression to classify the samples from $p, q$ and $\\{m_k\\}_{k=1}^K$ into $K+2$ classes. We show that if these auxiliary densities are constructed such that they overlap with $p$ and $q$, then a multi-class logistic regression \nallows for estimating $\\log p/q$ on the domain of any of the $K+2$ distributions and resolves the distribution shift problems of the current state-of-the-art methods.\nWe compare our method to state-of-the-art density ratio estimators on both synthetic and real datasets and demonstrate its superior performance on the tasks of density ratio estimation, mutual information estimation, and representation learning",

Hence, finding hierarchies (or dendrograms) using only comparisons is a well understood problem. However, evaluating their meaningfulness when no ground-truth nor explicit similarities are available remains an open question.\n\nIn this paper, we bridge this gap by proposing a new revenue function that allows one to measure the goodness of dendrograms using only comparisons. We show that this function is closely related to Dasgupta's cost for hierarchical clustering that uses pairwise similarities.\nOn the theoretical side, we use the proposed revenue function to resolve the open problem of whether one can approximately recover a latent hierarchy using few triplet comparisons. On the practical side, we present principled algorithms for comparison-based hierarchical clustering based on the maximisation of the revenue and we empirically compare them with existing methods",

    "abstract": "The applications of causal inference may be life-critical, including the evaluation of vaccinations, medicine, and social policy. However, when undertaking estimation for causal inference, practitioners rarely have access to what might be called `ground-truth' in a supervised learning setting, meaning the chosen estimation methods cannot be evaluated and must be assumed to be reliable. It is therefore crucial that we have a good understanding of the performance consistency of typical methods available to practitioners. In this work we provide a comprehensive evaluation of recent semiparametric methods (including neural network approaches) for average treatment effect estimation. Such methods have been proposed as a means to derive unbiased causal effect estimates and statistically valid confidence intervals, even when using otherwise non-parametric, data-adaptive machine learning techniques. We also propose a new estimator `MultiNet', and a variation on the semiparametric update step `MultiStep', which we evaluate alongside existing approaches. The performance of both semiparametric and `regular' methods are found to be dataset dependent, indicating an interaction between the methods used, the sample size, and nature of the data generating process. Our experiments highlight the need for practitioners to check the consistency of their findings, potentially by undertaking multiple analyses with different combinations of estimators",

The ubiquity of stationary models has led to the common practice of exploiting prior information via informative mean functions. In this paper, we highlight that these models can perform poorly, especially in high dimensions. We propose novel informative covariance functions for optimization, leveraging nonstationarity to encode preferences for certain regions of the search space and adaptively promote local exploration during optimization.

A now well established research avenue leverages optimal transport (OT) and looks for Monge maps, i.e. models with minimal effort between the source and target distributions. This paper introduces a method based on Brenier's polar factorization theorem to transform any trained NF into a more OT-efficient version without changing the final density. We do so by learning a rearrangement of the source (Gaussian) distribution that minimizes the OT cost between the source and the final density. The Gaussian preserving transformation is implemented with the construction of high dimensional divergence free functions and the path leading to the estimated Monge map is further constrained to lie on a geodesic in the space of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms thanks to Euler's equations. The proposed method leads to smooth flows with reduced OT costs for several existing models without affecting the model performance",

    "abstract": "Many machine learning techniques incorporate identity-preserving transformations into their models to generalize their performance to previously unseen data. These transformations are typically selected from a set of functions that are known to maintain the identity of an input when applied (e.g., rotation, translation, flipping, and scaling). However, there are many natural variations that cannot be labeled for supervision or defined through examination of the data. As suggested by the manifold hypothesis, many of these natural variations live on or near a low-dimensional, nonlinear manifold. Several techniques represent manifold variations through a set of learned Lie group operators that define directions of motion on the manifold. However, these approaches are limited because they require transformation labels when training their models and they lack a method for determining which regions of the manifold are appropriate for applying each specific operator. We address these limitations by introducing a learning strategy that does not require transformation labels and developing a method that learns the local regions where each operator is likely to be used while preserving the identity of inputs. Experiments on MNIST and Fashion MNIST highlight our model's ability to learn identity-preserving transformations on multi-class datasets. Additionally, we train on CelebA to showcase our model's ability to learn semantically meaningful transformations on complex datasets in an unsupervised manner",

In particular, the halfspace-mass (HM) depth exhibits attractive properties such as computational efficiency, which makes it a natural candidate for adversarial attack detection in high-dimensional spaces. Additionally, HM is non differentiable making it harder for attackers to directly attack HAMPER via gradient based-methods.

The temporal and spatial evolution of the process (along with containment through isolation) render such detection as fundamentally different from active search detection strategies. In this work, through an active learning approach, we design testing and isolation strategies to contain the spread and minimize the cumulative infections under a given test budget. We prove that the objective can be optimized, with performance guarantees,  by greedily selecting the nodes to test.  We further design reward-based methodologies that effectively minimize an upper bound on the cumulative infections and are computationally more tractable in large networks. These policies, however, need knowledge about the nodes' infection probabilities which are dynamically changing and have to be learned by sequential testing. We develop a message-passing framework for this purpose and, building on that,  show novel tradeoffs between exploitation of knowledge through reward-based heuristics and exploration of the unknown through a carefully designed probabilistic testing. The tradeoffs are fundamentally distinct from the classical counterparts under active search or multi-armed bandit problems (MABs).

In this work, we propose a novel method BVCR that better utilizes the supervised information by three schemes, i.e., modeling, exploration, and interaction. In the modeling scheme, BVCR models the source supervision and target supervision separately to avoid target supervised information being overwhelmed by source supervised information and better utilize the target supervision. Besides, as both  supervised information naturally offer distinct views for the target domain, the exploration scheme performs intra-domain consistency regularization to better explore target information with bidirectional views. Moreover, as both views are complementary to each other,  the interaction scheme introduces inter-domain consistency regularization to activate information interaction bidirectionally. Thus, the proposed method is elegantly symmetrical by design and easy to implement. Extensive experiments are conducted, and the results show the effectiveness of the proposed method",

We then use these factors as a more convenient representation of the state for downstream learning. The particular structure that we leverage is reward factorization, which defines a more compact class of MDPs that admit factorized value functions.

    "title": "The Low-Rank Simplicity Bias in Deep Networks",
    "abstract": "Modern deep neural networks are highly over-parameterized compared to the data on which they are trained, yet they often generalize remarkably well. A flurry of recent work has asked: why do deep networks not overfit to their training data? In this work, we make a series of\nempirical observations that investigate and extend the hypothesis that deeper networks are inductively biased to find solutions with lower effective rank embeddings. We conjecture that this bias exists because the volume of functions that maps to low effective rank embedding\nincreases with depth. We show empirically that our claim holds true on finite width linear and non-linear models on practical learning paradigms and show that on natural data, these are often the solutions that generalize well. We then show that the simplicity bias exists\nat both initialization and after training and is resilient to hyper-parameters and learning methods. We further demonstrate how linear over-parameterization of deep non-linear models can be used to induce low-rank bias, improving generalization performance on CIFAR and\nImageNet without changing the modeling capacity",

    "title": "Multi-objective Bayesian Optimization with Heuristic Objectives for Biomedical and Molecular Data Analysis Workflows",
    "abstract": "Many practical applications require optimization of multiple, computationally expensive, and possibly competing objectives that are well-suited for multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO). However, for many types of biomedical data, measures of data analysis workflow success are often heuristic and therefore it is not known a priori which objectives are useful. Thus, MOBO methods that return the full Pareto front may be suboptimal in these cases. Here we propose a novel MOBO method that adaptively updates the scalarization function using properties of the posterior of a multi-output Gaussian process surrogate function. This approach selects useful objectives based on a flexible set of desirable criteria, allowing the functional form of each objective to guide optimization. We demonstrate the qualitative behaviour of our method on toy data and perform proof-of-concept analyses of single-cell RNA sequencing and highly multiplexed imaging datasets for univariate input optimization",

    "title": "Parameter Efficient Node Classification on Homophilic Graphs",
    "abstract": "Deep Learning on Graphs was recently made possible with the introduction of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). GNNs use learnable diffusion processes to propagate information through the graph and improve performance on downstream tasks. However, learning this diffusion process can be expensive in terms of memory and computation. While a lot of research has gone into making these models more expressive and able to capture more complex patterns, in practice, edges in common benchmarking datasets often encode similarity of nodes with respect to the downstream task. This property is called homophily. We argue that for these homophilic graphs, learnable diffusion processes and large receptive fields are not required to achieve competitive performance. We propose Graph Non-Parametric Diffusion (GNPD) a method that outperforms traditional GNNs using only 2 linear models and non-parameteric diffusion. Our method takes ideas from Correct & Smooth (C&S) and the Scalable Inception Graph Network (SIGN) and combines them to create a simpler model that outperforms both of them on several datasets. Our method achieves an unmatched parameter efficiency, competing with models with two orders of magnitude more parameters. Additionally GNPD can also forego spectral embeddings which are the computational bottleneck of the C&S method",

Theoretical and empirical performance of L-SVRG and L-Katyusha can be improved by sampling the observations from a non-uniform distribution Qian et al. (2021). However, to design a desired sampling distribution, Qian et al. (2021) rely on prior knowledge of smoothness constants that can be computationally intractable to obtain in practice when the dimension of the model parameter is high. We propose an adaptive sampling strategy for L-SVRG and L-Katyusha that learns the sampling distribution with little computational overhead, while allowing it to change with iterates, and at the same time does not require any prior knowledge on the problem parameters. We prove convergence guarantees for L-SVRG and L-Katyusha for convex objectives when the sampling distribution changes with iterates. These results show that even without prior information, the proposed adaptive sampling strategy matches, and in some cases even surpasses, the performance of the sampling scheme in Qian et al.

    "abstract": "Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) are a recent family of generative models that achieve state-of-the-art results. In order to obtain class-conditional generation, it was suggested to guide the diffusion process by gradients from a time-dependent classifier. While the idea is theoretically sound, deep learning-based classifiers are infamously susceptible to gradient-based adversarial attacks. Therefore, while traditional classifiers may achieve good accuracy scores, their gradients are possibly unreliable and might hinder the improvement of the generation results. Recent work discovered that adversarially robust classifiers exhibit gradients that are aligned with human perception, and these could better guide a generative process towards semantically meaningful images. We utilize this observation by defining and training a time-dependent adversarially robust classifier and use it as guidance for a generative diffusion model. In experiments on the highly challenging and diverse ImageNet dataset, our scheme introduces significantly more intelligible intermediate gradients, better alignment with theoretical findings, as well as improved generation results under several evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we conduct an opinion survey whose findings indicate that human raters prefer our method's results",

However, in real-world applications, it is common to have distribution shift between the training and test data.

To solve this problem, we propose a novel fairness learning method termed CUrvature MAtching (CUMA), which can achieve robust fairness generalizable to unseen domains with unknown distributional shifts. Specifically, CUMA enforces the model to have similar generalization ability on the majority and minority groups, by matching the loss curvature distributions of the two groups. We evaluate our method on three popular fairness datasets. Compared with existing methods, CUMA achieves superior fairness under unseen distribution shifts, without sacrificing either the overall accuracy or the in-distribution fairness",

The sequence model forms a latent space prior over plausible demonstration behaviors to accelerate learning of high-level policies. We show how to acquire such priors from state-only motion capture demonstrations and explore several methods for integrating them into policy learning on transfer tasks. Our experimental results confirm that latent space priors provide significant gains in learning speed and final performance.

    "abstract": "The softmax function combined with a cross-entropy loss is a principled approach to modeling probability distributions that has become ubiquitous in deep learning. The softmax function is defined by a lone hyperparameter, the temperature, that is commonly set to one or regarded as a way to tune model confidence after training; however, less is known about how the temperature impacts training dynamics or generalization performance. In this work we develop a theory of early learning for models trained with softmax-cross-entropy loss and show that the learning dynamics depend crucially on the inverse-temperature $\\beta$ as well as the magnitude of the logits at initialization, $||\\beta\\textbf{z}||_{2}$. We follow up these analytic results with a large-scale empirical study of a variety of model architectures trained on CIFAR10, ImageNet, and IMDB sentiment analysis. We find that generalization performance depends strongly on the temperature, but only weakly on the initial logit magnitude. We provide evidence that the dependence of generalization on $\\beta$ is not due to changes in model confidence, but is a dynamical phenomenon. It follows that the addition of $\\beta$ as a tunable hyperparameter is key to maximizing model performance. Although we find the optimal $\\beta$ to be sensitive to the architecture, experimental results suggest that tuning $\\beta$ over the range $10^{-2}$ to $10^1$  improves performance over all architectures studied. We find that smaller $\\beta$ may lead to better peak performance at the cost of sensitivity to the random seed",

    "abstract": "Personalized federated learning, as a variant of federated learning, trains customized models for clients using their heterogeneously distributed data. However, it is still inconclusive about how to design personalized models with better representation of shared global knowledge and personalized pattern. To bridge the gap, we in this paper explore personalized models with low-rank and sparse decomposition. Specifically, we employ proper regularization to \textract a low-rank global knowledge representation (GKR), so as to distill global knowledge into a compact representation.  Subsequently, we employ a sparse component over the obtained GKR to fuse the personalized pattern into the global knowledge. As a solution, we propose a two-stage proximal-based algorithm named \\textbf{Fed}erated learning with mixed \\textbf{S}parse and \\textbf{L}ow-\\textbf{R}ank representation (FedSLR) to efficiently search for the mixed models.  Theoretically, under proper assumptions,  we show that the GKR trained by FedSLR can at least sub-linearly converge to a stationary point of the regularized problem, and that the sparse component being fused can converge to its stationary point under proper settings. Extensive experiments also demonstrate the superior empirical performance of FedSLR. Moreover, FedSLR reduces the number of parameters, and lowers the down-link communication complexity, which are all desirable for federated learning algorithms.

Our goal is to design agents that are robust against such attacks in terms of the worst-case utility w.r.t. the true, unpoisoned, rewards while computing their policies under the poisoned rewards. We propose an optimization framework for deriving optimal defense policies, both when the attack parameter is known and unknown. For this optimization framework, we first provide characterization results for generic attack cost functions. These results show that the functional form of the attack cost function and the agent's knowledge about it are critical for establishing lower bounds on the agent's performance, as well as for the computational tractability of the defense problem. We then focus on a cost function based on $\\ell_2$ norm, for which we show that the defense problem can be efficiently solved and yields defense policies whose expected returns under the true rewards are lower bounded by their expected returns under the poison rewards.

To address this issue, memory-based continual learning has been actively studied and stands out as one of the best-performing methods. We examine memory-based continual learning and identify that large variation in the representation space is crucial for avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Motivated by this, we propose to diversify representations by using two types of perturbations: model-agnostic variation (i.e., the variation is generated without the knowledge of the learned neural network) and model-based variation (i.e., the variation is conditioned on the learned neural network). We demonstrate that enlarging representational variation serves as a general principle to improve continual learning.

    "title": "Costs and Benefits of Fair Regression",
    "abstract": "Real-world applications of machine learning tools in high-stakes domains are often regulated to be fair, in the sense that the predicted target should satisfy some quantitative notion of parity with respect to a protected attribute. However, the exact tradeoff between fairness and accuracy with a real-valued target is not entirely clear. In this paper, we characterize the inherent tradeoff between statistical parity and accuracy in the regression setting by providing a lower bound on the error of any attribute-blind fair regressor. Our lower bound is sharp, algorithm-independent, and admits a simple interpretation: when the moments of the target differ between groups, any fair algorithm has to make an error on at least one of the groups. We further extend this result to give a lower bound on the joint error of any (approximately) fair algorithm, using the Wasserstein distance to measure the quality of the approximation. With our novel lower bound, we also show that the price paid by a fair regressor that does not take the protected attribute as input is less than that of a fair regressor with explicit access to the protected attribute. On the upside, we establish the first connection between individual fairness, accuracy parity, and the Wasserstein distance by showing that if a regressor is individually fair, it also approximately verifies the accuracy parity, where the gap is again given by the Wasserstein distance between the two groups. Inspired by our theoretical results, we develop a practical algorithm for fair regression through the lens of representation learning, and conduct experiments on a real-world dataset to corroborate our findings",

For example, fluctuations in temperature at a weather station can be predicted using both temperatures and barometric readings. However, a challenge when modelling such data is that it is easy for a neural network to rely on the greatest joint correlations within the target stream, which may ignore a crucial but small information transfer from the source to the target stream. As well, there are often situations where the target stream may have previously been modelled independently and it would be useful to use that model to inform a new joint model. Here, we develop an information bottleneck approach for conditional learning on two dependent streams of data. Our method, which we call Transfer Entropy Bottleneck (TEB), allows one to learn a model that bottlenecks the directed information transferred from the source variable to the target variable, while quantifying this information transfer within the model. As such, TEB provides a useful new information bottleneck approach for modelling two statistically dependent streams of data in order to make predictions about one of them",

In this paper, we establish a Black-box Discrete Prompt Learning (\\textbf{BDPL}) to resonate with pragmatic interactions between the cloud infrastructure and edge devices. Particularly, instead of fine-tuning the model in the cloud, we adapt PLMs by prompt learning, which efficiently optimizes only a few parameters of the discrete prompts. Moreover, we consider the scenario that we do not have access to the parameters and gradients of the pre-trained models, except for its outputs given inputs. This black-box setting secures the cloud infrastructure from potential attack and misuse to cause a single-point failure, which is preferable to the white-box counterpart by current infrastructures. Under this black-box constraint, we apply a variance-reduced policy gradient algorithm to estimate the gradients of parameters in the categorical distribution of each discrete prompt. In light of our method, the user devices can efficiently tune their tasks by querying the PLMs bounded by a range of API calls. Our experiments on RoBERTa and GPT-3 demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves significant improvement on eight benchmarks in a cloud-device collaboration manner.

    "abstract": "Recent neural compression methods have been based on the popular hyperprior framework. It relies on Scalar Quantization and offers a very strong compression performance. This contrasts from recent advances in image generation and representation learning, where Vector Quantization is more commonly employed.\nIn this work, we attempt to bring these lines of research closer by revisiting vector quantization for image compression. We build upon the VQ-VAE framework and introduce several modifications. First, we replace the vanilla vector quantizer by a product quantizer. This intermediate solution between vector and scalar quantization allows for a much wider set of rate-distortion points: It implicitly defines high-quality quantizers that would otherwise require intractably large codebooks. Second, inspired by the success of Masked Image Modeling (MIM) in the context of self-supervised learning and generative image models, we propose a novel conditional entropy model which improves entropy coding by modelling the co-dependencies of the quantized latent codes. The resulting PQ-MIM model is surprisingly effective: its compression performance on par with recent hyperprior methods. It also outperforms HiFiC in terms of FID and KID metrics when optimized with perceptual losses (e.g. adversarial). Finally, since PQ-MIM is compatible with image generation frameworks, we show qualitatively that it can operate under a hybrid mode between compression and generation, with no further training or finetuning. As a result, we explore the extreme compression regime where an image is compressed into 200 bytes, i.e., less than a tweet",

    "abstract": "Contextual bandit algorithms have many applicants in a variety of scenarios. In order to develop trustworthy contextual bandit systems, understanding the impacts of various adversarial attacks on contextual bandit algorithms is essential. In this paper, we propose a new class of attacks: action poisoning attacks, where an adversary can change the action signal selected by the agent. We design action poisoning attack schemes against disjoint linear contextual bandit algorithms in both white-box and black-box settings. We further analyze the cost of the proposed attack strategies for a very popular and widely used bandit algorithm: LinUCB. We show that, in both white-box and black-box settings, the proposed attack schemes can force the LinUCB agent to pull a target arm very frequently by spending only logarithm cost. We also extend the proposed attack strategies to generalized linear models and show the effectiveness of the proposed strategies",

    "title": "Mixed effects in machine learning â A flexible mixedML framework to add random effects to supervised machine learning regression",
    "abstract": "Clustered data can frequently be found not only in social and behavioral sciences (e.g., multiple measurements of individuals) but also in typical machine learning problems (e.g., weather forecast in different cities, house prices in different regions). This implies dependencis for observations within one cluster, leading to violations of i.i.d. assumptions, biased estimates, and false inference. A typical approach to address this issue is to include random effects instead of fixed effects. We introduce the general mixedML framework, which includes random effects in supervised regression machine learning models, and present different estimation procedures. A segmentation of the problem allows to include random effects as an additional correction to the standard machine learning regression problem. Thus, the framework can be applied on top of the machine learning task, without the need to change the model or architecture, which distinguishes mixedML from other models in this field. With a simulation study and empirical data sets, we show that the framework produces comparable estimates to typical mixed effects frameworks in the linear case and increases the prediction quality and the gained information of the standard machine learning models in both the linear and non-linear case. Furthermore, the presented estimation procedures significantly decrease estimation time. Compared to other approaches in this area, the framework does not restrict the choice of machine learning algorithms and still includes random effects",

    "title": "Probing Predictions on OOD Images via Nearest Categories",
    "abstract": "We study out-of-distribution (OOD) prediction behavior of neural networks when they classify images from unseen classes or corrupted images. To probe the OOD behavior, we introduce a new measure, nearest category generalization (NCG), where we compute the fraction of OOD inputs that are classified with the same label as their nearest neighbor in the training set. Our motivation stems from understanding the prediction patterns of adversarially robust networks, since previous work has identified unexpected consequences of training to be robust to norm-bounded perturbations. We find that robust networks have consistently higher NCG accuracy than natural training, even when the OOD data is much farther away than the robustness radius. This implies that the local regularization of robust training has a significant impact on the network’s decision regions. We replicate our findings using many datasets, comparing new and existing training methods. Overall, adversarially robust networks resemble a nearest neighbor classifier when it comes to OOD data",

For the OT problem involving two marginals with $m$ and $n$ atoms ($m\\geq n$), respectively, the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is $\\mathcal{O}(m^2n)$. Computing the empirical Wasserstein distance in the independence test requires solving this special type of OT problem, where $m=n^2$.

In addition to the aforementioned special type of OT problem, it is shown that the modified Hungarian algorithm could be adopted to solve a wider range of OT problems. Broader applications of the proposed algorithm are discussed---solving the one-to-many assignment problem and the many-to-many assignment problem. We conduct numerical experiments to validate our theoretical results.

OA imaging features a powerful combination between rich optical contrast and high resolution in deep tissues. This enabled the exploration of a number of attractive new applications both in clinical and laboratory settings. However, no standardized datasets generated with different types of experimental set-up and associated processing methods are available to facilitate advances in broader applications of OA in clinical settings. This complicates an objective comparison between new and established data processing methods, often leading to qualitative results and arbitrary interpretations of the data. In this paper, we provide both experimental and synthetic OA raw signals and reconstructed image domain datasets rendered with different experimental parameters and tomographic acquisition geometries. We further provide trained neural networks to tackle three important challenges related to OA image processing, namely accurate reconstruction under limited view tomographic conditions, removal of spatial undersampling artifacts and anatomical segmentation for improved image reconstruction.

    "title": "Stacking Diverse Architectures to Improve Machine Translation",
    "abstract": "Repeated applications of the same neural block primarily based on self-attention characterize the current state-of-the-art in neural architectures for machine translation. In such architectures the decoder adopts a masked version of the same encoding block. Although simple this strategy doesn't encode the various inductive biases such as locality that arise from alternative architectures and that are central to the modelling of translation. We propose Lasagna, an encoder-decoder model that aims to combine the inductive benefits of different architectures by layering multiple instances of different blocks.  Lasagna’s encoder first grows the representation from local to mid-sized using convolutional blocks and only then applies a pair of final self-attention blocks. Lasagna’s decoder uses only convolutional blocks that attend to the encoder representation. On a large suit of machine translation tasks, we find that Lasagna not only matches or outperforms the Transformer baseline, but it does so more efficiently thanks to widespread use of the efficient convolutional blocks. These findings suggest that the widespread use of uniform architectures may be suboptimal in certain scenarios and exploiting the diversity of inductive architectural biases can  lead to substantial gains",

    "title": "Contrastive Search Is What You Need For Neural Text Generation",
    "abstract": "Generating text with autoregressive language models (LMs) is of great importance to many natural language processing (NLP) applications. Previous solutions for this task often produce text that contains degenerative expressions (Welleck et al., 2020) or lacks semantic consistency (Basu et al., 2021). Recently, Su et al. (2022b) introduced a new decoding method, contrastive search, based on the isotropic representation space of the language model and obtained new state of the art on various benchmarks. Additionally, Su et al. (2022b) argued that the representations of autoregressive LMs (e.g. GPT-2) are intrinsically anisotropic which is also shared by previous studies (Ethayarajh, 2019). Therefore, to ensure the language model follows an isotropic distribution, Su et al. (2022b) proposed a contrastive learning scheme, SimCTG, which calibrates the language model’s representations through additional training.\n\nIn this study, we first answer the question: “Are autoregressive LMs really anisotropic?”. To this end, we extensively evaluate the isotropy of LMs across 16 major languages. Surprisingly, we find that the anisotropic problem only exists in the two specific English GPT-2-small/medium models. On the other hand, all other evaluated LMs are naturally isotropic which is in contrast to the conclusion drawn by previous studies (Ethayarajh, 2019; Su et al., 2022b). Based on our findings, we further assess the contrastive search decoding method using off-the-shelf LMs on four generation tasks across 16 languages. Our experimental results demonstrate that contrastive search significantly outperforms previous decoding methods without any additional training. More notably, on 12 out of the 16 evaluated languages, contrastive search performs comparably with human-level performances as judged by human evaluations",

    "title": "Separable Self-attention for Mobile Vision Transformers",
    "abstract": "Mobile vision transformers (MobileViT) can achieve state-of-the-art performance across several mobile vision tasks, including classification and detection. Though these models have fewer parameters, they have high latency as compared to convolutional neural network-based models. The main efficiency bottleneck in MobileViT is the multi-headed self-attention (MHA) in transformers, which requires $O(k^2)$ time complexity with respect to the number of tokens (or patches) $k$. Moreover, MHA requires costly operations (e.g., batch-wise matrix multiplication) for computing self-attention, impacting latency on resource-constrained devices. This paper introduces a separable self-attention method with linear complexity, i.e. $O(k)$. A simple yet effective characteristic of the proposed method is that it uses element-wise operations for computing self-attention, making it a good choice for resource-constrained devices. The improved model, MobileViTv2, is state-of-the-art on several mobile vision tasks, including ImageNet object classification and MS-COCO object detection. With about three million parameters, MobileViTv2 achieves a top-1 accuracy of 75.6% on the ImageNet dataset, outperforming MobileViT by about 1% while running $3.2\\times$ faster on a mobile device.

    "title": "A Flexible Nadaraya-Watson Head Can Offer Explainable and Calibrated Classification",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we empirically analyze a simple, non-learnable, and nonparametric Nadaraya-Watson (NW) prediction head that can be used with any neural network architecture. In the NW head, the prediction is a weighted average of labels from a support set. The weights are computed from distances between the query feature and support features. This is in contrast to the dominant approach of using a learnable classification head (e.g., a fully-connected layer) on the features, which can be challenging to interpret and can yield poorly calibrated predictions. Our empirical results on an array of computer vision tasks demonstrate that the NW head can yield better calibration with comparable accuracy compared to its parametric counterpart, particularly in data-limited settings. To further increase inference-time efficiency, we propose a simple approach that involves a clustering step run on the training set to create a relatively small distilled support set. Furthermore, we explore two means of interpretability/explainability that fall naturally from the NW head. The first is the label weights, and the second is our novel concept of the ``support influence function,'' which is an easy-to-compute metric that quantifies the influence of a support element on the prediction for a given query. As we demonstrate in our experiments, the influence function can allow the user to debug a trained model. We believe that the NW head is a flexible, interpretable, and highly useful building block that can be used in a range of applications",

Recently, multiple proposed inversion algorithms reduce representation error by optimizing over intermediate layer representations. These methods are typically applied to generative models that were trained agnostic of the downstream inversion algorithm. In our work, we introduce a principle that if a generative model is intended for inversion using an algorithm based on optimization of intermediate layers, it should be trained in a way that regularizes those intermediate layers. We instantiate this principle for two notable recent inversion algorithms: Intermediate Layer Optimization and the Multi-Code GAN prior. For both of these inversion algorithms, we introduce a new regularized GAN training algorithm and demonstrate that the learned generative model results in lower reconstruction errors across a wide range of under sampling ratios when solving compressed sensing, inpainting, and super-resolution problems",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are often trained on the premise that the complete training data set is provided ahead of time. However, in real-world scenarios, data often arrive in chunks over time. This leads to important considerations about the optimal strategy for training DNNs, such as whether to fine-tune them with each chunk of incoming data (warm-start) or to retrain them from scratch with the entire corpus of data whenever a new chunk is available. While employing the latter for training can be resource-intensive, recent work has pointed out the lack of generalization in warm-start models. Therefore, to strike a balance between efficiency and generalization, we introduce \"Learn, Unlearn, and Relearn (LURE)\" an online learning paradigm for DNNs. LURE interchanges between the unlearning phase, which selectively forgets the undesirable information in the model through weight reinitialization in a data-dependent manner, and the relearning phase, which emphasizes learning on generalizable features. We show that our training paradigm provides consistent performance gains across datasets in both classification and few-shot settings.

Hence, in this paper, we consider a new, more realistic, and more challenging problem setting where the pixel-level classifier has to be trained with labeled images and unlabeled open-world images—we name it open world semantic segmentation (OSS). In OSS, the trained classifier is expected to identify unknown-class pixels and classify known-class pixels well. To solve OSS, we first investigate which distribution that unknown-class pixels obey. Then, motivated by the goodness-of-fit test, we use statistical measurements to show how a pixel fits the distribution of an unknown class and select highly-fitted pixels to form the unknown region in each test image. Eventually, we propose an end-to-end learning framework, known-region-aware domain alignment (KRADA), to distinguish unknown classes while aligning the distributions of known classes in labeled and unlabeled open-world images.

However, despite the remarkable success of such algorithm in practice, its theoretical characterization remains limited. In this paper, we focus on neural networks with two and three layers and provide a rigorous understanding of the properties of the solutions found by SHB: \\emph{(i)} stability after dropping out part of the neurons, \\emph{(ii)} connectivity along a low-loss path, and \\emph{(iii)} convergence to the global optimum.\nTo achieve this goal, we take a mean-field view and relate the SHB dynamics to a certain partial differential equation in the limit of large network widths. This mean-field perspective has inspired a recent line of work focusing on SGD while, in contrast, our paper considers an algorithm with momentum. More specifically, after proving existence and uniqueness of the limit differential equations, we show convergence to the global optimum and give a quantitative bound between the mean-field limit and the SHB dynamics of a finite-width network. Armed with this last bound, we are able to establish the dropout-stability and connectivity of SHB solutions",

    "title": "Signed Graph Neural Networks: A Frequency Perspective",
    "abstract": "Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) and its variants are designed for unsigned graphs containing only positive links. Many existing GCNs have been derived from the spectral domain analysis of signals lying over (unsigned) graphs and in each convolution layer they perform low-pass filtering of the input features followed by a learnable linear transformation. Their extension to signed graphs with positive as well as negative links imposes multiple issues including computational irregularities and ambiguous frequency interpretation, making the design of computationally efficient low pass filters challenging. In this paper, we address these issues via spectral analysis of signed graphs and propose two different signed graph neural networks, one keeps only low-frequency information and one also retains high-frequency information. We further introduce magnetic signed Laplacian and use its eigendecomposition for spectral analysis of directed signed graphs. We test our methods for node classification and link sign prediction tasks on signed graphs and achieve state-of-the-art performances",

    "title": "Guaranteed Discovery of Control-Endogenous Latent States with Multi-Step Inverse Models",
    "abstract": "In many sequential decision-making tasks, the agent is not able to model the full complexity of the world, which consists of multitudes of relevant and irrelevant information. For example, a person walking along a city street who tries to model all aspects of the world would quickly be overwhelmed by a multitude of shops, cars, and people moving in and out of view, each following their own complex and inscrutable dynamics.  Is it possible to turn the agent's firehose of sensory information into a minimal latent state that is both necessary and sufficient for an agent to successfully act in the world? We formulate this question concretely, and propose the Agent Control-Endogenous State Discovery algorithm (AC-State), which has theoretical guarantees and is practically demonstrated to discover the minimal control-endogenous latent state which contains all of the information necessary for controlling the agent, while fully discarding all irrelevant information.    This algorithm consists of a multi-step inverse model (predicting actions from distant observations) with an information bottleneck.  AC-State enables localization, exploration, and navigation without reward or demonstrations.  We demonstrate the discovery of the control-endogenous latent state in three domains: localizing a robot arm with distractions (e.g., changing lighting conditions and background), exploring a maze alongside other agents, and navigating in the Matterport house simulator",

    "abstract": "The multi-head attention mechanism, or rather the Transformer-based models have always been under the spotlight, not only in the domain of text processing, but also for computer vision. Several works have recently been proposed around exploring the token attributions along the intrinsic decision process. However, the ambiguity of the expression formulation can lead to an accumulation of error, which makes the interpretation less trustworthy and less applicable to different variants. In this work, we propose a novel method to approximate token contributions inside Transformers. We start from the partial derivative to each token, divide the interpretation process into attention perception and reasoning feedback with the chain rule and explore each part individually with explicit mathematical derivations. In attention perception, we propose the head-wise and token-wise approximations in order to learn how the tokens interact to form the pooled vector. As for reasoning feedback, we adopt a noise-decreasing strategy by applying the integrated gradients to the last attention map. Our method is further validated qualitatively and quantitatively through the faithfulness evaluations across different settings: single modality (BERT and ViT) and bi-modality (CLIP), different model sizes (ViT-L) and different pooling strategies (ViT-MAE) to demonstrate the broad applicability and clear improvements over existing methods",

    "abstract": "Compiling together spatial and temporal modules via a unified framework, Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) have been popularly used in the multivariate spatio-temporal forecasting task, e.g. traffic prediction. After the numerous propositions of manually designed architectures, researchers show interest in the Neural Architecture Search (NAS) of STGNNs. Existing methods suffer from two issues: (1) hyperparameters like learning rate, channel size cannot be integrated into the NAS framework, which makes the model evaluation less accurate, potentially misleading the architecture search (2) the current search space, which basically mimics Darts-like methods, is too large for the search algorithm to find a sufficiently good candidate. In this work, we deal with both issues at the same time. We first re-examine the importance  and transferability of the training hyperparameters to ensure a fair and fast comparison. Next, we set up a framework that disentangles architecture design into three disjoint angles according to how spatio-temporal representations flow and transform in architectures, which allows us to understand the behavior of architectures from a distributional perspective. This way, we can obtain good guidelines to reduce the STGNN search space and find state-of-the-art architectures by simple random search. As an illustrative example, we combine these principles with random search which already significantly outperforms both state-of-the-art hand-designed models and recently automatically searched ones",

    "abstract": "Decentralized Actor-Critic (AC) algorithms have been widely utilized for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and have achieved remarkable success. Apart from its empirical success, the theoretical convergence property of decentralized AC algorithms is largely unexplored. Most of the existing finite-time convergence results are derived based on either double-loop update or two-timescale step sizes rule, and this is the case even for centralized AC algorithm under a single-agent setting. In practice, the *single-timescale* update is widely utilized, where actor and critic are updated in an alternating manner with step sizes being of the same order. In this work, we study a decentralized *single-timescale* AC algorithm. Theoretically, using linear approximation for value and reward estimation, we show that the algorithm has sample complexity of $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\varepsilon^{-2})$ under Markovian sampling, which matches the optimal complexity with a double-loop implementation (here, $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}$ hides a logarithmic term).  When we reduce to the single-agent setting, our result yields new sample complexity for centralized AC using a single-timescale update scheme. The central to establishing our complexity results is *the hidden smoothness of the optimal critic variable* we revealed. We also provide a local action privacy-preserving version of our algorithm and its analysis. Finally, we conduct experiments to show the superiority of our algorithm over the existing decentralized AC algorithms",

Recently, there has been growing attention in feature selection using neural networks. However, existing methods usually suffer from high computational costs when applied to high-dimensional datasets. In this paper, inspired by evolution processes, we propose a novel resource-efficient supervised feature selection method using sparse neural networks, named \"NeuroFS\". By gradually pruning the uninformative features from the input layer of a sparse neural network trained from scratch, NeuroFS derives an informative subset of features efficiently. By performing several experiments on $11$ low and high-dimensional real-world benchmarks of different types, we demonstrate that NeuroFS achieves the highest ranking-based score among the considered state-of-the-art supervised feature selection models.

The earliest statistical queries, for which differential privacy mechanisms have been developed, were for the release of the sample mean. In Geometric Statistics, the sample Fréchet mean represents one of the most fundamental statistical summaries, as it generalizes the sample mean for data belonging to nonlinear manifolds. In that spirit, the only geometric statistical query for which a differential privacy mechanism has been developed, so far, is for the release of the sample Fréchet mean: the \\emph{Riemannian Laplace mechanism} was recently proposed to privatize the Fréchet mean on complete Riemannian manifolds. In many fields, the manifold of Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices is used to model data spaces, including in medical imaging where privacy requirements are key. We propose a novel, simple and fast mechanism - the \\emph{tangent Gaussian mechanism} - to compute a differentially private Fréchet mean on the SPD manifold endowed with the log-Euclidean Riemannian metric.

    "abstract": "The modelling framework of neural algorithmic reasoning (Veličković & Blundell, 2021) postulates that a continuous neural network may learn to emulate the discrete reasoning steps of a symbolic algorithm. We investigate the underlying hypothesis in the most simple conceivable scenario – the addition of real numbers. Our results show that two layer neural networks fail to learn the structure of the task, despite containing multiple solutions of the true function within their hypothesis class. Growing the network’s width leads to highly complex error regions in the input space. Moreover, we find that the network fails to generalise with increasing severity i) in the training domain, ii) outside of the training domain but within its convex hull, and iii) outside the training domain’s convex hull. This behaviour can be emulated with Gaussian process regressors that use radial basis function kernels of decreasing length scale. Classical results establish an equivalence between Gaussian processes and infinitely wide neural networks. We demonstrate a tight linkage between the scaling of a network weights’ standard deviation and its effective length scale on a sinusoidal regression problem, suggesting simple modifications to control the length scale of the function learned by a neural network and, thus, its smoothness. This has important applications for the different generalisation scenarios suggested above, but it also suggests a partial remedy to the brittleness of neural network predictions as exposed by adversarial examples. We demonstrate the gains in adversarial robustness that our modification achieves on a standard classification problem of handwritten digit recognition. In conclusion, this work shows inherent problems of neural networks even for the simplest algorithmic tasks which, however, may be partially remedied through links to Gaussian processes",

However, there have been many variations of TP, and a simple version of TP still remains worthwhile. Revisiting the insights of LeCun (1985) and Lee et al (2015), we present a simple version of TP based on regularized inversions of layers of recurrent neural networks. The proposed TP algorithm is easily implementable in a differentiable programming framework. We illustrate the algorithm with recurrent neural networks on long sequences in various sequence modeling problems and delineate the regimes in which the computational complexity of TP can be attractive compared to BP",

    "title": "Bayesian Causal Bandits with Backdoor Adjustment Prior",
    "abstract": "The causal bandit problem setting is a sequential decision-making framework where actions of interest correspond to interventions on variables in a system assumed to be governed by a causal model. The underlying causality may be exploited when investigating actions in the interest of optimizing the yield of the reward variable. Most existing approaches assume prior knowledge of the underlying causal graph, which is in practice restrictive and often unrealistic. In this paper, we develop a novel Bayesian framework for tackling causal bandit problems that does not rely on possession of the causal graph, but rather simultaneously learns the causal graph while exploiting causal inferences to optimize the reward. Our methods efficiently utilize joint inferences from interventional and observational data in a unified Bayesian model constructed with intervention calculus and causal graph learning. For the implementation of our proposed methodology in the discrete distributional setting, we derive an approximation of the sampling variance of the backdoor adjustment estimator. In the Gaussian setting, we characterize the interventional variance with intervention calculus and propose a simple graphical criterion to share information between arms. We validate our proposed methodology in an extensive empirical study, demonstrating compelling cumulative regret performance against state-of-the-art standard algorithms as well as optimistic implementations of their causal variants that assume strong prior knowledge of the causal structure",

    "title": "Accelerated Quality-Diversity through Massive Parallelism",
    "abstract": "Quality-Diversity (QD) optimization algorithms are a well-known approach to generate large collections of diverse and high-quality solutions. However, derived from evolutionary computation, QD algorithms are population-based methods which are known to be data-inefficient and requires large amounts of computational resources. This makes QD algorithms slow when used in applications where solution evaluations are computationally costly. A common approach to speed up QD algorithms is to evaluate solutions in parallel, for instance by using physical simulators in robotics. Yet, this approach is limited to several dozen of parallel evaluations as most physics simulators can only be parallelized more with a greater number of CPUs. With recent advances in simulators that run on accelerators, thousands of evaluations can now be performed in parallel on single GPU/TPU. In this paper, we present QDax, an accelerated implementation of MAP-Elites which leverages massive parallelism on accelerators to make QD algorithms more accessible. We show that QD algorithms are ideal candidates to take advantage of progress in hardware acceleration. We demonstrate that QD algorithms can scale with massive parallelism to be run at interactive timescales without any significant effect on the performance. Results across standard optimization functions and four neuroevolution benchmark environments shows that experiment runtimes are reduced by two factors of magnitudes, turning days of computation into minutes. More surprising, we observe that reducing the number of generations by two orders of magnitude, and thus having significantly shorter lineage does not impact the performance of QD algorithms. These results show that QD can now benefit from hardware acceleration, which contributed significantly to the bloom of deep learning",

These situations are typically rife with uncertainty due to unknown or stochastic characteristics of the environment as well as limited offline training data. As a result, the value of a decision at any time point should be based on the distribution of its anticipated effects. We propose a framework to identify worst-case decision points, by explicitly estimating distributions of the expected return of a decision. These estimates enable earlier indication of dead-ends in a manner that is tunable based on the risk tolerance of the designed task. We demonstrate the utility of Distributional Dead-end Discovery (DistDeD) in a toy domain as well as when assessing the risk of severely ill patients in the intensive care unit reaching a point where death is unavoidable. We find that DistDeD significantly improves over prior discovery approaches, providing indications of the risk 10 hours earlier on average as well as increasing detection by 20%",

Our method, termed BIGRoC (Boosting Image Generation via a Robust Classifier), is based on a post-processing procedure via the guidance of a given robust classifier and without a need for additional training of the generative model. Given a synthesized image, we propose to update it through projected gradient steps over the robust classifier to refine its recognition. We demonstrate this post-processing algorithm on various image synthesis methods and show a significant quantitative and qualitative improvement on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. Surprisingly, although BIGRoC is the first model agnostic among refinement approaches and requires much less information, it outperforms competitive methods. Specifically, BIGRoC improves the image synthesis best performing diffusion model on ImageNet $128\\times128$ by 14.81%, attaining an FID score of 2.53 and on $256\\times256$ by 7.87%, achieving an FID of 3.63.

Backpropagation of error (BP) is an example of such an approach and has proven to be a highly successful application of stochastic gradient descent to deep neural networks. We propose constrained parameter inference (COPI) as a new principle for learning. The COPI approach assumes that learning can be set up in a manner where parameters infer their own values based upon observations of their local neuron activities. We find that this estimation of network parameters is possible under the constraints of decorrelated neural inputs and top-down perturbations of neural states for credit assignment. We show that the decorrelation required for COPI allows learning at extremely high learning rates, competitive with that of adaptive optimizers, as used by BP. We further demonstrate that COPI affords a new approach to feature analysis and network compression. Finally, we argue that COPI may shed new light on learning in biological networks given the evidence for decorrelation in the brain",

Performing mixup for transfer learning with pre-trained models however is not that simple,  a high capacity pre-trained model with a large fully-connected (FC) layer could easily overfit to the target dataset even with samples-to-labels mixed up. In this work, we propose SMILE — Sample-to-feature Mixup for Efficient Transfer Learning. With mixed images as inputs, SMILE regularizes the outputs of CNN feature extractors to learn from the mixed feature vectors of inputs, in addition to the mixed labels. SMILE incorporates a mean teacher to provide the surrogate \"ground truth\" for mixed feature vectors. The sample-to-feature mixup regularizer is imposed both on deep features for the target domain and classifier outputs for the source domain, bounding the linearity in-between samples for target tasks. Extensive experiments have been done to verify the performance improvement made by SMILE, in comparisons with a wide spectrum of transfer learning algorithms, including fine-tuning, L$^2$-SP, DELTA, BSS, RIFLE, Co-Tuning and RegSL, even with mixup strategies combined. Ablation studies show that the vanilla sample-to-label mixup strategies could marginally increase the linearity in-between training samples but lack of generalizability, while SMILE significantly improves the mixup effects in both label and feature spaces with both training and testing datasets.

For other tasks, their respective performances may get compromised due to a negative transfer from dominant tasks. We propose a Dropped-Scheduled Task (DST) algorithm, which probabilistically “drops” specific tasks during joint optimization while scheduling others to reduce negative transfer. For each task, a scheduling probability is decided based on four different metrics: (i) task depth, (ii) number of ground-truth samples per task, (iii) amount of training completed, and (iv) task stagnancy. Based on the scheduling probability, specific tasks get joint computation cycles while others are “dropped”. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DST algorithm, we perform multi-task learning on three applications and two architectures. Across unilateral (single input) and bilateral (multiple input) multi-task net- works, the chosen applications are (a) face (AFLW), (b) fingerprint (IIITD MOLF, MUST, and NIST SD27), and (c) character recognition (Omniglot) applications.

We first show that the use of this approach results in a computationally efficient online learning method in which the resulting predictor can be updated sequentially. We then  prove that, with high probability, its out-of-sample error approaches the optimal level at a root-$n$ rate, where $n$ is the number of data samples. This is so even if the nominal covariance model is misspecified. Moreover, we show that the resulting predictor enjoys two robustness properties. First, it corresponds to a predictor that minimizes the out-of-sample error with respect to the least favourable distribution within a given Wasserstein distance from the empirical distribution. Second, it is robust against errors in the covariate training data. We illustrate the performance of the proposed method in a numerical experiment",

    "title": "ViViT: Curvature Access Through The Generalized Gauss-Newtonâs Low-Rank Structure",
    "abstract": "Curvature in form of the Hessian or its generalized Gauss-Newton (GGN) approximation is valuable for algorithms that rely on a local model for the loss to train, compress, or explain deep networks. Existing methods based on implicit multiplication via automatic differentiation or Kronecker-factored block diagonal approximations do not consider noise in the mini-batch. We present ViViT, a curvature model that leverages the GGN’s low-rank structure without further approximations. It allows for efficient computation of eigenvalues, eigenvectors, as well as per-sample first- and second-order directional derivatives. The representation is computed in parallel with gradients in one backward pass and offers a fine-grained cost-accuracy trade-off, which allows it to scale. We demonstrate this by conducting performance benchmarks and substantiate ViViT’s usefulness by studying the impact of noise on the GGN’s structural properties during neural network training",

    "title": "On a continuous time model of gradient descent dynamics and instability in deep learning",
    "abstract": "The recipe behind the success of deep learning has been the combination of neural networks and gradient-based optimization. Understanding the behavior of gradient descent however, and particularly its instability, has lagged behind its empirical success. To add to the theoretical tools available to study gradient descent we propose the principal flow (PF), a continuous time flow that approximates gradient descent dynamics. To our knowledge, the PF is the only continuous flow that captures the divergent and oscillatory behaviors of gradient descent, including escaping local minima and saddle points. Through its dependence on the eigendecomposition of the Hessian the PF sheds light on the recently observed edge of stability phenomena in deep learning. Using our new understanding of instability we propose a learning rate adaptation method which enables us to control the trade-off between training stability and test set evaluation performance",

    "title": "Gradient-adjusted Incremental Target Propagation Provides Effective Credit Assignment in Deep Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "Many of the recent advances in the field of artificial intelligence have been fueled by the\nhighly successful backpropagation of error (BP) algorithm, which efficiently solves the\ncredit assignment problem in artificial neural networks. However, it is unlikely that BP is\nimplemented in its usual form within biological neural networks, because of its reliance on\nnon-local information in propagating error gradients. Since biological neural networks are\ncapable of highly efficient learning and responses from BP trained models can be related\nto neural responses, it seems reasonable that a biologically viable approximation of BP\nunderlies synaptic plasticity in the brain. Gradient-adjusted incremental target propagation\n(GAIT-prop or GP for short) has recently been derived directly from BP and has been\nshown to successfully train networks in a more biologically plausible manner. However,\nso far, GP has only been shown to work on relatively low-dimensional problems, such as\nhandwritten-digit recognition. This work addresses some of the scaling issues in GP and\nshows it to perform effective multi-layer credit assignment in deeper networks and on the\nmuch more challenging ImageNet dataset",
