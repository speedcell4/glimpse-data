We show that orthogonal estimators outperform state-of-the-art mechanisms that use iid sampling under weak conditions for tails of the associated Fourier distributions. We prove that for the case of many dimensions, the superiority of the orthogonal transform can be accurately measured by a property we define called the charm of the kernel, and that orthogonal random features provide optimal (in terms of mean squared error) kernel estimators. We provide the first theoretical results which explain why orthogonal random features outperform unstructured on downstream tasks such as kernel ridge regression by showing that orthogonal random features provide kernel algorithms with better spectral properties than the previous state-of-the-art.

    "abstract": "Computing the partition function $Z$ of a discrete graphical model is a fundamental inference challenge. Since this is computationally intractable, variational approximations are often used in practice. Recently, so-called gauge transformations were used to improve variational lower bounds on $Z$. In this paper, we propose a new gauge-variational approach, termed WMBE-G, which combines gauge transformations with the weighted mini-bucket elimination (WMBE) method. WMBE-G can provide both upper and lower bounds on $Z$, and is easier to optimize than the prior gauge-variational algorithm. We show that WMBE-G strictly improves the earlier WMBE approximation for symmetric models including Ising models with no magnetic field. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of WMBE-G even for generic, nonsymmetric models",

    "title": "A Fast Algorithm for Separated Sparsity via Perturbed Lagrangians",
    "abstract": "Sparsity-based methods are widely used in machine learning, statistics, and signal processing. There is now a rich class of structured sparsity approaches that expand the modeling power of the sparsity paradigm and incorporate constraints such as group sparsity, graph sparsity, or hierarchical sparsity. While these sparsity models offer improved sample complexity and better interpretability, the improvements come at a computational cost: it is often challenging to optimize over the (non-convex) constraint sets that capture various sparsity structures. In this paper, we make progress in this direction in the context of separated sparsity -- a fundamental sparsity notion that captures exclusion constraints in linearly ordered data such as time series. While prior algorithms for computing a projection onto this constraint set required quadratic time, we provide a perturbed Lagrangian relaxation approach that computes provably exact projection in only nearly-linear time. Although the sparsity constraint is non-convex, our perturbed Lagrangian approach is still guaranteed to find a globally optimal solution. In experiments, our new algorithms offer a 10$\\times$ speed-up already on moderately-size inputs",

    "title": "Accelerated Stochastic Power Iteration",
    "abstract": "Principal component analysis (PCA) is one of the most powerful tools in machine learning. The simplest method for PCA, the power iteration, requires O ( 1 / Δ ) full-data passes to recover the principal component of a matrix with eigen-gap Δ. Lanczos, a significantly more complex method, achieves an accelerated rate of O ( 1 / Δ ) passes. Modern applications, however, motivate methods that only ingest a subset of available data, known as the stochastic setting. In the online stochastic setting, simple algorithms like Oja's iteration achieve the optimal sample complexity O ( σ 2 / Δ 2 ) . Unfortunately, they are fully sequential, and also require O ( σ 2 / Δ 2 ) iterations, far from the O ( 1 / Δ ) rate of Lanczos. We propose a simple variant of the power iteration with an added momentum term, that achieves both the optimal sample and iteration complexity. In the full-pass setting, standard analysis shows that momentum achieves the accelerated rate, O ( 1 / Δ ) . We demonstrate empirically that naively applying momentum to a stochastic method, does not result in acceleration. We perform a novel, tight variance analysis that reveals the \"breaking-point variance\" beyond which this acceleration does not occur. By combining this insight with modern variance reduction techniques, we construct stochastic PCA algorithms, for the online and offline setting, that achieve an accelerated iteration complexity O ( 1 / Δ ) . Due to the embarassingly parallel nature of our methods, this acceleration translates directly to wall-clock time if deployed in a parallel environment. Our approach is very general, and applies to many non-convex optimization problems that can now be accelerated using the same technique",

We theoretically show that NNM implicitly updates the principal subspace through the multiple layers, and also prove that its corresponding errors of rank-k PSD matrix approximation and kernel PCA (KPCA) are decreased by using additional sublayers before the final layer. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the decreasing property of errors of NNM with the additional sublayers through the experiments on the constructed kernel matrices of real data sets, and show that NNM effectively controls the efficiency both for rank-k PSD matrix approximation and KPCA",

    "abstract": "One iteration of standard $k$-means (i.e., Lloyd's algorithm) or standard EM for Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) scales linearly with the number of clusters $C$, data points $N$, and data dimensionality $D$. In this study, we explore whether one iteration of $k$-means or EM for GMMs can scale sublinearly with $C$ at run-time, while improving the clustering objective remains effective. The tool we apply for complexity reduction is variational EM, which is typically used to make training of generative models with exponentially many hidden states tractable. Here, we apply novel theoretical results on truncated variational EM to make tractable clustering algorithms more efficient. The basic idea is to use a partial variational E-step which reduces the linear complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(NCD)$ required for a full E-step to a sublinear complexity. Our main observation is that the linear dependency on $C$ can be reduced to a dependency on a much smaller parameter $G$ which relates to cluster neighborhood relations. We focus on two versions of partial variational EM for clustering: variational GMM, scaling with $\\mathcal{O}(NG^2D)$, and variational $k$-means, scaling with $\\mathcal{O}(NGD)$ per iteration. Empirical results show that these algorithms still require comparable numbers of iterations to improve the clustering objective to same values as $k$-means. For data with many clusters, we consequently observe reductions of net computational demands between two and three orders of magnitude. More generally, our results provide substantial empirical evidence in favor of clustering to scale sublinearly with $C$",

These results are complemented by an experimental analysis, showing that asynchronous TS outperforms a suite of existing parallel BO algorithms in simulations and in an application involving tuning hyper-parameters of a convolutional neural network.

Despite a recent surge of interest in such eigensolver analysis, truly block solvers have received relatively less attention, in contrast to the majority of studies concentrating on vector versions and non-truly block versions that rely on the deflation strategy. In fact, truly block solvers are more widely deployed in practice by virtue of its simplicity without compromise on accuracy. However, the corresponding theoretical analysis remains inadequate for first-order solvers, as only local and kth gap-dependent rates of convergence have been established thus far. This paper is devoted to revealing significantly better or asyet-unknown theoretical properties of such solvers. We present a novel convergence analysis in a unified framework for three types of first-order Riemannian solvers, i.e., deterministic, vanilla stochastic, and stochastic with variance reduction, that are to find top-k eigenvectors of a real symmetric matrix, in full generality. In particular, the issue of zero gaps between eigenvalues, to the best of our knowledge for the first time, is explicitly considered for these solvers, which brings new understandings, e.g., the dependence of convergence on gaps other than the k-th one. We thus propose the concept of generalized k-th gap. Three types of solvers are proved to converge to a globally optimal solution at a global, generalized k-th gap-dependent, and linear or sub-linear rate. ∗Corresponding author.

    "abstract": "Computing accurate estimates of the Fourier transform of analog signals from discrete data points is important in many fields of science and engineering. The conventional approach of performing the discrete Fourier transform of the data implicitly assumes periodicity and bandlimitedness of the signal. In this paper, we use Gaussian process regression to estimate the Fourier transform (or any other integral transform) without making these assumptions. This is possible because the posterior expectation of Gaussian process regression maps a finite set of samples to a function defined on the whole real line, expressed as a linear combination of covariance functions. We estimate the covariance function from the data using an appropriately designed gradient ascent method that constrains the solution to a linear combination of tractable kernel functions. This procedure results in a posterior expectation of the analog signal whose Fourier transform can be obtained analytically by exploiting linearity. Our simulations show that the new method leads to sharper and more precise estimation of the spectral density both in noise-free and noise-corrupted signals.

In another situation, when only the value of the loss function is available, we propose a bandit online normalized gradient descent algorithm (BONGD). Under a condition to be called weak pseudo-convexity (WPC), we show that both algorithms achieve a cumulative regret bound of O( √ T + VTT ), where VT is the total temporal variations of the loss functions, thus establishing a sublinear regret bound for online learning with non-convex loss functions and non-stationary regret measure",

One of the most important challenges in BO is the development of algorithms that scale to high dimensions, which remains a key open problem despite recent progress. In this paper, we consider the approach of Kandasamy et al. (2015), in which the high-dimensional function decomposes as a sum of lower-dimensional functions on subsets of the underlying variables. In particular, we significantly generalize this approach by lifting the assumption that the subsets are disjoint, and consider additive models with arbitrary overlap among the subsets. By representing the dependencies via a graph, we deduce an efficient message passing algorithm for optimizing the acquisition function.

    "abstract": "Active label correction addresses the problem of learning from input data for which noisy labels are available (e.g., from imprecise measurements or crowd-sourcing) and each true label can be obtained at a significant cost (e.g., through additional measurements or human experts). To minimize these costs, we are interested in identifying training patterns for which knowing the true labels maximally improves the learning performance. We approximate the true label noise by a model that learns the aspects of the noise that are class-conditional (i.e., independent of the input given the observed label). To select labels for correction, we adopt the active learning strategy of maximizing the expected model change. We consider the change in regularized empirical risk functionals that use different pointwise loss functions for patterns with noisy and true labels, respectively. Different loss functions for the noisy data lead to different active label correction algorithms. If loss functions consider the label noise rates, these rates are estimated during learning, where importance weighting compensates for the sampling bias. We show empirically that viewing the true label as a latent variable and computing the maximum likelihood estimate of the model parameters performs well across all considered problems. A maximum a posteriori estimate of the model parameters was beneficial in most test cases. An image classification experiment using convolutional neural networks demonstrates that the class-conditional noise model, which can be learned efficiently, can guide re-labeling in real-world applications.

However, these systems focus only on selecting the therapy most likely to suppress the virus for several weeks, a choice that may be suboptimal over the longer term due to evolution of drug resistance. We present a novel generative model for HIV drug resistance evolution. This model is based on factorial HMMs, applying a novel collapsed Gibbs Sampling algorithm for approximate learning.

This allows us to (i) establish the worst-case optimality of the submodular extension for Potts model used in the literature; (ii) identify the worst-case optimal submodular extension for the more general class of metric labeling; and (iii) efficiently compute the marginals for the widely used dense CRF model with the help of a recently proposed Gaussian filtering method. Using synthetic and real data, we show that our approach provides comparable upper bounds on the log-partition function to those obtained using tree-reweighted message passing (TRW) in cases where the latter is computationally feasible.

Most current methods for constructing prediction intervals offer guarantees for a single new test point.

By focusing on expected errors, our method allows for variability in the per-example conditional error rates. As we demonstrate both analytically and empirically, this flexibility can increase the overall accuracy, or alternatively, reduce the average interval size.   While the problem we consider is of a regressive flavor, the loss we use is combinatorial. This allows us to provide PAC-style, finite-sample guarantees.

In order to train the MoE model efficiently, a matrix factorization method is applied, by extending each weight matrix of the RNN to be an ensemble of topic-dependent weight matrices. The degree to which each member of the ensemble is used is tied to the document-dependent probability of the corresponding topics. Experimental results on several corpora show that the proposed approach outperforms both a pure RNN-based model and other topic-guided language models. Further, our model yields sensible topics, and also has the capacity to generate meaningful sentences conditioned on given topics",

Yet, often, some prior knowledge is known, and this information is incorporated via engineering tricks or methods less principled than a Bayesian prior. However, employing these tricks is difficult to reconcile with principled probabilistic inference. For instance, in the case of data set augmentation, the posterior is conditioned on artificial data and not on what is actually observed. In this paper, we address the problem of how to specify an informative prior when the problem of interest is known to exhibit invariance properties. The proposed method is akin to posterior variational inference: we choose a parametric family and optimize to find the member of the family that makes the model robust to a given transformation. We demonstrate the method’s utility for dropout and rotation transformations, showing that the use of these priors results in performance competitive to that of non-Bayesian methods.

In this paper, we propose a new regularization method, \"Independently Interpretable Lasso\" (IILasso).

Hence, we can interpret regression coefficients intuitively and also improve the performance by avoiding overfitting.

In this paper, we introduce an efficient algorithm to address the above problem in a fully decentralized (peer-to-peer) and asynchronous fashion, with provable convergence rate. We show how to make the algorithm differentially private to protect against the disclosure of information about the personal datasets, and formally analyze the trade-off between utility and privacy. Our experiments show that our approach dramatically outperforms previous work in the non-private case, and that under privacy constraints, we can significantly improve over models learned in isolation",

    "abstract": "Low-rank tensor regression, a new model class that learns high-order correlation from data, has recently received considerable attention. At the same time, Gaussian processes (GP) are well-studied machine learning models for structure learning. In this paper, we demonstrate interesting connections between the two, especially for multi-way data analysis. We show that low-rank tensor regression is essentially learning a multi-linear kernel in Gaussian processes, and the low-rank assumption translates to the constrained Bayesian inference problem. We prove the oracle inequality and derive the average case learning curve for the equivalent GP model. Our finding implies that low-rank tensor regression, though empirically successful, is highly dependent on the eigenvalues of covariance functions as well as variable correlations",

The arms are divided into different groups, each of which has a common parameter. Therefore, when the player selects an arm at each time slot, information of other arms in the same group is also revealed. This regional bandit model naturally bridges the non-informative bandit setting where the player can only learn the chosen arm, and the global bandit model where sampling one arms reveals information of all arms. We propose an efficient algorithm, UCB-g, that solves the regional bandit problem by combining the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and greedy principles. Both parameter-dependent and parameter-free regret upper bounds are derived. We also establish a matching lower bound, which proves the order-optimality of UCB-g.

Another advantage is that it automatically determines the batch size within a specified budget avoiding unnecessary function evaluations. Theoretical analysis shows that the regret not only reduces sub-linearly but also by an additional reduction factor determined by the batch size.

    "abstract": "Evaluating integrals is an ubiquitous issue and Monte Carlo methods, exploiting advances in random number generation over the last decades, offer a popular and powerful alternative to integration deterministic techniques, unsuited in particular when the domain of integration is complex. This paper is devoted to the study of a kernel smoothing based competitor built from a sequence of n ≥ 1 i.i.d random vectors with arbitrary continuous probability distribution f(x)dx, originally proposed in [7], from a nonasymptotic perspective. We establish a probability bound showing that the method under study, though biased, produces an estimate approximating the target integral ∫ x∈Rd φ(x)dx with an error bound of order o(1/ √ n) uniformly over a class Φ of functions φ, under weak complexity/smoothness assumptions related to the class Φ, outperforming Monte-Carlo procedures. This striking result is shown to derive from an appropriate decomposition of the maximal deviation between the target integrals and their estimates, highlighting the remarkable benefit to averaging strongly dependent terms regarding statistical accuracy in this situation. The theoretical analysis then rests on sharp probability inequalities for degenerate U -statistics. It is illustrated by numerical results in the context of covariate shift regression, providing empirical evidence of the relevance of the approach.

One general class of algorithms for optimizing interactions with the world, while simultaneously learning how the world operates, is the multi-armed bandit setting and, in particular, the contextual bandit case. In this setting, for each executed action, one observes rewards that are dependent on a given 'context', available at each interaction with the world. The Thompson sampling algorithm has recently been shown to enjoy provable optimality properties for this set of problems, and to perform well in real-world settings. It facilitates generative and interpretable modeling of the problem at hand. Nevertheless, the design and complexity of the model limit its application, since one must both sample from the distributions modeled and calculate their expected rewards. We here show how these limitations can be overcome using variational inference to approximate complex models, applying to the reinforcement learning case advances developed for the inference case in the machine learning community over the past two decades. We consider contextual multi-armed bandit applications where the true reward distribution is unknown and complex, which we approximate with a mixture model whose parameters are inferred via variational inference. We show how the proposed variational Thompson sampling approach is accurate in approximating the true distribution, and attains reduced regrets even with complex reward distributions.

The number of labels needed is proportional to the statistical dimension of the problem which is often much smaller than $d$. Our method is an extension of a joint subsampling procedure called volume sampling. A second major contribution is that we speed up volume sampling so that it is essentially as efficient as leverage scores, which is the main i.i.d. subsampling procedure for this task. Finally, we show theoretically and experimentally that volume sampling has a clear advantage over any i.i.d. sampling when labels are expensive",

Further, our approach allows for training kernels based on deep neural networks without any modifications to the underlying GP model. A neural network learns a multidimensional embedding for the data, which is used by the GP to make the final prediction. We train GP and neural network parameters end-to-end without pretraining, through maximization of GP marginal likelihood.

Despite an abundance of observations thanks to parallel experiments, current BO techniques have been limited to merely a few thousand observations. In this paper, we propose ensemble Bayesian optimization (EBO) to address three current challenges in BO simultaneously: (1) large-scale observations; (2) high dimensional input spaces; and (3) selections of batch queries that balance quality and diversity. The key idea of EBO is to operate on an ensemble of additive Gaussian process models, each of which possesses a randomized strategy to divide and conquer.

A number of global-alignment kernels have since been proposed in the spirit of DTW to extend its use to kernel-based estimation method such as support vector machine. However, those kernels suffer from diagonal dominance of the Gram matrix and a quadratic complexity w.r.t. the sample size. In this work, we study a family of alignment-aware positive definite (p.d.) kernels, with its feature embedding given by a distribution of \\emph{Random Warping Series (RWS)}. The proposed kernel does not suffer from the issue of diagonal dominance while naturally enjoys a \\emph{Random Features} (RF) approximation, which reduces the computational complexity of existing DTW-based techniques from quadratic to linear in terms of both the number and the length of time-series. We also study the convergence of the RF approximation for the domain of time series of unbounded length.

While replacing a model to a heavy-tailed one (e.g., from Gaussian to Student-t) is a standard approach for robustification, it can only be applied to simple models. In this paper, based on Zellner's optimization and variational formulation of Bayesian inference, we propose an outlier-robust pseudo-Bayesian variational method by replacing the Kullback-Leibler divergence used for data fitting to a robust divergence such as the beta- and gamma-divergences. An advantage of our approach is that superior but complex models such as deep networks can also be handled. We theoretically prove that, for deep networks with ReLU activation functions, the \\emph{influence function} in our proposed method is bounded, while it is unbounded in the ordinary variational inference.

This leads to instance dependent regret bounds of $\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\lambda(\\pmb{\\mu})\\mathcal{M}\\log T/\\Delta \\right)$, where $\\lambda(\\pmb{\\mu})$ is a term that depends on the mean rewards of the experts, $\\Delta$ is the smallest gap between the mean reward of the optimal expert and the rest, and $\\mathcal{M}$ quantifies the information leakage among the experts.

For proving the achievability, we propose a two-step polynomial time algorithm that provably achieves the fundamental limit in the sparse hypergraph regime. For proving the optimality, the lower bound of the minimax risk is set by finding a smaller parameter space which contains the most dominant error events, inspired by the analysis in the achievability part. It turns out that the minimax risk decays exponentially fast to zero as the number of nodes tends to infinity, and the rate function is a weighted combination of several divergence terms, each of which is the Rényi divergence of order 1/2 between two Bernoulli distributions. The Bernoulli distributions involved in the characterization of the rate function are those governing the random instantiation of hyperedges in d-hSBM.

This lack of sparsity can be problematic in applications where the transportation plan itself is of interest. In this paper, we explore regularizing the primal and dual OT formulations with a strongly convex term, which corresponds to relaxing the dual and primal constraints with smooth approximations. We show how to incorporate squared $2$-norm and group lasso regularizations within that framework, leading to sparse and group-sparse transportation plans. On the theoretical side, we bound the approximation error introduced by regularizing the primal and dual formulations.

By reformulating the problem through exact penalty functions, we derive first-order algorithms which not only guarantees that the distance to the intersection is small but also improve the complexity to $O(1/\\varepsilon)$ and $O(1/\\sqrt{\\varepsilon})$ for smooth functions. For composite and smooth problems, this is achieved through a saddle-point reformulation where the proximal operators required by the primal-dual algorithms can be computed in closed form. We illustrate the benefits of our approach on a graph transduction problem and on graph matching",

    "abstract": "Many recent advances in large scale probabilistic inference rely on variational methods. The success of variational approaches depends on (i) formulating a flexible parametric family of distributions, and (ii) optimizing the parameters to find the member of this family that most closely approximates the exact posterior. In this paper we present a new approximating family of distributions, the variational sequential Monte Carlo (VSMC) family, and show how to optimize it in variational inference. VSMC melds variational inference (VI) and sequential Monte Carlo (SMC), providing practitioners with flexible, accurate, and powerful Bayesian inference. The VSMC family is a variational family that can approximate the posterior arbitrarily well, while still allowing for efficient optimization of its parameters. We demonstrate its utility on state space models, stochastic volatility models for financial data, and deep Markov models of brain neural circuits",

The statistical efficiencies of estimators, i.e., their convergence rates, play a central role in advanced statistical analysis. Although estimators and their convergence rates for smooth density functions are well investigated in the literature, those for non-smooth density functions remain elusive despite their importance in application fields. In this paper, we propose new estimators for non-smooth density functions by employing the notion of Szemerédi partitions from graph theory. We derive convergence rates of the proposed estimators.

    "title": "Generalized Concomitant Multi-Task Lasso for Sparse Multimodal Regression",
    "abstract": "In high dimension, it is customary to consider Lasso-type estimators to enforce sparsity. For standard Lasso theory to hold, the regularization parameter should be proportional to the noise level, yet the latter is generally unknown in practice. A possible remedy is to consider estimators, such as the Concomitant/Scaled Lasso, which jointly optimize over the regression coefficients as well as over the noise level, making the choice of the regularization independent of the noise level. However, when data from different sources are pooled to increase sample size, or when dealing with multimodal datasets, noise levels typically differ and new dedicated estimators are needed. In this work we provide new statistical and computational solutions to deal with such heteroscedastic regression models, with an emphasis on functional brain imaging with combined magneto- and electroencephalographic (M/EEG) signals. Adopting the formulation of Concomitant Lasso-type estimators, we propose a jointly convex formulation to estimate both the regression coefficients and the (square root of the) noise covariance. When our framework is instantiated to de-correlated noise, it leads to an efficient algorithm whose computational cost is not higher than for the Lasso and Concomitant Lasso, while addressing more complex noise structures. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our estimator yields improved prediction and support identification while correctly estimating the noise (square root) covariance. Results on multimodal neuroimaging problems with M/EEG data are also reported",

    "title": "Gradient Layer: Enhancing the Convergence of Adversarial Training for Generative Models",
    "abstract": "We propose a new technique that boosts the convergence of training generative adversarial networks. Generally, the rate of training deep models reduces severely after multiple iterations. A key reason for this phenomenon is that a deep network is expressed using a highly non-convex finite-dimensional model, and thus the parameter gets stuck in a local optimum. Because of this, methods often suffer not only from degeneration of the convergence speed but also from limitations in the representational power of the trained network. To overcome this issue, we propose an additional layer called the gradient layer to seek a descent direction in an infinite-dimensional space. Because the layer is constructed in the infinite-dimensional space, we are not restricted by the specific model structure of finite-dimensional models. As a result, we can get out of the local optima in finite-dimensional models and move towards the global optimal function more directly. In this paper, this phenomenon is explained from the functional gradient method perspective of the gradient layer. Interestingly, the optimization procedure using the gradient layer naturally constructs the deep structure of the network. Moreover, we demonstrate that this procedure can be regarded as a discretization method of the gradient flow that naturally reduces the objective function. Finally, the method is tested using several numerical experiments, which show its fast convergence",

The mechanism maintains a directed graph alongside the running program that evolves dynamically as operations are triggered upon it. Nodes of the graph represent random variables, edges the analytically-tractable relationships between them. Random variables remain in the graph for as long as possible, to be sampled only when they are used by the program in a way that cannot be resolved analytically. In the meantime, they are conditioned on as many observations as possible. We demonstrate the mechanism with a few pedagogical examples, as well as a linear-nonlinear state-space model with simulated data, and an epidemiological model with real data of a dengue outbreak in Micronesia. In all cases one or more variables are automatically marginalized out to significantly reduce variance in estimates of the marginal likelihood, in the final case facilitating a random-weight or pseudo-marginal-type importance sampler for parameter estimation.

    "abstract": "Discrete labeling problems are often solved by formulating them as an integer program, and relaxing the integrality constraint to a continuous domain. While the continuous relaxation is closely related to the original integer program, its optimal solution is often fractional. Thus, the success of a relaxation depends crucially on the availability of an accurate rounding procedure. The problem of identifying an accurate rounding procedure has mainly been tackled in the theoretical computer science community through mathematical analysis of the worst-case. However, this approach is both onerous and ignores the distribution of the data encountered in practice. We present a novel interpretation of rounding procedures as sampling from a latent variable model, which opens the door to the use of powerful machine learning formulations in their design. Inspired by the recent success of deep latent variable models we parameterize rounding procedures as a neural network, which lends itself to efficient optimization via back-propagation. By minimizing the expected value of the objective of the discrete labeling problem over training samples, we learn a rounding procedure that is more suited to the task at hand. Using both synthetic and real world data sets, we demonstrate that our approach can outperform the state-of-the-art hand-designed rounding procedures",

The score of a given item is defined as the probability that it beats a randomly chosen other item. Finding an exact ranking typically requires a prohibitively large number of comparisons, but in practice, approximate rankings are often adequate. Accordingly, we study the problem of finding approximate rankings from pairwise comparisons. We analyze an active ranking algorithm that counts the number of comparisons won, and decides whether to stop or which pair of items to compare next, based on confidence intervals computed from the data collected in previous steps. We show that this algorithm succeeds in recovering approximate rankings using a number of comparisons that is close to optimal up to logarithmic factors.

    "title": "VAE with a VampPrior",
    "abstract": "Many different methods to train deep generative models have been introduced in the past. In this paper, we propose to extend the variational auto-encoder (VAE) framework with a new type of prior which we call \"Variational Mixture of Posteriors\" prior, or VampPrior for short. The VampPrior consists of a mixture distribution (e.g., a mixture of Gaussians) with components given by variational posteriors conditioned on learnable pseudo-inputs. We further extend this prior to a two layer hierarchical model and show that this architecture with a coupled prior and posterior, learns significantly better models. The model also avoids the usual local optima issues related to useless latent dimensions that plague VAEs. We provide empirical studies on six datasets, namely, static and binary MNIST, OMNIGLOT, Caltech 101 Silhouettes, Frey Faces and Histopathology patches, and show that applying the hierarchical VampPrior delivers state-of-the-art results on all datasets in the unsupervised permutation invariant setting and the best results or comparable to SOTA methods for the approach with convolutional networks",

    "abstract": "Probabilistic reasoning on complex real-world models is computationally challenging. Inference algorithms have been developed that work well on specific models or on parts of general models, but they require significant handengineering to apply to full-scale problems. Probabilistic programming (PP) enables the expression of rich probabilistic models, but inference remains a bottleneck in many applications. Factored inference is one of the main approaches to inference in graphical models, but has trouble scaling up to some hard problems expressible as probabilistic programs. We present structured factored inference (SFI), a framework that enables factored inference algorithms to scale to significantly more complex programs. Using models encoded in a PP language, SFI provides a sound means to decompose a model into submodels, apply an algorithm to each submodel, and combine results to answer a query. Our results show that SFI successfully reasons on models where standard factored inference algorithms fail due to computational complexity. SFI is nearly as accurate as exact inference and is as fast as approximate inference methods",

    "abstract": "A central challenge to using first-order methods for optimizing nonconvex problems is the presence of saddle points. First-order methods often get stuck at saddle points, greatly deteriorating their performance. Typically, to escape from saddles one has to use second-order methods. However, most works on second-order methods rely extensively on expensive Hessian-based computations, making them impractical in large-scale settings. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a generic framework that minimizes Hessian based computations while at the same time provably converging to second-order critical points. Our framework carefully alternates between a first-order and a second-order subroutine, using the latter only close to saddle points, and yields convergence results competitive to the state-of-the-art.

Previous work for discrete treatment/action spaces focuses on inverse probability weighting (IPW) and doubly robust (DR) methods that use a rejection sampling approach for evaluation and the equivalent weighted classification problem for learning. In the continuous setting, this reduction fails as we would almost surely reject all observations. To tackle the case of continuous treatments, we extend the IPW and DR approaches to the continuous setting using a kernel function that leverages treatment proximity to attenuate discrete rejection. Our policy estimator is consistent and we characterize the optimal bandwidth. The resulting continuous policy optimizer (CPO) approach using our estimator achieves convergent regret and approaches the best-in-class policy for learnable policy classes. We demonstrate that the estimator performs well and, in particular, outperforms a discretization-based benchmark. We further study the performance of our policy optimizer in a case study on personalized dosing based on a dataset of Warfarin patients, their covariates, and final therapeutic doses.

Using numerical methods to solve the equations results in prohibitive computational costs, particularly when one adopts a Bayesian approach in sampling parameters from a posterior distribution. With the introduction of gradient matching, we can abandon the need to numerically solve the system of equations. Inherent in these efficient procedures is an introduction of bias to the learning problem as we no longer sample based on the exact likelihood function. This paper presents a multiphase MCMC approach that attempts to close the gap between efficiency and accuracy.

In this paper, we introduce sparse linear isotonic models (SLIMs) for highdimensional problems by hybridizing ideas in parametric sparse linear models and AIMs, which enjoy a few appealing advantages over both. In the high-dimensional setting, a two-step algorithm is proposed for estimating the sparse parameters as well as the monotone functions over predictors.

An automatically generated suggestion could help, but there is no single \"correct\" edit for a given image$-$different experts may make very different aesthetic decisions when faced with the same image, and a single expert may make different choices depending on the intended use of the image (or on a whim).

Unfortunately, most estimators are not scalable enough to handle the sizes of modern high-dimensional data sets (often on the order of terabytes), and assume Gaussian samples. To address these deficiencies, we introduce HP-CONCORD, a highly scalable optimization method for estimating a sparse inverse covariance matrix based on a regularized pseudolikelihood framework, without assuming Gaussianity. Our parallel proximal gradient method uses a novel communication-avoiding linear algebra algorithm and runs across a multi-node cluster with up to 1k nodes (24k cores), achieving parallel scalability on problems with up to ≈819 billion parameters (1.28 million dimensions); even on a single node, HP-CONCORD demonstrates scalability, outperforming a state-of-the-art method.

Importantly, dynamic connectivity has been linked to individual differences in physiology, psychology and behavior, and has shown promise as a biomarker for disease. The state of the art in computational neuroimaging is to estimate the brain networks as relatively short sliding window covariance matrices, which leads to high variance estimates, thereby resulting in high overall error. This manuscript proposes a novel Bayesian model for dynamic brain connectivity. Motivated by the underlying neuroscience, the model estimates covariances which vary smoothly over time, with an instantaneous decomposition into a collection of spatially sparse components – resulting in parsimonious and highly interpretable estimates of dynamic brain connectivity. Simulated results are presented to illustrate the performance of the model even when it is mis-specified.

We show that while we geometrically increase the size of the training set at each stage, a single iteration of the truncated Newton method is sufficient to solve the new ERM within its statistical accuracy. Moreover, for a large number of samples we are allowed to double the size of the training set at each stage, and the proposed method subsequently reaches the statistical accuracy of the full training set approximately after two effective passes.

In this work, we develop and analyze the Frank-Wolfe Augmented Lagrangian (FW-AL) algorithm, a method for minimizing a smooth function over convex compact sets related by a \"linear consistency\" constraint that only requires access to a linear minimization oracle over the individual constraints. It is based on the Augmented Lagrangian Method (ALM), also known as Method of Multipliers, but unlike most existing splitting methods, it only requires access to linear (instead of quadratic) minimization oracles. We use recent advances in the analysis of Frank-Wolfe and the alternating direction method of multipliers algorithms to prove a sublinear convergence rate for FW-AL over general convex compact sets and a linear convergence rate for polytopes",

    "title": "Learning linear structural equation models in polynomial time and sample complexity",
    "abstract": "The problem of learning structural equation models (SEMs) from data is a fundamental problem in causal inference. We develop a new algorithm --- which is computationally and statistically efficient and works in the high-dimensional regime --- for learning linear SEMs from purely observational data with arbitrary noise distribution. We consider three aspects of the problem: identifiability, computational efficiency, and statistical efficiency. We show that when data is generated from a linear SEM over $p$ nodes and maximum degree $d$, our algorithm recovers the directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure of the SEM under an identifiability condition that is more general than those considered in the literature, and without faithfulness assumptions. In the population setting, our algorithm recovers the DAG structure in $\\mathcal{O}(p(d^2 + \\log p))$ operations. In the finite sample setting, if the estimated precision matrix is sparse, our algorithm has a smoothed complexity of $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(p^3 + pd^7)$, while if the estimated precision matrix is dense, our algorithm has a smoothed complexity of $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(p^5)$. For sub-Gaussian noise, we show that our algorithm has a sample complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{d^8}{\\varepsilon^2} \\log (\\frac{p}{\\sqrt{\\delta}}))$ to achieve $\\varepsilon$ element-wise additive error with respect to the true autoregression matrix with probability at most $1 - \\delta$, while for noise with bounded $(4m)$-th moment, with $m$ being a positive integer, our algorithm has a sample complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{d^8}{\\varepsilon^2} (\\frac{p^2}{\\delta})^{1/m})$",

While with a standard parametrization the MLE problem is not convex and hence hard to solve globally, our parametrization leads to a functional that is jointly convex in the Sharpe ratio and inverse volatility functions. The major difficulty with the resulting infinite-dimensional convex program is the shape constraint on the inverse volatility function. We propose to solve the problem by solving a sequence of finite-dimensional convex programs with increasing dimensions, which can be done globally and efficiently. We demonstrate that, when the goal is to estimate the Sharpe ratio function directly, the finite-sample performance of the proposed estimation method is superior to existing methods that estimate the mean and variance functions separately. When applied to a financial dataset, our method captures a well-known covariate-dependent effect on the Shape ratio",

While the manifold hypothesis implies that the density induced by a dataset contains large regions of low density, the training criterions of VAEs and GANs will make the latent space densely covered. Consequently points that are separated by low-density regions in observation space will be pushed together in latent space, making stationary distances poor proxies for similarity. We transfer ideas from Riemannian geometry to this setting, letting the distance between two points be the shortest path on a Riemannian manifold induced by the transformation. The method yields a principled distance measure, provides a tool for visual inspection of deep generative models, and an alternative to linear interpolation in latent space. In addition, it can be applied for robot movement generalization using previously learned skills.

Measuring the performance is straightforward if the data are generated from a known model, the ground truth. However, when the study concerns real-world data, the current methodology is limited to estimating predictive performance, typically by cross-validation. This work introduces a method to compare algorithms’ ability to learn the model structure, assuming no ground truth is given. The idea is to identify a partial structure on which the algorithms agree, and measure the performance in relation to that structure on subsamples of the data. The method is instantiated to structure learning in Bayesian networks, measuring the performance by the structural Hamming distance. It is tested using benchmark ground truth networks and algorithms that maximize various scoring functions. The results show that the method can produce evaluation outcomes that are close to those one would obtain if the ground truth was available",

Our problem setting is a generalization of the online sparse linear regression problem, which has been actively studied. For our general problem, we present an algorithm by combining multi-armed bandit algorithms and online learning methods. This algorithm admits a sublinear regret bound when the number of observation functions is constant. We also show that the dependency on the number of observation functions is inevitable unless additional assumptions are adopted. To mitigate this inefficiency, we focus on a special case of practical importance, in which the observed information is expressed through linear combinations of the original features. We propose efficient algorithms for this special case. Finally, we also demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms by simulation studies using both artificial and real data.

    "title": "Learning Generative Models with Sinkhorn Divergences",
    "abstract": "The ability to compare two degenerate probability distributions (i.e. two probability distributions supported on two distinct low-dimensional manifolds living in a much higher-dimensional space) is a crucial problem arising in the estimation of generative models for high-dimensional observations such as those arising in computer vision or natural language. It is known that optimal transport metrics can represent a cure for this problem, since they were specifically designed as an alternative to information divergences to handle such problematic scenarios. Unfortunately, training generative machines using OT raises formidable computational and statistical challenges, because of (i) the computational burden of evaluating OT losses, (ii) the instability and lack of smoothness of these losses, (iii) the difficulty to estimate robustly these losses and their gradients in high dimension. This paper presents the first tractable computational method to train large scale generative models using an optimal transport loss, and tackles these three issues by relying on two key ideas: (a) entropic smoothing, which turns the original OT loss into one that can be computed using Sinkhorn fixed point iterations; (b) algorithmic (automatic) differentiation of these iterations. These two approximations result in a robust and differentiable approximation of the OT loss with streamlined GPU execution. Entropic smoothing generates a family of losses interpolating between Wasserstein (OT) and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), thus allowing to find a sweet spot leveraging the geometry of OT and the favorable high-dimensional sample complexity of MMD which comes with unbiased gradient estimates. The resulting computational architecture complements nicely standard deep network generative models by a stack of extra layers implementing the loss function",

To surmount this challenge, we start with the usual step of relaxing a discrete set (here, of permutation matrices) to its convex hull, which here is the Birkhoff polytope: the set of all doubly-stochastic matrices. We then introduce two novel transformations: first, an invertible and differentiable stick-breaking procedure that maps unconstrained space to the Birkhoff polytope; second, a map that rounds points toward the vertices of the polytope. Both transformations include a temperature parameter that, in the limit, concentrates the densities on permutation matrices. We then exploit these transformations and reparameterization gradients to introduce variational inference over permutation matrices, and we demonstrate its utility in a series of experiments",

However, to improve accuracy in realworld problems, we typically need to learn separate weights for different groundings of the MLN. In this paper, we present an approach to perform efficient weight learning in MLNs containing high-dimensional, untied formulas. The fundamental idea in our approach is to help the learning algorithm navigate the parameter search-space more efficiently by a) tying together groundings of untied formulas that are likely to have similar weights, and b) setting good initial values for the parameters. To do this, we follow a hierarchical approach, where we first learn the parameters that are to be tied using a non-relational learner. We then use a relational learner to learn the tiedparameter MLN with initial values derived from parameters learned by the non-relational learner. We illustrate the promise of our approach on three different real-world problems and show that our approach yields much more scalable and accurate results compared to existing state-of-the-art relational learning systems",

This problem extends the classical contextual bandit problem with similarity information by introducing multiple and possibly conflicting objectives. Since the best arm in each objective can be different given the context, learning the best arm based on a single objective can jeopardize the rewards obtained from the other objectives. In order to evaluate the performance of the learner in this setup, we use a performance metric called the contextual Pareto regret. Essentially, the contextual Pareto regret is the sum of the distances of the arms chosen by the learner to the context dependent Pareto front. For this problem, we develop a new online learning algorithm called Pareto Contextual Zooming (PCZ), which exploits the idea of contextual zooming to learn the arms that are close to the Pareto front for each observed context by adaptively partitioning the joint context-arm set according to the observed rewards and locations of the context-arm pairs selected in the past. Then, we prove that PCZ achieves $\\tilde O (T^{(1+d_p)/(2+d_p)})$ Pareto regret where $d_p$ is the Pareto zooming dimension that depends on the size of the set of near-optimal context-arm pairs. Moreover, we show that this regret bound is nearly optimal by providing an almost matching $\\Omega (T^{(1+d_p)/(2+d_p)})$ lower bound",

    "title": "Data-Efficient Reinforcement Learning with Probabilistic Model Predictive Control",
    "abstract": "Trial-and-error based reinforcement learning (RL) has seen rapid advancements in recent times, especially with the advent of deep neural networks. However, the majority of autonomous RL algorithms require a large number of interactions with the environment. A large number of interactions may be impractical in many real-world applications, such as robotics, and many practical systems have to obey limitations in the form of state space or control constraints. To reduce the number of system interactions while simultaneously handling constraints, we propose a model-based RL framework based on probabilistic Model Predictive Control (MPC). In particular, we propose to learn a probabilistic transition model using Gaussian Processes (GPs) to incorporate model uncertainty into long-term predictions, thereby, reducing the impact of model errors. We then use MPC to find a control sequence that minimises the expected long-term cost. We provide theoretical guarantees for first-order optimality in the GP-based transition models with deterministic approximate inference for long-term planning. We demonstrate that our approach does not only achieve state-of-the-art data efficiency, but also is a principled way for RL in constrained environments",

    "abstract": "Complex simulator-based models usually have intractable likelihood functions, rendering the likelihood-based inference methods inapplicable. Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) emerges as an alternative framework of likelihood-free inference methods. It identifies a quasi-posterior distribution by finding values of parameter that simulate the synthetic data resembling the observed data. A major ingredient of ABC is the discrepancy measure between the observed and the simulated data, which conventionally involves a fundamental difficulty of constructing effective summary statistics. To bypass this difficulty, we adopt a Kullback-Leibler divergence estimator to assess the data discrepancy. Our method enjoys the asymptotic consistency and linearithmic time complexity as the data size increases. In experiments on five benchmark models, this method achieves a comparable or higher quasiposterior quality, compared to the existing methods using other discrepancy measures",

    "title": "Practical Bayesian optimization in the presence of outliers",
    "abstract": "Inference in the presence of outliers is an important field of research as outliers are ubiquitous and may arise across a variety of problems and domains. Bayesian optimization is method that heavily relies on probabilistic inference. This allows outstanding sample efficiency because the probabilistic machinery provides a memory of the whole optimization process. However, that virtue becomes a disadvantage when the memory is populated with outliers, inducing bias in the estimation. In this paper, we present an empirical evaluation of Bayesian optimization methods in the presence of outliers. The empirical evidence shows that Bayesian optimization with robust regression often produces suboptimal results. We then propose a new algorithm which combines robust regression (a Gaussian process with Student-t likelihood) with outlier diagnostics to classify data points as outliers or inliers. By using an scheduler for the classification of outliers, our method is more efficient and has better convergence over the standard robust regression. Furthermore, we show that even in controlled situations with no expected outliers, our method is able to produce better results",

In graphon estimation, one is interested in estimating edge intensities or probabilities between nodes using a single snapshot of a graph realization. In the recent literature, there has been exciting development within both of these topics. In the context of crowdsourcing, the key intellectual challenge is to understand whether a given task can be more accurately denoised by aggregating answers collected from other different tasks. In the context of graphon estimation, precise information limits and estimation algorithms remain of interest. In this paper, we utilize a statistical reduction from crowdsourcing to graphon estimation to advance the state-of-art for both of these challenges.

    "abstract": "Embed-to-control (E2C) is a model for solving high-dimensional optimal control problems by combining variational auto-encoders with locally-optimal controllers. However, the E2C model suffers from two major drawbacks: 1) its objective function does not correspond to the likelihood of the data sequence and 2) the variational encoder used for embedding typically has large variational approximation error, especially when there is noise in the system dynamics. In this paper, we present a new model for learning robust locally-linear controllable embedding (RCE). Our model directly estimates the predictive conditional density of the future observation given the current one, while introducing the bottleneck between the current and future observations. Although the bottleneck provides a natural embedding candidate for control, our RCE model introduces additional specific structures in the generative graphical model so that the model dynamics can be robustly linearized. We also propose a principled variational approximation of the embedding posterior that takes the future observation into account, and thus, makes the variational approximation more robust against the noise. Experimental results show that RCE outperforms the E2C model, and does so significantly when the underlying dynamics is noisy",

Our method generalizes and improves over that of Globerson et al. (2015), who introduced the problem for two-dimensional grid lattices.   For trees we provide a simple, efficient, algorithm that infers the ground truth with optimal Hamming error has optimal sample complexity and implies recovery results for all connected graphs. Here, the presence of side information is critical to obtain a non-trivial recovery rate. We then show how to adapt this algorithm to tree decompositions of edge-subgraphs of certain graph families such as lattices, resulting in optimal recovery error rates that can be obtained efficiently   The thrust of our analysis is to 1) use the tree decomposition along with edge measurements to produce a small class of viable vertex labelings and 2) apply an analysis influenced by statistical learning theory to show that we can infer the ground truth from this class using vertex measurements. We show the power of our method in several examples including hypergrids, ring lattices, and the Newman-Watts model for small world graphs.

The method of SDs is simple, and it is often easy to develop a shepherded sampler for a particular problem. Other advantages include wide applicability–the method can easily be used to draw samples from discrete distributions, or distributions on the simplex.

Comparison-based queries are among the most natural ways to get feedback from humans. A challenge in designing comparison-based interactive learning algorithms is coping with noisy answers. The most common fix is to submit a query several times, but this is not applicable in many situations due to its prohibitive cost and due to the unrealistic assumption of independent noise in different repetitions of the same query.   In this paper, we introduce a new weak oracle model, where a non-malicious user responds to a pairwise comparison query only when she is quite sure about the answer. This model is able to mimic the behavior of a human in noise-prone regions. We also consider the application of this weak oracle model to the problem of content search (a variant of the nearest neighbor search problem) through comparisons. More specifically, we aim at devising efficient algorithms to locate a target object in a database equipped with a dissimilarity metric via invocation of the weak comparison oracle. We propose two algorithms termed WORCS-I and WORCS-II (Weak-Oracle Comparison-based Search), which provably locate the target object in a number of comparisons close to the entropy of the target distribution. While WORCS-I provides better theoretical guarantees, WORCS-II is applicable to more technically challenging scenarios where the algorithm has limited access to the ranking dissimilarity between objects.

Most recently, a range of probabilistic latent variable models applied to fMRI data have been successful in a variety of tasks, including identifying similarity patterns in neural data (Representational Similarity Analysis and its empirical Bayes variant, RSA and BRSA; Intersubject Functional Connectivity, ISFC), combining multi-subject datasets (Shared Response Mapping; SRM), and mapping between brain and behavior (Joint Modeling). Although these methods share some underpinnings, they have been developed as distinct methods, with distinct algorithms and software tools. We show how the matrix-variate normal (MN) formalism can unify some of these methods into a single framework. In doing so, we gain the ability to reuse noise modeling assumptions, algorithms, and code across models. Our primary theoretical contribution shows how some of these methods can be written as instantiations of the same model, allowing us to generalize them to flexibly modeling structured noise covariances. Our formalism permits novel model variants and improved estimation strategies: in contrast to SRM, the number of parameters for MN-SRM does not scale with the number of voxels or subjects; in contrast to BRSA, the number of parameters for MN-RSA scales additively rather than multiplicatively in the number of voxels. We empirically demonstrate advantages of two new methods derived in the formalism: for MN-RSA, we show up to 10x improvement in runtime, up to 6x improvement in RMSE, and more conservative behavior under the null. For MN-SRM, our method grants a modest improvement to out-of-sample reconstruction while relaxing an orthonormality constraint of SRM.

    "title": "Spectral Algorithms for Computing Fair Support Vector Machines",
    "abstract": "Classifiers and rating scores are prone to implicitly codifying biases, which may be present in the training data, against protected classes (i.e., age, gender, or race). So it is important to understand how to design classifiers and scores that prevent discrimination in predictions. This paper develops computationally tractable algorithms for designing accurate but fair support vector machines (SVM's). Our approach imposes a constraint on the covariance matrices conditioned on each protected class, which leads to a nonconvex quadratic constraint in the SVM formulation. We develop iterative algorithms to compute fair linear and kernel SVM's, which solve a sequence of relaxations constructed using a spectral decomposition of the nonconvex constraint. Its effectiveness in achieving high prediction accuracy while ensuring fairness is shown through numerical experiments on several data sets",

    "abstract": "We present a probabilistic, fully Bayesian framework for multi-label learning. Our framework is based on the idea of learning a joint low-rank embedding of the label matrix and the label co-occurrence matrix. The proposed framework has the following appealing aspects: (1) It leverages the sparsity in the label matrix and the feature matrix, which results in very efficient inference, especially for sparse datasets, commonly encountered in multi-label learning problems, and (2) By effectively utilizing the label co-occurrence information, the model yields improved prediction accuracies, especially in the case where the amount of training data is low and/or the label matrix has a significant fraction of missing labels. Our framework enjoys full local conjugacy and admits a simple inference procedure via a scalable Gibbs sampler. We report experimental results on a number of benchmark datasets, on which it outperforms several state-of-the-art multi-label learning models",

SGLDS uses the Bernoulli-Poisson link together with a gamma process to generate an infinite dimensional sparse random graph to model state transitions. Depending on the sparsity pattern of the corresponding row and column of the graph affinity matrix, a latent state of SGLDS can be categorized as either a non-dynamic state or a dynamic one. A normal-gamma construction is used to shrink the energy captured by the non-dynamic states, while the dynamic states can be further categorized into live, absorbing, or noise-injection states, which capture different types of dynamical components of the underlying time series. The state-of-the-art performance of SGLDS is demonstrated with experiments on both synthetic and real data",

    "abstract": "Variational inference is a powerful approach for approximate posterior inference. However, it is sensitive to initialization and can be subject to poor local optima. In this paper, we develop proximity variational inference (PVI). PVI is a new method for optimizing the variational objective that constrains subsequent iterates of the variational parameters to robustify the optimization path. Consequently, PVI is less sensitive to initialization and optimization quirks and finds better local optima. We demonstrate our method on three proximity statistics. We study PVI on a Bernoulli factor model and sigmoid belief network with both real and synthetic data and compare to deterministic annealing (Katahira et al., 2008). We highlight the flexibility of PVI by designing a proximity statistic for Bayesian deep learning models such as the variational autoencoder (Kingma and Welling, 2014; Rezende et al., 2014). Empirically, we show that PVI consistently finds better local optima and gives better predictive performance",

To facilitate understanding of the target hypothesis, it is crucial for the teaching algorithm to use examples which are interpretable to the human learner. In this paper, we propose NOTES, a principled framework for constructing interpretable teaching sets, utilizing explanations to accelerate the teaching process. Our algorithm is built upon a natural stochastic model of learners and a novel submodular surrogate objective function which greedily selects interpretable teaching examples. We prove that NOTES is competitive with the optimal explanation-based teaching strategy. We further instantiate NOTES with a specific hypothesis class, which can be viewed as an interpretable approximation of any hypothesis class, allowing us to handle complex hypothesis in practice. We demonstrate the effectiveness of NOTES on several image classification tasks, for both simulated and real human learners. Our experimental results suggest that by leveraging explanations, one can significantly speed up teaching",

While our algorithm requires further optimization to handle larger datasets, we are able to evaluate our algorithm using several synthetic datasets. We show that on HQMM generated data, our algorithm learns HQMMs with the same number of hidden states and predictive accuracy as the true HQMMs, while HMMs learned with the Baum-Welch algorithm require more states to match the predictive accuracy",

Although tractable, the algorithm is typically too slow for sufficiently large problems in practice. Inspired by recent advances in non-convex approaches to low-rank recovery problems, we propose an algorithm based on projected gradient descent that enjoys similar provable guarantees as the convex counterpart, but can be orders of magnitude faster.

In this work, we present an analysis hinting that high similarity between concurrently processed gradients may be a cause of this performance degradation. We introduce the notion of gradient diversity that measures the dissimilarity between concurrent gradient updates, and show its key role in the performance of mini-batch SGD. We prove that on problems with high gradient diversity, mini-batch SGD is amenable to better speedups, while maintaining the generalization performance of serial (one sample) SGD. We further establish lower bounds on convergence where mini-batch SGD slows down beyond a particular batch-size, solely due to the lack of gradient diversity. We provide experimental evidence indicating the key role of gradient diversity in distributed learning, and discuss how heuristics like dropout, Langevin dynamics, and quantization can improve it",

    "abstract": "In the most popular distribution testing and parameter estimation model, one can obtain information about an underlying distribution D via independent samples from D. We introduce a model in which every sample comes with the information about the probability of selecting it. In this setting, we give algorithms for problems such as testing if two distributions are (approximately) identical, estimating the total variation distance between distributions, and estimating the support size. The sample complexity of all of our algorithms is optimal up to a constant factor for sufficiently large support size. The running times of our algorithms are near-linear in the number of samples collected. Additionally, our algorithms are robust to small multiplicative errors in probability estimates. The complexity of our model lies strictly between the complexity of the model where only independent samples are provided and the complexity of the model where additionally arbitrary probability queries are allowed. Our model finds applications where once a given element is sampled, it is easier to estimate its probability. We describe two scenarios in which all occurrences of each element are easy to explore once at least one copy of the element is detected",

Most of them rely on a preselected kernel, whose prudent choice presumes task-specific prior information. To cope with this limitation, multi-kernel learning has gained popularity thanks to its flexibility in choosing kernels from a prescribed kernel dictionary. Leveraging the random feature approximation and its recent orthogonality-promoting variant, the present contribution develops an online multi-kernel learning scheme to infer the intended nonlinear function `on the fly.' To further boost performance in non-stationary environments, an adaptive multi-kernel learning scheme (termed AdaRaker) is developed with affordable computation and memory complexity. Performance is analyzed in terms of both static and dynamic regret. To our best knowledge, AdaRaker is the first algorithm that can optimally track nonlinear functions in non-stationary settings with theoretical guarantees.

    "abstract": "Sparse model selection is ubiquitous from linear regression to graphical models where regularization paths, as a family of estimators upon the regularization parameter varying, are computed when the regularization parameter is unknown or decided data-adaptively. Traditional computational methods rely on solving a set of optimization problems where the regularization parameters are fixed on a grid that might be inefficient. In this paper, we introduce a simple iterative regularization path, which follows the dynamics of a sparse Mirror Descent algorithm or a generalization of Linearized Bregman Iterations with nonlinear loss. Its performance is competitive to \\texttt{glmnet} with a further bias reduction. A path consistency theory is presented that under the Restricted Strong Convexity (RSC) and the Irrepresentable Condition (IRR), the path will first evolve in a subspace with no false positives and reach an estimator that is sign-consistent or of minimax optimal $\\ell_2$ error rate. Early stopping regularization is required to prevent overfitting. Application examples are given in sparse logistic regression and Ising models for NIPS coauthorship",

We show that EM can get stuck in regions of slow convergence, even when the features are binary and i.i.d. conditioning on the class label, and even under random (i.e. non worst-case) initialization. In turn, we show that EM can be bootstrapped in a pre-training step that computes a good initialization. From this initialization we show theoretically and experimentally that EM converges exponentially fast to the true model parameters. Our bootstrapping method amounts to running the EM algorithm on appropriately centered iterates of small magnitude, which as we show corresponds to effectively performing power iteration on the covariance matrix of the mixture model, although power iteration is performed under the hood by EM itself. As such, we call our bootstrapping approach \"power EM.\" Specifically for the case of two binary features, we show global exponentially fast convergence of EM, even without bootstrapping. Finally, as the Naive Bayes model is quite expressive, we show as corollaries of our convergence results that the EM algorithm globally converges to the true model parameters for mixtures of two Gaussians, recovering recent results of [XHM16, DTZ17]",
